    <ol>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found the best technique with this stuff is to apply it to where needed with a q-tip and then put the retainer in to hold it there while I take a shower.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s good for people who want to lift 1-3 shades lighter and then keep it that way over time.</li>
            <li>Been using it for a good six years.</li>
            <li>Good luck locating an expiration date, though....</li>
            <li>The good reviews must be paid for.</li>
            <li>and he said it is good.</li>

            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Good product, incredible price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>easy painless, and works great to remove tartar.</li>
            <li>I got a kit from the dentist for $50 and its amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice product and will purchase again.</li>
            <li>kind of makes my jaw hurt.</li>
            <li>This is a good buy, it is great for anyone who has sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>Should be more U-shaped.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used many whiteners over time, including mouthwashes, toothpastes, strips, etc.</li>
            <li>price is great for what you get, though I will say if you have medium to very yellowing teeth</li>
            <li>exxellent delivered just before Christmas :)</li>
            <li>Arrived on time .... worked for me. :)</li>
            <li>You would think you&#x27;d get what you pay for but in this instance, I&#x27;d say you get more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this 3 times now and for about 10 min each time (directions say to use longer for more stained teeth) and I don&#x27;t even think there is any difference.</li>
            <li>LOVE the product</li>
            <li>You would never be able to put this liquid on the tray as directed.</li>
            <li>She love it.</li>
            <li>Do not use consecutively for more than 14 days.</li>
            <li>Overall, great for the price!</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This works so much better.  </li>
            <li>Works well but better tray is needed.</li>
            <li>I bought dental trays that work much better.</li>
            <li>I bought this thing in 2007 to &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; my teeth, I used many days, and it destroyed my gums.</li>
            <li>satisfied.</li>
            <li>So, in that respect, this stuff is top notch.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>I suspect that some teeth are more susceptible to whitening than others.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to order some 35% gel and see if the results are more acceptable.</li>
            <li>but i was able to tolerate the pain for the five minute.</li>
            <li>It arrived on time, but the tube had a hole at the top</li>
            <li>I love this product...</li>
            <li>So be sure to have some paper towels nearby to catch it.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good when u leave it for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>My teeth are so bright thanks to this product.</li>
            <li>Make sure your mouthpiece fit well.</li>
            <li>but my teeth did not turn a brilliant white like a dental treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The mouth rinse is refreshing and light.</li>
            <li>If you want a teeth whitening system that is inexpensive, painless, easy and delivers what it promises</li>
            <li>easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>The instructions are easy to follow</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve honestly had the best luck with the little strips that you lay over your teeth and let sit for a while - and then do that for 7 days straight or so.</li>
            <li>mouthpiece didn&#x27;t fit me well</li>
            <li>But its cheap so maybe that&#x27;s what you get?</li>
            <li>Important to follow the directions.</li>
            <li>Also the gel is gummy and fills your entire mouth when use as directed, it also doesn&#x27;t taste great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a study where they picked a product using light therapy.</li>
            <li>The mouth tray is comfortable and fits well in my mouth.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great and makes my teeth super white!</li>
            <li>Worth it!</li>
            <li>This product is powerful!</li>
            <li>Because of the first use results, I did not need to use the product more than three five minute sessions per week.</li>
            <li>The other items in the kit are good but the gel is the most important item to the kit.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best tooth whitener I&#x27;ve used, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>easy to use and quick-I noticied improvement right away</li>
            <li>so i scaled back my use and do a bare minimum maintenance treatment and it works perfectly now-</li>
            <li>I made him stop using it after two weeks for fear that his teeth would start glowing in the dark--they seemed so bright white!</li>
            <li>i brought it to my dentist years ago to make sure it was safe and was given the go ahead- same formula they use</li>
            <li>Did not whiten my teeth especially just like the box said, but I didn&#x27;t notice exceptional change.</li>
            <li>Be aware!</li>
            <li>This is a great system and costs far less than most.  </li>
            <li>And it is so nice that it is not for hours but only minutes.</li>
            <li>This is the best kept teeth whitening secret.</li>
            <li>but, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s because the product is now old.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many supermarket teeth whitening products over the years and also paid a lot of money and had the professional Zoom teeth whitening procedure.</li>
            <li>The price was right and the tray is very well-made and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using as directed for a week and really haven&#x27;t noticed a significant change.</li>
            <li>Very good product, works well for a short period but that comes as expected</li>
            <li>i bought this with high expectations i was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Invest a few more dollars for a better product.</li>
            <li>Saliva builds up super fast.</li>
            <li>This kit does take some time to use, which may not be easy in the course of a busy day.</li>
            <li>This works pretty well.</li>
            <li>It does exactly as promised.  </li>
            <li>To start, I whitened for top teeth only first to learn how to adjust to the mouth piece and gel process.</li>
            <li>Baking soda does a better job and is easier and not as gross.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!  </li>
            <li>as i pulled it out of the envelope i saw that the top of the box was open and the bottom of the box was all ripped apart</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>I love red wine, coffee and tea.  </li>
            <li>Since it was not expensive, I guess I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li>First of all I found a study online which uses this product and specifies it&#x27;s 35% hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li>After my first use, I noticed immediate results.</li>
            <li>Overall, I like this way more than whitening strips or whitening pens.</li>
            <li>Really works these two products worth the buy</li>
            <li>The mouth guard fits great, just bite down a little bit and the bleaching process works better.</li>
            <li>though there&#x27;s is stronger and costs a lot more of course!- just put it on everyday for 2 weeks</li>
            <li>I have not completed the two week time period yet, but Ive only used it for a week and some of the most embarrassing stains that I use to have are almost completely gone!</li>
            <li>this technique will probably not work for you as you&#x27;ll need something much stronger.</li>
            <li>You can even leave it on for a longer period of time for those that have very stained teeth.</li>
            <li>This whitener really works.  </li>
            <li>This system works very well for my wife.</li>
            <li>It removes  stains from your teeth very well</li>
            <li>But I was hoping to notice a change but didn&#x27;t see much if any of a change on my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!  </li>
            <li>I really need a lawyer,</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much except irritate the gums</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, you cannot really complain about the price though its really cheap, but doesn&#x27;t work as expected, I do see some white marks on my teeth, but it&#x27;s not evenly distributed,</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t swallow any and don&#x27;t get too much on the gums and mouth.</li>
            <li>the 5-10 minutes go by fast.</li>
            <li>(Would be nice to have one of those little mini sucking devices from the denist!</li>
            <li>Easy to use, though the mouth tray is a bit narrow in the front, so I felt it did not reach the upper part of my top teeth particularly well.</li>
            <li>Overall, not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>i have been using this product for nearly 20 years now (the original formula and now the new improved formula) and this stuff is the only system that works for consistent</li>
            <li>I bought this system to see if I could expedite the whitening process, since the over-the-counter gel I normally use with my toothpaste isn&#x27;t quite so spectacular and offers slight whitening.</li>
            <li>In addition, the instructions are simple and it REALLY works the first time!</li>
            <li>After 3 weeks I concluded that the results were modest, at best, and disappointing.  </li>
            <li>This works decently well.</li>
            <li>The only downside of this product is by the time you&#x27;re almost ready to take it out, you&#x27;ve started to build up a saliva in your mouth, and since you can&#x27;t swallow it, you pretty much start drooling, a lot.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s high quality</li>
            <li>You can do this several times and have a super white smile.</li>
            <li>I recommend putting the gel onto teeth using a Q-tip then putting a little more into mouth piece before placing into mouth.</li>
            <li>In addition, it requires a few more steps then some done.</li>
            <li>(well that is for normal cases of yellowish teeth)-</li>
            <li>Product arrived and looked normal</li>
            <li>i have absolutely nothing to gain by sharing with everyone how great this product has been for me starting when i was a poor university student and could never have afforded professional teeth whitening, this product was a godsend-  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s soooooooooo cheap compared to other products that leave me in pain.</li>
            <li>If they send me a new non-defective gel pack I will update my review.</li>
            <li>I left Plus White on for 20 minutes without pain which was fantastic as I normally use a sensitive toothpaste and was a bit worried that is would hurt.  </li>
            <li>I follow the directions exactly, put it in before I hop in the shower, and rinse out the tray last thing before I get out.</li>
            <li>You definitely have to be consistent</li>
            <li>I have to spit half way through just to avoid choking, This is too cheap to work.</li>
            <li>The price is right, but it&#x27;s pretty messy.  </li>
            <li>The mouth piece is a bit large for smaller mouths, so I use a q-tip to paint the gel on.</li>
            <li>The gel is so runny that it&#x27;s hard to get it to stay in the bottom part of the tray while you&#x27;re putting it in the top part.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are not abnormally sensitive to begin.</li>
            <li>This product did not cause any gum or tooth sensitivity for me thus far</li>
            <li>this product does not work, do not waste your money</li>
            <li>She has sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>The old lady was borderline hideous before she found this stuff.</li>
            <li>it won&#x27;t look as natural-</li>
            <li>/&gt;This doesn&#x27;t work as well as a professional bleaching by a dentist</li>
            <li>I got an old version of this product</li>
            <li>This product detroys your enamel and leaves your teeth extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li>But, I just think my teeth need professional whitening.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions as much as possible and still ended up with very damaged gums.</li>
            <li>I was happily surprised when I found it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend it anyone that wants an inexpensive way to whiten their teeth.</li>
            <li>Maybe the concentration of the peroxide isn&#x27;t high enough, I don&#x27;t know.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly suggest checking your local CVS or Wal-Mart, or another seller here on amazon  before purchasing from this one.</li>
            <li>As expected and fast delivery!</li>
            <li>The mouth guard is a bit bulky and less is more with the gel but other than that, I&#x27;ll keep getting it.</li>
            <li>THis is a hot mess and It tastes gross and It really does not work</li>
            <li>However, I am a huge coffee, tea and wine drinker and a former heavy soda drinker.</li>
            <li>its well worth the mess to save.</li>
            <li>for example there are 2 strips of white marks in my 2 middle top teeth, and one one giant white spot mark on my upper left side teeth, I have now bought Crest white strips luxe edition to try.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t taste strongly at all, and does not cause sensitivity to my teeth, plus it works as well, if not better than white strips.</li>
            <li>So I wanted to try something that was more cost effective and less painful</li>
            <li>After years of coffee smoking, I still don&#x27;t see the yellow tint he is so self conscious about but thought I would try to get him a bit of an ego boost.</li>
            <li>and I could barely eat or drink anything.</li>
            <li>This works .. even on my old yellow teeth - ..</li>
            <li>I have about three days left before I complete the two-week process.</li>
            <li>Makes your teeth white without making them sensitive</li>
            <li>The secret to this stuff is to make sure all teeth are covered</li>
            <li>- if you use it beyond the 2 weeks everyday when your teeth are already super white, and keep doing that for months let&#x27;s say, you will start to get almost translucent teeth-</li>
            <li>I do know that after a few days my teeth do look somewhat improved right after going through the process.</li>
            <li>it must have happened pre-shipping because the thick yellow bubble-wrap envelope was totally fine and undamaged.  </li>
            <li>I have to say I&#x27;m surprised how well this five dollar system works, especially after spending I-don&#x27;t-want-to-think-how-much on crest white strips.</li>
            <li>but unlike the Crest white strips this whitener has not yet left my gums burning or my teeth sensitive.</li>
            <li>It was not the improved formula is was the old one I would know because I&#x27;ve been buying it that long</li>
            <li>I could see a slight difference after the first 2 applications, but was not able to see much improvement after that.</li>
            <li>I do not smoke or drink coffee, but would like my teeth to be a little whiter, and this did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>My research revealed that the normal version of the Plus White gel contains only 6% peroxide, as compared to the 20% - 35% concentrations used in some other products.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used this 3 times now and for about 10 min each time (directions say to use longer for more stained teeth) and I don&#x27;t even think there is any difference.</li>
            <li> LOVE the product</li>
            <li> You would never be able to put this liquid on the tray as directed.</li>
            <li> She love it.</li>
            <li> Do not use consecutively for more than 14 days.</li>
            <li> Overall, great for the price!</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> This works so much better.  </li>
            <li> Works well but better tray is needed.</li>
            <li> I bought dental trays that work much better.</li>
            <li> I bought this thing in 2007 to &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; my teeth, I used many days, and it destroyed my gums.</li>
            <li> satisfied.</li>
            <li> So, in that respect, this stuff is top notch.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> I suspect that some teeth are more susceptible to whitening than others.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to order some 35% gel and see if the results are more acceptable.</li>
            <li> but i was able to tolerate the pain for the five minute.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time, but the tube had a hole at the top</li>
            <li> I love this product...</li>
            <li> So be sure to have some paper towels nearby to catch it.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good when u leave it for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> My teeth are so bright thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> Make sure your mouthpiece fit well.</li>
            <li> but my teeth did not turn a brilliant white like a dental treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The mouth rinse is refreshing and light.</li>
            <li> If you want a teeth whitening system that is inexpensive, painless, easy and delivers what it promises</li>
            <li> easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> The instructions are easy to follow</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve honestly had the best luck with the little strips that you lay over your teeth and let sit for a while - and then do that for 7 days straight or so.</li>
            <li> mouthpiece didn&#x27;t fit me well</li>
            <li> But its cheap so maybe that&#x27;s what you get?</li>
            <li> Important to follow the directions.</li>
            <li> Also the gel is gummy and fills your entire mouth when use as directed, it also doesn&#x27;t taste great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a study where they picked a product using light therapy.</li>
            <li> The mouth tray is comfortable and fits well in my mouth.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great and makes my teeth super white!</li>
            <li> Worth it!</li>
            <li> This product is powerful!</li>
            <li> Because of the first use results, I did not need to use the product more than three five minute sessions per week.</li>
            <li> The other items in the kit are good but the gel is the most important item to the kit.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best tooth whitener I&#x27;ve used, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> easy to use and quick-I noticied improvement right away</li>
            <li> so i scaled back my use and do a bare minimum maintenance treatment and it works perfectly now-</li>
            <li> I made him stop using it after two weeks for fear that his teeth would start glowing in the dark--they seemed so bright white!</li>
            <li> i brought it to my dentist years ago to make sure it was safe and was given the go ahead- same formula they use</li>
            <li> Did not whiten my teeth especially just like the box said, but I didn&#x27;t notice exceptional change.</li>
            <li> Be aware!</li>
            <li> This is a great system and costs far less than most.  </li>
            <li> And it is so nice that it is not for hours but only minutes.</li>
            <li> This is the best kept teeth whitening secret.</li>
            <li> but, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s because the product is now old.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many supermarket teeth whitening products over the years and also paid a lot of money and had the professional Zoom teeth whitening procedure.</li>
            <li> The price was right and the tray is very well-made and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using as directed for a week and really haven&#x27;t noticed a significant change.</li>
            <li> Very good product, works well for a short period but that comes as expected</li>
            <li> i bought this with high expectations i was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Invest a few more dollars for a better product.</li>
            <li> Saliva builds up super fast.</li>
            <li> This kit does take some time to use, which may not be easy in the course of a busy day.</li>
            <li> This works pretty well.</li>
            <li> It does exactly as promised.  </li>
            <li> To start, I whitened for top teeth only first to learn how to adjust to the mouth piece and gel process.</li>
            <li> Baking soda does a better job and is easier and not as gross.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!  </li>
            <li> as i pulled it out of the envelope i saw that the top of the box was open and the bottom of the box was all ripped apart</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> I love red wine, coffee and tea.  </li>
            <li> Since it was not expensive, I guess I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> First of all I found a study online which uses this product and specifies it&#x27;s 35% hydrogen peroxide.</li>
            <li> After my first use, I noticed immediate results.</li>
            <li> Overall, I like this way more than whitening strips or whitening pens.</li>
            <li> Really works these two products worth the buy</li>
            <li> The mouth guard fits great, just bite down a little bit and the bleaching process works better.</li>
            <li> though there&#x27;s is stronger and costs a lot more of course!- just put it on everyday for 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I have not completed the two week time period yet, but Ive only used it for a week and some of the most embarrassing stains that I use to have are almost completely gone!</li>
            <li> this technique will probably not work for you as you&#x27;ll need something much stronger.</li>
            <li> You can even leave it on for a longer period of time for those that have very stained teeth.</li>
            <li> This whitener really works.  </li>
            <li> This system works very well for my wife.</li>
            <li> It removes  stains from your teeth very well</li>
            <li> But I was hoping to notice a change but didn&#x27;t see much if any of a change on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!  </li>
            <li> I really need a lawyer,</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much except irritate the gums</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, you cannot really complain about the price though its really cheap, but doesn&#x27;t work as expected, I do see some white marks on my teeth, but it&#x27;s not evenly distributed,</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t swallow any and don&#x27;t get too much on the gums and mouth.</li>
            <li> the 5-10 minutes go by fast.</li>
            <li> (Would be nice to have one of those little mini sucking devices from the denist!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, though the mouth tray is a bit narrow in the front, so I felt it did not reach the upper part of my top teeth particularly well.</li>
            <li> Overall, not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> i have been using this product for nearly 20 years now (the original formula and now the new improved formula) and this stuff is the only system that works for consistent</li>
            <li> I bought this system to see if I could expedite the whitening process, since the over-the-counter gel I normally use with my toothpaste isn&#x27;t quite so spectacular and offers slight whitening.</li>
            <li> In addition, the instructions are simple and it REALLY works the first time!</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks I concluded that the results were modest, at best, and disappointing.  </li>
            <li> This works decently well.</li>
            <li> The only downside of this product is by the time you&#x27;re almost ready to take it out, you&#x27;ve started to build up a saliva in your mouth, and since you can&#x27;t swallow it, you pretty much start drooling, a lot.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s high quality</li>
            <li> You can do this several times and have a super white smile.</li>
            <li> I recommend putting the gel onto teeth using a Q-tip then putting a little more into mouth piece before placing into mouth.</li>
            <li> In addition, it requires a few more steps then some done.</li>
            <li> (well that is for normal cases of yellowish teeth)-</li>
            <li> Product arrived and looked normal</li>
            <li> i have absolutely nothing to gain by sharing with everyone how great this product has been for me starting when i was a poor university student and could never have afforded professional teeth whitening, this product was a godsend-  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s soooooooooo cheap compared to other products that leave me in pain.</li>
            <li> If they send me a new non-defective gel pack I will update my review.</li>
            <li> I left Plus White on for 20 minutes without pain which was fantastic as I normally use a sensitive toothpaste and was a bit worried that is would hurt.  </li>
            <li> I follow the directions exactly, put it in before I hop in the shower, and rinse out the tray last thing before I get out.</li>
            <li> You definitely have to be consistent</li>
            <li> I have to spit half way through just to avoid choking, This is too cheap to work.</li>
            <li> The price is right, but it&#x27;s pretty messy.  </li>
            <li> The mouth piece is a bit large for smaller mouths, so I use a q-tip to paint the gel on.</li>
            <li> The gel is so runny that it&#x27;s hard to get it to stay in the bottom part of the tray while you&#x27;re putting it in the top part.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are not abnormally sensitive to begin.</li>
            <li> This product did not cause any gum or tooth sensitivity for me thus far</li>
            <li> this product does not work, do not waste your money</li>
            <li> She has sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> The old lady was borderline hideous before she found this stuff.</li>
            <li> it won&#x27;t look as natural-</li>
            <li> /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t work as well as a professional bleaching by a dentist</li>
            <li> I got an old version of this product</li>
            <li> This product detroys your enamel and leaves your teeth extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li> But, I just think my teeth need professional whitening.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions as much as possible and still ended up with very damaged gums.</li>
            <li> I was happily surprised when I found it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend it anyone that wants an inexpensive way to whiten their teeth.</li>
            <li> Maybe the concentration of the peroxide isn&#x27;t high enough, I don&#x27;t know.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly suggest checking your local CVS or Wal-Mart, or another seller here on amazon  before purchasing from this one.</li>
            <li> As expected and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> The mouth guard is a bit bulky and less is more with the gel but other than that, I&#x27;ll keep getting it.</li>
            <li> THis is a hot mess and It tastes gross and It really does not work</li>
            <li> However, I am a huge coffee, tea and wine drinker and a former heavy soda drinker.</li>
            <li> its well worth the mess to save.</li>
            <li> for example there are 2 strips of white marks in my 2 middle top teeth, and one one giant white spot mark on my upper left side teeth, I have now bought Crest white strips luxe edition to try.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t taste strongly at all, and does not cause sensitivity to my teeth, plus it works as well, if not better than white strips.</li>
            <li> So I wanted to try something that was more cost effective and less painful</li>
            <li> After years of coffee smoking, I still don&#x27;t see the yellow tint he is so self conscious about but thought I would try to get him a bit of an ego boost.</li>
            <li> and I could barely eat or drink anything.</li>
            <li> This works .. even on my old yellow teeth - ..</li>
            <li> I have about three days left before I complete the two-week process.</li>
            <li> Makes your teeth white without making them sensitive</li>
            <li> The secret to this stuff is to make sure all teeth are covered</li>
            <li> - if you use it beyond the 2 weeks everyday when your teeth are already super white, and keep doing that for months let&#x27;s say, you will start to get almost translucent teeth-</li>
            <li> I do know that after a few days my teeth do look somewhat improved right after going through the process.</li>
            <li> it must have happened pre-shipping because the thick yellow bubble-wrap envelope was totally fine and undamaged.  </li>
            <li> I have to say I&#x27;m surprised how well this five dollar system works, especially after spending I-don&#x27;t-want-to-think-how-much on crest white strips.</li>
            <li> but unlike the Crest white strips this whitener has not yet left my gums burning or my teeth sensitive.</li>
            <li> It was not the improved formula is was the old one I would know because I&#x27;ve been buying it that long</li>
            <li> I could see a slight difference after the first 2 applications, but was not able to see much improvement after that.</li>
            <li> I do not smoke or drink coffee, but would like my teeth to be a little whiter, and this did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> My research revealed that the normal version of the Plus White gel contains only 6% peroxide, as compared to the 20% - 35% concentrations used in some other products.</li>
            <li> My teeth don&#x27;t even feel sensitive like with other products *coughcrestwhitestripscough</li>
            <li> but if your teeth are naturally yellow,  it will not completely whiten them.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to note a difference in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it does make me teeth just a little bit sensitive, but it&#x27;s not unmanageable.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to tell people what I use because I&#x27;m afraid I will not be able to find the stuff on the shelves of my local drugstore.</li>
            <li> at first I thought I imagined it because how the heck could this literally five dollar kit from Walmart possibly make a difference, especially after the whitestrips fail, and especially with the amount of tea I drink on a daily basis...</li>
            <li> DONT PAY ATTENTION TO THE LONG 5 STAR REVIEWS THAT MADE UP.</li>
            <li> Minor gum burns.</li>
            <li> The only thing is, be careful of an expiration date.  </li>
            <li> As long as you distract yourself (tv works well)</li>
            <li> The tube was shipped opened, and I only had half of the product left once I received it!</li>
            <li> This is not easy and your mouth will become sensitive.  </li>
            <li> All other whitening products I have used (except target white strips which are not sold anymore!)</li>
            <li> Other than that the results last for about three months.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t stick to it very long</li>
            <li> It is also hard shape the tray so it does not fit right.</li>
            <li> Considering what I received so far I have overpaid for a small mouthpiece.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent in a long time.</li>
            <li> Gets rid of surface stains, but definitely not deep down.</li>
            <li> I like the smaller package since it now takes up less room in my overly cluttered bathroom.</li>
            <li> After about a week and a half my teeth are almost completely white!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t looking for snow white teeth just a few shades improvement over my coffee stained grill.</li>
            <li> You need to be careful with this.</li>
            <li> within only a week of use even I, who looks at that mug everyday, could tell that it was working.</li>
            <li> and this does not hurt her teeth as other products have.</li>
            <li> Wipe off excess gel from your gums or any other area other than your teeth.</li>
            <li> But then other people stared noticing after about a week, and now I&#x27;m convinced.</li>
            <li> does not harm my teeth or gums like some other products.</li>
            <li> I have used Crest White strips in the past followed by extreme tooth sensitivity like someone was drilling a hole through by teeth.</li>
            <li> The gel is congealed yet, it won&#x27;t stick in the tray when  you turn it over to fill the other side, like it used to.   </li>
            <li> n leave it in about an hour every other day.</li>
            <li> Wear custom trays and use it for like an hour every other day for two weeks u will be amazed.</li>
            <li> the person who said all the positive reviews are a scam, is totally wrong-</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s a little curious why they don&#x27;t give you the percentage of the whitening agent (active ingredient).  </li>
            <li> NOT WORTH IT</li>
            <li> not sensitive, thats why I could use it for a few days, the only thing I did notice was white spots in my gums, but I thought they would be removed with saliva and brushing, but I was badly wrong.</li>
            <li> I used the regular version of this product twice a day and for at least 20 minutes per session.  </li>
            <li> And of course since I didn&#x27;t open the product immediately it&#x27;s now too late to return.</li>
            <li> Used it everyday for about a week and then switched to every other day..</li>
            <li> The peroxide can be a bit harsh on the inside of your mouth as it touches parts other than your teeth</li>
            <li> The final result from Plus White was exactly the same as the Zoom whitening but by far less expensive and less painful!!  </li>
            <li> I did see a slightly whiter color when I used it three times a day for about twenty minutes a piece, and no tooth pain.</li>
            <li> 1 week later my teeth are extremely sensitive to cold and heat</li>
            <li> I believe this would work well for people who have slight staining and need a refresher.</li>
            <li> Burns slightly.</li>
            <li> I purchased my kit at my local Wal-Mart for around 10 dollars, so the price here is ridiculous, but this product works</li>
            <li> and I did notice subtle results after only one use.</li>
            <li> What a mess.</li>
            <li> I bought this at a local Kroger&#x27;s, a few years ago, and was unable to find it locally.  </li>
            <li> I see a little change there already.</li>
            <li> You just need a little bit of gel on you mouthpiece.</li>
            <li> when this came i opened it and was a little nervous.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little hard to keep the gel in your mouth in my opinion- a lot of spit accumulation was expected</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it just once a day for a few days and already see an improvement.</li>
            <li> Waste of time.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be set for a few months</li>
            <li> It caused sores on my gums as it was to harsh.</li>
            <li> A bit messy to use but for the price (a fraction of crest strips)</li>
            <li> I noticed results in a few days.</li>
            <li> One day I just woke up and realized how heavily stained my teeth are.</li>
            <li> This product is messy and the gel comes out like a waterfall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using it a few days ago</li>
            <li> I even tried refrigerating it to firm up the consistency but no use.</li>
            <li> The gel itself has an uneven consistency</li>
            <li> A bit messy.</li>
            <li> It is a mess!</li>
            <li> Too much trouble for very little effect.  </li>
            <li> but I have to say this item whitens just as well if not better.</li>
            <li> I was  never able to even try the product.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but they actually work.</li>
            <li> They looked all red and weird.</li>
            <li> It is very messy and leaves my mouth tasting of peroxide.  </li>
            <li> The mouth pieces are too V-shaped and therefore hard to keep on teeth; had to bite down hard to keep them in!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s hard to apply it evenly in the tray.  </li>

            <li> this stuff seriously works!</li>
            <li> The mouth pieces are too V-shaped and therefore hard to keep on teeth; had to bite down hard to keep them in! Should be more U-shaped.</li>
            <li> This works pretty well. It says to use it twice a day for 14 days. I&#x27;ve used it just once a day for a few days and already see an improvement. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it does make me teeth just a little bit sensitive, but it&#x27;s not unmanageable. Would definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I saw this recommended online as a sort of \\&quot;maintenance whitener\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used many whiteners over time, including mouthwashes, toothpastes, strips, etc. I&#x27;ve honestly had the best luck with the little strips that you lay over your teeth and let sit for a while - and then do that for 7 days straight or so. (The drawbacks to that method are cost and tooth sensitivity.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because I wanted to whiten my teeth a bit before my sister&#x27;s wedding. Nothing quite as unappealing as a bridesmaid with...interesting teeth. I&#x27;ve found the best technique with this stuff is to apply it to where needed with a q-tip and then put the retainer in to hold it there while I take a shower. Then when I&#x27;m done showering? I simply remove the mouth piece and rinse it out before I get out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is great for what you get, though I will say if you have medium to very yellowing teeth this technique will probably not work for you as you&#x27;ll need something much stronger. It&#x27;s good for people who want to lift 1-3 shades lighter and then keep it that way over time.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all. Teeth are still yellow. Why did I waste money on this worthless piece of big crap</li>
            <li> exxellent delivered just before Christmas :)</li>
            <li> DONT PAY ATTENTION TO THE LONG 5 STAR REVIEWS THAT MADE UP. You click on the names and see that they rate a bunch of the same products and they&#x27;re obviously getting paid. I&#x27;ve been using as directed for a week and really haven&#x27;t noticed a significant change. Don&#x27;t waste your money you WILL be disappointed</li>
            <li> Arrived on time .... worked for me. :)</li>
            <li> There was no difference out after a week. Waste of time.</li>
            <li> Product is really too messy to keep in your mouth for any amount of time. I got a kit from the dentist for $50 and its amazing. Invest a few more dollars for a better product.</li>
            <li> This is a great system and costs far less than most.  It does exactly as promised.  You can even leave it on for a longer period of time for those that have very stained teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years. It is the best tooth whitening system I have found. Ive tried all of the expensive brands. Everyone is always asking me &amp;#34;how do I get my teeth so white?&amp;#34; Even my dentist has remarked how amazingly white my teeth are. I don&#x27;t like to tell people what I use because I&#x27;m afraid I will not be able to find the stuff on the shelves of my local drugstore. This beats $80 tooth whitening brands.</li>
            <li> This whitener really works.  I can see the results on my upper teeth after only a week. I see a little change there already. And it is so nice that it is not for hours but only minutes.</li>
            <li> I have used crest white strips, walmart brand white strips and target brand white strips (I miss those!) but I have to say this item whitens just as well if not better. It&#x27;s a little hard to keep the gel in your mouth in my opinion- a lot of spit accumulation was expected but it took some adjusting for me to learn how to learn to deal with it. I recommend putting the gel onto teeth using a Q-tip then putting a little more into mouth piece before placing into mouth. To start, I whitened for top teeth only first to learn how to adjust to the mouth piece and gel process. (Would be nice to have one of those little mini sucking devices from the denist! Lol) Already I see a difference after three days of use, just 10-15 minutes per day. I use with whitening toothpaste. I also would like to add that this product does not cause sensitivity! All other whitening products I have used (except target white strips which are not sold anymore!) have caused sensitivity to my gums. My teeth are not abnormally sensitive to begin. This product did not cause any gum or tooth sensitivity for me thus far and I am very pleased!</li>
            <li> You would think you&#x27;d get what you pay for but in this instance, I&#x27;d say you get more. I wasn&#x27;t looking for snow white teeth just a few shades improvement over my coffee stained grill. It did that and it happened in only a week @ 10 minutes per day 1x. Directions call for 2x per day for 2 weeks but I found it unnecessary. I followed the tip of using a Q-tip to spread the solution around evenly in the tray and I had no gum irritation at all. Nice product and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> this product does not work, do not waste your money</li>
            <li> I have seen such a big difference in a short time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this 3 times now and for about 10 min each time (directions say to use longer for more stained teeth) and I don&#x27;t even think there is any difference. Baking soda does a better job and is easier and not as gross.</li>
            <li> I was expecting something different. It is extremely uncomfortable. Would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> LOVE the product but when i received the package the tube had exploded in the box and the gel was EVERYWHERE. Not very happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week, so far, and have seen some improvement; not as much as I expected, but my teeth are whiter.</li>
            <li> I was  never able to even try the product. The &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; was all liquid and spilled all over. You would never be able to put this liquid on the tray as directed. I don&#x27;t know if I just got a bad one but I will not be buying another to find out.  What a mess.</li>
            <li> I heard about this stuff while watching youtube videos. I tried it and it works great! The makeup artist who recommend this adviced to get mouth guards let them sit in boiling water for a minute. Then you can mold it to your teeth. Buy two. You can buy them at Wal-Mart for a dollar each. I haven&#x27;t used it in a while. But Im sure I&#x27;ll get great results again. I use it for 20 minutes. It starts working after a week! I gave it four stars because it gave me sensitivity on one of my teeth. Other than that the results last for about three months.</li>
            <li> This system works very well for my wife. She has sensitive teeth and this does not hurt her teeth as other products have. There is a noticeable difference after just two applications. She loves it!</li>
            <li> Gets rid of surface stains, but definitely not deep down. Used it everyday for about a week and then switched to every other day.. still not a big difference. The tray is uncomfortable because I can&#x27;t relax my mouth if I want it closed all the way. If I relax my mouth saliva and gel start to ooze on my lips. Saliva builds up super fast. I have to spit half way through just to avoid choking, This is too cheap to work.</li>
            <li> The old lady was borderline hideous before she found this stuff. Now when she smiles I can see myself in her teeth which is awesome.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great and makes my teeth super white! I get compliments all the time. Been using it for a good six years. A handful of times a month and you&#x27;ll be set for a few months</li>
            <li> As expected and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked this had gotten good reviews. It&#x27;s messy, uncomfortable, and the gel doesn&#x27;t even cover the teeth. I was gagging. And the rinse you need to use beforehand burned the back of my throat (yes, I did dilute it!). Skip this product. Now I&#x27;m off to the store to get crest white strips. Expensive, but they actually work.</li>
            <li> I was watching one of my favourite youtubers talking about this product. She love it. Her name is Kandee Johnson watch her. Step 1 -  brush and floss your teeth. I apply the gel with my finger so I can get it between my teeth but you can also use a Q-tip. Make sure your mouthpiece fit well. You just need a little bit of gel on you mouthpiece. Wipe off excess gel from your gums or any other area other than your teeth. Leave in for 5 minutes for regular whitening. For badly stained or yellow teeth, allow 15-20 minutes. Do not use consecutively for more than 14 days. For  the mouth wash I use one teaspoon of the Rinse and two teaspoon of water. Swish in mouth for 2-3 seconds and rinse out. Using your  toothbrush, brush your teeth without toothpaste and rinse mouth with water. I recommend this product and the seller. I buy mouthpieces from Amazon  I didn&#x27;t use the one that came with the kit. All the instructions are on the back of the package.</li>
            <li> The gel was a clumpy gelatin like substance  it makes the use of it almost impossible due to the fact that it is not evenly distributed. The other items in the kit are good but the gel is the most important item to the kit.</li>
            <li> You need to be careful with this. It caused sores on my gums as it was to harsh. In addition, it requires a few more steps then some done. It is also hard shape the tray so it does not fit right.</li>
            <li> This works decently well. I drink energy drinks and coffee all the time. I DO brush my teeth twice a day and floss but I still don&#x27;t have white teeth. This product helps get rid of the worst of the yellow staining.</li>
            <li> i have been using this product for nearly 20 years now (the original formula and now the new improved formula) and this stuff is the only system that works for consistent all over white- i have received i&#x27;d say at least 50 + compliments on my white teeth in those years from strangers to acquaintances and friends- i brought it to my dentist years ago to make sure it was safe and was given the go ahead- same formula they use i was told- though there&#x27;s is stronger and costs a lot more of course!- just put it on everyday for 2 weeks and then just maintenance after that- (well that is for normal cases of yellowish teeth)- for the low price and convenience of taking only 5 minutes of your time, you can&#x27;t possibly go wrong- it works trust me! the person who said all the positive reviews are a scam, is totally wrong- do not believe them- i have absolutely nothing to gain by sharing with everyone how great this product has been for me starting when i was a poor university student and could never have afforded professional teeth whitening, this product was a godsend-  i will give you one word of advice, though, do not overdue it! - if you use it beyond the 2 weeks everyday when your teeth are already super white, and keep doing that for months let&#x27;s say, you will start to get almost translucent teeth- and you don&#x27;t want that- it won&#x27;t look as natural- my dentist pointed that out to me- so i scaled back my use and do a bare minimum maintenance treatment and it works perfectly now-</li>
            <li> I have to say I&#x27;m surprised how well this five dollar system works, especially after spending I-don&#x27;t-want-to-think-how-much on crest white strips. I follow the directions exactly, put it in before I hop in the shower, and rinse out the tray last thing before I get out. I noticed my teeth were whiter after maybe three days...at first I thought I imagined it because how the heck could this literally five dollar kit from Walmart possibly make a difference, especially after the whitestrips fail, and especially with the amount of tea I drink on a daily basis... But then other people stared noticing after about a week, and now I&#x27;m convinced. This is the best kept teeth whitening secret. How is this not all over Pinterest as the miracle tooth whitening sensation of the week?? And did I mention it tastes like birch beer? My teeth don&#x27;t even feel sensitive like with other products *coughcrestwhitestripscough* :D</li>
            <li> Beware i just threw this in the trash my 3rd application of this i gota deep shooting pain in my gum i dont know why but i rinse it off immediately and threw it away. Back to whitestrips for me!!</li>
            <li> If you follow the directions for this kit it works.  You have to use it twice a day for two weeks.  This is not easy and your mouth will become sensitive.  Not just your teeth but your gums also. The discomfort resolves after you stop the two week regimen and switch over to the twice per week maintenance schedule.  My teeth brightened by several shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t work as well as a professional bleaching by a dentist but it gives acceptable results.  It removes  stains from your teeth very well but if your teeth are naturally yellow,  it will not completely whiten them.  Maybe the concentration of the peroxide isn&#x27;t high enough, I don&#x27;t know.  For the price, I like the results but my teeth did not turn a brilliant white like a dental treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mouthpiece didn&#x27;t fit me well so I used a custom molded one that I also purchased from Amazon.  I would recommend  others do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to continue to use this but recommend it with reservations.  Don&#x27;t expect a miracle.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband because he thinks his teeth are yellow. After years of coffee smoking, I still don&#x27;t see the yellow tint he is so self conscious about but thought I would try to get him a bit of an ego boost. This was just it! within only a week of use even I, who looks at that mug everyday, could tell that it was working. I made him stop using it after two weeks for fear that his teeth would start glowing in the dark--they seemed so bright white! He said the tray is a little uncomfortable and bulky but that it was tolerable. Overall, great for the price!</li>
            <li> I tried it. Maybe I saw a difference?  But I was hoping to notice a change but didn&#x27;t see much if any of a change on my teeth.  But its cheap so maybe that&#x27;s what you get?</li>
            <li> i have bought this product several times before and found it cheaper here on amazon than in the store. I like the smaller package since it now takes up less room in my overly cluttered bathroom. I love this product. does not harm my teeth or gums like some other products. does not cause sensitivity like others and gets the job done. The mouth guard is a bit bulky and less is more with the gel but other than that, I&#x27;ll keep getting it.</li>
            <li> Important to follow the directions. Easy to use, though the mouth tray is a bit narrow in the front, so I felt it did not reach the upper part of my top teeth particularly well. Overall, not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t stick to it very long so I didn&#x27;t notice a change. Eventually I just stop using it. J</li>
            <li> This is a good buy, it is great for anyone who has sensitive teeth. The mouth guard fits great, just bite down a little bit and the bleaching process works better. The mouth rinse is refreshing and light. Lastly, the mouth rinse and squeeze bottle are bigger than they appear in the picture. Worth it! Happy customer! :)</li>
            <li> Awesome teeth whitener for the price.  Actually found it in my local Walmart for under $8, so hopefully Amazon drops the price soon.  A bit messy to use but for the price (a fraction of crest strips) its well worth the mess to save.</li>
            <li> I have used Crest White strips in the past followed by extreme tooth sensitivity like someone was drilling a hole through by teeth. So I wanted to try something that was more cost effective and less painful, I like the Plus White System but the mouth guard is to big and kind of makes my jaw hurt. Also the gel is gummy and fills your entire mouth when use as directed, it also doesn&#x27;t taste great. I did see a slightly whiter color when I used it three times a day for about twenty minutes a piece, and no tooth pain. I look forward to see if it improves the overall white color of my teeth when used for a two week period.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Gel\\&quot; was liquified and exploded all over the inside of the package. The back of the gel says \\&quot;If liquified, do not use and contact us\\&quot; so I will be calling tomorrow.  Considering what I received so far I have overpaid for a small mouthpiece. If they send me a new non-defective gel pack I will update my review.</li>
            <li> The price is right, but it&#x27;s pretty messy.  The gel is so runny that it&#x27;s hard to get it to stay in the bottom part of the tray while you&#x27;re putting it in the top part.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to note a difference in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I had to discard this because the tube was squeezed in the package so that it broke on the bottom. I cannot use it. It is a mess!</li>
            <li> Received with hole in white formula tub and solution all over box. Not much left to use. May try to get another tube.</li>
            <li> The picture and product did not match I got an old version of this product and it did not include the mouth wash as pictured. It was not the improved formula is was the old one I would know because I&#x27;ve been buying it that long</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. Applying the gel as the instructions said ended up leaving all the product on the back of my teeth, where it was not needed at all. Minor gum burns.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, I smoke and drink alot of coffee.. this is after using 5 times.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!  You will definitely notice a difference without having to pay hundreds of dollars at the dentist OR without having to put those flimsy strips on your teeth.  This works so much better.  The peroxide can be a bit harsh on the inside of your mouth as it touches parts other than your teeth but- otherwise, it&#x27;s a great product.  Highly recommended!  update Feb, 2017:  This is by far the best tooth whitener I&#x27;ve used, especially for the price.  Nothing else compares.  The only thing is, be careful of an expiration date.  I can&#x27;t find one on the tube or on the box but, I&#x27;ve had a couple of tubes sitting in my cabinet for a while now, and they are totally gloppy and unusable.  The gel is congealed yet, it won&#x27;t stick in the tray when  you turn it over to fill the other side, like it used to.   I can&#x27;t see an expiration date but, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s because the product is now old.  Good luck locating an expiration date, though....</li>
            <li> when this came i opened it and was a little nervous. as i pulled it out of the envelope i saw that the top of the box was open and the bottom of the box was all ripped apart (looked like it had been chewed) it must have happened pre-shipping because the thick yellow bubble-wrap envelope was totally fine and undamaged.  i checked all the products and none of the protective seals had been broken so i assume it was just a mishap for me and i will still be using this product.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, we ALWAYS keep it in the house, and use it on a weekly basis!</li>
            <li> This product has worked for me, I have noticed a big difference in whiter teeth. I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> THis is a hot mess and It tastes gross and It really does not work and it is just gross!!</li>
            <li> It really works! I noticed results in a few days. The mouth piece is a bit large for smaller mouths, so I use a q-tip to paint the gel on. Highly recommend this product. Loving my pearly whites!</li>
            <li> Works well but better tray is needed. Not a replacement for in office whitening.</li>
            <li> The tube was shipped opened, and I only had half of the product left once I received it!</li>
            <li> This product detroys your enamel and leaves your teeth extremely sensitive. I used this product for 3 days in a row, as directed for 5 minutes max. 1 week later my teeth are extremely sensitive to cold and heat and i can feel the enamel chipping on the teeth. 3 days of use and teeth destroyed!!!!! NOT WORTH IT AT ALL, AVOID!</li>
            <li> The mouthpiece is no good. I bought dental trays that work much better. But the gel and rinse work GREAT!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see drastic results but there was some whitening. Package arrived on time and undamaged.</li>
            <li> It works, albeit slowly. You have to be diligent with it.</li>
            <li> This product is powerful!</li>
            <li> I bought this thing in 2007 to &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; my teeth, I used many days, and it destroyed my gums. Since then Im living with periodontal disease, bleeding, bad breath, 4-6 mm pockets.&lt;br /&gt;You are not gonna get white teeth, the only thing you are gonna get is a gum disease.&lt;br /&gt;Save your 5 dollars and 1000s for treatment. Im telling you.&lt;br /&gt;Im not sensitive, thats why I could use it for a few days, the only thing I did notice was white spots in my gums, but I thought they would be removed with saliva and brushing, but I was badly wrong. Dont buy, save your 5 dollars and 1000 for gum treatment. I really need a lawyer, Im thinking to sue this company.</li>
            <li> Good product, incredible price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> seems to be doing the job, even without me following the directions. satisfied.</li>
            <li> Great product, great results</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much except irritate the gums</li>
            <li> I love red wine, coffee and tea.  I have tried many supermarket teeth whitening products over the years and also paid a lot of money and had the professional Zoom teeth whitening procedure. The final result from Plus White was exactly the same as the Zoom whitening but by far less expensive and less painful!!  I left Plus White on for 20 minutes without pain which was fantastic as I normally use a sensitive toothpaste and was a bit worried that is would hurt.  If you want a teeth whitening system that is inexpensive, painless, easy and delivers what it promises then I recommend you give Plus White a go, you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I only saw the slightest bit of improvement. However, I am a huge coffee, tea and wine drinker and a former heavy soda drinker. One day I just woke up and realized how heavily stained my teeth are. It did do the slightest whitening. But, I just think my teeth need professional whitening. I believe this would work well for people who have slight staining and need a refresher. Not an entire makeover!</li>
            <li> Used it 2x a day for 25 min for 2 weeks, not a shade brighter</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. Made my teeth so sensible from day 1. Couldn&#x27;t handle the sensibility x.x</li>
            <li> did not have results as promised.</li>
            <li> Slow working but unlike the Crest white strips this whitener has not yet left my gums burning or my teeth sensitive. You definitely have to be consistent but it&#x27;s soooooooooo cheap compared to other products that leave me in pain. So, in that respect, this stuff is top notch.</li>
            <li> I had the worst time with this whitener. I followed the directions as much as possible and still ended up with very damaged gums. My gums were peeling for days and I could barely eat or drink anything. This product is messy and the gel comes out like a waterfall. I used this one time and threw it into the back of my medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> I bought this at a local Kroger&#x27;s, a few years ago, and was unable to find it locally.  I was happily surprised when I found it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Its easy painless, and works great to remove tartar.</li>
            <li> I bought this system to see if I could expedite the whitening process, since the over-the-counter gel I normally use with my toothpaste isn&#x27;t quite so spectacular and offers slight whitening. This kit does take some time to use, which may not be easy in the course of a busy day. I do know that after a few days my teeth do look somewhat improved right after going through the process. I will continue with the process over the next several weeks to see if there is any drastic improvement.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this product over all.  It is very messy and leaves my mouth tasting of peroxide.  The gel gags me if I leave the tray in place for any amount of time.  Also, the tube was open on both ends and leaked everywhere.  I would not recommend this product.  Too much trouble for very little effect.  Since it was not expensive, I guess I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Immediate results.  Burns slightly.</li>
            <li> Did not whiten my teeth especially just like the box said, but I didn&#x27;t notice exceptional change. These did work okay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using it a few days ago and if you use it like required you will see the results in a matter of days. I use it 2/day and after 3 days I can see my teeth changing color, the rinse helps too.</li>
            <li> I saw some whitening within days.  I will continue to use for the specified time to get maximum results</li>
            <li> The good reviews must be paid for. I don&#x27;t know if it works because I used it twice and it made my gums sore. They looked all red and weird. I&#x27;m sticking to the crest white strips</li>
            <li> ..but close.  I suspect that some teeth are more susceptible to whitening than others.  I used the regular version of this product twice a day and for at least 20 minutes per session.  The price was right and the tray is very well-made and comfortable.  After 3 weeks I concluded that the results were modest, at best, and disappointing.  The problems lies, I believe, in the percentage of bleach in the product.  My research revealed that the normal version of the Plus White gel contains only 6% peroxide, as compared to the 20% - 35% concentrations used in some other products. I&#x27;m going to order some 35% gel and see if the results are more acceptable.</li>
            <li> Have used this twice a day for 5 days and I see no change at all. I do not smoke or drink coffee, but would like my teeth to be a little whiter, and this did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good when u leave it for 20 minutes. My teeth are so bright thanks to this product. This product is a must buy.</li>
            <li> i bought this with high expectations i was not disappointed. one problem doe, when the whitening gel get in contact with my gums it was painful but i was able to tolerate the pain for the five minute.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, you cannot really complain about the price though its really cheap, but doesn&#x27;t work as expected, I do see some white marks on my teeth, but it&#x27;s not evenly distributed, for example there are 2 strips of white marks in my 2 middle top teeth, and one one giant white spot mark on my upper left side teeth, I have now bought Crest white strips luxe edition to try.</li>
            <li> easy to use and quick-I noticied improvement right away</li>
            <li> Very good product, works well for a short period but that comes as expected</li>
            <li> Product arrived and looked normal but when I opened it the consistency of the gel is like syrup. I&#x27;ve been purchasing this product from the local drug store for years and I know how it&#x27;s supposed to perform. I seems like it&#x27;s been sitting on a shelf somewhere and has lost it&#x27;s usefulness. I even tried refrigerating it to firm up the consistency but no use. And of course since I didn&#x27;t open the product immediately it&#x27;s now too late to return. Be aware!</li>
            <li> This works .. even on my old yellow teeth - .. when I take time to use it -- I just don&#x27;t take the time ..</li>
            <li> First of all I found a study online which uses this product and specifies it&#x27;s 35% hydrogen peroxide. It&#x27;s a study where they picked a product using light therapy. The point is that&#x27;s like the strongest one can get but the bottle doesn&#x27;t tell you that. The secret to this stuff is to make sure all teeth are covered n leave it in about an hour every other day. You can do this several times and have a super white smile. Do this for two weeks n u will have amazingly white teeth. Follow the dental instructions for 35% hp which calls for a longer duration. 5 minutes won&#x27;t get u anything. Don&#x27;t swallow any and don&#x27;t get too much on the gums and mouth. Wear custom trays and use it for like an hour every other day for two weeks u will be amazed.</li>
            <li> This actually works, cuz I have hella stains and it works.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time, but the tube had a hole at the top so when you squeeze it, the the gel comes out on both ends.  The gel itself has an uneven consistency, it&#x27;s hard to apply it evenly in the tray.  And the tray is useless.  It doesn&#x27;t hug your teeth at all, the gel gets all over your mouth.  I&#x27;ll use the rest of the gel by mixing it in with the toothpaste when I brush, hopefully it will help some...  Also, it&#x27;s a little curious why they don&#x27;t give you the percentage of the whitening agent (active ingredient).  My guess is that it&#x27;s probably a low percentage...</li>
            <li> easy to use.  did notice a difference after three times.  Will continue to buy this.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I purchased my kit at my local Wal-Mart for around 10 dollars, so the price here is ridiculous, but this product works, believe me, it&#x27;s the best 10 dollars I&#x27;ve spent in a long time. It doesn&#x27;t taste strongly at all, and does not cause sensitivity to my teeth, plus it works as well, if not better than white strips. I&#x27;d highly suggest checking your local CVS or Wal-Mart, or another seller here on amazon  before purchasing from this one.</li>
            <li> Been using 5 minute white for years...excellent product...</li>
            <li> I have not completed the two week time period yet, but Ive only used it for a week and some of the most embarrassing stains that I use to have are almost completely gone! After about a week and a half my teeth are almost completely white! I have about three days left before I complete the two-week process. I also purchased their toothpaste I use it in conjunction with the crest 3D white. For those that did not give it 5 stars I can only confer that they did not properly follow the directions. I love this product...however I purchased my kit for $8 from Walmart. I love it!! Definitely recommend it anyone that wants an inexpensive way to whiten their teeth.</li>
            <li> After my first use, I noticed immediate results. Because of the first use results, I did not need to use the product more than three five minute sessions per week. In addition, the instructions are simple and it REALLY works the first time!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and I did notice subtle results after only one use. The instructions are easy to follow and I had no problems figuring out how to use it. The mouth tray is comfortable and fits well in my mouth. As long as you distract yourself (tv works well) the 5-10 minutes go by fast. The only downside of this product is by the time you&#x27;re almost ready to take it out, you&#x27;ve started to build up a saliva in your mouth, and since you can&#x27;t swallow it, you pretty much start drooling, a lot. So be sure to have some paper towels nearby to catch it. Overall, I like this way more than whitening strips or whitening pens. In regards to tooth sensitivity after using the product, I didn&#x27;t experience any.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Makes your teeth white without making them sensitive</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and good it&#x27;s high quality</li>
            <li> Works great and cheap too!</li>
            <li> I am happy that my package arrived.  And I know a friend have used this product already and he said it is good. So I will be using it soon for myself.</li>
            <li> Really works these two products worth the buy</li>
            <li> Did not try it.  The whitening gel had a hole in the bottom of it so I shipped it back to Amazon.</li>
            <li> A bit messy. I could see a slight difference after the first 2 applications, but was not able to see much improvement after that.</li>
