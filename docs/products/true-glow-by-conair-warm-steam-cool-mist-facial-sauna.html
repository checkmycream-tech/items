            <li>Wife and daughter love it.</li>

            <li>Easy dial operation.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time and my skin felt amazing afterwards.</li>
            <li>I  love the cool mist  enhancement  and timer,  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to set-up and use.</li>
            <li>Warms up quickly and is easy to operate.</li>
            <li>The cool mist works fine.</li>
            <li>The cool mist is a great feature and my overall reason for choosing this steamer.</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my grand daughter and this is exactly the make, model and quality she needed for her business.</li>
            <li>I was NOT disappointed.  </li>
            <li>wait till they come out with one that has better water&lt;br /&gt; reservoir for both hot &amp; cool mist.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have this at home to use on a more regular basis than going to a spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The directions were unclear and it did not steam as well as the one without the cool mist.  </li>
            <li>Cool mist</li>
            <li>This keeps my skin smooth and fresh.  </li>
            <li>We used the steamer for a full treatment and then used the cool mist.  </li>
            <li>Changes quickly from steam to cool mist.</li>
            <li>They have quality just like this facial steamer with both warm steam and cool mist.</li>
            <li>It produces a good stream of cool air, but NOT hot steam.</li>
            <li>When I can&#x27;t get to a salon, I pamper myself and this is a great little item</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much more comfortable to use and to target specific areas of your face.</li>
            <li>I like how you can do hot or cool steam.</li>
            <li>The local stores couldn&#x27;t even come close to matching the price I was able to secure thru amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve definitely seen a difference in my skin since using this, it effectively helps my clogged pores and acne to come to the surface of my skin and heal.</li>
            <li>Inefficient design idea to have the hot water receptacle flow into the cool mist water receptacle.</li>
            <li>I tested both hot and cool steam.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t even work right 1 time.</li>
            <li>I apply Clinique Gel moisturizer right after.  </li>
            <li>It takes a long time to warm up and start steaming and then it stops steaming minutes before the timer is set to stop it-</li>
            <li>Does what it&#x27;s supposed to, wish it fit my face better (too wide).</li>
            <li>Really like this product and the price was much better on here than at Ulta (which was a major deciding factor for me).</li>
            <li>like I did at first and try to use it every night.</li>
            <li>more used to the one that has only &amp;#34;The</li>
            <li>I do believe that my charcoal masque penetrates better using this steamer than simply a bowl of hot water.</li>
            <li>Not complicated at all</li>
            <li>Well, it gets HOT...</li>
            <li>Today I tried it again, the hot steam just stopped working.</li>
            <li>Warms up fast and steams well!  </li>
            <li>I purchased the steamer to provide hot steam for the facials I give myself.</li>
            <li>(I use the full 15minutes to get a deep clean).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving this little thing.</li>
            <li>Nice little machine.  </li>
            <li>I really saw a difference  in my skin after using it 3 times.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very relaxing as well.</li>
            <li>More wet dew than steam.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product, it works really well.</li>
            <li>Very ease to use and is what we were looking for.</li>
            <li>not so much 👎</li>
            <li>Great product, the only draw back is the opening that provides the heated steam is centered in the middle and requires that you move your face around to really reap the benefits.</li>
            <li>Anyone who sees it in my room wants to try it because it is a mini spa day.</li>
            <li>I love that the steam gets really hot, hot enough to actually make</li>
            <li>The option to control how much steam/mist comes out.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t generate as much steam as i thought it would</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Most interesting.&amp;#34;  Thanks</li>
            <li>Nice product has timer,and you can utilize warm and cold air.</li>
            <li>I mainly use it for the hot steam for my dry eyes and even though there is water in the cool mist receptacle, I constantly have to refill the hot water receptacle in order to use it, but since that water flows to the cool mist receptacle, the water is always overflowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We use this at home to deep clean our skin weekly.  </li>
            <li>I still like to use a towel to prevent any air from escaping (mainly from the bottom where my chin is supposed to sit).  </li>
            <li>Within the first use I noticed a MAJOR improvement in my skin/complexion.  </li>
            <li>You would come off better standing over a boiling pot of water, complete waste.</li>
            <li>I love how simple it is to assemble and use, and that it&#x27;s pink!</li>
            <li>One of my concerns when buying it was how hot the steam would actually get.</li>
            <li>&gt; Originally purchased to steam my teenage son&#x27;s pores open for extractions.  </li>
            <li>Complete Junk!</li>
            <li>Having extremely sensitive and acne-prone skin makes it a battle living in the state.  </li>
            <li>I use it directly after exfoliating with Queen Helene Mint Julep scrub or her Apricot Scrub (from Sally&#x27;s or Ulta).  </li>
            <li>I use it frequently and have had it for awhile.  </li>
            <li>I really need to get into the habit of using it regularly.</li>
            <li>Sent it back and still shopping for a decent one.</li>
            <li>Truthfully, using a pot of boiling water works way better, but I feel guilty about wasting water and this uses very little- easing my conscious.</li>
            <li>I called back and they sent a new one</li>
            <li>The steam shoots directly from the middle</li>
            <li>took 1 star away because the steam shoots directly from middle</li>
            <li>Perhaps a little too hot for people with sensitivity to heat.  </li>

            <li> Truthfully, using a pot of boiling water works way better, but I feel guilty about wasting water and this uses very little- easing my conscious.</li>
            <li> I called back and they sent a new one</li>
            <li> The steam shoots directly from the middle</li>
            <li> took 1 star away because the steam shoots directly from middle</li>
            <li> Perhaps a little too hot for people with sensitivity to heat.  </li>
            <li> But the hot one took a long time to have steam came out, and it is not strong at all.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant because of the price, but really wanted it for my dry eyes.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve owned other &amp;#34;facial steamers&amp;#34; before (that are no longer available), and this one is not good.</li>
            <li> The unit barely holds any water and would be difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> This product is ok, produces minimal amount of steam and sticking your face in the cone is uncomfortable and doesn&#x27;t allow you to target the steam on one part of your face.</li>
            <li> The steam is pretty weak, don&#x27;t get me wrong, it can get hot when you get up close, but there is just not that much steam at all.</li>
            <li> the  wide face attachment  helps with the upper neck area.  </li>
            <li> Only the center of my faced gets steamed.</li>
            <li> what make it difference from other facial is the safety features..</li>
            <li> Cheaper here than in the stores and cuter than the other Conair facial steamer (which is why I picked it since it&#x27;s going to stay on my counter), you can&#x27;t see from the photo</li>
            <li> I misplaced my firs facial sauna that I purchased from Avon several years ago ..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind a little profit for my local stores, but $15 I thought was going a little too far.</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona...where we get a lot of heat but hardly any humidity.</li>
            <li> only issue with the product is that it doesn&#x27;t collapse down for storage.</li>
            <li> The pink face portion can separate but it doesn&#x27;t break down any further from there.</li>
            <li> I am glad I ignored bad reviews and ordered this item.</li>
            <li> This is a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I am in my 20s and have extreme red scarring from cystic acne a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much from this product, but I bought it because it was less expensive than say a Panasonic steamer.</li>
            <li> Whether I want to turn it on (silver knob) or change the timer setting (small pink knob inside the silver knob), I always have a hard time grasping either knob because they are too small for my fingers or too slippery that it takes several tries just to turn it</li>
            <li> Turn knob to hot, cold, or off.</li>
            <li> The steam can make the veins on your eyelids turn red and it looks irritating.</li>
            <li> Not cheap materials like some of the others</li>
            <li> I find it takes too long for the mist to start and the dial is a little difficult to figure out.  </li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t go overboard</li>
            <li> it boils water in a close compartment and steam travel through a small opening to my face</li>
            <li> Uses small amount of water.</li>
            <li> No more break outs.</li>
            <li> The front knobs are too small for my fingers to grab.</li>
            <li> With two different settings, You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> This device dispenses steam trough a small focused opening.</li>
            <li> Disappointed it didn&#x27;t work, it took long to heat, the steam only came out when I tilted it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s average for this mister but not great.  </li>
            <li> I use st least three times a week.</li>
            <li> Being in AZ, the air is very dirty and dry.  </li>
            <li> Wasted money :(</li>
            <li> The cold steam is stronger, but it&#x27;s still weak.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I was going to purchase a steamer from Ulta (which I am not a fan of) and they were just too expensive.  </li>
            <li> Sorry!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m kinda disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed, because I trust Conair brand</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>

            <li> This product is ok, produces minimal amount of steam and sticking your face in the cone is uncomfortable and doesn&#x27;t allow you to target the steam on one part of your face. The unit barely holds any water and would be difficult to clean. I returned it and purchased the Ivation Portable Sauna for $15 more. It produces so much more steam and it&#x27;s much more comfortable to use and to target specific areas of your face. The Ivation also holds much more water.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for your skin and really will make a difference in your tone.</li>
            <li> I really saw a difference  in my skin after using it 3 times.  It&#x27;s very relaxing as well. Would definitely  purchase again</li>
            <li> This is a total waste of money. I purchased this product from a retail location and the steam comes out of this tiny hole, barely enough to do anything. You would come off better standing over a boiling pot of water, complete waste.</li>
            <li> Disappointed it didn&#x27;t work, it took long to heat, the steam only came out when I tilted it. I sent it back after one use</li>
            <li> It does not work well at all!  We&#x27;ve owned other &amp;#34;facial steamers&amp;#34; before (that are no longer available), and this one is not good. More wet dew than steam.  Sent it back and still shopping for a decent one.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my daughter.  She loves it!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product, it works really well.</li>
            <li> Perfect for home use!!</li>
            <li> Good as described and easy to use !!</li>
            <li> great quality for the price</li>
            <li> I wanted to buy this same unit at Ulta but it was priced at $60. This was a great deal! I like how you can do hot or cool steam. It definitely adds another level to your beauty routine. Just don&#x27;t go overboard like I did at first and try to use it every night. The steam can make the veins on your eyelids turn red and it looks irritating. It goes away if you stop steaming so often though. I would use it once of twice a week max.</li>
            <li> glad with this purchase.. it does it job as a facial steamer, but what make it difference from other facial is the safety features.. it boils water in a close compartment and steam travel through a small opening to my face</li>
            <li> The directions were unclear and it did not steam as well as the one without the cool mist.  Would not recommend this&lt;br /&gt;product</li>
            <li> Well, not as great as the commercial said, the sound! the noise! eee!</li>
            <li> Good product for dollar. I love mine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s average for this mister but not great.  I find it takes too long for the mist to start and the dial is a little difficult to figure out.  I didn&#x27;t find the instructions to be all that helpful.  I still use it but I don&#x27;t think  I could recommend.</li>
            <li> I have used one of these for years. I have really enjoyed this newer version. The cool mist is great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Ok.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m more used to the one that has only &amp;#34;The Steam&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Since it has two stages, the water fill doesn&#x27;t last as long.&lt;br /&gt;Still a Good Concept!&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait till they come out with one that has better water&lt;br /&gt; reservoir for both hot &amp; cool mist.</li>
            <li> The local stores couldn&#x27;t even come close to matching the price I was able to secure thru amazon. I saved well over $15 from the local merchants. I don&#x27;t mind a little profit for my local stores, but $15 I thought was going a little too far. So Amazon was my best choice and arrived exactly on the day they said it would. This was a gift for my grand daughter and this is exactly the make, model and quality she needed for her business.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying a total of 6 of these steamers for my Merle Norman studio and they are excellent products for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this little thing. It&#x27;s super easy to set-up and use. I used it for the first time and my skin felt amazing afterwards. It&#x27;s nice to have this at home to use on a more regular basis than going to a spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue with the product is that it doesn&#x27;t collapse down for storage. The pink face portion can separate but it doesn&#x27;t break down any further from there. Be sure you have a place to store it, I&#x27;m still searching for mine.</li>
            <li> We use this at home to deep clean our skin weekly.  Very ease to use and is what we were looking for.</li>
            <li> Hot steam good  👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻... Cool mist not so much 👎🏻👎🏻</li>
            <li> The product is very easy to use, very fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Wife and daughter love it.</li>
            <li> Really like this product and the price was much better on here than at Ulta (which was a major deciding factor for me). I do believe that my charcoal masque penetrates better using this steamer than simply a bowl of hot water. I use it once a week.</li>
            <li> Great for getting your face clean and pores refreshed!  My husband also loves this product.  Nothing to complain about with the overall product.  It is worth the price for the great job it does.  5 Start rating.</li>
            <li> Terrible. Didn&#x27;t even work right 1 time. Sent back</li>
            <li> Changes quickly from steam to cool mist. Warms up quickly and is easy to operate. Uses small amount of water.</li>
            <li> The steam setting works only sporadically. The cool mist works fine. The timer will be set for 15 minutes and works for only 5.</li>
            <li> Gets very warm almost Hot but to a tolerable steam temperature.  Great product, the only draw back is the opening that provides the heated steam is centered in the middle and requires that you move your face around to really reap the benefits. I wrap a towel around the machine and this helps to add more of an experience and locks in the steam.  The cool mist is a great feature and my overall reason for choosing this steamer.</li>
            <li> This is an easy to use machine.  Not complicated at all</li>
            <li> I like Conair products. They have quality just like this facial steamer with both warm steam and cool mist. I have used it twice and I love it.</li>
            <li> This thing is so relaxing. Anyone who sees it in my room wants to try it because it is a mini spa day. I love how simple it is to assemble and use, and that it&#x27;s pink! I&#x27;ve definitely seen a difference in my skin since using this, it effectively helps my clogged pores and acne to come to the surface of my skin and heal.</li>
            <li> I am glad I ignored bad reviews and ordered this item. It works just as described on box. I use st least three times a week. No more break outs.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant because of the price, but really wanted it for my dry eyes. For the most part, I love it. The issues I have with it are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Inefficient design idea to have the hot water receptacle flow into the cool mist water receptacle. I mainly use it for the hot steam for my dry eyes and even though there is water in the cool mist receptacle, I constantly have to refill the hot water receptacle in order to use it, but since that water flows to the cool mist receptacle, the water is always overflowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The front knobs are too small for my fingers to grab. Whether I want to turn it on (silver knob) or change the timer setting (small pink knob inside the silver knob), I always have a hard time grasping either knob because they are too small for my fingers or too slippery that it takes several tries just to turn it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I LOVE about it is:&lt;br /&gt;1. One of my concerns when buying it was how hot the steam would actually get. Well, it gets HOT...and I love that!!  I love that the steam gets really hot, hot enough to actually make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;d like to see in a later model is:&lt;br /&gt;1. The option to change the direction of the steam/mist.&lt;br /&gt;2. The option to control how much steam/mist comes out.&lt;br /&gt;3. A change in the receptacle design.&lt;br /&gt;4. Bigger knobs or maybe button operation.</li>
            <li> I just used this product yesterday. I tested both hot and cool steam. The cool mist is nice and strong. But the hot one took a long time to have steam came out, and it is not strong at all. Today I tried it again, the hot steam just stopped working. I am very disappointed, because I trust Conair brand so I purchased this item. I will return it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much from this product, but I bought it because it was less expensive than say a Panasonic steamer. Needless to say, you get what you pay for. I don&#x27;t recommend this. The steam is pretty weak, don&#x27;t get me wrong, it can get hot when you get up close, but there is just not that much steam at all. That&#x27;s even after I turn my face towards the area where steam is coming from. The cold steam is stronger, but it&#x27;s still weak. To be honest, I get more steam cooking pasta on my stovetop. I didn&#x27;t like this product.</li>
            <li> The steamer is made well and the cool mist option is quite nice.  The reason for only giving it three stars is because it takes up a lot of space and it takes quite awhile to heat up.  Truthfully, using a pot of boiling water works way better, but I feel guilty about wasting water and this uses very little- easing my conscious.</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona...where we get a lot of heat but hardly any humidity. This has improved my complexion alot...youthful glow</li>
            <li> I LOVE it.  Being in AZ, the air is very dirty and dry.  Having extremely sensitive and acne-prone skin makes it a battle living in the state.  I was going to purchase a steamer from Ulta (which I am not a fan of) and they were just too expensive.  This one was a bit pricier in-store.  I have wanted one for years and finally got myself to purchase it and test it out.  I was NOT disappointed.  Within the first use I noticed a MAJOR improvement in my skin/complexion.  The steam shoots directly from the middle so you do have to move your face around to make sure you cover all surfaces.  I still like to use a towel to prevent any air from escaping (mainly from the bottom where my chin is supposed to sit).  I use this once a week and it keeps my skin looking fresher.  I am in my 20s and have extreme red scarring from cystic acne a few years ago.  This keeps my skin smooth and fresh.  Everyone has noticed the improvement.  I use it directly after exfoliating with Queen Helene Mint Julep scrub or her Apricot Scrub (from Sally&#x27;s or Ulta).  I apply Clinique Gel moisturizer right after.  It has a timer on it (I use the full 15minutes to get a deep clean).  Worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only took 1 star away because the steam shoots directly from middle so you have to move your face around.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t generate as much steam as i thought it would</li>
            <li> Nice little machine.  Does what it is supposed to</li>
            <li> Nice product has timer,and you can utilize warm and cold air. Even my boyfriend loves using it</li>
            <li> Love this product. I use it weekly. It&#x27;s my &amp;#34;me time&amp;#34; facial spa go-to.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to, wish it fit my face better (too wide). Cheaper here than in the stores and cuter than the other Conair facial steamer (which is why I picked it since it&#x27;s going to stay on my counter), you can&#x27;t see from the photo but the white part is shimmery.</li>
            <li> I  love conair  products,  this specific  model  is still taking some adjustment.  However it is a great product!  the auto shut off prevents from burning and over heating. I  love the cool mist  enhancement  and timer,  the  wide face attachment  helps with the upper neck area.  The price is sufficient as well,  at  ulta  this  retails for $59.</li>
            <li> Warms up fast and steams well!  Perhaps a little too hot for people with sensitivity to heat.  We used the steamer for a full treatment and then used the cool mist.  Makes your skin feel great!</li>
            <li> I am enjoying it. Great for spa night with the girls. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Great steamer.  I use it frequently and have had it for awhile.  Great for home facials.  I love it!!!</li>
            <li> I misplaced my firs facial sauna that I purchased from Avon several years ago ..I just received my product yesterday but I am sure that I will not have any issues with this Sauna from Conair. With two different settings, You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I was very excited about this steamer but I&#x27;m kinda disappointed. It takes a long time to warm up and start steaming and then it stops steaming minutes before the timer is set to stop it- therefore I have to start all over again.</li>
            <li> Very dissatisfied with the product. It produces a good stream of cool air, but NOT hot steam. I purchased the steamer to provide hot steam for the facials I give myself. Would not recommend this product. Sorry!</li>
            <li> Do not buy this. I bought this and it did not work at all. The steam would not stay on and eventually stopped working.I sent an e-mail to these people about 2 months after I bought it and they would not take it back because it was over 30 days. I called the warranty, I mailed it back and they sent me a used one. I called back and they sent a new one and it didn&#x27;t work. I just threw it out. Don&#x27;t waist your money or time!</li>
            <li> When I can&#x27;t get to a salon, I pamper myself and this is a great little item</li>
            <li> item exactly as described great quality fast ship</li>
            <li> This device dispenses steam trough a small focused opening. Only the center of my faced gets steamed. A bowl of steaming water still works best for my whole face.</li>
            <li> Not cheap materials like some of the others comparable price points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Originally purchased to steam my teenage son&#x27;s pores open for extractions.  It works wonderfully. Easy dial operation. Turn knob to hot, cold, or off. The only effort is to add water. For that, requires 2 steps. To store in cupboard, face cone must be detached.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times and I like it. I really need to get into the habit of using it regularly.</li>
            <li> all that I have purchased through Amazon.com has met my expections.  Coptic Religion...led me to review their history and the &amp;#34;schism.&amp;#34;  I have watch the series Sleepy Hallow...noted... names, places, locations, and events, and have additionally read the background history of the people mentioned in the series...&amp;#34;Most interesting.&amp;#34;  Thanks</li>
            <li> Complete Junk! Leaks water all over. Wasted money :(</li>
            <li> Used it 10 or so times and the steamer broke.</li>
            <li> I use this for clearing sinus .  Works well for me.  I would ask your doctor .</li>
            <li> wife says she is happy with it, thats all that matters.</li>
