            <li> DRY SKIN DIAPPEARS</li>
            <li> There is not very much cream in the jar.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I have wasted my money, when I could have used for something that actually worked.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a heavy moisturizer for dry skin, My wife is 29 and have been using Mary Kay products since about 15.</li>
            <li> Usually, I can get somewhere between 4 and 6 months out of moisturizers.</li>
            <li> It is thick and creamy.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like the  thick feel of cream, this one&#x27;s probably not for you.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is thick, not at all what I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> If I have any complaints, they are that it is really thick (which makes it difficult to put on) and the jar is a bit deceptive.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I did not like the product. I know its intense moisture cream however it does nothing to your skin. I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I love  this moisturizer.  It&#x27;s definitely for dry skin.  It is thick and creamy.  It leaves your skin looking luminous. A lovey sheen to it.  If you don&#x27;t like the  thick feel of cream, this one&#x27;s probably not for you.</li>
            <li> I received the lotion very promptly. I love the lotion and I use it every night. It keeps my face very soft.</li>
            <li> using it for years.  excellent cream.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is thick, not at all what I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> great if your have dry skin</li>
            <li> I have used Mary Kay for years. I like that it is not greasy and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly. I really like the price of this product, much lower than I had found elsewhere. Tried the face cream immediately and can feel a difference already in comparison to another product I already used.</li>
            <li> This product worked for about 3 weeks and then started making me break out.  I read some reviews that said it was great for acne prone skin because it helped wight he breakouts and evened out skin tone. Well it did that for a very short time. I feel lie I have wasted my money, when I could have used for something that actually worked.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot. If I have any complaints, they are that it is really thick (which makes it difficult to put on) and the jar is a bit deceptive. There is not very much cream in the jar. It has taken me maybe 2 months to finish it off. Usually, I can get somewhere between 4 and 6 months out of moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Love this product for my face, I have sensitive skin and this does the trick and feels smooth all day and even the following day.</li>
            <li> I like the product and use it routinely.  When I&#x27;ve bought it via Amazon and opened the jar, there was a section already scooped out.  When I buy it from my Mary Kay rep., it comes in tact.  Would like to know if you&#x27;re selling returned products or what?  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Used it before.  Great product.</li>
            <li> If you are a first time user, be aware that a little goes far.  Very rich in texture, feels heavy on the skin, but it does work. I use it regularly in spite of it all.</li>
            <li> Perfect, just as described.  Great company to do business with.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and I use this every morning and sometimes at night. It isn&#x27;t oily or greasy. It actually hydrates my skin and makes my face feel soft. This is now a staple in my house. I will be buying more every time I run out.</li>
            <li> Like the smoothness of the moisterizer.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Exactly as described</li>
            <li> I have used Mary Kay since I was 18 years old and have loved it.  I wouldn&#x27;t change any of my skin care products.</li>
            <li> Has Mark Kay ever made a bad product??? its awesome very thick and rich, well made absorbs into the skin and makes my skin feel very soft...</li>
            <li> DRY SKIN DIAPPEARS&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT AFTER A FULL DAY IN SUN, REALLY MAKE SKIN FEEL SOFT AND SMOOTH&lt;br /&gt;BUY IT</li>
            <li> Wonderful product  Wanted to try Mary Kay - never tried before.  61 year old gramma feels pampered great price wonderful seller - shipped fast and well packed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a heavy moisturizer for dry skin, My wife is 29 and have been using Mary Kay products since about 15. She tried different brands, but always came back to MK. &amp;#34;This moisturizer is a great deal, leaves your skin filled and nourished, just remove some extra left on your face after 15 minutes, the skin absorbs this and looks glowing without oily feeling&amp;#34; - She says.  Will reorder soon.</li>
            <li> My wife is happy with it.</li>
            <li> One of the best creams for dry skin!!!! I have been using it for a long time.</li>
