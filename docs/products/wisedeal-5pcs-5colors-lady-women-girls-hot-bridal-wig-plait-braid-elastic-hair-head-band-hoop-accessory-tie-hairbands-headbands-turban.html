    <ol>
            <li>Price and delivery were GREAT!!!</li>
            <li>Perfect for our daughter&#x27;s Anna costume</li>
            <li>Perfect!  </li>
            <li>Match my highlight perfectly.</li>
            <li>This is a great assortment of braided hair headbands.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>A tad too shiny for my liking but a great deal.</li>
            <li>Nice quality and beautiful colors.  </li>
            <li>I have gotten good compliments.  </li>
            <li>the hairband quality are good.</li>
            <li>Good hair color too.</li>
            <li>Love the braids and the colors!</li>
            <li>Looks like my own hair.</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>My mother in law said it looked ok.  </li>
            <li>I wear this as many times as I feel up to wearing it</li>
            <li>The brown one matches my hair perfectly and the others stand out in it, so those are the ones people usually comment on and want to know if I dyed my hair or something; it&#x27;s kind of fun!</li>
            <li>Would be fine for a child or costume</li>
            <li>Now they fit perfect and look stylish on my 14 year old daughter&#x27;s blonde hair.</li>
            <li>but it does fit</li>
            <li>They look good in my hair even when I&#x27;m wearing the ones that don&#x27;t match my natural color, so I can wear all of them.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
            <li>I was not expecting it to be 100% realistic like real hair, but I will not wear them as they look very cheap.  </li>
            <li>It looks really shiny next to my own hair color.  </li>
            <li>Love the different colors.</li>
            <li>They are all really shiny and very synthetic looking.  </li>
            <li>They were ok , But fit a little to big on my head, Kept sliding off, But were pretty.</li>
            <li>The blonde couldn&#x27;t match my color better and same is to be said I the brunette one for my sister.</li>
            <li>The elastic could have been better as this is uncomfortably tight on my head, however.</li>
            <li>highly recommend</li>
            <li>so thought I&#x27;d try a new color.  </li>
            <li>If you want braids that are remotely natural colored do not get these.</li>
            <li>I ended up giving them to my five year old for dress up (and not cosplay where again her wigs are natural in appearance).</li>
            <li>The black was not jet black and there was more auburn colors.  </li>
            <li>After contacting the cellar to replace it who was out of China, refused and gave me the run around, saying I have to photograph them, then fax them and other stupid stuff which I explained I did not have that kind of phone or electronic device to do that and did not want to bother a friend or a relative to turn this into a big project when it could have been nice and simple.</li>

            <li> I have a problem with headbands slipping off my head a lot, but these don&#x27;t do that as much, especially if I wear two at a time.  </li>
            <li> These are so obviously fake (super shiny).  </li>
            <li> but I dont want to walk around if people know it is not real.</li>
            <li> Whereas other headbands I have people mistake for my hair.</li>
            <li> I could give the other colors to my friends.  </li>
            <li> Four out of five breads were ALL cut or broken.  </li>
            <li> I ended up with a big loss, they are terribly made and again, five of mine were all cut, damaged.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> What a steal! Love the braids and the colors! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Love these. They do wonders to your hair when your hair won&#x27;t do wonders for itself.</li>
            <li> They were ok , But fit a little to big on my head, Kept sliding off, But were pretty.Thank you</li>
            <li> This is a great assortment of braided hair headbands. They do run big, so I had to take in the elastic in on each of them. Now they fit perfect and look stylish on my 14 year old daughter&#x27;s blonde hair. Price and delivery were GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> Four out of five breads were ALL cut or broken.  After contacting the cellar to replace it who was out of China, refused and gave me the run around, saying I have to photograph them, then fax them and other stupid stuff which I explained I did not have that kind of phone or electronic device to do that and did not want to bother a friend or a relative to turn this into a big project when it could have been nice and simple. I ended up with a big loss, they are terribly made and again, five of mine were all cut, damaged. shame on you seller.</li>
            <li> Perfect for our daughter&#x27;s Anna costume</li>
            <li> People notice these headbands and ask me about them a lot.  The brown one matches my hair perfectly and the others stand out in it, so those are the ones people usually comment on and want to know if I dyed my hair or something; it&#x27;s kind of fun! They look good in my hair even when I&#x27;m wearing the ones that don&#x27;t match my natural color, so I can wear all of them.  I have a problem with headbands slipping off my head a lot, but these don&#x27;t do that as much, especially if I wear two at a time.  Great product.</li>
            <li> It looks really shiny next to my own hair color.  I would only wear it as ornamental.  My mother in law said it looked ok.  Call me vain but I dont want to walk around if people know it is not real.</li>
            <li> If you want braids that are remotely natural colored do not get these. These are so obviously fake (super shiny).  Whereas other headbands I have people mistake for my hair. I ended up giving them to my five year old for dress up (and not cosplay where again her wigs are natural in appearance).</li>
            <li> Perfect!  Exactly what I was looking for!  The blonde couldn&#x27;t match my color better and same is to be said I the brunette one for my sister. I will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Nice quality and beautiful colors.  The elastic could have been better as this is uncomfortably tight on my head, however.</li>
            <li> I have gotten good compliments.  Looks like my own hair.</li>
            <li> the hairband quality are good. Good hair color too. Match my highlight perfectly. i will definitely buy again. highly recommend</li>
            <li> The black was not jet black and there was more auburn colors.  The braids material was silk and the elastic strap  loosened after being used within 1 minute.  Must use hair pins to help stay in place.</li>
            <li> A bit too shiny plastic looking but it does fit and it does do the job as a headband and the company promptly replied when contacted about the color choice.</li>
            <li> I wear this as many times as I feel up to wearing it and I can change my hair style, anytime I want it gives me flexibility.</li>
            <li> A tad too shiny for my liking but a great deal. Love the different colors. I&#x27;ll be trying the baby powder trick to rid it of some of the shine.</li>
            <li> I have one similar and liked it, but have since died my hair auburn from dirty blond so thought I&#x27;d try a new color.  I figured for the price I could give the other colors to my friends.  They are all really shiny and very synthetic looking.  I was not expecting it to be 100% realistic like real hair, but I will not wear them as they look very cheap.  Also the redish one is too red and the brown one is too brown...niether work with the color of my hair.  Would be fine for a child or costume</li>
