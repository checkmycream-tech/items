    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product was recommended by my salon.  I usually question salon products due to the heavy price tag.  I was convinced to give the Unite volumizing shampoo and conditioner a try.  I&#x27;m in my early 60s and my hair has been thinning for several years. This product gives my hair the extra volume and shine I need to camouflage my thin spots.  I will continue to purchase this product until I find something that is more effective.  The one drawback occurs when dispensing the shampoo and conditioner.  The opening in the top of the bottle is so small, it takes a long time to get enough for a good shampooing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,  Emjay</li>
            <li> Great product and good price..thank you!</li>
            <li> Amazing product and better price through Amazon then my hair salon!</li>
            <li> I like it a lot!! Gives volume, isn&#x27;t heavy...good stuff! :) no pricier than any salon shampoo. Give it a try!</li>
            <li> This is a great product and is much less expensive than if purchased in the salon. I will continue to but&#x3D;y this from Amazon</li>
            <li> best everyday shampoo and conditioner I have used, period!  Smells amazing and leaves your hair feeling fresh and clean without making it look dull.  This shampoo is also healthy for your hair as its free of any harsh chemicals like sulfates and parabens; also cruelty free as it does not test on animals :)  It is pricey but well worth it.  I am a hair product junkie and have tried so many shampoos/conditioners and none have left me as happy as these two have.  If you have seen my previous reviews, I use also Redken deep conditioning systems on Sundays along with this duo.  My hair is noticeably healthier, less split ends, longer, and more voluminous.

            <li> I love this product but the way it was packaged left the residue of tape all of the bottle!!</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is definitely volumizing and well worth the money. My hair is extremely fine and thick. This product makes it feel soft yet full of body.</li>
            <li> I love Unite shampoos - both the Volumizing and Blonda. Great for color treated hair. I alternate between the two types and my hair is in awesome condition, my color lasts and I get tons if compliments.  Best brand of shampoo!!</li>
            <li> Love all Unite products. I use the shampoo, conditioner, and Seven Seconds. If is not heavy, hair is clean and shiny.</li>
            <li> I have been using these products for a couple years now.  I have fine, slightly wavy hair, they are a light product and do not weight down my hair. Nice amount of body, nice fragrance and nice shine. Can only find them online.  Thanks for carrying these wonderful products.</li>
            <li> Good products used in many hairdressing salons.</li>
            <li> I love my hair with this product.  I am loosing my hair, but his product gives it volume and smells great. Box just arrived and the bottles leaked all over. Very disappointing</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic shampoo and conditioner. This is the first shampoo and conditioner that my husband commented, &amp;#34;Your hair looks really healthy. It smells really good and it feels smoother.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine, hair &amp; thought these products would give me some volume, but unfortunately they didn&#x27;t.  I gave them to a friend who has thicker hair than mine &amp; she loves them both, so it&#x27;s a personal preference.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner. I have a hard time finding it in my area salons. Great service-fast shipping! I will purchase again from this seller!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter because she has very flat hair and so far she really likes it.  She is very picky about scents and she says it has a very pleasant scent.  No too overpowering. I also bought the Boosta Volumizing spray and they all work great.  Highly recommend and will buy again.  5/20/15: No longer buying this product for my daughter.  This product is not chemical free.  My daughter switched to Justnaturalskincare.com shampoo and conditioners.  I have been using their products for quite some time and love them.  100% chemical free and made in the USA.  Also try products from Bubble and Bee.  Love their chemical free products and made in the USA.</li>
            <li> It smells great! This is a hard product to come by in stores. And it&#x27;s also a hard product to come by for a reasonable price. I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re going to be able to beat the price listed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do you notice a difference with the texture of my hair and even the volume of my hair when I use the shampoo. It is both Sulfate and sodium free shampoo/ conditioner. This brand as a top brand. It&#x27;s good for color treated hair and as well as keratin treated hair. Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see much volume since it&#x27;s supose to give you volume, but the hair feels nice and soft and smells great</li>
            <li> My hair dresser uses this product on me but they don&#x27;t sell it in the salon. I love the way it smells and also the way it makes my hair feel after using it! I was so happy to find this on amazon and even better it was packaged together so i knew they would arrive at the same time. i will totally order it again!</li>
