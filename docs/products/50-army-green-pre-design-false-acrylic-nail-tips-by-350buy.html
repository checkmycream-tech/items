            <li> They are packaged a little oddly, but they still work.</li>
            <li> and I mean never purchase  anything from this seller again also took a month to get my stuff with 2 days shipping</li>

            <li> Absolutely love them! You have to be careful when putting them on so they don&#x27;t crack but if you know what you&#x27;re doing there&#x27;s no problems. Other then that I&#x27;ve done my nails up several times with these &amp; people always compliment them.</li>
            <li> Cute! Have not tried them yet.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re the same colors as the picture.  Sturdy and the colors won&#x27;t bleed through with the acrylic.  Will be buying more for sure.</li>
