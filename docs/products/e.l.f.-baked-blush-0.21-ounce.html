            <li>nice color, but received in damaged condition</li>
            <li>Nice blush, just a tad too shimmery for my taste.</li>
            <li>I purchased this blush thinking it would be a nice shimmery peach blush - it&#x27;s not.  </li>
            <li>I am looking at you, Milani!) and give a nice glow to the cheeks.</li>
            <li>Nice blush</li>
            <li>Kind of shimmery though.  </li>
            <li>include promotional content of any kind or reviews written in exchange for compensation.</li>
            <li>The color is nice</li>
            <li>It gives a nice sheen without being overly shimmery.</li>
            <li>I have a VERY light skin complection and this color goes on beautifully, has a light shimmer to it, and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>is really soft and looks so perfect in&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a beautiful color and gives my cheeks a really pretty glow.  </li>
            <li>It give a nice healthy glow.</li>
            <li>The product arrive quickly with a nice personalized card!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for my fair pink toned/pale skin.</li>
            <li>so you really have to build it, but that&#x27;s better than it being too bright!</li>
            <li>It is a great colour and has a nice glow, which really adds to your make up :)</li>
            <li>If you looking for a soft look this is perfect for highlighting your face or to use as your cheek color very very pretty!</li>
            <li>Additionally, it was much more sparkly</li>
            <li>Love this blush just got it today</li>
            <li>placing the item in bubble wrap then the shipping box with more protection may have sufficed</li>
            <li>LOVE.</li>
            <li>so I was pleased.</li>
            <li>I love the E.L.F. products but was dissapointed with this.</li>
            <li>I will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a lovely peach/coral shade that lasts all day on my oily skin.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I really love this blush‚ù§</li>
            <li>I love this blush.  </li>
            <li>This is more of a highlighting blush.  </li>
            <li>I love the color (Peachy Cheeky) and the sparkly glow it leaves on my skin.  </li>
            <li>i love it...</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I love elf products</li>
            <li>I love this color of blush.  </li>
            <li>love the shimmer and color</li>
            <li>Ehhh, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Love the glittery type glow it gives off.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>gives just ahint of highlight non-over powering unless you want to apply more,..</li>
            <li>The colour iluminate our skin perfectly but the problem is to open the case.</li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>For the cheeks I brush the side that has the most peach and apply it, then I brush over the section that has the bronze ribbon and apply it as a highlight.</li>
            <li>I am medium skin toned and this give me a hint of color and lovely glow.</li>
            <li>This blush was way more pinky than peachy.</li>
            <li>I have the baked blush in peachy cheeky and in rich rose.</li>
            <li>has great color and pigmentation.not worth the hassle of returning for a new one its still a good product regardless of its damage</li>
            <li>Pretty good...</li>
            <li>I am pretty fair skinned and this works for me if I&#x27;m going for a heavier makeup look</li>
            <li>It arrived fairly quick and in one piece, which I can&#x27;t say for its accompanying order - despite the package lacking bubble wrap or some kind of protective support.</li>
            <li>This is a very good blush , it last all day .</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin,  Hazel eyes and dyed medium red hair</li>
            <li>Very suddle yet a gorgeous blush</li>
            <li>Good value for money, really cant fault it.</li>
            <li>They are nicely pigmented (but not over the top, so much so that you can&#x27;t use them...</li>
            <li>Blends easy and lasts throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too easy to pick up with a brush.</li>
            <li>So I bought one and decided I&#x27;d keep my Milani for more special purposes and use this one from e.l.f.</li>
            <li>Light and applies easily.</li>
            <li>I got it to wear it on top of Maybelline bold gold 24 hour eye shadow.</li>
            <li>I love this blush, very pretty peachy hugh.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gorgeous and seems to be more of a highlight than blush with its shimmer and sheer color coverage, even with my medium (light medium, at that) skin tone.</li>
            <li>Very affordable and color pay-off is amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice but very shimmery</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit light in color</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice color, but be prepared -- it&#x27;s very shiny.</li>
            <li>I like the way the light reflects this blush.</li>
            <li>It goes well with my paler skin and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>Application was smooth.</li>
            <li>Okay, not as bright as I expected</li>
            <li>This blush gives you a nice and natural shimmering glow.</li>
            <li>I love this blush, I have almost black hair and fair skinned.</li>
            <li>I feel as if I got a terrific deal on the peachy shade and am quite happy with the subtleness and slight shimmer of this shade on my fair skinned cheeks.</li>
            <li>i use this under my more colorful blush for it&#x27;s shimmer, it really livens up the color.</li>
            <li>It looks really nice on the face and is not too much no matter how much you put on.</li>
            <li>Love this , only thing I would say is I love this as a highlight</li>
            <li>Very pretty color.</li>
            <li>Really pretty!</li>
            <li>Pretty!</li>
            <li>IT is a really pretty blush with a mix of bronzer in it!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>The blush itself is smooth and a pretty color, just wasn&#x27;t quite right for me.</li>
            <li>The color is much much lighter than the picture but that being said I have purchased some ELF items I enjoy just not the &amp;#34;baked&amp;#34; products</li>
            <li>I have light skin, and I was trying to find a nice pink blush to add some color.</li>
            <li>with about a &amp;#34;dime&amp;#34; worth of product in it</li>
            <li>To be honest, I was a fan of Milani Baked blush but one time I left my blush at home and had to borrow from a friend.</li>
            <li>Love the light coral color, it gives my cheeks just enough color with a hint of shimmer.</li>
            <li>Worth what I paid for it.  </li>
            <li>This blush is great for pale skin.</li>
            <li>Anyway, the next day I put this blush on in the morning and said to myself, it&#x27;s perfect and I don&#x27;t need to buy any other.</li>
            <li>When I saw that this product had a generally high rating I figured it would be fine.</li>
            <li>It has just the right about of color, sparkle, and bronze which leaves you glowing.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t break me out, and it was priced just right (cheaper than the ELF website when I bought it here on Amazon).</li>
            <li>It has a beautiful soft peachy pink color.</li>
            <li>I recently went to the MAC store to check out Springsheen, which I heard is a really nice peachy pink with a nice glow.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not really a orangey peach, but more of a peachy pink with a very nice glowy sheen.</li>
            <li>Slight sheen is good but sparkle...</li>
            <li>I probably won&#x27;t use it very much.</li>
            <li>It is very natural looking, and you really would have to try to get too much on, unlike most blushes where if you don&#x27;t tap the excess off you&#x27;re looking like Mrs. Clown.</li>
            <li>Blush was a pretty color, but came cracked in 5+ pieces.</li>
            <li>so I guess I had higher expectations for this product.</li>
            <li>It gives my skin a healthy glow because it has some shimmer mixed in the blush.</li>
            <li>It has hints of gold in the blush which give you a pretty highlight.</li>
            <li>When I get close to running out, if I ever do, I&#x27;ll be coming back to buy more.</li>
            <li>but it is pretty.</li>
            <li>The ELF baked peach blush is a pretty color.  </li>
            <li>and it was pretty inexpensive</li>
            <li>Pretty color.</li>
            <li>, it makes me glow but not too much, I glow in a youthful way!</li>
            <li>Pretty color.</li>
            <li>When I want a little more color I just blend another blush underneath and it works just fine.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really look like the nice pink peace I pictured it being on my skin.</li>
            <li>This product is so cheap and barely comes off on blush brush.</li>
            <li>Love the color, but you may have to apply it several times to get a decent shade.</li>
            <li>Traditional blushes can easily look clownish on my lighter toned skin.  </li>
            <li>It was very affordable and has lasted a long time, already more than 6 months.  </li>
            <li>When I first used it I had to try to get the color on my brush several times, almost like there was a coating on the blush to make sure it didn&#x27;t damage in shipping, but after the first few brush swipes it was fine.</li>
            <li>Wish it would come with a brush, but for the price, it really can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>so I thought a pink color would look better</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t too much shimmer, it&#x27;s really just glowy.</li>
            <li>not so much.</li>
            <li>Not really a blush more like a way</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast though.</li>
            <li>It looked so much like my Milani</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do identify specific attributes (e.g. comfort &amp; fit of a shirt or the battery life of a camera) and whether they met your expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I really like this blush.</li>
            <li>It looked gold and made me very shiny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really a fan of this e.l.f. baked blush color.</li>
            <li>This blush is very pigmented and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Do explain why you liked or disliked this</li>
            <li>Have bought multiple other colors and love them all.... often use as a quick eye shadow as well.</li>
            <li>The peachy color looks really natural and pretty.</li>
            <li>you can normally get this much cheaper at Target though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more golden than in the photo, but the pink color is true.  </li>
            <li>I live the color, shimmer and texture!  </li>
            <li>i must say the person shipping this product had no foresight in wrapping it knowing that powders tend to crumble easily with a bit of rough handling...</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty much exactly the same.  </li>
            <li>The big downside to this product is that it contains methylparaben, which is estrogen mimicker that is absorbed through the skin intact.</li>
            <li>this blush is super cute, very subtle and very summery.....</li>
            <li>, I will look into other colors available.</li>
            <li>I definately recommend this product for anyone looking for a new blush.</li>
            <li>Honestly, if you really want this blush, I would suggest just going to a store and buying it so you can assure that it won&#x27;t be broken.</li>
            <li>Gives a nice subtle glow.</li>
            <li>The shade is very much the same.</li>
            <li>It goes on well with ease and does look very natural.</li>
            <li>Blends in well and most importantly, not tested on animals!</li>
            <li>I really love this blush, I&#x27;ve actually hit pan and have maybe a month or so before it&#x27;s used up (I&#x27;ve been using it daily for a over year, it&#x27;s lasted a long time).</li>
            <li>but I use a very soft brush if you use a stiff brush it would be fine.</li>
            <li>Love that just a little dab can make such an impression.</li>
            <li>With the MAC blush I had to be a little more careful that I didn&#x27;t get too much color on the brush and end up looking like a clown.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper to buy directly from Elf, but bought from here because shipping was only 2 days.</li>
            <li>I feel naturally sunkissed when wearing it.</li>
            <li>It has a soft, long-staying color.  </li>
            <li>so I went ahead and used it and to my surprised</li>
            <li>, i&#x27;s so much like Milani Baked Brush, not just physically.</li>
            <li>and I was surprised by how pigmented it is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and can be applied over and over for the depth of color you want.</li>
            <li>but just as good as the expensive brand highlights</li>
            <li>I love how it looks and have since thrown away all my other brands that were much much more expensive.</li>
            <li>The peachy-pink tone is very lightly pigmented but is also buildable, so you can go for a subtle look or amp it up with a heavier application.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical about the shimmer in it, but it actually gives you a very nice glow.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like blushes that have too much pink it in because in the summer when it gets really hot out</li>
            <li>yet they are high quality  that can stand up next to other high brand names except without the high price.</li>
            <li>My new daily go-to!  </li>
            <li>I would recommend spending a few dollars more for the Milani baked blush, but if you&#x27;re on a budget, this is a buildable rosey pink blush.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like heavy and bold makeup and this fits the bill.</li>
            <li>However, I have a pretty minimal makeup style and try to keep my color looking as natural as possible.  </li>
            <li>I actually like the ELF better not only because of the price, but because its hard to overfill your brush with color.  </li>
            <li>I generally like e.l.f products and thought I might try the baked products.</li>
            <li>Definitely very powdery and since the container is small, the powder doesn&#x27;t really have anywhere to go</li>
            <li>Easy to apply a little for build the color for a brighter pink.  </li>
            <li>I asked her how much was it and was surprised it was half the price of Milani.</li>
            <li>It looks much darker and brighter in person but it does not on as dark as you would expect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit chalky, barely pigmented highlighter, definitely not a blush.</li>
            <li>I usually apply it in two or three rounds to get the right amount of color.  </li>
            <li>it is very pigmented, slight shimmery  peach color which can be used as a blush or a highlighter</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only ever worn pink blush and I wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical because I dont have a good track record with blush</li>

            <li> Beautiful color with a shimmer.....</li>
            <li> beautiful color, great blush.</li>
            <li> Together, they create a perfect rose gold eye look.</li>
            <li> I also started using it as just a blush, and the color looks really great on me.</li>
            <li> These are great</li>
            <li> Works great as a cheek highlighter.</li>
            <li> great color to.</li>
            <li> No flecks of glitter in this product which is great</li>
            <li> This blush works great</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a great plus for me.</li>
            <li> I will most definately be a repeat customer!!</li>
            <li> Its a very nice shade and ads shimmer.</li>
            <li> it provides a very nice looking glow that can be used for the summer time,  even wear it as an eye shadow or just when your running to have a splash of color and glow to your face.</li>
            <li> This coral color is perfect and this blush has no sparkles, just shimmer:)</li>
            <li> I have always had good experiences with E.L.F.</li>
            <li> This blush is great for a nice shimmer on your cheek.</li>
            <li> Good quality.</li>
            <li> It worked just as good and flattered my skin tone just as well.</li>
            <li> For its price, it does a good job.</li>
            <li> Good for fair to medium skin.</li>
            <li> love this blush!</li>
            <li> So glad I have this!</li>

            <li> Lovely color!</li>
            <li> This baked blush is amazing.</li>
            <li> nice color, but received in damaged condition</li>
            <li> Nice blush, just a tad too shimmery for my taste.</li>
            <li> I purchased this blush thinking it would be a nice shimmery peach blush - it&#x27;s not.  </li>
            <li> I am looking at you, Milani!) and give a nice glow to the cheeks.</li>
            <li> Nice blush</li>
            <li> Kind of shimmery though.  </li>
            <li> include promotional content of any kind or reviews written in exchange for compensation.</li>
            <li> The color is nice</li>
            <li> It gives a nice sheen without being overly shimmery.</li>
            <li> I have a VERY light skin complection and this color goes on beautifully, has a light shimmer to it, and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> is really soft and looks so perfect in&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a beautiful color and gives my cheeks a really pretty glow.  </li>
            <li> It give a nice healthy glow.</li>
            <li> The product arrive quickly with a nice personalized card!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for my fair pink toned/pale skin.</li>
            <li> so you really have to build it, but that&#x27;s better than it being too bright!</li>
            <li> It is a great colour and has a nice glow, which really adds to your make up :)</li>
            <li> If you looking for a soft look this is perfect for highlighting your face or to use as your cheek color very very pretty!</li>
            <li> Additionally, it was much more sparkly</li>
            <li> Love this blush just got it today</li>
            <li> placing the item in bubble wrap then the shipping box with more protection may have sufficed</li>
            <li> LOVE.</li>
            <li> so I was pleased.</li>
            <li> I love the E.L.F. products but was dissapointed with this.</li>
            <li> I will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a lovely peach/coral shade that lasts all day on my oily skin.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I really love this blush‚ù§</li>
            <li> I love this blush.  </li>
            <li> This is more of a highlighting blush.  </li>
            <li> I love the color (Peachy Cheeky) and the sparkly glow it leaves on my skin.  </li>
            <li> i love it...</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> I love elf products</li>
            <li> I love this color of blush.  </li>
            <li> love the shimmer and color</li>
            <li> Ehhh, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Love the glittery type glow it gives off.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> gives just ahint of highlight non-over powering unless you want to apply more,..</li>
            <li> The colour iluminate our skin perfectly but the problem is to open the case.</li>
            <li> I really love it.</li>
            <li> For the cheeks I brush the side that has the most peach and apply it, then I brush over the section that has the bronze ribbon and apply it as a highlight.</li>
            <li> I am medium skin toned and this give me a hint of color and lovely glow.</li>
            <li> This blush was way more pinky than peachy.</li>
            <li> I have the baked blush in peachy cheeky and in rich rose.</li>
            <li> has great color and pigmentation.not worth the hassle of returning for a new one its still a good product regardless of its damage</li>
            <li> Pretty good...</li>
            <li> I am pretty fair skinned and this works for me if I&#x27;m going for a heavier makeup look</li>
            <li> It arrived fairly quick and in one piece, which I can&#x27;t say for its accompanying order - despite the package lacking bubble wrap or some kind of protective support.</li>
            <li> This is a very good blush , it last all day .</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin,  Hazel eyes and dyed medium red hair</li>
            <li> Very suddle yet a gorgeous blush</li>
            <li> Good value for money, really cant fault it.</li>
            <li> They are nicely pigmented (but not over the top, so much so that you can&#x27;t use them...</li>
            <li> Blends easy and lasts throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too easy to pick up with a brush.</li>
            <li> So I bought one and decided I&#x27;d keep my Milani for more special purposes and use this one from e.l.f.</li>
            <li> Light and applies easily.</li>
            <li> I got it to wear it on top of Maybelline bold gold 24 hour eye shadow.</li>
            <li> I love this blush, very pretty peachy hugh.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gorgeous and seems to be more of a highlight than blush with its shimmer and sheer color coverage, even with my medium (light medium, at that) skin tone.</li>
            <li> Very affordable and color pay-off is amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice but very shimmery</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit light in color</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice color, but be prepared -- it&#x27;s very shiny.</li>
            <li> I like the way the light reflects this blush.</li>
            <li> It goes well with my paler skin and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> Application was smooth.</li>
            <li> Okay, not as bright as I expected</li>
            <li> This blush gives you a nice and natural shimmering glow.</li>
            <li> I love this blush, I have almost black hair and fair skinned.</li>
            <li> I feel as if I got a terrific deal on the peachy shade and am quite happy with the subtleness and slight shimmer of this shade on my fair skinned cheeks.</li>
            <li> i use this under my more colorful blush for it&#x27;s shimmer, it really livens up the color.</li>
            <li> It looks really nice on the face and is not too much no matter how much you put on.</li>
            <li> Love this , only thing I would say is I love this as a highlight</li>
            <li> Very pretty color.</li>
            <li> Really pretty!</li>
            <li> Pretty!</li>
            <li> IT is a really pretty blush with a mix of bronzer in it!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> The blush itself is smooth and a pretty color, just wasn&#x27;t quite right for me.</li>
            <li> The color is much much lighter than the picture but that being said I have purchased some ELF items I enjoy just not the &amp;#34;baked&amp;#34; products</li>
            <li> I have light skin, and I was trying to find a nice pink blush to add some color.</li>
            <li> with about a &amp;#34;dime&amp;#34; worth of product in it</li>
            <li> To be honest, I was a fan of Milani Baked blush but one time I left my blush at home and had to borrow from a friend.</li>
            <li> Love the light coral color, it gives my cheeks just enough color with a hint of shimmer.</li>
            <li> Worth what I paid for it.  </li>
            <li> This blush is great for pale skin.</li>
            <li> Anyway, the next day I put this blush on in the morning and said to myself, it&#x27;s perfect and I don&#x27;t need to buy any other.</li>
            <li> When I saw that this product had a generally high rating I figured it would be fine.</li>
            <li> It has just the right about of color, sparkle, and bronze which leaves you glowing.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t break me out, and it was priced just right (cheaper than the ELF website when I bought it here on Amazon).</li>
            <li> It has a beautiful soft peachy pink color.</li>
            <li> I recently went to the MAC store to check out Springsheen, which I heard is a really nice peachy pink with a nice glow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really a orangey peach, but more of a peachy pink with a very nice glowy sheen.</li>
            <li> Slight sheen is good but sparkle...</li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t use it very much.</li>
            <li> It is very natural looking, and you really would have to try to get too much on, unlike most blushes where if you don&#x27;t tap the excess off you&#x27;re looking like Mrs. Clown.</li>
            <li> Blush was a pretty color, but came cracked in 5+ pieces.</li>
            <li> so I guess I had higher expectations for this product.</li>
            <li> It gives my skin a healthy glow because it has some shimmer mixed in the blush.</li>
            <li> It has hints of gold in the blush which give you a pretty highlight.</li>
            <li> When I get close to running out, if I ever do, I&#x27;ll be coming back to buy more.</li>
            <li> but it is pretty.</li>
            <li> The ELF baked peach blush is a pretty color.  </li>
            <li> and it was pretty inexpensive</li>
            <li> Pretty color.</li>
            <li> , it makes me glow but not too much, I glow in a youthful way!</li>
            <li> Pretty color.</li>
            <li> When I want a little more color I just blend another blush underneath and it works just fine.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really look like the nice pink peace I pictured it being on my skin.</li>
            <li> This product is so cheap and barely comes off on blush brush.</li>
            <li> Love the color, but you may have to apply it several times to get a decent shade.</li>
            <li> Traditional blushes can easily look clownish on my lighter toned skin.  </li>
            <li> It was very affordable and has lasted a long time, already more than 6 months.  </li>
            <li> When I first used it I had to try to get the color on my brush several times, almost like there was a coating on the blush to make sure it didn&#x27;t damage in shipping, but after the first few brush swipes it was fine.</li>
            <li> Wish it would come with a brush, but for the price, it really can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> so I thought a pink color would look better</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t too much shimmer, it&#x27;s really just glowy.</li>
            <li> not so much.</li>
            <li> Not really a blush more like a way</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast though.</li>
            <li> It looked so much like my Milani</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do identify specific attributes (e.g. comfort &amp; fit of a shirt or the battery life of a camera) and whether they met your expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I really like this blush.</li>
            <li> It looked gold and made me very shiny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really a fan of this e.l.f. baked blush color.</li>
            <li> This blush is very pigmented and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Do explain why you liked or disliked this</li>
            <li> Have bought multiple other colors and love them all.... often use as a quick eye shadow as well.</li>
            <li> The peachy color looks really natural and pretty.</li>
            <li> you can normally get this much cheaper at Target though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more golden than in the photo, but the pink color is true.  </li>
            <li> I live the color, shimmer and texture!  </li>
            <li> i must say the person shipping this product had no foresight in wrapping it knowing that powders tend to crumble easily with a bit of rough handling...</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty much exactly the same.  </li>
            <li> The big downside to this product is that it contains methylparaben, which is estrogen mimicker that is absorbed through the skin intact.</li>
            <li> this blush is super cute, very subtle and very summery.....</li>
            <li> , I will look into other colors available.</li>
            <li> I definately recommend this product for anyone looking for a new blush.</li>
            <li> Honestly, if you really want this blush, I would suggest just going to a store and buying it so you can assure that it won&#x27;t be broken.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice subtle glow.</li>
            <li> The shade is very much the same.</li>
            <li> It goes on well with ease and does look very natural.</li>
            <li> Blends in well and most importantly, not tested on animals!</li>
            <li> I really love this blush, I&#x27;ve actually hit pan and have maybe a month or so before it&#x27;s used up (I&#x27;ve been using it daily for a over year, it&#x27;s lasted a long time).</li>
            <li> but I use a very soft brush if you use a stiff brush it would be fine.</li>
            <li> Love that just a little dab can make such an impression.</li>
            <li> With the MAC blush I had to be a little more careful that I didn&#x27;t get too much color on the brush and end up looking like a clown.  </li>
            <li> Much cheaper to buy directly from Elf, but bought from here because shipping was only 2 days.</li>
            <li> I feel naturally sunkissed when wearing it.</li>
            <li> It has a soft, long-staying color.  </li>
            <li> so I went ahead and used it and to my surprised</li>
            <li> , i&#x27;s so much like Milani Baked Brush, not just physically.</li>
            <li> and I was surprised by how pigmented it is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and can be applied over and over for the depth of color you want.</li>
            <li> but just as good as the expensive brand highlights</li>
            <li> I love how it looks and have since thrown away all my other brands that were much much more expensive.</li>
            <li> The peachy-pink tone is very lightly pigmented but is also buildable, so you can go for a subtle look or amp it up with a heavier application.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the shimmer in it, but it actually gives you a very nice glow.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like blushes that have too much pink it in because in the summer when it gets really hot out</li>
            <li> yet they are high quality  that can stand up next to other high brand names except without the high price.</li>
            <li> My new daily go-to!  </li>
            <li> I would recommend spending a few dollars more for the Milani baked blush, but if you&#x27;re on a budget, this is a buildable rosey pink blush.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like heavy and bold makeup and this fits the bill.</li>
            <li> However, I have a pretty minimal makeup style and try to keep my color looking as natural as possible.  </li>
            <li> I actually like the ELF better not only because of the price, but because its hard to overfill your brush with color.  </li>
            <li> I generally like e.l.f products and thought I might try the baked products.</li>
            <li> Definitely very powdery and since the container is small, the powder doesn&#x27;t really have anywhere to go</li>
            <li> Easy to apply a little for build the color for a brighter pink.  </li>
            <li> I asked her how much was it and was surprised it was half the price of Milani.</li>
            <li> It looks much darker and brighter in person but it does not on as dark as you would expect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit chalky, barely pigmented highlighter, definitely not a blush.</li>
            <li> I usually apply it in two or three rounds to get the right amount of color.  </li>
            <li> it is very pigmented, slight shimmery  peach color which can be used as a blush or a highlighter</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only ever worn pink blush and I wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical because I dont have a good track record with blush</li>
            <li> There was barely any pink when I first applied, and absolutely no color after half an hour.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;Do compare to similar products and share how long you&#x27;ve used this</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last for very long unless i cake it on...</li>
            <li> A little too shiny for an old lady like me.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair with auburn highlights and blue eyes and this blush is complementary for my colors and tones.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pink blush&lt;br</li>
            <li> then I had expected.</li>
            <li> However, that is what I expected with reviews I&#x27;ve read and seen about the product and that is the purpose I want it to fulfill.</li>
            <li> read carefully the size before ordering....</li>
            <li> Waste of money - I won&#x27;t purchase another product from ELF seeing this is my second shipment of makeup from them that I am disapointed with.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s shimmery...not too pigmented with pink.</li>
            <li> The pink color was nonexistent all it did</li>
            <li> , I use this and the passion pink e.l.f.</li>
            <li> I tried it and wore it for the night and my impression of it was that it had a bit too much pink in it for my liking.</li>
            <li> my cheeks get pink and flushed anyway...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite pale and have yellow undertone to my skin</li>
            <li> Extremely dissapoonted.</li>
            <li> I will never use any other blush again...</li>
            <li> so I have to be very careful with blushes.</li>
            <li> It is not super orange, nor is it too pink.</li>
            <li> A little too pink for me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to purchase some products online when you can&#x27;t physically see them.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t get dark by any stretch, but it will build.</li>
            <li> Yes they have a slight sheen, but not gaudy shimmer.</li>
            <li> I compare ELF&#x27;s baked to Laura Geller&#x27;s baked blushes and it is almost equal,but much less money than Laura Geller&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> It is not super pigmented which gives you the ability to build up the color</li>
            <li> too flaky, glittery mess of a highlighter.</li>
            <li> It just takes a little effort to load the brush.</li>
            <li> It was a little to shiny for me - with the color being so pale on my darker skin tone, it just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my everyday blush now.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> nearly everyday.</li>
            <li> This is a bit shimmery, but not in a childish way.  </li>
            <li> for everyday use.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve learned to use less than I usually would and then blend it with a face brush.</li>
            <li> Slight highlighter effect!</li>
            <li> so I usually just blow away the residue before covering my brush.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t seem to me that it had to excessive flyaway</li>
            <li> Staple blush in my everyday routine!</li>
            <li> It is a little shiny which is hard to see in the photos - and goes on thick</li>
            <li> Hard to see the color...</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> but when i did get it it was broken up so badly....</li>
            <li> I am no spring chicken</li>
            <li> but this one has broken that bad streak!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very difficult</li>
            <li> I never post reviews but this product was absolutely horrible!</li>

            <li> I like it it&#x27;s pink blush&lt;br /&gt;But then when it hits sun it&#x27;s like pink/bronze&lt;br /&gt;üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè</li>
            <li> nice color, but received in damaged condition</li>
            <li> I have light skin, and I was trying to find a nice pink blush to add some color. I was dissatisfied with this blush. It didn&#x27;t work at all for me. There was barely any pink when I first applied, and absolutely no color after half an hour. Additionally, it was much more sparkly then I had expected. When I saw that this product had a generally high rating I figured it would be fine. I regret this purchase and I&#x27;ve been swatching it on my friends&#x27; skin to find out who I could possibly give it to...</li>
            <li> Love this blush just got it today its beautiful &amp; pigment i use it as a highlight it comes off as gold on my skin. i give it a 5/5</li>
            <li> Very suddle yet a gorgeous blush</li>
            <li> Very pretty color. Definitely very powdery and since the container is small, the powder doesn&#x27;t really have anywhere to go so I usually just blow away the residue before covering my brush. It is a little shiny which is hard to see in the photos - and goes on thick so I&#x27;ve learned to use less than I usually would and then blend it with a face brush.</li>
            <li> Nice blush, just a tad too shimmery for my taste.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY! Blush was a pretty color, but came cracked in 5+ pieces. Extremely dissapoonted. Honestly, if you really want this blush, I would suggest just going to a store and buying it so you can assure that it won&#x27;t be broken.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product hoping to actually get to use it but when i did get it it was broken up so badly....i must say the person shipping this product had no foresight in wrapping it knowing that powders tend to crumble easily with a bit of rough handling...placing the item in bubble wrap then the shipping box with more protection may have sufficed</li>
            <li> Great color! Slight highlighter effect! Great summer blush!</li>
            <li> I have a VERY light skin complection and this color goes on beautifully, has a light shimmer to it, and lasts all day. I did not buy it from here as ALL E.L.F. Cosmetics are way cheaper on there website. LOVE.</li>
            <li> I purchased ELF Peachy Cheeky and MAC Petal Power at the same time to try them out.  The colors are pretty much exactly the same.  I actually like the ELF better not only because of the price, but because its hard to overfill your brush with color.  I usually apply it in two or three rounds to get the right amount of color.  With the MAC blush I had to be a little more careful that I didn&#x27;t get too much color on the brush and end up looking like a clown.  However, I have a pretty minimal makeup style and try to keep my color looking as natural as possible.  The big downside to this product is that it contains methylparaben, which is estrogen mimicker that is absorbed through the skin intact.</li>
            <li> i use this under my more colorful blush for it&#x27;s shimmer, it really livens up the color. it didn&#x27;t seem to me that it had to excessive flyaway so I was pleased. It set well and lasted all day.</li>
            <li> I love the E.L.F. products but was dissapointed with this. I am very fair with a redish complexion so I have to be very careful with blushes. I have always had good experiences with E.L.F. so I guess I had higher expectations for this product. It doesn&#x27;t show up at all!! And on me, EVERYTHING shows up...&lt;br /&gt;May not buy this product again but will buy the E.L.F. line</li>
            <li> Love that just a little dab can make such an impression. Wish it would come with a brush, but for the price, it really can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> It arrived fairly quick and in one piece, which I can&#x27;t say for its accompanying order - despite the package lacking bubble wrap or some kind of protective support. It&#x27;s gorgeous and seems to be more of a highlight than blush with its shimmer and sheer color coverage, even with my medium (light medium, at that) skin tone. However, that is what I expected with reviews I&#x27;ve read and seen about the product and that is the purpose I want it to fulfill.</li>
            <li> Very affordable and color pay-off is amazing. I just wish it lasted on longer. I will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> read carefully the size before ordering....this is about the size of a 50 cent piece....with about a &amp;#34;dime&amp;#34; worth of product in it</li>
            <li> This blush is great for a nice shimmer on your cheek. But it does leave &amp;#34;sparkles&amp;#34; and look shimmery on your face. When i apply it with a brush i get shimmer on my hands. It&#x27;s nice but very shimmery</li>
            <li> I generally like e.l.f products and thought I might try the baked products. I&#x27;m quite pale and have yellow undertone to my skin so I thought a pink color would look better but I was wrong. The peachy color looks really natural and pretty. It gives my skin a healthy glow because it has some shimmer mixed in the blush. It&#x27;s my everyday blush now. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this color if you&#x27;re tan or darker because it probably show. It might work as a highlighter.</li>
            <li> I really love this blush, I&#x27;ve actually hit pan and have maybe a month or so before it&#x27;s used up (I&#x27;ve been using it daily for a over year, it&#x27;s lasted a long time). I have the shade Peachy Cheeky and it&#x27;s a lovely peach/coral shade that lasts all day on my oily skin. There isn&#x27;t too much shimmer, it&#x27;s really just glowy. Only con is that the lid broke off like a month ago. Since it&#x27;s almost used up I don&#x27;t mind. I apply this with the ELF stipple brush and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> If you looking for a soft look this is perfect for highlighting your face or to use as your cheek color very very pretty!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite. I got it to wear it on top of Maybelline bold gold 24 hour eye shadow. Together, they create a perfect rose gold eye look. I also started using it as just a blush, and the color looks really great on me. I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!! I was a little skeptical because I dont have a good track record with blush but this one has broken that bad streak! It has just the right about of color, sparkle, and bronze which leaves you glowing. I feel naturally sunkissed when wearing it. It looks really nice on the face and is not too much no matter how much you put on. When I want a little more color I just blend another blush underneath and it works just fine. I definately recommend this product for anyone looking for a new blush. I will most definately be a repeat customer!!</li>
            <li> This product is so cheap and barely comes off on blush brush. It doesn&#x27;t transfer well at all onto the face. It says baked- well it&#x27;s baked to the point you can&#x27;t use it unless you get a chisel and spacel it on your face. Waste of money - I won&#x27;t purchase another product from ELF seeing this is my second shipment of makeup from them that I am disapointed with.</li>
            <li> Staple blush in my everyday routine!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this product.  It is a great colour and has a nice glow, which really adds to your make up :)</li>
            <li> arrived cracked . has great color and pigmentation.not worth the hassle of returning for a new one its still a good product regardless of its damage</li>
            <li> Really pretty! Love this , only thing I would say is I love this as a highlight not a blush it&#x27;s shimmery...not too pigmented with pink.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color however does not show on my skin.</li>
            <li> I feel as if I got a terrific deal on the peachy shade and am quite happy with the subtleness and slight shimmer of this shade on my fair skinned cheeks. I have dark brown hair with auburn highlights and blue eyes and this blush is complementary for my colors and tones. Came well packaged and timely. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I purchased this blush thinking it would be a nice shimmery peach blush - it&#x27;s not.  It&#x27;s a bit chalky, barely pigmented highlighter, definitely not a blush. It seems to be the same formula as their baked eyeshadow</li>
            <li> Pretty good...I like it ....I use it to highlight though not as blush ....I don&#x27;t think I would like it for blush ....but just as good as the expensive brand highlights</li>
            <li> I have the baked blush in peachy cheeky and in rich rose. I adore them. I am planning on going to the elf website and getting the rest in this line. They are nicely pigmented (but not over the top, so much so that you can&#x27;t use them... I am looking at you, Milani!) and give a nice glow to the cheeks. Yes they have a slight sheen, but not gaudy shimmer. I am no spring chicken anymore so I can&#x27;t be walking around like a fairy farted on my cheeks! Slight sheen is good but sparkle... not so much. These are great and I&#x27;ve been reaching for them exclusively ever since I purchased them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is that the Amazon prices tend to be a lot steeper than on the elf website. But amazon is so dang convenient! But if it is a deal you are looking for... definitely go to the elf website.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only ever worn pink blush and I wanted to try something new. So, I bought this. This coral color is perfect and this blush has no sparkles, just shimmer:)</li>
            <li> I will never use any other blush again... you can normally get this much cheaper at Target though. I love how it looks and have since thrown away all my other brands that were much much more expensive. Have bought multiple other colors and love them all.... often use as a quick eye shadow as well.</li>
            <li> Its a very nice shade and ads shimmer.</li>
            <li> I really love this blush‚ù§is really soft and looks so perfect in&lt;br /&gt;My skin i recommend this product is awesome</li>
            <li> I would recommend spending a few dollars more for the Milani baked blush, but if you&#x27;re on a budget, this is a buildable rosey pink blush.</li>
            <li> The color is beautiful...no glitter...but it doesn&#x27;t last for very long unless i cake it on...and if i cake it on i look like a clown so i choose to just reapply before going out at night.</li>
            <li> beautiful color, great blush.</li>
            <li> This baked blush is amazing. It doesn&#x27;t make my skin itchy and I don&#x27;t have to re-apply over and over.</li>
            <li> I adore E.L.F. product  they are inexpensive products yet they are high quality  that can stand up next to other high brand names except without the high price. Very good product I bought the Baked Blush in Peachy Cheeky it is very pigmented, slight shimmery  peach color which can be used as a blush or a highlighter it provides a very nice looking glow that can be used for the summer time,  even wear it as an eye shadow or just when your running to have a splash of color and glow to your face.</li>
            <li> Light and applies easily. Works great as a cheek highlighter. Doesn&#x27;t break me out, and it was priced just right (cheaper than the ELF website when I bought it here on Amazon).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit light in color so you really have to build it, but that&#x27;s better than it being too bright!</li>
            <li> Pretty! Gives a nice subtle glow.</li>
            <li> I love this blush.  It is a beautiful color and gives my cheeks a really pretty glow.  It has hints of gold in the blush which give you a pretty highlight.</li>
            <li> I like this one a lot.  Traditional blushes can easily look clownish on my lighter toned skin.  This is more of a highlighting blush.  The peachy-pink tone is very lightly pigmented but is also buildable, so you can go for a subtle look or amp it up with a heavier application.  It won&#x27;t get dark by any stretch, but it will build.</li>
            <li> Not really a blush more like a way too flaky, glittery mess of a highlighter. The color is much much lighter than the picture but that being said I have purchased some ELF items I enjoy just not the &amp;#34;baked&amp;#34; products</li>
            <li> Waste of money. Very low quality product. Not pigmented at all, cant even see it. Shipping was fast though.</li>
            <li> I love the color (Peachy Cheeky) and the sparkly glow it leaves on my skin.  Easy to apply a little for build the color for a brighter pink.  Good quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice color, but be prepared -- it&#x27;s very shiny.</li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t beat this purchase! IT is a really pretty blush with a mix of bronzer in it! Perfect glow! The product arrive quickly with a nice personalized card!</li>
            <li> This is a very good blush , it last all day . great color to.</li>
            <li> I like the way the light reflects this blush. It give a nice healthy glow.</li>
            <li> I never post reviews but this product was absolutely horrible! When it came there were cracks throughout the blush itself then when I tried to apply it it literally showed nothing on my face. I even tried adding water to the brush and nothing helped. The pink color was nonexistent all it did was add some shimmer. Learn from my mistake and DON&#x27;T buy this product!</li>
            <li> i love it... just a bit of shimmer</li>
            <li> Nice blush, I use this and the passion pink e.l.f. nearly everyday. Good value for money, really cant fault it.</li>
            <li> Too shimmery, not that peachy. Doesn&#x27;t transfer to the brush well either.</li>
            <li> I love this. It goes well with my paler skin and goes on smooth. Much cheaper to buy directly from Elf, but bought from here because shipping was only 2 days.</li>
            <li> My new daily go-to!  This is a bit shimmery, but not in a childish way.  It has a soft, long-staying color.  It travels (and falls) well without breaking as I found out.  It was very affordable and has lasted a long time, already more than 6 months.  When I get close to running out, if I ever do, I&#x27;ll be coming back to buy more.</li>
            <li> Hard to see the color...but it is pretty. Kind of shimmery though.  I love elf products but I doubt I&#x27;ll repurchase this.</li>
            <li> I love this color of blush.  It&#x27;s a little more golden than in the photo, but the pink color is true.  It shimmers but the shimmer doesn&#x27;t spread or flake throughout the day.  When I first used it I had to try to get the color on my brush several times, almost like there was a coating on the blush to make sure it didn&#x27;t damage in shipping, but after the first few brush swipes it was fine.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I was a fan of Milani Baked blush but one time I left my blush at home and had to borrow from a friend. She had this. It looked so much like my Milani so I went ahead and used it and to my surprised, i&#x27;s so much like Milani Baked Brush, not just physically. It worked just as good and flattered my skin tone just as well. The shade is very much the same. I asked her how much was it and was surprised it was half the price of Milani. So I bought one and decided I&#x27;d keep my Milani for more special purposes and use this one from e.l.f. for everyday use.</li>
            <li> A little too pink for me.  I like the way it goes on.</li>
            <li> Do explain why you liked or disliked this product.&lt;br /&gt;Do compare to similar products and share how long you&#x27;ve used this product.&lt;br /&gt;Do identify specific attributes (e.g. comfort &amp; fit of a shirt or the battery life of a camera) and whether they met your expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t describe your seller or shipping experience (you can do that at amazon.com/feedback).&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t include promotional content of any kind or reviews written in exchange for compensation.</li>
            <li> I have this in Peachy Cheeky and I was surprised by how pigmented it is. It is a perfect shade for the summer. I was skeptical about the shimmer in it, but it actually gives you a very nice glow.</li>
            <li> love the shimmer and color you get with this product the color is not to over powering and the shimmer is just enough so u dont feel like you are out a night club.</li>
            <li> I really like this blush. It&#x27;s soft and can be applied over and over for the depth of color you want.</li>
            <li> Love the light coral color, it gives my cheeks just enough color with a hint of shimmer. Blends easy and lasts throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really look like the nice pink peace I pictured it being on my skin. It looked gold and made me very shiny. I wore it for my graduation. I probably won&#x27;t use it very much.</li>
            <li> The color is nice I just need to apply it several times before I see a difference but I use a very soft brush if you use a stiff brush it would be fine.</li>
            <li> The ELF baked peach blush is a pretty color.  I compare ELF&#x27;s baked to Laura Geller&#x27;s baked blushes and it is almost equal,but much less money than Laura Geller&#x27;s.  If you are watching your costs, try some of the ELF products.</li>
            <li> Ehhh, it&#x27;s ok. It&#x27;s not too easy to pick up with a brush. But it is a beautiful color. It just takes a little effort to load the brush.</li>
            <li> Love the glittery type glow it gives off. Worth what I paid for it.  Just as described. I love it</li>
            <li> Okay, not as bright as I expected</li>
            <li> It was a little to shiny for me - with the color being so pale on my darker skin tone, it just didn&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s hard to purchase some products online when you can&#x27;t physically see them. The blush itself is smooth and a pretty color, just wasn&#x27;t quite right for me.</li>
            <li> this blush is super cute, very subtle and very summery.....gives just ahint of highlight non-over powering unless you want to apply more,..great price awesome blush</li>
            <li> This blush is great for pale skin. It is very natural looking, and you really would have to try to get too much on, unlike most blushes where if you don&#x27;t tap the excess off you&#x27;re looking like Mrs. Clown. This will definitely be my go-to, I&#x27;m considering order a lifetime supply just in case they discontinue!</li>
            <li> This blush is definetly not pigmented enough to be a blush, but I already knew this before purchasing. I specifically bought this as a hilighter. For its price, it does a good job. It gives a nice sheen without being overly shimmery.</li>
            <li> The colour iluminate our skin perfectly but the problem is to open the case. It&#x27;s very difficult and I broke my nail twice.</li>
            <li> Its not pigmented at alllllll....</li>
            <li> Shipping took forever.. The item I received is not what it shows in the picture.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color with a shimmer.....love this blush!</li>
            <li> I ordered this blush to try it out. So glad I have this! I really love it. It gives me a peachy glow to my cheeks. It&#x27;s not really a orangey peach, but more of a peachy pink with a very nice glowy sheen. No flecks of glitter in this product which is great and it&#x27;s not overly shimmery...just perfect. The blush I received has a bronze ribbon color that runs through it. For the cheeks I brush the side that has the most peach and apply it, then I brush over the section that has the bronze ribbon and apply it as a highlight. I am medium skin toned and this give me a hint of color and lovely glow. I recently went to the MAC store to check out Springsheen, which I heard is a really nice peachy pink with a nice glow. I tried it and wore it for the night and my impression of it was that it had a bit too much pink in it for my liking. I don&#x27;t like blushes that have too much pink it in because in the summer when it gets really hot out my cheeks get pink and flushed anyway...and I don&#x27;t want a blush to add to that. Anyway, the next day I put this blush on in the morning and said to myself, it&#x27;s perfect and I don&#x27;t need to buy any other. Since I like this product and it was pretty inexpensive, I will look into other colors available.</li>
            <li> Pretty color. Goes on well. It looks much darker and brighter in person but it does not on as dark as you would expect. I am pretty fair skinned and this works for me if I&#x27;m going for a heavier makeup look</li>
            <li> This blush gives you a nice and natural shimmering glow. It goes on well with ease and does look very natural. I don&#x27;t like heavy and bold makeup and this fits the bill. Just a hint of color. I have very fair skin,  Hazel eyes and dyed medium red hair and I like how this looks. I will buy this brand again and try another color.</li>
            <li> I live the color, shimmer and texture!  4 came in one box so the price was great! Would buy more!</li>
            <li> I love this blush, very pretty peachy hugh. Good for fair to medium skin.</li>
            <li> I love elf products! Very great product for a great price. I love this blush, I have almost black hair and fair skinned. This blush works great, it makes me glow but not too much, I glow in a youthful way! Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really a fan of this e.l.f. baked blush color. It has a beautiful soft peachy pink color. It is not super orange, nor is it too pink. It&#x27;s perfect for my fair pink toned/pale skin. Application was smooth. It is not super pigmented which gives you the ability to build up the color however deep you&#x27;d like it. That&#x27;s a great plus for me.</li>
            <li> Pretty color. A little too shiny for an old lady like me.</li>
            <li> Love the color, but you may have to apply it several times to get a decent shade. Otherwise a great blush!</li>
            <li> This blush is very pigmented and lasts all day. I love it!</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite blush! Blends in well and most importantly, not tested on animals!</li>
            <li> This blush was way more pinky than peachy.</li>
            <li> Lovely color! Fast shipping!! Thank-you!!</li>
