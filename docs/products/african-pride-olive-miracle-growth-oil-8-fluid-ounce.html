    <ol>
            <li>For me, this product works the best after I sweat at the gym.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s perfect for sealing in moisture after I wash and condition my hair and before I</li>
            <li>Smells awesome, I don&#x27;t know</li>
            <li>how well it&#x27;s doing in regards to growth, but it does keep my scalp oiled and smelling exquisite.</li>
            <li>It lingers and make my hair smell awesome.</li>
            <li>This is without a doubt the best hair product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this!!!  </li>
            <li>I had to order some more of this and can&#x27;t wait until it gets here!!!</li>
            <li>&amp; it smells good.!</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>but I was in Europe during the winter time which greatly differs climate-wise from the California Bay Area that I&#x27;m in now.</li>
            <li>it also makes my hair shine &amp; seems to be keeping my scalp happy.</li>
            <li>This smells so good.</li>
            <li>It is also a good oil.</li>
            <li>Excellent product and light weight.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s soooo good.</li>
            <li>I have always loved the smell of this oil.</li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with its performance.</li>
            <li>love this stuff!</li>
            <li>however, I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>This product,and many non-organic products like it contain silicones and parabens!</li>
            <li>And for the granola set, since it contains \\&quot;bad\\&quot; ingredients, just make your own.  </li>
            <li>but honestly they have its place.  </li>
            <li>honestly I feel like that is just a gimmick.  </li>
            <li>I used the Olive Miracle growth oil on my hair, scalp and am not sure if it does grow faster but my hair looks great and the best thing about this formula is its smell....</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it contains many great oils, but I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li>I just started using it so no update on growth or healthy results, I&#x27;ll post in 30 days to this post.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s lightweight not heavy and incredible smell.</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>Love the smell</li>
            <li>I have felt a better change.</li>
            <li>Again, I hope this review can assist someone! :)</li>
            <li>I love this oil.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>It has stopped breakage and I love the smell.</li>
            <li>I love how it feels.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this oil and use it reguarly for my edges and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I wish the paraben activists/&amp;#34;purists&amp;#34; would do their homework on which parabens are the most harmful and how they&#x27;re harmful before writing off any product that has any mention of ___paraben in the ingredient list.</li>
            <li>I wish the paraben activists/&amp;#34;purists&amp;#34; would do their homework on which parabens are the most harmful and how they&#x27;re harmful before writing off any product that has any mention of ___paraben in the ingredient list.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, I love mixing this oil with raw shea butter to create my own mixture that smells so wonderful.</li>
            <li>Good oil but really 10 dollars ?</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I first received this product as I had read some really good reviews on it.</li>
            <li>growth oil smells so sweet like candy!</li>
            <li>so it gets cleansed out easily with washing.</li>
            <li>This oil is designed to keep hair follicles strong, however it can clog your pores and your scalp will itch if applied.</li>
            <li>When I read the ingredients, I was impressed by the number of natural ingredients it contained (granted it is not all natural</li>
            <li>It looked cheap and garish and nothing in that line appealed to me.  </li>
            <li>I  use it for my hair, a lot more during the winter time to calm my frizzy hair</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and manageable, isn&#x27;t greasy and smells really good.</li>
            <li>I bought it as a hot oil treatment and I&#x27;m glad I gave it a chance even though the bottle looked cheap,the results were not.</li>
            <li>One or more of the ingredients attracts dirt, so you&#x27;ll have to wash your hair more frequently.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used both with flat ironing and loved the results there as well.</li>
            <li>still give this product 5 stars and while I can&#x27;t say that this in particular aids in the growth of my hair I will say that while using it my hair does look and feel healthy and my growth has not been stunted.</li>
            <li>I use a dime size amount on my ends &amp; wrap my hair at night &amp; my hair is straight and smooth for work in the morning.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will admit that this is probably a deadly cocktail for those who have allergic reactions to one or more ingredient (add any form of peanut in this bottle and your child would probably be effectively banned for the school year</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t nearly as likely to leave my hair greasy or weigh it down as many hair oils are prone to do in high amounts and soaks in to my hair and even my skin very quickly and well, but still does a great job at sealing and nourishing the strands.</li>
            <li>If this stuff is actually worth close to ten bucks, I should stock on more...</li>
            <li>What I liked about it so far is that it leaves my hair soft and moisturized and it appears to encourage curl definition.  </li>
            <li>However since it was so cheap, I don&#x27;t have too many regrets about buying it in the first place.</li>
            <li>*)</li>
            <li>In the meantime, I have to do some of the extras from time to time to make my hair cooperate, like hot oil treatments, chelating treatments, etc.  </li>
            <li>omg it made my hair grow fast !</li>
            <li>I will first say emphasis on the \\&quot;For Me!\\&quot;...</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m aware this isn&#x27;t the intended use</li>
            <li>I do scalp massages with it, hot oil, and use it to seal.</li>
            <li>Sally does offer a much better price than the urban beauty supply stores, which did surprise me.</li>
            <li>But the flaw I find is that the lid doesn&#x27;t stay sealed, so this container is definitely not travel friendly and you need to clean around the openings of the bottle to avoid attracting dust.  </li>
            <li>The effects last all day, and it does a great job at reducing breakage from combing even when used on dry hair.</li>
            <li>Okay i have some pretty dry hair and this stuff is like water.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know WHAT cause me to do my face this way, more than likely personal trial and error, but my honey even thinks that I&#x27;m wearing make up because my face looks sooo smooth</li>
            <li>This smell is so great and makes my skin feel so soft and works much better than any expensive lotion.</li>
            <li>Most  people disown sulfate shampoos because they dry your hair out,but if you are using silicone based products a co-wash or sulfate-free shampoo will not remove the excess oils/dirt.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find it overly greasy as some products I&#x27;ve used in the past and most importantly</li>
            <li>Start using 100% pure products or products without silcones,parabens,and mineral oil/petroleum.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like any other hair oil, but it has a wonderful aroma and this is what makes it unlike any other oil I&#x27;ve used thus far</li>
            <li>so seeing tiny hairs fall hurts but in the end it worked fine.</li>
            <li>And that held true until about two or three weeks ago when I was browsing through the major drugstore clearance shelves and found this beauty for something that was cheaper than bus fare in my city.  </li>
            <li>It dispenses the oil well, meaning you can control how much you want but be mindful of the pressure you apply on the bottle.  </li>
            <li>but then again I don&#x27;t use much of this product.  </li>
            <li>Silicones clog your scalp much like mineral oil.</li>
            <li>I use this in conjunction with the leave in conditioner for my coarse, high porosity, baby fine, 3b curly hair.</li>
            <li>I am familiar with the brand African Pride for about 10 to 20 years</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s likely added to boost the product&#x27;s ability to protect against free radicals and/or withstand high humidity.</li>
            <li>I have fine, wavy, long hair.</li>
            <li>But after about 3 uses, the sickly sweet smell was simply too much for me.</li>
            <li>Let me first say that I bought this wonderful stuff at Dollar General for a measly $2.75.</li>
            <li>I wash my hair then moisturize and put this stuff on top and on my scalp (not often, only when I feel I personally need it...)</li>
            <li>The protein content is sufficient enough that I no longer have to do 2x weekly protein treatments, and since I started using these products, I&#x27;ve been able to leave off the weekly deep conditioning treatments completely.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend if you have a relaxer</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s normal for my type of hair texture, which happens to me if I don&#x27;t wash my hair after 7 days, but with this product, I have to wash it twice a week....</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and its very cheap!</li>
            <li>I use this mixture mainly for my natural hair and also on my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>on topic: I purchased it and used it several times as a pre-shampoo hot oil treatment.  </li>
            <li>My first review of this was May 21st 2013..</li>
            <li>but right now my morning skin care regimen consists of cleansing my face with alcohol pads, patting it dry, putting this oil on, then wiping off the excess...</li>
            <li>The night before I wash &amp; deep condition or before my trip to the salon I will use a little more.</li>
            <li>I must say that I am surprised that I even tried this product at all.  </li>
            <li>I have natural hair</li>
            <li>use it after my natural coconut oil treatment.</li>
            <li>I try to retain as much hair as possible and after this one use I know its something I&#x27;ll be using every shower.</li>
            <li>My hair wad hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li>I only apply it to my hair and avoid applying it to my scalp as much as I can.</li>
            <li>Be very weary when dealing with these commercial products.  </li>
            <li>, it does not break my on-and-off sensitive skin out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is the same as the leave in, very fruity and luscious like something you could eat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My scalp felt moisturized and not tight.</li>
            <li>For those who are too lazy and cheap, like me, continue reading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I discovered this oil at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply, which I don&#x27;t normally shop in, but I wasn&#x27;t in an urban area at the time of purchase.</li>
            <li>Since I wear my hair out, it is exposed to the sun, which gradually destroys my fine but thick kinky curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Their danger mainly comes from overuse, not their mere existence alone, and the most major offender for them is deodorant, not hair care products, which is why they&#x27;ve been SPECIFICALLY linked to breast cancer.t</li>
            <li>Their danger mainly comes from overuse, not their mere existence alone, and the most major offender for them is deodorant, not hair care products, which is why they&#x27;ve been SPECIFICALLY linked to breast cancer.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s naturally curly state and occasionally when I want to diverge from using olive oil on my hair after I shampoo and condition my hair to lock in the moisture</li>
            <li>how every my hair is also sensitive and i noticed tiny hairs fall when i rub it in...</li>
            <li>But I am still a big fan and frequent user of African Pride even though my hair is thin and fine</li>

            <li> I wash my hair then moisturize and put this stuff on top and on my scalp (not often, only when I feel I personally need it...)</li>
            <li> The protein content is sufficient enough that I no longer have to do 2x weekly protein treatments, and since I started using these products, I&#x27;ve been able to leave off the weekly deep conditioning treatments completely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you have a relaxer</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s normal for my type of hair texture, which happens to me if I don&#x27;t wash my hair after 7 days, but with this product, I have to wash it twice a week....</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and its very cheap!</li>

            <li> but right now my morning skin care regimen consists of cleansing my face with alcohol pads, patting it dry, putting this oil on, then wiping off the excess...</li>
            <li> The night before I wash &amp; deep condition or before my trip to the salon I will use a little more.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Let me first say that I bought this wonderful stuff at Dollar General for a measly $2.75. If this stuff is actually worth close to ten bucks, I should stock on more...FAST!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This growth oil smells so sweet like candy! I like the fact that it contains many great oils, but I&#x27;m pretty sure there&#x27;s not an equal ratio among them (olive oil, obviously). Nonetheless, I love mixing this oil with raw shea butter to create my own mixture that smells so wonderful. I use this mixture mainly for my natural hair and also on my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I purchased this at one of the local dollar stores for less than $3.  For me, this product works the best after I sweat at the gym.  I use a dime size amount on my ends &amp; wrap my hair at night &amp; my hair is straight and smooth for work in the morning. The night before I wash &amp; deep condition or before my trip to the salon I will use a little more. Since using, I have noticed less breakage and I&#x27;ve seen growth.  Highly recommend if you have a relaxer and you work out.</li>
            <li> This smells so good. It is also a good oil. I find that it will nourish your scalp 100%.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this!!!  I just started using it so no update on growth or healthy results, I&#x27;ll post in 30 days to this post.  But it&#x27;s lightweight not heavy and incredible smell.</li>
            <li> I must say that I am surprised that I even tried this product at all.  I am familiar with the brand African Pride for about 10 to 20 years but I never paid any attention to that line.  It wasn&#x27;t because of the name but the way the packaging looked.  It looked cheap and garish and nothing in that line appealed to me.  And that held true until about two or three weeks ago when I was browsing through the major drugstore clearance shelves and found this beauty for something that was cheaper than bus fare in my city.  When I read the ingredients, I was impressed by the number of natural ingredients it contained (granted it is not all natural but you have to add something to the oils since the go rancid quickly):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;soybean oil, olive fruit oil, wheat germ oil, coconut oil, jojoba oil, grapeseed oil, avocado oil flaxseed oil, horsetail extract, silk amino acids, wheat protein, soybean protein, hydrolyzed oat protein, hydrolyzed vegetable protein pg-propyl silanetriol, phenyl trimethicone, D&amp;C yellow 11, D&amp;C green #6, TBHQ, propylparaben, fragrance, lanolin oil, c12-c14 alkyl benzoate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will admit that this is probably a deadly cocktail for those who have allergic reactions to one or more ingredient (add any form of peanut in this bottle and your child would probably be effectively banned for the school year *lol*) but I have no problems with it.  And for the granola set, since it contains \\&quot;bad\\&quot; ingredients, just make your own.  For those who are too lazy and cheap, like me, continue reading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slightly off topic: I usually avoid products that contains silicone but lately I stopped caring.  My hair is a bit easier to manage when I have a touch of silicones.  I know I know that silicones are bad but honestly they have its place.  Since I wear my hair out, it is exposed to the sun, which gradually destroys my fine but thick kinky curly hair.  In short, silicones protect my hair from heat exposure and daily stresses I encounter when I comb/style myhair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back on topic: I purchased it and used it several times as a pre-shampoo hot oil treatment.  What I liked about it so far is that it leaves my hair soft and moisturized and it appears to encourage curl definition.  Even with my natural shampoo, my hair winds up brittle at times due to the hard water municipal water and I don&#x27;t have the funds to spring for one at the moment, but I will in the future.  In the meantime, I have to do some of the extras from time to time to make my hair cooperate, like hot oil treatments, chelating treatments, etc.  Next time I plan to do a modified Chicoro[sic] pre-shampoo treatment, which includes aloe vera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product comes in a eight fluid ounce bottle, with a snap lid.  It dispenses the oil well, meaning you can control how much you want but be mindful of the pressure you apply on the bottle.  But the flaw I find is that the lid doesn&#x27;t stay sealed, so this container is definitely not travel friendly and you need to clean around the openings of the bottle to avoid attracting dust.  The scent of the oil blend smells like candy, almost like Wonder 8 oil.  So if you hate the smell of that product, then please avoid this one.  On me, the scent does not linger but then again I don&#x27;t use much of this product.  When I wipe off the oil from the body of the bottle, I apply it on my ends at night and in the morning, my hair looks moisturized.  I have not experience any exponential growth but honestly I feel like that is just a gimmick.  I would definitely give this product a try but look around to find a cheaper price.  You can definitely find it cheaper locally or through some online e-tailer.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and light weight.  Love the smell.</li>
            <li> ive had this before, my mom used it.&lt;br /&gt;and omg it made my hair grow fast !&lt;br /&gt;not over night but does give u  couple inches in a month /s.&lt;br /&gt;will keep buying once I run out.&lt;br /&gt;&amp; it smells good.!</li>
            <li> My sister in England actually recommended this product. I have natural hair so I need a lot of moisture..&#x27;i use it after my natural coconut oil treatment. Love the smell</li>
            <li> Softens dry hair and leaves it feeling silky.</li>
            <li> This is on the ethnic hair care section at Sally Beauty Supply, but I still gave it a chance even though I&#x27;m Hispanic. I have fine, wavy, long hair. I bought it as a hot oil treatment and I&#x27;m glad I gave it a chance even though the bottle looked cheap,the results were not. 1 hair came out in the shower!! Not the usual 5-7 hairs. I try to retain as much hair as possible and after this one use I know its something I&#x27;ll be using every shower. My hair detangled like nothing, and it dried fast. My hair wad hydrated and soft. My scalp felt moisturized and not tight. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This oil is designed to keep hair follicles strong, however it can clog your pores and your scalp will itch if applied. I only apply it to my hair and avoid applying it to my scalp as much as I can. My hair is stronger and thicker because of this oil.</li>
            <li> After a few days of use , I would recommend it to the persons with falling hair . I have felt a better change.</li>
            <li> I will first say emphasis on the \\&quot;For Me!\\&quot;...everything works a little different for everybody...however, I love this stuff! I wash my hair then moisturize and put this stuff on top and on my scalp (not often, only when I feel I personally need it...) and it&#x27;s perfect for sealing in moisture after I wash and condition my hair and before I style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another pro about this is it works WONDERS on my skin! Now I&#x27;m aware this isn&#x27;t the intended use so I would do this with caution but right now my morning skin care regimen consists of cleansing my face with alcohol pads, patting it dry, putting this oil on, then wiping off the excess...B.E.A.U.tiful! I don&#x27;t know WHAT cause me to do my face this way, more than likely personal trial and error, but my honey even thinks that I&#x27;m wearing make up because my face looks sooo smooth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well that&#x27;s my review, hopefully it can assist someone! I had to order some more of this and can&#x27;t wait until it gets here!!! :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update 1/2/2014*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just wanted to come back and say that I no longer use this product on my face and (looking back...) I can&#x27;t believe that I EVER did that but I was in Europe during the winter time which greatly differs climate-wise from the California Bay Area that I&#x27;m in now. I do still use this on my hair but I only use it when I straighten my hair and want a bit of moisture without my hair reverting to it&#x27;s naturally curly state and occasionally when I want to diverge from using olive oil on my hair after I shampoo and condition my hair to lock in the moisture (as I stated above).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still give this product 5 stars and while I can&#x27;t say that this in particular aids in the growth of my hair I will say that while using it my hair does look and feel healthy and my growth has not been stunted. Again, I hope this review can assist someone! :)</li>
            <li> Smells awesome, I don&#x27;t know how well it&#x27;s doing in regards to growth, but it does keep my scalp oiled and smelling exquisite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Caucasian but grew up with African-Americans and I always used this brand since I was 13 and it always did wonders for me. About 15 years ago the bottles looked very different. But I am still a big fan and frequent user of African Pride even though my hair is thin and fine it loves this brand. I used the Olive Miracle growth oil on my hair, scalp and am not sure if it does grow faster but my hair looks great and the best thing about this formula is its smell....it&#x27;s soooo good. I  use it for my hair, a lot more during the winter time to calm my frizzy hair but I use it all year long for my skin. This smell is so great and makes my skin feel so soft and works much better than any expensive lotion. Yes, the price on Amazon is ridiculous,  you can buy it at any store for less than $3.</li>
            <li> I have always loved the smell of this oil. It lingers and make my hair smell awesome. it also makes my hair shine &amp; seems to be keeping my scalp happy.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. I have really thick hair such and keep it braided under wigs. I am trying to grow it out. It says its a growth oil and I have seen growth; I think its because the oil is stopping breakage. It makes my hair soft and manageable, isn&#x27;t greasy and smells really good. A little goes a long way and its very cheap! I love this stuff&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 4/20/2014- My first review of this was May 21st 2013..so we are almost to a year. I must say this oil has worked WONDERS. It has stopped breakage and I love the smell. I love how it feels. I do scalp massages with it, hot oil, and use it to seal. I also am determined to believe it is the oil because I haven&#x27;t changed anything to my regimen. But this stuff works wonders. Will keep buying.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like any other hair oil, but it has a wonderful aroma and this is what makes it unlike any other oil I&#x27;ve used thus far</li>
            <li> I wanna start off by saying I got this product for 1.99$ at Dollar General,so 7.95$ is robbery. Second, I wanna say that while this product did work well for me,I have recently learned some horrifying things about its ingredients.  This product,and many non-organic products like it contain silicones and parabens! Silicones clog your scalp much like mineral oil.You will need to wash your hair with a sulfate based shampoo to rid your scalp of the product build-up. Most  people disown sulfate shampoos because they dry your hair out,but if you are using silicone based products a co-wash or sulfate-free shampoo will not remove the excess oils/dirt.And as we know, if those aren&#x27;t removed, your hair will not grow. 2nd) There are parabens in this product. Parabens are said to cause abberations in our glands,and hormones. In addition,parabens are linked to cancer,and found in every breast cancer cell (google it). When we put this oil in our hair, our scalp absorbs it,and the parabens are released into our bloodstream. If you&#x27;re gonna use a product with parabens you must leave it for a short period and wash it out.Be very weary when dealing with these commercial products.  Start using 100% pure products or products without silcones,parabens,and mineral oil/petroleum. I hope this review helped someone. I wish someone told me this before I massaged those cancer causing parabens in my scalp. :( smh.</li>
            <li> Okay i have some pretty dry hair and this stuff is like water. how every my hair is also sensitive and i noticed tiny hairs fall when i rub it in... Im trying to promote growth for Dreads so seeing tiny hairs fall hurts but in the end it worked fine.</li>
            <li> I discovered this oil at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply, which I don&#x27;t normally shop in, but I wasn&#x27;t in an urban area at the time of purchase. I love the smell of this oil and use it reguarly for my edges and moisturizing. I don&#x27;t find it overly greasy as some products I&#x27;ve used in the past and most importantly, it does not break my on-and-off sensitive skin out. I also add this oil to my conditioner for extra moisturizing. I highly recommend this product. Sally does offer a much better price than the urban beauty supply stores, which did surprise me.</li>
            <li> Good oil but really 10 dollars ? Dollar store has it for 3.50.</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with the leave in conditioner for my coarse, high porosity, baby fine, 3b curly hair. I have been very pleased with its performance. It isn&#x27;t nearly as likely to leave my hair greasy or weigh it down as many hair oils are prone to do in high amounts and soaks in to my hair and even my skin very quickly and well, but still does a great job at sealing and nourishing the strands. The effects last all day, and it does a great job at reducing breakage from combing even when used on dry hair. The protein content is sufficient enough that I no longer have to do 2x weekly protein treatments, and since I started using these products, I&#x27;ve been able to leave off the weekly deep conditioning treatments completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is the same as the leave in, very fruity and luscious like something you could eat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used both with flat ironing and loved the results there as well. Shiny and sleek with no evidence of product usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using these products during a time I&#x27;ve been growing my hair out, after my last trim (which followed a period of 4 months without a cut) I only had to lose a half inch off my growth. :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a VERY small amount of silicone in the ingredient list, right next to the food coloring in the ingredient list... small enough that I would call it negligible, especially since I have hair that tends to be VERY sensitive to the drying effects of silicone containing products, so I would definitely notice if there was enough silicone in this to cause issues. Whatever is there is also negligible enough that it doesn&#x27;t cause any build up so it gets cleansed out easily with washing. It&#x27;s likely added to boost the product&#x27;s ability to protect against free radicals and/or withstand high humidity. There is also one paraben here, but it&#x27;s not one of the major offenders and exists in a very small amount as an anti-microbial (preservative)... HIGHLY unlikely you&#x27;re going to get cancer from it, and without it this product would start growing bacteria in no time. I wish the paraben activists/&amp;#34;purists&amp;#34; would do their homework on which parabens are the most harmful and how they&#x27;re harmful before writing off any product that has any mention of ___paraben in the ingredient list. Their danger mainly comes from overuse, not their mere existence alone, and the most major offender for them is deodorant, not hair care products, which is why they&#x27;ve been SPECIFICALLY linked to breast cancer.t this product would start growing bacteria in no time.

Their danger mainly comes from overuse, not their mere existence alone, and the most major offender for them is deodorant, not hair care products, which is why they&#x27;ve been SPECIFICALLY linked to breast cancer.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I first received this product as I had read some really good reviews on it. But after about 3 uses, the sickly sweet smell was simply too much for me. Also, the consistency of it is almost gooey and feels heavy and extremely oily on the hair, yuck. However since it was so cheap, I don&#x27;t have too many regrets about buying it in the first place.</li>
            <li> I ordered this one by mistake. I thought I was ordering the Olive Oil and Clove that another company makes. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, so I&#x27;m not sure about it&#x27;s potential growing ones hair possibilities, but I will tell you this... After you wash your hair and use this, it goes on oily which fattens your hair. One or more of the ingredients attracts dirt, so you&#x27;ll have to wash your hair more frequently. I used to wash my hair once a week, but by day 4 or 5, my scalp begins itching, flaking and shedding....that&#x27;s normal for my type of hair texture, which happens to me if I don&#x27;t wash my hair after 7 days, but with this product, I have to wash it twice a week....It&#x27;s a bit too oily. My hair must not be course enough to use this oil.  Regardless, I paid for it, so I&#x27;ll finish the bottle. I guess all I can say is know your hair texture before buying this product. This product is like using hair grease, something that I can&#x27;t use on my hair because of the same issues.</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt the best hair product I have ever used. And I&#x27;ve bought the expensive Sephora s*** plenty. This product is THEE product.</li>
