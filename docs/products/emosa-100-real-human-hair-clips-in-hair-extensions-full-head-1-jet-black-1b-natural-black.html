            <li>so it was fine..</li>
            <li>overall i have a great experience buying this product</li>
            <li>i took them out of the package and as expected the clips were already on the tracks of the hair and they are sewn in very nicely and neatly and strong.</li>
            <li>First time buying/ using extensions, absolutely fell in love with them!</li>
            <li>I really didnt plan on wasting more than 100 dollars on hair</li>
            <li>After one was about the only thing it was good for was making dreadlocks, which I&#x27;ve done.</li>
            <li>Not bad.  </li>
            <li>one pack into going to look right alone.</li>
            <li>Super long and suuuper soft and surprisingly tthicker</li>
            <li>a nice long length (I never measured them, so I couldn&#x27;t say if they&#x27;re exactly 22\\</li>
            <li>when i first put them in, i thought they felt alright for the price</li>
            <li>and I am pretty tall.</li>
            <li>You get exactly what you pay for.</li>
            <li>The hair extensions were way to thin , I wasn&#x27;t able to blend it in with my own hair , so I haven&#x27;t even worn them once...</li>
            <li>So thanks for nothing ðŸ˜Š have a blessed day</li>
            <li>yes its really thin but its a great deal.</li>
            <li>well they will last and for me I have thin hair so these were perfect for me.</li>
            <li>But I was pleasantly surprised when I first got them &amp; clipped them in.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re</li>
            <li>so it would be decent looking,</li>
            <li>Im planning to wear them until my hair grows a little more</li>
            <li>and i get a little more money</li>
            <li>the hair is so soft and very long and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>Anyway, to keep it shiny, smooth and silky you have to wash it every single week!</li>
            <li>if i had just a few more pieces</li>
            <li>I love these this is my second time ordering them, I had my last one for about 3 months and as long as you treat them</li>
            <li>So far I have had them for 2 weeks</li>
            <li>After all I&#x27;m just adding them to some old extentions.</li>
            <li>people think these are my real hair, unless they&#x27;ve seen me walk around with my short hair.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I thin my hair, so these look nice with it.</li>
            <li>but then quickly realized what a waste of money i dropped on them after i tried styling them.</li>
            <li>I was sure these were going to be pretty bad quality since they&#x27;re so much cheaper than other extensions I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li>&quot; all the way down), and they stay in really well.</li>

            <li> i bought two packs because they are extremely thin. when i first put them in, i thought they felt alright for the price but then quickly realized what a waste of money i dropped on them after i tried styling them. they frizz so easily even with product. even after a wash, it looks like a halloween walmart wig.</li>
            <li> I really loved them! First time buying/ using extensions, absolutely fell in love with them! Blend right in with my hair and are not heavy or uncomfortable what so ever!</li>
            <li> I received my order quickly (less than a week) and the hair extensions were exactly what I expected. The hair care information page provided was also helpful.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I ever buy hair extensions, well I decided to chop off most of my hair since it was mostly damaged. I really hate how I look with short hair so I decided to go for extensions. I really didnt plan on wasting more than 100 dollars on hair so i thought these extensions would be a good choice. Im planning to wear them until my hair grows a little more but I love the way they look! I have thin/wavy hair so they combined perfectly with mine. I also had to dye my hair back to black since it used to be brown. The color of these extensions is jet black, really dark but they look so glamorous. So far I have had them for 2 weeks and i wash them every 3-4 days. They are still in great shape just make sure to use good quality shampoo in order to keep them healthy and looking good (tangle free) I curl them and straighten them and get so many compliments. I would totally recommend this product, you wont regret it! It takes about 3-4 days of shipment but thats good for me. They are long and almost touch my but and I am pretty tall. I am actually considering on buying another pair so I have a curly pair and a straight pair :) BUY!!</li>
            <li> I loved my extensions fully recommended. is the first time I use a suit and my very good. xo xo</li>
            <li> I got it and it looked this but I had to mix it with other hair I has so it would be decent looking, one pack into going to look right alone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what I expected and I&#x27;m so not interested in going through the hassle of returning it. I will never purchase anything like this online ever again So thanks for nothing ðŸ˜Š have a blessed day</li>
            <li> I love these this is my second time ordering them, I had my last one for about 3 months and as long as you treat them well they will last and for me I have thin hair so these were perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Exclente product 100% fine ....</li>
            <li> Not bad.  Super long and suuuper soft and surprisingly tthicker then I was expecting. But not thick enough if u have thick hair but my hair is thin so it was fine..</li>
            <li> Not worth it. The hair came and it was very thin and scraggly. After one was about the only thing it was good for was making dreadlocks, which I&#x27;ve done.</li>
            <li> They are ok. I wasn&#x27;t expecting jesus &#x27; personal extention pack. You get what you pay for. But I&#x27;m pretty happy with them. After all I&#x27;m just adding them to some old extentions.</li>
            <li> It sucks. Too thin. Not even black. Melts when you try to straighten it. Falls out quickly.would not buy again</li>
            <li> I received the extensions and was SOOO happy because they came in a whole month before they were estimated to get here. the shipping was phenomenal. i took them out of the package and as expected the clips were already on the tracks of the hair and they are sewn in very nicely and neatly and strong. the hair is so soft and very long and easy to manage. i have thicker hair so its understandable that 27$ of hair isn&#x27;t going to be quite enough for my hair, but it still looked very good. if i had just a few more pieces im sure it would be perfect. overall i have a great experience buying this product and when i feel i want a more full look for my hair and i get a little more money i will probably buy this same product again to add to was i already have.</li>
            <li> I was sure these were going to be pretty bad quality since they&#x27;re so much cheaper than other extensions I&#x27;ve seen. But I was pleasantly surprised when I first got them &amp; clipped them in.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re a nice long length (I never measured them, so I couldn&#x27;t say if they&#x27;re exactly 22\\&quot; all the way down), and they stay in really well. I layered my extensions to go better with  my hair, &amp; I&#x27;ve been extremely happy to show them off. I thin my hair, so these look nice with it. I suggest two sets for people with thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;Most people think these are my real hair, unless they&#x27;ve seen me walk around with my short hair.&lt;br /&gt;My only problem with them is that since most people don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re extensions, they have a tendency to be careless and they grab and pull on them a lot. After months of the abuse, the string in the clips became loose so I had to fix it. But it was easy and they&#x27;ve stayed strong since.&lt;br /&gt;A friend of mine even said my extensions were just as good as the ones her sisters bought from Sally&#x27;s. She plans to order some from here. :)</li>
            <li> i love it! yes its really thin but its a great deal. if you dont want to pay a lot then dont conplain !!!</li>
            <li> This hair is horrible and disgusting I want a refund and they won&#x27;t give me one. I ordered this hair for homecoming and it&#x27;s way thinner than the pictures and I usually have no problem mixing thinner extenstions in with my semi thick hair when I curl them and these won&#x27;t curl. They are see through even when bunched together and they smell like chemicals. I won&#x27;t EVER buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> I gave this weave two stars because it&#x27;s a good price. You get exactly what you pay for. It looked really good in the package, but after a couple weeks it was frizzy, it matts together, and it&#x27;s nappy! Other people I know have used this weave and they didn&#x27;t have a problem with it. Maybe I just got a bad batch. It happens. Anyway, to keep it shiny, smooth and silky you have to wash it every single week! I don&#x27;t have time for that!</li>
            <li> The hair extensions were way to thin , I wasn&#x27;t able to blend it in with my own hair , so I haven&#x27;t even worn them once... really disappointed</li>
