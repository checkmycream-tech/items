    <ol>
            <li> Love, love, love Thieves foaming hand soap! S</li>
            <li> I bought the three pack of this and absolutely love it.  I put one bottle in each bathroom.  Neither of us caught a cold this winter and I do attribute some of that luck to using Thieves Foaming Handsoap. The product smells great and washes off your hands easily and does not leave a residue.</li>
            <li> The Thieves Foaming Hand Soap arrived very quickly. It was packed very well.&lt;br /&gt;I really like this option, instead of anti-bacterial soap.&lt;br /&gt;It smells great and works beautifully!</li>
            <li> I love this product buyt the cost for this is WAY out there. Smells wonderful (as I expected), but if your on a budget this may not fit!</li>
            <li> I never want to be without it.</li>
            <li> This hand soap arrived a day earlier than expected. Great service. We wash our hands a lot and this soap does not dry out your hands.</li>
            <li> My cousin first introduced me to this product....Since she lives in another state, I was thrilled to be able to get more at Amazon.....WONDERFUL smell...great for guys as well as women.....</li>
            <li> great product with fresh smell; foam until the very end of the bottle (then I just pour what&#x27;s left into the new bottle).  Not as drying as some.</li>
            <li> I love Thieves products. It is healthy, good for the body, clean well and fun to use as a foamed soap. It smells good, too. Happy!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love, love, love this soap.  I discovered it at a friend&#x27;s house.  It was a present from another friend to her.  Each time I was at her house I fell in love with the wonderful smell over and over again.  It felt amazing and left the best smell on my hands. I did some research and discovered the ingredients that made it smell so wonderful also made it a great healthy alternative to antibacterial soap as well.  I always tell people it smells like I imagine Christmas in the far east would smell or the Arabian desert...  I have purchased this soap and given it as gifts and always hear the same thing.  I love, love, love it from the person I gave it to.</li>
            <li> I used this soap at my massage therapist&#x27;s home. She uses nothing but items from this company.  It a wonderful aroma that lingers long after your hands are clean and dry.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Great soap! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> After I used this hand soap, I had to buy their refill bottle.  The smell is what I love, but it&#x27;s perfect for those who are sensitive to chemical products.  There&#x27;s a great story behind the ingredients in all the Thieves products.</li>
            <li> Best soap ever! Smells fab too!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting this soap to feel so good and clean my hands at the same time. It really leaves my hands soft.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product and great price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but it smells great and you know your hands are clean.  I bought it after having read other reviews and I was not disappointed. Previously, Mrs. Meyers Lavendar was my favorite soap.  Led me to purchase their tooth paste and general cleaner.</li>
            <li> As advertised.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Very helpful for cleansing and beneficial for everybody at home!</li>
            <li> Something of value without carcinogens.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap.  They say there is &amp;#34;medicinal&amp;#34; reasons to use this because of the Thieves oil and while I cannot attest to that, I can only surmise that they are correct - I haven&#x27;t been sick since I starting using the soap (?).  I like the smell - not perfummy, but a &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; smell.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This has the most delightful aroma!</li>
