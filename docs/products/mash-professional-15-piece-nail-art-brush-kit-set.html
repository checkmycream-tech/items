            <li>but i was glad to see that mine did .</li>

            <li>I like the case and it looks like it will keep the brushes protected for many years.</li>

            <li>Before even touching a brush, the carrying case was already stuck to the brushes which caused smudging imprints on the brush handles.</li>
            <li>Again, more smudged varnish marks.</li>
            <li>still use and love these brushes.</li>
            <li>I also love the dotting tool that comes with it.</li>
            <li>It will work until I find something better to store them  in.</li>
            <li>I love using these brushes now (though I still use bobby pins from now and then)</li>
            <li>I recieved my item, I love it.</li>

            <li>I love my brush kit set.  </li>
            <li>They worked ok for there price</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it came with everything that was said(and</li>
            <li>I personally love these brushes.</li>
            <li>i love that it came with</li>
            <li>Now I just have to learn to use the brushes correctly :-)</li>
            <li>Satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>I also love the variety of brushes.  </li>
            <li>I have seen better ones...</li>
            <li>She is able to do the fancy things that a salon would charge money for.</li>
            <li>Love these brushes for my nail art.</li>
            <li>Not a problem - more of a cosmetic issue for how the brush looks.</li>
            <li>My Giftee seemed to love it. .</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with the promptness and condition of the item.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love my brush kit</li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>You can find a better set of nail art brushes for cheaper.</li>
            <li>Construction seems OK too.</li>
            <li>I have used most of the brushes just playing around with it.</li>
            <li>And I even don&#x27;t draw good on paper, but with this brushes and youtube tutorials I did great, totally recommended!</li>
            <li>I love this set.</li>
            <li>Okay brushes for the price.  </li>
            <li>but I am more knowledgeable about paint brushes for painting on canvas as opposed to nail art brushes.</li>
            <li>Lots of different sizes, perfect for all kinds of detail work.  </li>
            <li>Overall, great buy!!</li>
            <li>I also bought the nail rhinestones and dotting tools and I could not recommend them more.</li>
            <li>i love the carrying case protects my brushes while they are put away</li>
            <li>Okay</li>
            <li>these brushes are a bit cheap looking, but who cares!</li>
            <li>Looking forward to better nail art now.</li>
            <li>I love how many colors and designs you get though.</li>
            <li>in all this is a good product and worth the price I paid for it.</li>
            <li>The Case looks nice its sturdy and the brushes are secure.</li>
            <li>otherwise i love the brushes and the cute case that it is in.</li>
            <li>am glad a have it</li>
            <li>I had it for about a month before my daughter fell in love with it</li>
            <li>Love that they came in the case.</li>
            <li>i love doing my nails.</li>
            <li>The quality appears to be ok.</li>
            <li>i love the case they come with</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a newbie at nail art, but was getting more adventurous, so decided to invest in some brushes.</li>
            <li>The bristles of the brushes are made extremely cheap!  </li>
            <li>if that&#x27;s what you are buying them for because it will stick to the fibers and harden them up so you won&#x27;t be able to use the brush anymore.</li>
            <li>and I also found that if working with acrylic paint, the more diluted with water the paint is, the better these brushes work for you.</li>
            <li>Through time i will be able to tell.</li>
            <li>like the case it came in, it&#x27;s very easy to carry around and hold all the items.&lt;br /&gt;The quality is OK, I took off one of the plastic covers for the dotter and the hole dotter metal head came off along with the package but was easily fixed.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>so I know she will find this set very useful and add to her nail creativity!</li>
            <li>im excited to start using them ! :)</li>
            <li>They are GREAT quality brushes, and super easy to clean.</li>
            <li>She was pretty impressed by how much comes with this kit, and the quality of each brush.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the ease of these tools, great for first timers or those looking to have fun with nails!</li>
            <li>The quality isn&#x27;t phenomenal but if you are just starting out and want to practice your nail art and find which kind of brushes you prefer it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>It has made my life so much easier in designing my own creations!</li>
            <li>For the price though, this is a pretty good set.</li>
            <li>But the rest of the brushes look pretty good.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it can be hard to find good, quality brushes, but these ones are excellent.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to use them when i got them!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it!!</li>
            <li>Worth the money and produces a professional-like finish!!</li>
            <li>Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to all Dont forget to tip your waiter / Waitress</li>
            <li>Super nice for taking them to my friends houses and doing their nails as well.</li>
            <li>but I suggest the manufacturers to change the painting method or let them dry perfectly before packaging.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this because most the reviews I read were good</li>
            <li>These brushes are great so far!</li>
            <li>I mostly practice right now and havent done much on my own nails.</li>
            <li>The brushes are very light weight and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used the brushes yet, but i&#x27;m super excited to!!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get such a great deal on these brushes!!</li>
            <li>I just recieved this kit about a week ago and so far its been great.</li>
            <li>, now she can paint her nails herself, was a great unexpected gift to her</li>
            <li>It was what I expected and I will be purchasing more things from this company!!!</li>
            <li>I am very happy I chose to purchase this set over the other ones I considered buying.</li>
            <li>These are my first nail art brushes, so I dont have anything to compare them to, but I LOVE these brushes!</li>
            <li>My nail polish case is neatly organized now, AND if I get paint on the pouch it create an \\&quot;artsy\\&quot; look which is cool too!  </li>
            <li>The brushes fall off easily, they don&#x27;t work well with nail polish</li>
            <li>We looked at some easy tutorials on YouTube</li>
            <li>Easy for me to use</li>
            <li>The handles are sturdy and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>:) have fun being creative with these brushes you have no limit.</li>
            <li>The item shipped and was received very quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to wrap them up for traveling.</li>
            <li>by purchasing this set, I am able to do my own nails, and it is much cheaper then going to the shop.  </li>
            <li>Inexpensive and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Arrived very quickly and were just as described.</li>
            <li>the case makes it easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>but this came in the mail the exact date it said and was packed nicely</li>
            <li>They work perfectly and they came a day before expected!!</li>
            <li>I use these with nail polish and with acrylic craft paints to make my designs and they work just fine.  </li>
            <li>all I&#x27;m pretty happy with this purchase and for the price you really can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>The brushes came quickly and I immediately used the dotting tool and the striper brushes!  </li>
            <li>I was pleased to see that this seller ships quickly, my order came in just like shown up online.</li>
            <li>Packaging was more than adequate for protection.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, good quality, inexpensive for home or professional use.</li>
            <li>Overall very satisfied!</li>
            <li>This little set is perfect for the price.</li>
            <li>The case is a huge bonus.</li>
            <li>or they were under a huge amount of heat on their way here.....</li>
            <li>The brushes work great and they are like regular paint brushes, not the cheap bristles but there is one thing that is a problem.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with all the different designs this allows me to do</li>
            <li>Brush case looks and feels extremely cheap, but I guess for $10</li>
            <li>Awww yeeeeh.  </li>
            <li>Im sooo happy to finally recieve my MASH nail tool kit.</li>
            <li>I bought this nail brush for the cheap price and the quantity.</li>
            <li>Others have said the brushes are easy to clean.</li>
            <li>enjoy having them eventhough</li>
            <li>The brushes were easy to clean afterwards, as well.</li>
            <li>It was on Amazon Prime which meant free shipping as well for me.   </li>
            <li>would enjoy this set also.</li>
            <li>but these are to cheaply made to do them with.</li>
            <li>I have been able to do some fun designs.</li>
            <li>and they are easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Cheap kit.</li>
            <li>It is really fantastic</li>
            <li>Ohhh the fun I have been having :)</li>
            <li>A few stray hairs needed to be removed before I used a couple of these brushes, besides that, a great set for the price!  </li>
            <li>Plus, the brushes wouldn&#x27;t come clean easily.</li>
            <li>The longer brushes all came with caps for safe storage and there is a good size range between the various brushes.</li>
            <li>Plus, frequent cleaning will keep them in good condition.</li>
            <li>What I liked is that the case and brushes are decent size, which  make it easy to store anywhere.</li>
            <li>All of the brushes are soft and good quality.</li>
            <li>It comes with so many brushes &amp; the quality looks good enough for me to use to do nail art!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li>My first was zebra stripes!!</li>
            <li>Still very usable!!!</li>
            <li>And it Helps Me TREMENDOUSLY with making perfectly straight lines and cute designs!  </li>
            <li>They arrived early, in good packaging, and they were super cheap.  </li>
            <li>Aside from the great quality of the brushes, the fact that they come nearly organized in a pouch is very convenient too!</li>
            <li>Quick And Easy</li>
            <li>I was really excited to get this</li>
            <li>I bought these brushes about a week ago and was so excited to use them.</li>
            <li>She is excited to use them.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>You can pretty much be sure that I returned this defective item.</li>
            <li>I think a beginner would love these and a seasoned nail tech like me</li>
            <li>There are so many brushes in this kit, I&#x27;m pretty excited to get to using it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use them for my nails, I use them for painting with oil paints on canvas to get into small places and they are wonderful.</li>
            <li>i just got my nail brushes today i was so excited</li>
            <li>love the small tips great for fine detailed designs.</li>
            <li>Happy with purchase, just wish brushes were a little better quality.</li>
            <li>They clean up well with acetone or water depending on if you used paint or polish.</li>
            <li>They clean well with polish remover.</li>
            <li>The paint comes off if you clean it with acetone.</li>
            <li>That was with the free super saver shipping (5-8 days)</li>
            <li>Other then that, the product is good :)</li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t going to be anything special.</li>
            <li>They all came in differnt styles which is good for different styles.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these brushes! :)</li>
            <li>and it seems the dotting tool is the only one that works fairly well.</li>
            <li>A girl frend of mine find its good so far, she likes it, and she jinks its really ok so far</li>
            <li>I love the brushes, they work really well.</li>
            <li>so far the only fault I have come up with is that I would have liked something that tells me what design each brush is good for.</li>
            <li>I can do some cool details.</li>
            <li>Too many tools for her to really know what to do with.</li>
            <li>I loved all the different brushes!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cool .</li>
            <li>Good fir just starting out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all cool.</li>
            <li>Good simple kit, she has used almost all of the brushes and loves it.</li>
            <li>good enough.</li>
            <li>I ordered them after seeing no bad comments...</li>
            <li>Not bad for the cost I guess.</li>
            <li>Love all the brushes and super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>There was a pretty strong smell when I opened the case</li>
            <li>they came quickly and they look like the pictures</li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:mo3GHT0F4IWRAP9]]A quick look at the M.A.S.H Brush Set.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super-fast and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Overall, an excellent product and a purchase I would definitely make again.</li>
            <li>The item came quickly.</li>
            <li>It would be super helpful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Besides what I&#x27;ve said in the video, the shipping on these was extremely quick.</li>
            <li>I have done many new designs on my nails.  </li>
            <li>I was satisfied, until I received the new set of brushes.</li>
            <li>and I gawked at the price at first because it was such a good deal for the number of brushes I was getting.</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;m kind of bummed that I paid the same price for the brushes with the crappy plastic case as everyone who is getting the awesome new black case.</li>
            <li>When I first saw this product I was so eager to purchase it!</li>
            <li>I used them for their intended purpose when I first got them, but now I find myself using them for my paintings!</li>
            <li>exactly everything I need to do my nail artwork!</li>
            <li>/&gt;They looked pretty otherwise, but I got another brand that was only 2-3 dollars more, and those worked better.</li>
            <li>I was pretty excited to get these in the email today.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly new to nail art and am very excited to have these tools.</li>
            <li>The little organizer they come in keeps dust out and is a great way to store them.</li>
            <li>When I opened the clear plastic overwrap the odor was overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>Having so much fun doing one-stroke nail art for my mom</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it for the price I guess.</li>
            <li>Worth the money you spend.</li>
            <li>and they are ALL useful.</li>
            <li>I have had so much fun doing all kinds of designs on my nails with these.</li>
            <li>My brushes seem to be ok: no damage, no shedding so far.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it</li>
            <li>I am having fun with them.</li>
            <li>What fun that was, I had a ton of compliments.</li>
            <li>I love them so far.</li>
            <li>The brushes come in a lovely tri-fold soft leatherette case with two magnetic snaps and the MASH logo on one side.</li>
            <li>but it isnt as good quality as I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>The money you pay for them is well worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m nowhere near a skilled nail tech</li>
            <li>I completely fell in love with these brushes which came in the mail super fast!</li>
            <li>Still, the price is right, and if you get a non-acetone brush cleaner, you&#x27;ll be golden.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>It came quick with Prime, and it look exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>I received these brushes pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>This is a great little set for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>They have fast and friendly service.</li>
            <li>Other than that this is a good product.</li>
            <li>Priced right.</li>
            <li>(didn&#x27;t rate right away)</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t do right work or designs.</li>
            <li>this was pretty exciting to have the right tools.</li>
            <li>The black pouch is really nice and not so huge</li>
            <li>My only issue with the kit is that the pouch had an extremely strong chemical smell!  </li>
            <li>Came in the black case and the brushes in good quality.</li>
            <li>I got this super fast</li>
            <li>Shipped super fast.</li>
            <li>The shipping was super fast</li>
            <li>For what I spent I am extremely satisfied and so is my girlfriend!</li>
            <li>Shipping was also very fast .</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>Mind you, I was very gentle when opening it up.</li>
            <li>price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li>So far the brushes themselves are fine.</li>
            <li>I asked for these as a gift and was so excited to get them, but I&#x27;m new to nail art</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found a use for several of the brushes in  here, and (like most wood-handled brushes), the paint they are covered with dissolves in acetone.</li>
            <li>Love the case and all the different brushes.</li>
            <li>I have bought 3 seperate sets of these brushes, and have ben using the first set for 3 months...</li>
            <li>My teen daughter will love and spend hours designing her nails.  </li>
            <li>When I first got the package I didn&#x27;t even open the kit and metal/bristle top part fell off.</li>
            <li>and I love all the different brush sizes and options.</li>
            <li>Would highly reccommend them!!</li>
            <li>This was one of the first sets I found</li>
            <li>and they make my nail art look so much cleaner and easier!</li>
            <li>so hopefully she will know enough about it to use it appropriately.  </li>
            <li>There are so many different types of brushes in this set.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>My first design with these were mistletoe I also bought rhinestone and the fimo canes from Mash.</li>
            <li>The description of the item is exactly what was received.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Pretty Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li>other than that i love this product!</li>
            <li>Thank You so much!</li>
            <li>I totally recommend it if you want to get creative.</li>
            <li>This is my first brush set.</li>
            <li>It seems like a product that will most likely come in contact with nail polish remover should be resistant to it.</li>
            <li>Even considering shipping it was only around $1 per brush. : )</li>
            <li>very well made !</li>
            <li>First, when I opened the pouch for the first time, the flap covering the brushes was sticking to the handles.  </li>
            <li>the MASH brushes arrived on time and are exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to the nail art game &amp; these brushes are good quality and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Although I loved the variety and quality of the brushes, and the convenient case to store them in, cleaning nail polish off of these babies is no easy task.</li>
            <li>They are easy to clean and dry fast.</li>
            <li>All these items are going to my daughter on Christmas so not sure exactly how the quality is but looks good when I opened the box to wrap the items up.</li>
            <li>anywhere else your looking at 20 dollars for just half of as many as you get!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good deal until you&#x27;re ready to invest in more expensive durable items....</li>
            <li>The black brush case is fantastic it has a slot for every brush and folds up like an envelope so it easily slides into her nail stuff container without taking up a lot of space.</li>
            <li>They might work better if they were not so stiff after i use them (even after I clean them in nail polish remover).</li>
            <li>I was kind of unsure whether to buy these brushes or not by reading reviews that mentioned they didn&#x27;t recieve the black pouch as shown in the picture</li>
            <li>I bought this particular item because I wanted nail art tools to to help me learn how to do nail art without spending a lot of money!</li>
            <li>And they clean beautifully in acetone, but only pure acetone - anything else does not clean them properly.</li>
            <li>They are nice brushes although one drill apart from the stick a little glue an</li>
            <li>Nice little case--nicer than brushes.  </li>
            <li>So far a few of the bristles on the brushes have kind of went astray, but for the price and amount of brushes you get it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>High quality brush and case!</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I use one of the brushes in there as an eyeliner brush for my gel liner, works very well.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and well packed.</li>
            <li>I do really recommend these brushes .</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>The brushes work really well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks alot its a Christmas gift for my wife.</li>
            <li>This really has everything I&#x27;d want for nail art.</li>
            <li>I really have no complaints.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I am very upset with this item.</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t have to wait with the whole return process on mine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve very up set</li>
            <li>very</li>
            <li>I use straight acetone and then dab on a paper towel or pantyliner, I never runt he brush under water.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely buy it again.</li>
            <li>I was extremely gentle.</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves this set</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>They were shipped fast.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>and those brushes is like for real pain not for nail work</li>
            <li>They pair very well with the MASH dotting tool set.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these brushes!</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>The package arrived very quick.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Othere than that they do not stand the test of time very well.</li>
            <li>But the case that they come in is very convenient</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>but hey are not the real mash</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very eager to learn.</li>
            <li>I only used 1 brush so far and it seemed to work ok.</li>
            <li>They did arrive brand new and packaged exactly as shown and described.</li>
            <li>Really nice product for the price...wish there were a few size dotting tools and small detail brushes but overall great value.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, these brushes seem strong and ready to take on the task of many painting adventures, but like I said I&#x27;ve only had them for a little over a week.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend them for people who are looking into nail art as a fun hobby!</li>
            <li>The brushes have been pretty good, I have had trouble with the actual handle of the bushes -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve pretty much figured it out now but the first few days I had them I spent a good amount of time</li>
            <li>however the quality of the brushes looked really good same with the black case.</li>
            <li>B005BG02BU MASH Professional 15 piece Nail Art Brush Kit Set]] was ordered and arrived fast!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to the whole nail art scene.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re laying them out on a work table, make sure not to spill any cleaning solutions in the area because you&#x27;ll get black paint all over your hands when you go to pick them up.)</li>
            <li>also they&#x27;re easily bent so that&#x27;s something else to be careful about...</li>
            <li>Im particularly fond of the striping brushes.</li>
            <li>Okay, no big deal I just bent it back using pliers.</li>
            <li>The only problem was that once I opened it a very strong paint odor came out and when I tried to take the brushes out, they were al stuck to the case, it looks like either they didn&#x27;t let it dry before putting inside of the case</li>
            <li>This looks and feels like a high quality set of brushes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these brushes to nail artists everywhere.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I feel like the brushes could have been a little better quality</li>
            <li>I even love the little fold-over case for it.</li>
            <li>, they get the job done well, and they were pretty inexpensive for such a large set.</li>
            <li>I use them the most, and they havent let me down yet!  </li>
            <li>Absolutely surprised that I got my package that fast.</li>
            <li>WoW that was fast...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very chic and professional looking.</li>
            <li>:) Initially, I thought it was strange that there were two fan brushes</li>
            <li>I felt that this product was extremely useful and helps me spice up my basic manicures!</li>
            <li>There are some really nice detail brushes but overall it is average.</li>
            <li>Bought for my wife for a gift, she really liked them, the case has magnetic buttons on the inside to hold it closed, there was a small tear on the inner seam, but that was ok you couldn&#x27;t see it.</li>
            <li>I did read some reviews which did mention how the tip of the dotter tool fell off for some people which gave me some cause for worry, but it seems that I have received a good set and nothing has broken yet.   </li>
            <li>the brushes work great, but while using them, the black paint on the handles starts to rub off on your fingers &amp; get a little sticky.</li>
            <li>Decent quality, very professional looking.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this as a gift this christmas, and it looks substantial and like it cost more than it did (I was a bit leary, but so far MASH has not let me down), but i&#x27;ll have to keep you posted.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know what to do with all the brushes, but it&#x27;s not hard to figure it out.</li>
            <li>i just put it right back on!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new at nail art and have been using thin nail art polishes and have been able to do certain designs but these brushes just opened up a wide variety of much more I can learn...</li>
            <li>It was very fast shipping, the product was exactly as I expected and at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>and they still work brand new</li>
            <li>I returned them and ordered a new set.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m new to nail art, I&#x27;m uncertain what some are for, but that doesn&#x27;t matter.  </li>
            <li>This was a new brand For me</li>
            <li>Thought I would start a new hobby and why not nail art?</li>
            <li>Cant wait to try new nail designs with them.</li>
            <li>w.some sort of instruction manual for how to use the various brushes, although most seem self explanatory I have no idea what the 2 wide brushes are for.</li>
            <li>It looked very professional.</li>
            <li>First result to pop up when i searched nail art brushes, and i had to look no further!</li>
            <li>First of all, it does not come in that fancy back case, just a plastic bag.</li>
            <li>usually i never get things on time</li>
            <li>When we received her package the EXACT same brush was damaged!!!</li>
            <li>Then I went for the first brush from the left.</li>
            <li>NOW I&#x27;m on the hunt for QUALITY Professional brushes!</li>
            <li>she feels like a professional!  </li>
            <li>It is exactly what i was looking for, and i would definitely recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>One of the brushes is already stained blue from the first use...</li>
            <li>They looked pretty when they arrived, but when I opened the package, the lacquer on the handles stuck to the upper flap of the bag and damaged the handles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These Brushes Are Exactly What It Says On The Description They arrived A Day Earlier Than They Were Supposed To</li>
            <li>They had the exact same problem.</li>
            <li>Has every brush you could possibly need, makes designing nail art so much easier!</li>
            <li>And I should be able to trim the few on that particular brush before its next use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Especially if you are doing a nail design that takes a decent amount of time &amp; a steady hand.</li>
            <li>The brushes were a bit hard but after soaking them in nail polish remover for a little bit they work great...</li>
            <li>gives you a clean professional look and the seem to be long lasting.</li>
            <li>The case is a little generic compared to some of the others but still ok.</li>
            <li>Then, after using one of the brushes with polish, I grabbed some remover on a cotton ball and was swabbing it clean.... and the BLACK PAINT on the handles came off onto the cotton ball (and my fingers)!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She is a professional nail tech, so I will pass along her thoughts on this kit.</li>
            <li>I ordered the MASH Professional 15 piece Nail Art Brush Kit Set.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve done leopard print and zebra print, and I got tons of compliments on both.    </li>
            <li>I bought these brushes about a week ago for my 13 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>, the woman I talked to was very helpful and explained I could send back and get a refund</li>
            <li>B005BG02BU MASH Professional 15 piece Nail Art Brush Kit Set]]</li>
            <li>Though my nails did come out very well, my friends suggested to me that I get a proper set of nail art brushes.   </li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and do not shed.</li>
            <li>Bought this as a Christmas gift for my 12 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>1 of MASH Professional 15 piece Nail Art Brush Kit</li>
            <li>I have used two of them so far for that.</li>
            <li>It is a complete amount of tools.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So much so that when I peeled it open, a portion of the paint or covering of the brush handles was stuck to the pouch!  </li>
            <li>but they look like professional painters brushes, not just nail brushes.</li>
            <li>I wouldnt really know how to rate it since ive only used it once</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought ridiculously expensive paintbrushes at Michaels before and these seem to be just as good in terms of quality.</li>
            <li>Nothing was broken &amp; was packed nicely.</li>
            <li>They are long enough to be used easily but not so long they are unwieldy.</li>
            <li>The dotting tool is made from high quality metal and will last forever.</li>
            <li>These brushes are pretty cheaply made--the bristles are constantly falling out, and the metal piece connecting the brush to the handle fell off of one--but they serve my purposes as an amateur nail artist well enough.</li>
            <li>I would definitely invest a little more in my next set, though.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the brushes, but expected the black case they are shown in also.</li>
            <li>Just be careful not to get acetone on the handles because they will get messed up and not look pretty</li>
            <li>i noticed that the word M.A.S.H on the brush melted onto the black pouch, probably because its hot where i live, but that does not take away from the quality of the brush.</li>
            <li>So I wanted to get a new one, it is a gift for my girlfriend, but they will only give me a refund instead of a return.</li>
            <li>Nail Art   1 of MASH Double Sided Nail Art Plate Stamp and Scraper   1 of NEW 2012 MASH Set of 25 Nail Art Nailart Polish Stamp Stamping</li>
            <li>The nail polish doesn&#x27;t come out with remover (with or without acetone), and there&#x27;s nothing more frustrating than trying to paint with a brush whose bristles are stuck together with two week old polish.</li>
            <li>I am by no means a professional, but I wanted to learn how to do a few fun things for myself.</li>
            <li>but you can&#x27;t really expect that with such a low price.</li>
            <li>just make sure to add a base coat and when done a top coat</li>
            <li>The rest of the brushes were stuck to their respective pockets too but only the first brush&#x27;s head came off when I pulled open their protective caps.</li>
            <li>I received this for Christmas, along with about all my other nail supplies, and it is exactly what it looks like in the picture &amp;</li>
            <li>the black covering will melt right off.</li>
            <li>(a little lazy bug i am) but from using it the first time it was just fine.</li>
            <li>They clean easily with a small amount of nail polish remover... just be careful not to get the polish remover on the wood, as it removes the black paint from the brushes.</li>
            <li>Open it up, air it out maybe outside for a few days and it will be fine.</li>
            <li>I just doubt that the brushes will last long, the set seems to not be very durable.  </li>
            <li>There certainly is enough of them to keep her busy.</li>
            <li>The only problem I have so far is that one or two of the brushes were bent.</li>
            <li>As an early Christmas present, I have already given it to her.</li>
            <li>She has been using it for several months now with no trouble ..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used a couple so far</li>
            <li>Good luck to all you Nail Crazy Fashionistas out there.</li>
            <li>So I was kind of skeptical of the quality, but I gave it a try.</li>
            <li>love the brushes still alittle confused about the fan looking brushes</li>
            <li>Be careful though acetone makes the paint come off the handle and its hard to clean brushes with out using pure acetone.</li>
            <li>you watch youtube tutorials, they actually use this brushes for design, I&#x27;ve only used one brush to clean up the messy polishes around nails.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Just keep in mind that nail polish remover will strip the pretty black paint on the brush handles.</li>
            <li>A little stiff on a few of the brushes, but otherwise a great brush set for starting out.</li>
            <li>I find that the quality of these brushes is decent but only decent because some stray fibers mess up some of my designs</li>
            <li>The first time I went to clean these half the bristles fell out at least.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter for Christmas, which she was very pleased, however, one brush was pretty bent up, not sure if it was a shipping damage, but nothing was wrong with my fedex box when received.</li>
            <li>Each brush, other than the two fan brushes, also has a plastic sleeve over the bristles to help keep them straight and protected.</li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;ve began to notice when using it is that  the brushes I&#x27;ve used so far fall off the wooden handle.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast too, I chose standard shipping and it arrived 2 days before expected!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty clunky and the lines are messy.</li>
            <li>Was disappointed with that, but the brushes seem to be very nice.</li>
            <li>They do come in the little case shown in the picture and the whole case was wrapped in bubble wrap when I received it.</li>

            <li> The quality is really nice</li>

            <li> I was thrilled to get started using them with my nail art.</li>
            <li> The brushes are all good except tht it would have been better if they had brush no on it as well the name.</li>

            <li> With There own plastic cover ( Except Both fan Brushes)</li>
            <li> Customer service was nice, but the product remained the same....damaged.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and the brushes work great and a very nice pouch to keep them in.</li>
            <li> the brushes could break easily though, just saying :P that was my issue</li>
            <li> excellent quality, nice case makes doing your own nails so fun and easy</li>
            <li> Well this is a very good buy and what you see is exactly what you get.</li>

            <li> In the end I love it! :)</li>
            <li> Most places has them for 50-80$ maybe more!</li>

            <li> The set looks good and hope it will be useful and the brushes will nicely packed.</li>

            <li> I received the brushes very fast and they are going to work great.</li>
            <li> The brushes are beautiful and wear very well, even after washing.</li>
            <li> The product comes in a very good tri fold case, very professional.</li>
            <li> Also the case is very cheap when I recieve it, the case was stuck to the brushes and literally peeled off.</li>
            <li> Very professional, and you get all of this at a very good price.</li>
            <li> Each brush has it&#x27;s own pocket to slide into, making storage and protection easy as pie.</li>
            <li> The first time I used the brushes I was impressed on how easy they clean up...but...</li>
            <li> Im very pleased with my purchase and am becoming a HUGE fan of the MASH line of products.</li>
            <li> my sister is enjoying every bit of these brushes.</li>
            <li> Such a great variety of brushes!!  </li>
            <li> I already did so many cute designs with them.</li>
            <li> I am reall pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my brushes</li>
            <li> and I love the dotted tool</li>
            <li> and i hope to get a lot of use out of these in the years to come. :)</li>
            <li> Love the carry case ...</li>
            <li> She says she couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.</li>
            <li> I wish there were better dotting tools..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased with them I&#x27;m thinking of getting another set as a gift for a friend.</li>
            <li> And i love this kit....</li>
            <li> She thinks I paid alot more for it, so that must speak volumes about the quality for the price.</li>
            <li> I know she&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> but i was glad to see that mine did .</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I like the case and it looks like it will keep the brushes protected for many years.</li>
            <li> but it doesnt spread nice at all for detailed work..and it didn&#x27;t come with instruction package which would be helpful.</li>
            <li> I love these Nail Art Brush Kit Set.</li>
            <li> I can now do my nails and be as creative as I would like.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay if you lose a cap too because it comes with extras.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still figuring out what to do with most of them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just begun learning how to do nail art, and bought this set because of the well-deserved reviews, and like everyone else was pleased with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> I love doing my nails and using all the brushes in the kit.</li>

            <li> Love this collection and the case sealed the deal.</li>
            <li> love using my brushes.  </li>
            <li> PLUS IT CAN HOLD MORE.</li>
            <li> Before even touching a brush, the carrying case was already stuck to the brushes which caused smudging imprints on the brush handles.</li>
            <li> Again, more smudged varnish marks.</li>
            <li> still use and love these brushes.</li>
            <li> I also love the dotting tool that comes with it.</li>
            <li> It will work until I find something better to store them  in.</li>
            <li> I love using these brushes now (though I still use bobby pins from now and then)</li>
            <li> I recieved my item, I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this set but wish I had gone for a glass or crystal handled set.</li>
            <li> and she just love it</li>
            <li> Love the carrying case.</li>
            <li> I love my brush kit set.  </li>
            <li> They worked ok for there price</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it came with everything that was said(and</li>
            <li> I personally love these brushes.</li>
            <li> i love that it came with</li>
            <li> Now I just have to learn to use the brushes correctly :-)</li>
            <li> Satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I also love the variety of brushes.  </li>
            <li> I have seen better ones...</li>
            <li> She is able to do the fancy things that a salon would charge money for.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes for my nail art.</li>
            <li> Not a problem - more of a cosmetic issue for how the brush looks.</li>
            <li> My Giftee seemed to love it. .</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with the promptness and condition of the item.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love my brush kit</li>
            <li> and I love them.</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> You can find a better set of nail art brushes for cheaper.</li>
            <li> Construction seems OK too.</li>
            <li> I have used most of the brushes just playing around with it.</li>
            <li> And I even don&#x27;t draw good on paper, but with this brushes and youtube tutorials I did great, totally recommended!</li>
            <li> I love this set.</li>
            <li> Okay brushes for the price.  </li>
            <li> but I am more knowledgeable about paint brushes for painting on canvas as opposed to nail art brushes.</li>
            <li> Lots of different sizes, perfect for all kinds of detail work.  </li>
            <li> Overall, great buy!!</li>
            <li> I also bought the nail rhinestones and dotting tools and I could not recommend them more.</li>
            <li> i love the carrying case protects my brushes while they are put away</li>
            <li> Okay</li>
            <li> these brushes are a bit cheap looking, but who cares!</li>
            <li> Looking forward to better nail art now.</li>
            <li> I love how many colors and designs you get though.</li>
            <li> in all this is a good product and worth the price I paid for it.</li>
            <li> The Case looks nice its sturdy and the brushes are secure.</li>
            <li> otherwise i love the brushes and the cute case that it is in.</li>
            <li> am glad a have it</li>
            <li> I had it for about a month before my daughter fell in love with it</li>
            <li> Love that they came in the case.</li>
            <li> i love doing my nails.</li>
            <li> The quality appears to be ok.</li>
            <li> i love the case they come with</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a newbie at nail art, but was getting more adventurous, so decided to invest in some brushes.</li>
            <li> The bristles of the brushes are made extremely cheap!  </li>
            <li> if that&#x27;s what you are buying them for because it will stick to the fibers and harden them up so you won&#x27;t be able to use the brush anymore.</li>
            <li> and I also found that if working with acrylic paint, the more diluted with water the paint is, the better these brushes work for you.</li>
            <li> Through time i will be able to tell.</li>
            <li> like the case it came in, it&#x27;s very easy to carry around and hold all the items.&lt;br /&gt;The quality is OK, I took off one of the plastic covers for the dotter and the hole dotter metal head came off along with the package but was easily fixed.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> so I know she will find this set very useful and add to her nail creativity!</li>
            <li> im excited to start using them ! :)</li>
            <li> They are GREAT quality brushes, and super easy to clean.</li>
            <li> She was pretty impressed by how much comes with this kit, and the quality of each brush.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the ease of these tools, great for first timers or those looking to have fun with nails!</li>
            <li> The quality isn&#x27;t phenomenal but if you are just starting out and want to practice your nail art and find which kind of brushes you prefer it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> It has made my life so much easier in designing my own creations!</li>
            <li> For the price though, this is a pretty good set.</li>
            <li> But the rest of the brushes look pretty good.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it can be hard to find good, quality brushes, but these ones are excellent.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to use them when i got them!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it!!</li>
            <li> Worth the money and produces a professional-like finish!!</li>
            <li> Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to all Dont forget to tip your waiter / Waitress</li>
            <li> Super nice for taking them to my friends houses and doing their nails as well.</li>
            <li> but I suggest the manufacturers to change the painting method or let them dry perfectly before packaging.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this because most the reviews I read were good</li>
            <li> These brushes are great so far!</li>
            <li> I mostly practice right now and havent done much on my own nails.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very light weight and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used the brushes yet, but i&#x27;m super excited to!!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get such a great deal on these brushes!!</li>
            <li> I just recieved this kit about a week ago and so far its been great.</li>
            <li> , now she can paint her nails herself, was a great unexpected gift to her</li>
            <li> It was what I expected and I will be purchasing more things from this company!!!</li>
            <li> I am very happy I chose to purchase this set over the other ones I considered buying.</li>
            <li> These are my first nail art brushes, so I dont have anything to compare them to, but I LOVE these brushes!</li>
            <li> My nail polish case is neatly organized now, AND if I get paint on the pouch it create an \\&quot;artsy\\&quot; look which is cool too!  </li>
            <li> The brushes fall off easily, they don&#x27;t work well with nail polish</li>
            <li> We looked at some easy tutorials on YouTube</li>
            <li> Easy for me to use</li>
            <li> The handles are sturdy and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> :) have fun being creative with these brushes you have no limit.</li>
            <li> The item shipped and was received very quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to wrap them up for traveling.</li>
            <li> by purchasing this set, I am able to do my own nails, and it is much cheaper then going to the shop.  </li>
            <li> Inexpensive and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly and were just as described.</li>
            <li> the case makes it easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> but this came in the mail the exact date it said and was packed nicely</li>
            <li> They work perfectly and they came a day before expected!!</li>
            <li> I use these with nail polish and with acrylic craft paints to make my designs and they work just fine.  </li>
            <li> all I&#x27;m pretty happy with this purchase and for the price you really can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> The brushes came quickly and I immediately used the dotting tool and the striper brushes!  </li>
            <li> I was pleased to see that this seller ships quickly, my order came in just like shown up online.</li>
            <li> Packaging was more than adequate for protection.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, good quality, inexpensive for home or professional use.</li>
            <li> Overall very satisfied!</li>
            <li> This little set is perfect for the price.</li>
            <li> The case is a huge bonus.</li>
            <li> or they were under a huge amount of heat on their way here.....</li>
            <li> The brushes work great and they are like regular paint brushes, not the cheap bristles but there is one thing that is a problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with all the different designs this allows me to do</li>
            <li> Brush case looks and feels extremely cheap, but I guess for $10</li>
            <li> Awww yeeeeh.  </li>
            <li> Im sooo happy to finally recieve my MASH nail tool kit.</li>
            <li> I bought this nail brush for the cheap price and the quantity.</li>
            <li> Others have said the brushes are easy to clean.</li>
            <li> enjoy having them eventhough</li>
            <li> The brushes were easy to clean afterwards, as well.</li>
            <li> It was on Amazon Prime which meant free shipping as well for me.   </li>
            <li> would enjoy this set also.</li>
            <li> but these are to cheaply made to do them with.</li>
            <li> I have been able to do some fun designs.</li>
            <li> and they are easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Cheap kit.</li>
            <li> It is really fantastic</li>
            <li> Ohhh the fun I have been having :)</li>
            <li> A few stray hairs needed to be removed before I used a couple of these brushes, besides that, a great set for the price!  </li>
            <li> Plus, the brushes wouldn&#x27;t come clean easily.</li>
            <li> The longer brushes all came with caps for safe storage and there is a good size range between the various brushes.</li>
            <li> Plus, frequent cleaning will keep them in good condition.</li>
            <li> What I liked is that the case and brushes are decent size, which  make it easy to store anywhere.</li>
            <li> All of the brushes are soft and good quality.</li>
            <li> It comes with so many brushes &amp; the quality looks good enough for me to use to do nail art!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li> My first was zebra stripes!!</li>
            <li> Still very usable!!!</li>
            <li> And it Helps Me TREMENDOUSLY with making perfectly straight lines and cute designs!  </li>
            <li> They arrived early, in good packaging, and they were super cheap.  </li>
            <li> Aside from the great quality of the brushes, the fact that they come nearly organized in a pouch is very convenient too!</li>
            <li> Quick And Easy</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes about a week ago and was so excited to use them.</li>
            <li> She is excited to use them.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> You can pretty much be sure that I returned this defective item.</li>
            <li> I think a beginner would love these and a seasoned nail tech like me</li>
            <li> There are so many brushes in this kit, I&#x27;m pretty excited to get to using it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use them for my nails, I use them for painting with oil paints on canvas to get into small places and they are wonderful.</li>
            <li> i just got my nail brushes today i was so excited</li>
            <li> love the small tips great for fine detailed designs.</li>
            <li> Happy with purchase, just wish brushes were a little better quality.</li>
            <li> They clean up well with acetone or water depending on if you used paint or polish.</li>
            <li> They clean well with polish remover.</li>
            <li> The paint comes off if you clean it with acetone.</li>
            <li> That was with the free super saver shipping (5-8 days)</li>
            <li> Other then that, the product is good :)</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t going to be anything special.</li>
            <li> They all came in differnt styles which is good for different styles.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these brushes! :)</li>
            <li> and it seems the dotting tool is the only one that works fairly well.</li>
            <li> A girl frend of mine find its good so far, she likes it, and she jinks its really ok so far</li>
            <li> I love the brushes, they work really well.</li>
            <li> so far the only fault I have come up with is that I would have liked something that tells me what design each brush is good for.</li>
            <li> I can do some cool details.</li>
            <li> Too many tools for her to really know what to do with.</li>
            <li> I loved all the different brushes!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool .</li>
            <li> Good fir just starting out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all cool.</li>
            <li> Good simple kit, she has used almost all of the brushes and loves it.</li>
            <li> good enough.</li>
            <li> I ordered them after seeing no bad comments...</li>
            <li> Not bad for the cost I guess.</li>
            <li> Love all the brushes and super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> There was a pretty strong smell when I opened the case</li>
            <li> they came quickly and they look like the pictures</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3GHT0F4IWRAP9]]A quick look at the M.A.S.H Brush Set.</li>
            <li> Shipping was super-fast and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Overall, an excellent product and a purchase I would definitely make again.</li>
            <li> The item came quickly.</li>
            <li> It would be super helpful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Besides what I&#x27;ve said in the video, the shipping on these was extremely quick.</li>
            <li> I have done many new designs on my nails.  </li>
            <li> I was satisfied, until I received the new set of brushes.</li>
            <li> and I gawked at the price at first because it was such a good deal for the number of brushes I was getting.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;m kind of bummed that I paid the same price for the brushes with the crappy plastic case as everyone who is getting the awesome new black case.</li>
            <li> When I first saw this product I was so eager to purchase it!</li>
            <li> I used them for their intended purpose when I first got them, but now I find myself using them for my paintings!</li>
            <li> exactly everything I need to do my nail artwork!</li>
            <li> /&gt;They looked pretty otherwise, but I got another brand that was only 2-3 dollars more, and those worked better.</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to get these in the email today.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly new to nail art and am very excited to have these tools.</li>
            <li> The little organizer they come in keeps dust out and is a great way to store them.</li>
            <li> When I opened the clear plastic overwrap the odor was overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> Having so much fun doing one-stroke nail art for my mom</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it for the price I guess.</li>
            <li> Worth the money you spend.</li>
            <li> and they are ALL useful.</li>
            <li> I have had so much fun doing all kinds of designs on my nails with these.</li>
            <li> My brushes seem to be ok: no damage, no shedding so far.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it</li>
            <li> I am having fun with them.</li>
            <li> What fun that was, I had a ton of compliments.</li>
            <li> I love them so far.</li>
            <li> The brushes come in a lovely tri-fold soft leatherette case with two magnetic snaps and the MASH logo on one side.</li>
            <li> but it isnt as good quality as I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> The money you pay for them is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m nowhere near a skilled nail tech</li>
            <li> I completely fell in love with these brushes which came in the mail super fast!</li>
            <li> Still, the price is right, and if you get a non-acetone brush cleaner, you&#x27;ll be golden.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> It came quick with Prime, and it look exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> I received these brushes pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a great little set for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> They have fast and friendly service.</li>
            <li> Other than that this is a good product.</li>
            <li> Priced right.</li>
            <li> (didn&#x27;t rate right away)</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t do right work or designs.</li>
            <li> this was pretty exciting to have the right tools.</li>
            <li> The black pouch is really nice and not so huge</li>
            <li> My only issue with the kit is that the pouch had an extremely strong chemical smell!  </li>
            <li> Came in the black case and the brushes in good quality.</li>
            <li> I got this super fast</li>
            <li> Shipped super fast.</li>
            <li> The shipping was super fast</li>
            <li> For what I spent I am extremely satisfied and so is my girlfriend!</li>
            <li> Shipping was also very fast .</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> Mind you, I was very gentle when opening it up.</li>
            <li> price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> So far the brushes themselves are fine.</li>
            <li> I asked for these as a gift and was so excited to get them, but I&#x27;m new to nail art</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found a use for several of the brushes in  here, and (like most wood-handled brushes), the paint they are covered with dissolves in acetone.</li>
            <li> Love the case and all the different brushes.</li>
            <li> I have bought 3 seperate sets of these brushes, and have ben using the first set for 3 months...</li>
            <li> My teen daughter will love and spend hours designing her nails.  </li>
            <li> When I first got the package I didn&#x27;t even open the kit and metal/bristle top part fell off.</li>
            <li> and I love all the different brush sizes and options.</li>
            <li> Would highly reccommend them!!</li>
            <li> This was one of the first sets I found</li>
            <li> and they make my nail art look so much cleaner and easier!</li>
            <li> so hopefully she will know enough about it to use it appropriately.  </li>
            <li> There are so many different types of brushes in this set.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> My first design with these were mistletoe I also bought rhinestone and the fimo canes from Mash.</li>
            <li> The description of the item is exactly what was received.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Pretty Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li> other than that i love this product!</li>
            <li> Thank You so much!</li>
            <li> I totally recommend it if you want to get creative.</li>
            <li> This is my first brush set.</li>
            <li> It seems like a product that will most likely come in contact with nail polish remover should be resistant to it.</li>
            <li> Even considering shipping it was only around $1 per brush. : )</li>
            <li> very well made !</li>
            <li> First, when I opened the pouch for the first time, the flap covering the brushes was sticking to the handles.  </li>
            <li> the MASH brushes arrived on time and are exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the nail art game &amp; these brushes are good quality and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Although I loved the variety and quality of the brushes, and the convenient case to store them in, cleaning nail polish off of these babies is no easy task.</li>
            <li> They are easy to clean and dry fast.</li>
            <li> All these items are going to my daughter on Christmas so not sure exactly how the quality is but looks good when I opened the box to wrap the items up.</li>
            <li> anywhere else your looking at 20 dollars for just half of as many as you get!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good deal until you&#x27;re ready to invest in more expensive durable items....</li>
            <li> The black brush case is fantastic it has a slot for every brush and folds up like an envelope so it easily slides into her nail stuff container without taking up a lot of space.</li>
            <li> They might work better if they were not so stiff after i use them (even after I clean them in nail polish remover).</li>
            <li> I was kind of unsure whether to buy these brushes or not by reading reviews that mentioned they didn&#x27;t recieve the black pouch as shown in the picture</li>
            <li> I bought this particular item because I wanted nail art tools to to help me learn how to do nail art without spending a lot of money!</li>
            <li> And they clean beautifully in acetone, but only pure acetone - anything else does not clean them properly.</li>
            <li> They are nice brushes although one drill apart from the stick a little glue an</li>
            <li> Nice little case--nicer than brushes.  </li>
            <li> So far a few of the bristles on the brushes have kind of went astray, but for the price and amount of brushes you get it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> It works really well</li>
            <li> High quality brush and case!</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I use one of the brushes in there as an eyeliner brush for my gel liner, works very well.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and well packed.</li>
            <li> I do really recommend these brushes .</li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> The brushes work really well.  </li>
            <li> Thanks alot its a Christmas gift for my wife.</li>
            <li> This really has everything I&#x27;d want for nail art.</li>
            <li> I really have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I am very upset with this item.</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t have to wait with the whole return process on mine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve very up set</li>
            <li> very</li>
            <li> I use straight acetone and then dab on a paper towel or pantyliner, I never runt he brush under water.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I was extremely gentle.</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves this set</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> They were shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> and those brushes is like for real pain not for nail work</li>
            <li> They pair very well with the MASH dotting tool set.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these brushes!</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> The package arrived very quick.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Othere than that they do not stand the test of time very well.</li>
            <li> But the case that they come in is very convenient</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> but hey are not the real mash</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very eager to learn.</li>
            <li> I only used 1 brush so far and it seemed to work ok.</li>
            <li> They did arrive brand new and packaged exactly as shown and described.</li>
            <li> Really nice product for the price...wish there were a few size dotting tools and small detail brushes but overall great value.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, these brushes seem strong and ready to take on the task of many painting adventures, but like I said I&#x27;ve only had them for a little over a week.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend them for people who are looking into nail art as a fun hobby!</li>
            <li> The brushes have been pretty good, I have had trouble with the actual handle of the bushes -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve pretty much figured it out now but the first few days I had them I spent a good amount of time</li>
            <li> however the quality of the brushes looked really good same with the black case.</li>
            <li> B005BG02BU MASH Professional 15 piece Nail Art Brush Kit Set]] was ordered and arrived fast!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the whole nail art scene.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re laying them out on a work table, make sure not to spill any cleaning solutions in the area because you&#x27;ll get black paint all over your hands when you go to pick them up.)</li>
            <li> also they&#x27;re easily bent so that&#x27;s something else to be careful about...</li>
            <li> Im particularly fond of the striping brushes.</li>
            <li> Okay, no big deal I just bent it back using pliers.</li>
            <li> The only problem was that once I opened it a very strong paint odor came out and when I tried to take the brushes out, they were al stuck to the case, it looks like either they didn&#x27;t let it dry before putting inside of the case</li>
            <li> This looks and feels like a high quality set of brushes.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these brushes to nail artists everywhere.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I feel like the brushes could have been a little better quality</li>
            <li> I even love the little fold-over case for it.</li>
            <li> , they get the job done well, and they were pretty inexpensive for such a large set.</li>
            <li> I use them the most, and they havent let me down yet!  </li>
            <li> Absolutely surprised that I got my package that fast.</li>
            <li> WoW that was fast...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very chic and professional looking.</li>
            <li> :) Initially, I thought it was strange that there were two fan brushes</li>
            <li> I felt that this product was extremely useful and helps me spice up my basic manicures!</li>
            <li> There are some really nice detail brushes but overall it is average.</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife for a gift, she really liked them, the case has magnetic buttons on the inside to hold it closed, there was a small tear on the inner seam, but that was ok you couldn&#x27;t see it.</li>
            <li> I did read some reviews which did mention how the tip of the dotter tool fell off for some people which gave me some cause for worry, but it seems that I have received a good set and nothing has broken yet.   </li>
            <li> the brushes work great, but while using them, the black paint on the handles starts to rub off on your fingers &amp; get a little sticky.</li>
            <li> Decent quality, very professional looking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this as a gift this christmas, and it looks substantial and like it cost more than it did (I was a bit leary, but so far MASH has not let me down), but i&#x27;ll have to keep you posted.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to do with all the brushes, but it&#x27;s not hard to figure it out.</li>
            <li> i just put it right back on!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new at nail art and have been using thin nail art polishes and have been able to do certain designs but these brushes just opened up a wide variety of much more I can learn...</li>
            <li> It was very fast shipping, the product was exactly as I expected and at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> and they still work brand new</li>
            <li> I returned them and ordered a new set.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m new to nail art, I&#x27;m uncertain what some are for, but that doesn&#x27;t matter.  </li>
            <li> This was a new brand For me</li>
            <li> Thought I would start a new hobby and why not nail art?</li>
            <li> Cant wait to try new nail designs with them.</li>
            <li> w.some sort of instruction manual for how to use the various brushes, although most seem self explanatory I have no idea what the 2 wide brushes are for.</li>
            <li> It looked very professional.</li>
            <li> First result to pop up when i searched nail art brushes, and i had to look no further!</li>
            <li> First of all, it does not come in that fancy back case, just a plastic bag.</li>
            <li> usually i never get things on time</li>
            <li> When we received her package the EXACT same brush was damaged!!!</li>
            <li> Then I went for the first brush from the left.</li>
            <li> NOW I&#x27;m on the hunt for QUALITY Professional brushes!</li>
            <li> she feels like a professional!  </li>
            <li> It is exactly what i was looking for, and i would definitely recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> One of the brushes is already stained blue from the first use...</li>
            <li> They looked pretty when they arrived, but when I opened the package, the lacquer on the handles stuck to the upper flap of the bag and damaged the handles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These Brushes Are Exactly What It Says On The Description They arrived A Day Earlier Than They Were Supposed To</li>
            <li> They had the exact same problem.</li>
            <li> Has every brush you could possibly need, makes designing nail art so much easier!</li>
            <li> And I should be able to trim the few on that particular brush before its next use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Especially if you are doing a nail design that takes a decent amount of time &amp; a steady hand.</li>
            <li> The brushes were a bit hard but after soaking them in nail polish remover for a little bit they work great...</li>
            <li> gives you a clean professional look and the seem to be long lasting.</li>
            <li> The case is a little generic compared to some of the others but still ok.</li>
            <li> Then, after using one of the brushes with polish, I grabbed some remover on a cotton ball and was swabbing it clean.... and the BLACK PAINT on the handles came off onto the cotton ball (and my fingers)!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She is a professional nail tech, so I will pass along her thoughts on this kit.</li>
            <li> I ordered the MASH Professional 15 piece Nail Art Brush Kit Set.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve done leopard print and zebra print, and I got tons of compliments on both.    </li>
            <li> I bought these brushes about a week ago for my 13 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> , the woman I talked to was very helpful and explained I could send back and get a refund</li>
            <li> B005BG02BU MASH Professional 15 piece Nail Art Brush Kit Set]]</li>
            <li> Though my nails did come out very well, my friends suggested to me that I get a proper set of nail art brushes.   </li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and do not shed.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for my 12 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> 1 of MASH Professional 15 piece Nail Art Brush Kit</li>
            <li> I have used two of them so far for that.</li>
            <li> It is a complete amount of tools.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So much so that when I peeled it open, a portion of the paint or covering of the brush handles was stuck to the pouch!  </li>
            <li> but they look like professional painters brushes, not just nail brushes.</li>
            <li> I wouldnt really know how to rate it since ive only used it once</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought ridiculously expensive paintbrushes at Michaels before and these seem to be just as good in terms of quality.</li>
            <li> Nothing was broken &amp; was packed nicely.</li>
            <li> They are long enough to be used easily but not so long they are unwieldy.</li>
            <li> The dotting tool is made from high quality metal and will last forever.</li>
            <li> These brushes are pretty cheaply made--the bristles are constantly falling out, and the metal piece connecting the brush to the handle fell off of one--but they serve my purposes as an amateur nail artist well enough.</li>
            <li> I would definitely invest a little more in my next set, though.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the brushes, but expected the black case they are shown in also.</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to get acetone on the handles because they will get messed up and not look pretty</li>
            <li> i noticed that the word M.A.S.H on the brush melted onto the black pouch, probably because its hot where i live, but that does not take away from the quality of the brush.</li>
            <li> So I wanted to get a new one, it is a gift for my girlfriend, but they will only give me a refund instead of a return.</li>
            <li> Nail Art   1 of MASH Double Sided Nail Art Plate Stamp and Scraper   1 of NEW 2012 MASH Set of 25 Nail Art Nailart Polish Stamp Stamping</li>
            <li> The nail polish doesn&#x27;t come out with remover (with or without acetone), and there&#x27;s nothing more frustrating than trying to paint with a brush whose bristles are stuck together with two week old polish.</li>
            <li> I am by no means a professional, but I wanted to learn how to do a few fun things for myself.</li>
            <li> but you can&#x27;t really expect that with such a low price.</li>
            <li> just make sure to add a base coat and when done a top coat</li>
            <li> The rest of the brushes were stuck to their respective pockets too but only the first brush&#x27;s head came off when I pulled open their protective caps.</li>
            <li> I received this for Christmas, along with about all my other nail supplies, and it is exactly what it looks like in the picture &amp;</li>
            <li> the black covering will melt right off.</li>
            <li> (a little lazy bug i am) but from using it the first time it was just fine.</li>
            <li> They clean easily with a small amount of nail polish remover... just be careful not to get the polish remover on the wood, as it removes the black paint from the brushes.</li>
            <li> Open it up, air it out maybe outside for a few days and it will be fine.</li>
            <li> I just doubt that the brushes will last long, the set seems to not be very durable.  </li>
            <li> There certainly is enough of them to keep her busy.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have so far is that one or two of the brushes were bent.</li>
            <li> As an early Christmas present, I have already given it to her.</li>
            <li> She has been using it for several months now with no trouble ..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used a couple so far</li>
            <li> Good luck to all you Nail Crazy Fashionistas out there.</li>
            <li> So I was kind of skeptical of the quality, but I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> love the brushes still alittle confused about the fan looking brushes</li>
            <li> Be careful though acetone makes the paint come off the handle and its hard to clean brushes with out using pure acetone.</li>
            <li> you watch youtube tutorials, they actually use this brushes for design, I&#x27;ve only used one brush to clean up the messy polishes around nails.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Just keep in mind that nail polish remover will strip the pretty black paint on the brush handles.</li>
            <li> A little stiff on a few of the brushes, but otherwise a great brush set for starting out.</li>
            <li> I find that the quality of these brushes is decent but only decent because some stray fibers mess up some of my designs</li>
            <li> The first time I went to clean these half the bristles fell out at least.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas, which she was very pleased, however, one brush was pretty bent up, not sure if it was a shipping damage, but nothing was wrong with my fedex box when received.</li>
            <li> Each brush, other than the two fan brushes, also has a plastic sleeve over the bristles to help keep them straight and protected.</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;ve began to notice when using it is that  the brushes I&#x27;ve used so far fall off the wooden handle.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast too, I chose standard shipping and it arrived 2 days before expected!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty clunky and the lines are messy.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed with that, but the brushes seem to be very nice.</li>
            <li> They do come in the little case shown in the picture and the whole case was wrapped in bubble wrap when I received it.</li>
            <li> I am a casual nail artist at home and they are more than sufficient for my use.  </li>
            <li> They are very durable, and I don&#x27;t see me breaking into the other sets for a long time!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super high quality</li>
            <li> I have ordered other MASH Nails items and they also have been received broken and able to return.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m not a professional, and I don&#x27;t know what each brush is used for, I can see the potential for lots of different uses.</li>
            <li> The case looks very professional and so does the black finish on the brushes.</li>
            <li> Im not sure if that is a real brand or not</li>
            <li> Hope they will last a long time.</li>
            <li> The bristles are well connected to the handles and feel like they will last a long time.</li>
            <li> By now the black paint has worn out near the brush heads, but that doesn&#x27;t affect performance.  </li>
            <li> When I picked it up, my hand was completely coated in the black finish on these brushes.  </li>
            <li> The handles of the brushes were then marked slightly.  </li>
            <li> Ordering special ink for detail..hoping that works..it not at least I only wasted 9.99$</li>
            <li> Hopefully they will last a real long time!</li>
            <li> but when I went to clean the polish off I got a little acetone on the black part and it started to come OFF!!!</li>
            <li> There was a minor error in which one of the brushes didn&#x27;t come with the plastic protecter , no biggie though .</li>
            <li> I received it much earlier than I had expected.</li>
            <li> but I look forward to experimenting with them for a long time.</li>
            <li> Currently researching other brands.</li>
            <li> The product came 4 days earlier then expected!</li>
            <li> The only bad thing was the on the dotting brush the top came off</li>
            <li> You can spread them around, let them dry then add another dot inside.</li>
            <li> It looked as if the brushes were painted, and then packaged before being fully dry...</li>
            <li> It comes with every single brush in the picture.</li>
            <li> Received it and noticed that every single brush had damage to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them constantly on my nails and these brushes have yet to let me down.</li>
            <li> and this product allows me to do more difficult nail art than i usually can.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific little starter set.  </li>
            <li> And Theyre NOT Coming Loose!</li>
            <li> that MASH will not help out since so many people are getting bad batches</li>
            <li> I had to carefully remove it with nailpolish remover because it looked tacky.</li>
            <li> so I carefully peeled it from the sides of the pockets before pulling it out.</li>
            <li> one thing though be careful cleaning them try not to get acetone on the wood part of the brush</li>
            <li> It came faster than expected.</li>
            <li> I spilled my nail polish remover on one of these brushes while I was carefully painting my nails.  </li>
            <li> so be careful with that...</li>
            <li> The brushes do their job, and give me a wide range of tools that encourage my creativity.</li>
            <li> So, be careful.</li>
            <li> I expected some quality.</li>
            <li> kept falling out getting stuck in the wet polish</li>
            <li> They were packed when the paint was wet and it smudged on the wood</li>
            <li> but that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> No thanks.</li>
            <li> Like someone else posted in a review, be careful when cleaning or using in acetone.</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish they would have included was a little mini Instructions showing what each brush is used for!</li>
            <li> If I got even a little remover on it my entire hand was black.</li>
            <li> Before I use them I was just wondering what other people have been doing for cleaning?</li>
            <li> Other than the fan brushes which is understandable.</li>
            <li> the other is for the washable paints.</li>
            <li> They came in a small white plastic packet.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a small gift for my girlfriend who has recently gotten into painting designs on her nails.</li>
            <li> Other then that I would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brushes look and function as intended...but whomever designed this set should have used other materials for the handles.  </li>
            <li> someone who fakes a brand or company name is shady enough for me!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this item not expecting much because normally I am not very good at nails.</li>
            <li> fact, I&#x27;d say the only thing missing really, is a little instruction sheet, with ideas of what to do, and the brushes to use.</li>
            <li> I like these, and use them, however, the black finish will come off in a brush cleaner if you aren&#x27;t careful.</li>
            <li> anyways whoever it is selling them painted the brushes black and stamped the name because as soon as they get wet</li>
            <li> One side note, be careful with these brushes around your nail polish remover because the black painted handles will no longer be painted black...</li>
            <li> The only downside is that the case smells like moth balls really bad at first.</li>
            <li> one is one of those I rarely use, but will go crazy without.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the m.a.s.h. logo is wearing off</li>
            <li> Last thing you want are small hairs in a nail design!</li>
            <li> and they also came in the black case.</li>
            <li> brushes came in their black pouch, which is so convenient.</li>
            <li> (One thing about cleaning: brush cleaner/acetone NP remover will take off the black paint on the brush handles.  </li>
            <li> if you get acetone on them the black paint starts to come off.</li>
            <li> The black paint does come off a bit if you have nail polish remover on your hands.</li>
            <li> I got it as a gift, but my netetr half seems to like it a lot.  </li>
            <li> the black paint on the brushes easly comes off in brush cleaner or nail polish remover....</li>
            <li> I have a slight problem with the silver coming off the stick</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get any nail polish remover on your fingers and then grab your nail art brush, the black handle is painted on and will be removed where ever the nail polish fingers are from.</li>
            <li> The black painted finish is not practical.</li>
            <li> If you use any of these brushes for acetone touch-ups, BEWARE that the black finish will start to come off almost immediately on your hands or anything else you accidentally touch.</li>
            <li> the brushes are painted black with a &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Also the packaging smelled really odd.</li>
            <li> Anything with acetone in it will strip the hell out of the brush handles, and turn your hands into a black, sticky mess.</li>
            <li> No easy feat to get off when your nails are wet!</li>
            <li> they will mess up if you get remover on the shaft</li>
            <li> It was stuck inside the little pocket</li>
            <li> This gets messy sometimes.</li>
            <li> The quality of brushes was poor, they did not last !</li>
            <li> People are mindless.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t mind because that&#x27;s not really important to me.</li>
            <li> therefore nothing was missing)</li>
            <li> Now a few things, when I received the brushes, one of them was bent at the metal part.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a heavy vinyl/cheap plastic odor.</li>
            <li> My brushes came in a white plastic pouch with a clear front...not in the black tri-fold as pictured &#x3D;(    </li>
            <li> Its been a year and a half since I bought these!</li>
            <li> I posted a picture with what they look like without the black finish!</li>
            <li> I noticed that the tips of the brushes started dissolving... and the finish of the brush handles comes off on your hands if you have remover on your fingers, revealing plain wood.</li>
            <li> If you dip the brush down past the metal bit that holds the brush to the handle the black paint will come off and get all over!!</li>
            <li> I usually worked with bobby pins, toothpicks, dried out pens when doing detailing on my nails.</li>
            <li> previous reviewer complained about cleaning solution, I have never needed any.</li>
            <li> They came in a little plastic carry case and came just as shown in the picture!</li>
            <li> It made a Hugh mess and I to take it all off otherwise it was sticky and messy!!</li>
            <li> the one in here is really small</li>
            <li> all these usable brushes with a small price.i would recommed this to a friend</li>
            <li> There are also a lot of pointless brushes.</li>
            <li> I had a difficult time trying to find a set of brushes that included all the ones needed to paint designs on nails, but I finally found this one.  </li>
            <li> Quite a few brushes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them a few times now, and am slowly learning which brush does what.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still not sure what a couple of them are used for</li>
            <li> After the first use of 3 of the brushes, the bristles came apart and they were completely worthless to try and use again.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s pretty annoying.</li>
            <li> It is hard to know what each brush is used for unless your like a pro nail artist.</li>
            <li> and they are so holding up none of them have gotten hard or hard to use do to use.</li>
            <li> From the fan brushes to thick blush or powder brushes to the thinnest eyeliner brush, this set has them all.  </li>

            <li> no good .</li>
            <li> the color comes off and makes a terrible mess and the paint wont come off of material and barely come off the skin.</li>
            <li> One of the brushes were bent and broken, no time to exchange this is for a christmas gift.  </li>
            <li> just keeps sending out bad ones due to the fact that is all they have and don&#x27;t relize it.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m happy with all the different designs this allows me to do</li>
            <li> my sister is enjoying every bit of these brushes. She just started on art work on herself and it came in handy!!</li>
            <li> The quality isn&#x27;t phenomenal but if you are just starting out and want to practice your nail art and find which kind of brushes you prefer it&#x27;s great. The case looks very professional and so does the black finish on the brushes. So far a few of the bristles on the brushes have kind of went astray, but for the price and amount of brushes you get it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought these to play with some nail artwork,... they were perfect for the price and for as often as I have needed to use them.  Such a great variety of brushes!!  Quality is great as well.  I&#x27;ve not had brush hairs come out like some that you might find.  Last thing you want are small hairs in a nail design!</li>
            <li> I completely fell in love with these brushes which came in the mail super fast! I already did so many cute designs with them. Great product for a great price!!</li>
            <li> They are nice brushes although one drill apart from the stick a little glue an they work just as good. I am reall pleased with the product. They all came in differnt styles which is good for different styles. Nice.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my brushes I bought this about a month ago and they still work brand new and I love the dotted tool It works really well (make dot or to carve shapes in the polish) I highly recommend these brushes! :)</li>
            <li> WYSIWYG!!! High quality brush and case! You can&#x27;t go wrong here at all! Hopefully they will last a real long time! Will update</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and the brushes work great and a very nice pouch to keep them in. Even come with plastic tube covers to protect the brush tips.</li>
            <li> It was very fast shipping, the product was exactly as I expected and at a very reasonable price. Highly recommended!!!! Haven&#x27;t used the brushes yet, but i&#x27;m super excited to!!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift and I know the recipient will be over-the-moon delighted with the assortment.  My only issue with the kit is that the pouch had an extremely strong chemical smell!  When I opened the clear plastic overwrap the odor was overwhelming.  Had to take off a star for that.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas, which she was very pleased, however, one brush was pretty bent up, not sure if it was a shipping damage, but nothing was wrong with my fedex box when received. It&#x27;s still usable but not fixable to straighten up. Other then that, the product is good :)</li>
            <li> I just recieved the brushes today and i love them!!!! they came quickly and they look like the pictures and they also came in the black case. I cant wait to use them and i hope to get a lot of use out of these in the years to come. :)</li>
            <li> I asked for these as a gift and was so excited to get them, but I&#x27;m new to nail art so I wish this kit came w.some sort of instruction manual for how to use the various brushes, although most seem self explanatory I have no idea what the 2 wide brushes are for. Brushes seem of good quality and the case is super handy. I definitely recommend to anyone looking to get into nail art.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3GHT0F4IWRAP9]]A quick look at the M.A.S.H Brush Set.</li>
            <li> I love nail art and found these brushes thinking they would be great (price and number won me over) I ordered them after seeing no bad comments... I now use them as regular paint brushes. The brushes fall off easily, they don&#x27;t work well with nail polish and it seems the dotting tool is the only one that works fairly well.</li>
            <li> Some of the pieces broke off after one use. Very disappointed. I was really excited to get this and then it broke, Just for removing the plastic covering...didn&#x27;t even get to use it and the brush fell off of the stick, made no sense.</li>
            <li> First result to pop up when i searched nail art brushes, and i had to look no further! i LOVE these brushes! i got them yesterday and i already broke into them. Having so much fun doing one-stroke nail art for my mom and i cant wait to try them on my friends and clients. Thank you soooooo much!&lt;br /&gt;The brushes came in their black pouch, which is so convenient. Each has a plastic protector to keep bristles in place. i noticed that the word M.A.S.H on the brush melted onto the black pouch, probably because its hot where i live, but that does not take away from the quality of the brush. Overall very satisfied!</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes about a week ago and was so excited to use them. The pack includes every kind of brush you&#x27;ll need for nail art. I&#x27;ve been using them constantly on my nails and these brushes have yet to let me down. They are GREAT quality brushes, and super easy to clean. I couldn&#x27;t be happier about the purchase and you can&#x27;t beat the price!!</li>
            <li> The brushes came quickly and I immediately used the dotting tool and the striper brushes!  The brushes were a bit hard but after soaking them in nail polish remover for a little bit they work great...glad I purchased!  The kit inlcudes every brush I can ever want to do nail art!</li>
            <li> Nice set of brushes, works well for nail art.  Good quality &amp; brush selection.  Would buy again, but I think these will last quite a while!!</li>
            <li> When I first saw this product I was so eager to purchase it! When it came in the mail I was estatic to do my nails!!! There is a brush for just about every type of design that is possible on a nail! I am giving it 4 stars because there are some brushes that I don&#x27;t even know what to do with. I would recommend this product to any creative nail artist! I also would recommend to the manufacturer that it should come with a manual showing the different functions of each brush!</li>
            <li> The brushes are a Christmas present and haven&#x27;t been used yet.  The package arrived quickly and the brushes look perfect for nail design.  Love the carry case ... well exceeded my expectations ... great value.</li>
            <li> My wife loves his item. She uses it all the time. She says she couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied. That bought me a couple hours of peace.</li>
            <li> This set of brushes is perfect for creating a host of design on your nails. I gave it to my granddaughter and she loves it. Wonderful product and didn&#x27;t break the bank! Thanks.</li>
            <li> When shipment was recived one of the brushes was bent.  Still the brushes will be a good gift set for anyone looking for an assortment of nail brushes.</li>
            <li> I had no expectations buying this. First of all, it does not come in that fancy back case, just a plastic bag. I use one of the brushes in there as an eyeliner brush for my gel liner, works very well. I&#x27;ve only used 2 brushes to make designs. It&#x27;s worth it for the price I guess. I wish there were better dotting tools..the one in here is really small so I still have to use the head of a bobby pin. Next time I will likely look for something else.</li>
            <li> So happy I purchased this set.  The brushes are beautiful and wear very well, even after washing. And there is a brush for everything!  From the fan brushes to thick blush or powder brushes to the thinnest eyeliner brush, this set has them all.  I&#x27;m so pleased with them I&#x27;m thinking of getting another set as a gift for a friend.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found a use for several of the brushes in  here, and (like most wood-handled brushes), the paint they are covered with dissolves in acetone. This gets messy sometimes. The case is handy for wrangling all of your brushes.</li>
            <li> When I bust out these brushes people think I&#x27;m fancy. The case is a huge bonus. Don&#x27;t think twice...buy these!! You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I received this quickly and in great condition.  The brushes are wonderful and I have a blast using them.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Hi,     i recently purchased this Nail Art brush set. It is really a perfect set for Nail Art. you can paint any designs you want. Worth the money you spend. And i love this kit....</li>
            <li> If you a beginner or are very good at nail art, you have to get these brushes. There is no way to get this amount of different brushes and pay this amount. Each one can be used in different ways, you will find a use for them all.</li>
            <li> A girl frend of mine find its good so far, she likes it, and she jinks its really ok so far</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my sister, along with a gel kit. She is a professional nail tech, so I will pass along her thoughts on this kit. She was pretty impressed by how much comes with this kit, and the quality of each brush. She thinks I paid alot more for it, so that must speak volumes about the quality for the price.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to see that this seller ships quickly, my order came in just like shown up online. Very happy! ^~^v</li>
            <li> Item better than described! Priced right. Fast shipping and well packed. Love the case and all the different brushes. Fits perfect in my nail train case.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my niece. I know she&#x27;ll love it. She loves doing her nals and I know this will be the perfect gift for her</li>
            <li> I was kind of unsure whether to buy these brushes or not by reading reviews that mentioned they didn&#x27;t recieve the black pouch as shown in the picture but i was glad to see that mine did . There was a minor error in which one of the brushes didn&#x27;t come with the plastic protecter , no biggie though . Shipping was also very fast . It only took three days . I do really recommend these brushes .</li>
            <li> These are ideal brushes for detailed nail designs.. I have bought 3 seperate sets of these brushes, and have ben using the first set for 3 months... They are very durable, and I don&#x27;t see me breaking into the other sets for a long time!! DEFINITELY RECOMMEND these to the nails artist out there!!!</li>
            <li> There are 15 different brush sizes here and they are ALL useful. I have had so much fun doing all kinds of designs on my nails with these. I also love that they come in their own pouch. Super nice for taking them to my friends houses and doing their nails as well. If you like to do crazy things on your nails the these are for you. Very happy.</li>
            <li> I love the brushes, they work really well. I use them weekly and so far the only fault I have come up with is that I would have liked something that tells me what design each brush is good for. I&#x27;ve pretty much figured it out now but the first few days I had them I spent a good amount of time just understanding which one did what.</li>
            <li> The set looks good and hope it will be useful and the brushes will nicely packed. I think it is a good product for the price.</li>
            <li> I love this item!!! Got to me in 2 days and the package was perfect!! It was what I expected and I will be purchasing more things from this company!!! Absolutely surprised that I got my package that fast.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift and I was disappointed when it arrived because the brand name that was stamped on the brushes was smudging off and smearing to the pouch that carries the brushes. I had to carefully remove it with nailpolish remover because it looked tacky.</li>
            <li> Arrived within days of ordering- just in time for Christmas.  Great starter kit- has variety of brushes.  My teen daughter will love and spend hours designing her nails.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I ordered the MASH Professional 15 piece Nail Art Brush Kit Set. When I received it, one of the pens was ruined. So I wanted to get a new one, it is a gift for my girlfriend, but they will only give me a refund instead of a return. I have ordered other MASH Nails items and they also have been received broken and able to return.</li>
            <li> excellent quality, nice case makes doing your own nails so fun and easy</li>
            <li> My brushes seem to be ok: no damage, no shedding so far. Brush case looks and feels extremely cheap, but I guess for $10 it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very VERY weak. When I first got the package I didn&#x27;t even open the kit and metal/bristle top part fell off. I was planning on giving them for a Christmas present, but I don&#x27;t know if I will or not.&lt;br /&gt;Also the case smells terribly. Bad, bad plastic smell.</li>
            <li> I bought this set to use for coloring or painting on fondant and this brush set worked well for what I needed it to do.</li>
            <li> The brushes were awesome!!!! I was so excited to use them when i got them! They came in a little plastic carry case and came just as shown in the picture! The only bad thing was the on the dotting brush the top came off but it was no biggie i just put it right back on! Totally worth it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my brushes to do my nails!!! It has made my life so much easier in designing my own creations! Love them!</li>
            <li> I got these brushes as a Christmas gift for someone.They are very nice.I am very pleased with the quality and the price of the brushes.I will definitely order from them again.</li>
            <li> everything in great condition and came right on time. usually i never get things on time but this came in the mail the exact date it said and was packed nicely</li>
            <li> my wife loved it. now it´s easier for to make the different designs on her nails, it´s great product at a great price, exactly how it looks on the picture and the shipping was on time. thanks.</li>
            <li> This looks and feels like a high quality set of brushes. It&#x27;s a Christmas gift so I will need to wait and see if she finds them satisfactory. I like the case and it looks like it will keep the brushes protected for many years. There certainly is enough of them to keep her busy. Yes, your nails look beautiful, dear.</li>
            <li> The quality of brushes was poor, they did not last !</li>
            <li> I received the brushes very fast and they are going to work great. Before I use them I was just wondering what other people have been doing for cleaning? Also, are you using nail polish or paint?</li>
            <li> Yes one came bent...read the info..it is supposed to be. People are mindless. It came im a nice package..brushes look great..one of the metal pieces holding the brush together&lt;br /&gt;With the wood came off already though. And I tried using the brushes..maybe its my base coat or the polish..but it doesnt spread nice at all for detailed work..and it didn&#x27;t come with instruction package which would be helpful. Ordering special ink for detail..hoping that works..it not at least I only wasted 9.99$</li>
            <li> Unrolling this baby makes me feel like nail-polish-Dexter. Awww yeeeeh.  But in seriousness, great product, came in perfect condition, just as advertised. A must have for any laquerista!</li>
            <li> I love these Nail Art Brush Kit Set. the price was great and I love all the brushes. I will recommend these kit. You will not find it anywhere else at these price. I am having fun with them.</li>
            <li> Great set! And yes, one brush is supposed to be bent. It&#x27;s not damaged! Hope they will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly   Excellent product for price   Used in Acetone and no damage to brushes  would recommend</li>
            <li> Im sooo happy to finally recieve my MASH nail tool kit. Its a great product. I can now do my nails and be as creative as I would like. The only problem I have so far is that one or two of the brushes were bent. This really disappointed me.</li>
            <li> It comes with every single brush in the picture. :) Initially, I thought it was strange that there were two fan brushes but they&#x27;re actually not identical. The white one is angled differently to create different effects. The longer brushes all came with caps for safe storage and there is a good size range between the various brushes. It&#x27;s okay if you lose a cap too because it comes with extras. The bristles look great and I did not experience any problems with the metal part of the brush coming off. I&#x27;ve bought ridiculously expensive paintbrushes at Michaels before and these seem to be just as good in terms of quality. Shipping was very fast. I received it much earlier than I had expected.</li>
            <li> I received my merchandise within 2 days of placing my order.   I will definitely be reodering in the future. They have fast and friendly service.</li>
            <li> The brushes work really well.  So far I&#x27;ve done leopard print and zebra print, and I got tons of compliments on both.    They arrived early, in good packaging, and they were super cheap.  Like another reviewer said, it would be nice if there was a guide that showed which brush did what, but I&#x27;ve been figuring it out through trial and error.    One thing I will say though, make sure you buy brush cleaner!  The nail polish doesn&#x27;t come out with remover (with or without acetone), and there&#x27;s nothing more frustrating than trying to paint with a brush whose bristles are stuck together with two week old polish. Plus, frequent cleaning will keep them in good condition. (One thing about cleaning: brush cleaner/acetone NP remover will take off the black paint on the brush handles.  So if you&#x27;re laying them out on a work table, make sure not to spill any cleaning solutions in the area because you&#x27;ll get black paint all over your hands when you go to pick them up.)</li>
            <li> Thanks alot its a Christmas gift for my wife. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to all Dont forget to tip your waiter / Waitress</li>
            <li> Ordered brushes and some were severely bent. I returned them and ordered a new set. Still had one bent. Would not order again. Perhaps the packaging?</li>
            <li> I bought this nail brush for the cheap price and the quantity. I&#x27;m new to the nail art game &amp; these brushes are good quality and easy to clean.  I&#x27;m still figuring out what to do with most of them but I look forward to experimenting with them for a long time.</li>
            <li> This really has everything I&#x27;d want for nail art. It&#x27;s inexpensive, and works rather well. I really have no complaints. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I bought these brushes about a week ago for my 13 year old daughter.  She is excited to use them. The quality seems very good.  Others have said the brushes are easy to clean. It&#x27;s nice to have the carry case to keep them organized.</li>
            <li> I like the brushes except one of them was bent when I got them. Also, I&#x27;m kind of bummed that I paid the same price for the brushes with the crappy plastic case as everyone who is getting the awesome new black case.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast. They are good quality. I like that they came in a plastic case and each brush has a plastic tube that goes over them to protected. Other than the fan brushes which is understandable. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> But I like to have all the equipment that is necessary for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;This one is one of those I rarely use, but will go crazy without.&lt;br /&gt;If you watch youtube tutorials, they actually use this brushes for design, I&#x27;ve only used one brush to clean up the messy polishes around nails.&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy having them eventhough I don&#x27;t use them much.&lt;br /&gt;Fairly good quality too</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just begun learning how to do nail art, and bought this set because of the well-deserved reviews, and like everyone else was pleased with my purchase.  Came in on time, in great condition.  The price is amazing for the variety of brushes you get.  Since I&#x27;m new to nail art, I&#x27;m uncertain what some are for, but that doesn&#x27;t matter.  I am overly pleased with this purchase! Love this product!!</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have gotten so far! I love doing my nails and using all the brushes in the kit.</li>
            <li> My brushes came in a white plastic pouch with a clear front...not in the black tri-fold as pictured &#x3D;(    So far the brushes themselves are fine. Why did I get the terrible pouch with all my brushes bunched up together??!</li>
            <li> All these items are going to my daughter on Christmas so not sure exactly how the quality is but looks good when I opened the box to wrap the items up.</li>
            <li> These are great and for the price they can&#x27;t be beat. The quality is really nice and I love all the different brush sizes and options. Im very pleased with my purchase and am becoming a HUGE fan of the MASH line of products.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start this out by saying that I&#x27;m a dude who bought this kit for my female friend, who recently got into nail polish and designing.  I figured this kit would help her with her creativity.  As an early Christmas present, I have already given it to her. She loves it.  A little stiff on a few of the brushes, but otherwise a great brush set for starting out.</li>
            <li> Nice selection of brushes, however the metal pieces on some of the brushes were bent and dented. The case was kund of flimsy, but there are a lot of different brushes to use. This is for a gift.</li>
            <li> This was a new brand For me and i was unsure if i was going to like it  I don&#x27;t, i love it  so do my daughters  Fast shipping, great items.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> WoW that was fast...here in 24hrs! You just cant go wrong with this one. It got me through the holidays with ease! We had every brush we needed to create buautiful holiday nail art:) LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I have a 10-yr-old niece who LOVES to do her nails. When I saw this brush set and saw all the good reviews, I knew I had to get this for her for Christmas 2011. It turned out to be a hit with her. She loved it and was so excited to have it. We looked at some easy tutorials on YouTube and she painted some flower designs on my fingernails. She was so proud! The product is good quality and the case it convenient and nice quality as well. The brushes were easy to clean afterwards, as well. Shipping was super-fast and arrived quickly. I would recommend this to anyone who loves doing nails!</li>
            <li> Such a wonderful brush set! Easy for me to use and they came packaged well and neat. They clean up well with acetone or water depending on if you used paint or polish.</li>
            <li> They are perfect condition and I know one is bended but I think that&#x27;s the way it&#x27;s supposed to be as I seen some like that before. I love the case and the protective top. Can&#x27;t wait to start using this product will be buying from mash again! Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I am very upset with this item. I really wanted this because most the reviews I read were good and I&#x27;ve been wanting nail art brushes. When I received my package everything was nice until I noticed that one brush was bent. I called the number on the MASH profile and the guy told me there was nothing he could do since I ordered from amazon and I needed to contact amazon. So I did that, the woman I talked to was very helpful and explained I could send back and get a refund and she was sorry my brush was damaged. My mother went ahead and ordered one for me so I wouldn&#x27;t have to wait with the whole return process on mine. When we received her package the EXACT same brush was damaged!!! Coincidence? I think not! The guy I had talked to at the MASH place explained that they sent amazon packages of theses and when people ordered amazon would send them out. I believe that MASH had sent amazon a bad batch and amazon just keeps sending out bad ones due to the fact that is all they have and don&#x27;t relize it. I&#x27;ve very up set that MASH will not help out since so many people are getting bad batches and they push it off on amazon, but amazon should start checking if they have so many complaints!! I&#x27;m about to just head on over to bundle monter and buy them from them! They haven&#x27;t let me down yet!!!</li>
            <li> Love this collection and the case sealed the deal. All this for the price was a great deal. Product as described/</li>
            <li> love using my brushes.  they work great. love the small tips great for fine detailed designs. only problem was a couple of my tips came off. but nothing glue wont fix</li>
            <li> I USE THIS SET EVERY WEEK. THE BRUSHES WORK GREAT AND THE POUCH IT COMES IN HOLDS EVERYTHING TOGETHER. PLUS IT CAN HOLD MORE. I USE IT TO STORE MY DOTTING TOOLS AS WELL. IT&#x27;S A GREAT BUY.</li>
            <li> I love painting with my brush kit set! My kids enjoy all the designs I am making on their nails and my own!</li>
            <li> The brushes were a disappointment. Before even touching a brush, the carrying case was already stuck to the brushes which caused smudging imprints on the brush handles. Mind you, I was very gentle when opening it up. Then I went for the first brush from the left. It was stuck inside the little pocket so I carefully peeled it from the sides of the pockets before pulling it out. Again, more smudged varnish marks. Then I pulled open the protective cap of the brush and the entire head with the metal handle came off! The rest of the brushes were stuck to their respective pockets too but only the first brush&#x27;s head came off when I pulled open their protective caps. And the fan brushes looked really cheap and made haphazardly: really thin and crooked hairs. You can pretty much be sure that I returned this defective item. As others have stated, there was no choice of an exchange.</li>
            <li> This set shipped fast and is very nice for so cheap!! Would highly reccommend them!! The case is a nice one and each brush has its on top to keep the brushes nice after each use</li>
            <li> My daughter is beginning to do nail art and this was the perfect product for her....very professional![[ASIN:B005BG02BU MASH Professional 15 piece Nail Art Brush Kit Set]]</li>
            <li> These brushes help you make a lot of nail designs. I would recommend them.</li>
            <li> The product comes in a very good tri fold case, very professional. The only problem was that once I opened it a very strong paint odor came out and when I tried to take the brushes out, they were al stuck to the case, it looks like either they didn&#x27;t let it dry before putting inside of the case or they were under a huge amount of heat on their way here.....who knows!? But overall, they do what they&#x27;re supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it but I suggest the manufacturers to change the painting method or let them dry perfectly before packaging.</li>
            <li> Its been a year and a half since I bought these! (Just now starting to write reviews)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still use and love these brushes. By now the black paint has worn out near the brush heads, but that doesn&#x27;t affect performance.  The case is great, and I even squeezed my dot tools in there tightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The previous reviewer complained about cleaning solution, I have never needed any. I use straight acetone and then dab on a paper towel or pantyliner, I never runt he brush under water. It works, I am happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still don&#x27;t know what the fan brush is for though......</li>
            <li> I just recieved this kit about a week ago and so far its been great. I&#x27;m new to the whole nail art scene. I&#x27;m unemployed and bored. Thought I would start a new hobby and why not nail art? I used to do my nails with the brushes that came with the polish and that took forever!!! Now with these brushes,there is such an assortment and the sky is the limit. I can do some cool details. My first was zebra stripes!! What fun that was, I had a ton of compliments. I also love the dotting tool that comes with it. I made dots on my toes that look kinda like cheetah prints. You can spread them around, let them dry then add another dot inside. AWESOME. I&#x27;m trying my hand at palm trees for my daughter next. I did a fade of sunset colors on her hand and thought that would be neat.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, these brushes seem strong and ready to take on the task of many painting adventures, but like I said I&#x27;ve only had them for a little over a week. I love them so far. They even came in a nice plastic case. It will work until I find something better to store them  in. Good luck to all you Nail Crazy Fashionistas out there.</li>
            <li> I have very recently gotten into nail art and have made a hobby out of it. I usually worked with bobby pins, toothpicks, dried out pens when doing detailing on my nails. Though my nails did come out very well, my friends suggested to me that I get a proper set of nail art brushes.   This was one of the first sets I found and I gawked at the price at first because it was such a good deal for the number of brushes I was getting. It was around 8USD or so for 15 brushes! It was on Amazon Prime which meant free shipping as well for me.   I wasn&#x27;t disappointed either when I received them! It came right on time and everything was in perfect condition. I did read some reviews which did mention how the tip of the dotter tool fell off for some people which gave me some cause for worry, but it seems that I have received a good set and nothing has broken yet.   I love using these brushes now (though I still use bobby pins from now and then) and they make my nail art look so much cleaner and easier! I definitely recommend them for people who are looking into nail art as a fun hobby!</li>
            <li> I recieved my item, I love it. It came quick with Prime, and it look exactly like the picture. The brushes are GREAAAAAAATTTTTTT.</li>
            <li> Awesome fast shipping! good product. I enjoyed the ease of these tools, great for first timers or those looking to have fun with nails!</li>
            <li> One of the brushes arrived bent.  I guess for the money I should have realized it wasn&#x27;t going to be anything special. It would be good to include something with it that would picture what you could do with the brushes.  It&#x27;s a gift for a teenaged girl so hopefully she will know enough about it to use it appropriately.  I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> The brushes come in a lovely tri-fold soft leatherette case with two magnetic snaps and the MASH logo on one side. Each brush has it&#x27;s own pocket to slide into, making storage and protection easy as pie. Each brush, other than the two fan brushes, also has a plastic sleeve over the bristles to help keep them straight and protected. The bristles are well connected to the handles and feel like they will last a long time. The brushes are very light weight and comfortable to hold. They are long enough to be used easily but not so long they are unwieldy. Overall, an excellent product and a purchase I would definitely make again.</li>
            <li> I love this set but wish I had gone for a glass or crystal handled set. I accidentally spilled acetone on this set and now the brush handles are ruined. I wish they had used acetone resistant paint or plastic....</li>
            <li> These brushes are a great quality product. The bristles are soft and do not shed. The handles are sturdy and easy to hold. They are easy to clean and dry fast. The dotting tool is made from high quality metal and will last forever. I am very happy I chose to purchase this set over the other ones I considered buying.</li>
            <li> I bought this item as a gift to my girlfriend and she just love it, now she can paint her nails herself, was a great unexpected gift to her</li>
            <li> The brushes are amazing. I&#x27;m new at nail art and have been using thin nail art polishes and have been able to do certain designs but these brushes just opened up a wide variety of much more I can learn...one thing though be careful cleaning them try not to get acetone on the wood part of the brush the black covering will melt right off. Great purchase all the way around. Love the carrying case.</li>
            <li> I have had these brushes for about a month and used them several times. I am by no means a professional, but I wanted to learn how to do a few fun things for myself. The brushes have been pretty good, I have had trouble with the actual handle of the bushes - if you get acetone on them the black paint starts to come off. But I don&#x27;t mind because that&#x27;s not really important to me. For the price though, this is a pretty good set.</li>
            <li> I love my brush kit set.  I have done many new designs on my nails.  I no longer have to have them done.</li>
            <li> Nice set. Seller replaced a couple of brushes that were damaged.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, good quality, inexpensive for home or professional use. No issues with this set and what a money saver! I&#x27;d definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know HOW this product got so many good reviews?? The ball point tip of the dotting tool broke off just when I took the plastic off of it. So mad and it only came with one! After the first use of 3 of the brushes, the bristles came apart and they were completely worthless to try and use again. I&#x27;ve tried everything to take care of them, but you get what you pay for I guess. In the TRASH is where they went! NOW I&#x27;m on the hunt for QUALITY Professional brushes!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get such a great deal on these brushes!! They worked ok for there price but when I went to clean the polish off I got a little acetone on the black part and it started to come OFF!!! It made a Hugh mess and I to take it all off otherwise it was sticky and messy!! It was such a disappointment!!!! I posted a picture with what they look like without the black finish!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it came with everything that was said(and therefore nothing was missing)...but it isnt as good quality as I expected it to be. What I liked is that the case and brushes are decent size, which  make it easy to store anywhere.</li>
            <li> I personally love these brushes. The money you pay for them is well worth it. There are so many different types of brushes in this set. From stripers to fan to a dotting tool. I think a beginner would love these and a seasoned nail tech like me would enjoy this set also.</li>
            <li> Came with everything I wanted. The black paint does come off a bit if you have nail polish remover on your hands. The brushes work well and can be cleaned with remover.</li>
            <li> Finger nail polish remover also removes the finish on these brushes (I had never had nail art brushes before). I used them for their intended purpose when I first got them, but now I find myself using them for my paintings! They make great small-sized brushes.</li>
            <li> this mash professional 15 piece nail brush kit set was awesome. i love that it came with all these usable brushes with a small price.i would recommed this to a friend</li>
            <li> I use this every day since I do my nails every day!!! Hasn&#x27;t failed me!! Just be careful not to get acetone on the handles because they will get messed up and not look pretty but they serve their purpose!! I love the case!!</li>
            <li> just what I wanted to help me in my nail design. great case and easily cleaned also. good variety of brushes too</li>
            <li> Variety of brushes, dotters, etc. Too many tools for her to really know what to do with. A great buy for the price.</li>
            <li> I loved all the different brushes! Came in the black case and the brushes in good quality. Now I just have to learn to use the brushes correctly :-)</li>
            <li> These were a gift so I have no personal use experience. They did arrive brand new and packaged exactly as shown and described. They do seems to be good quality and the hairs did not pull out when I checked them. Satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it can be hard to find good, quality brushes, but these ones are excellent. I also love the variety of brushes.  I would absolutely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have seen better ones...</li>
            <li> These brushes are not good quality at all. I had several designs in mind to so but these are to cheaply made to do them with. The first time I went to clean these half the bristles fell out at least. I was extremely gentle. Also the case is very cheap when I recieve it, the case was stuck to the brushes and literally peeled off. Pieces of the case were and still are stuck to the brushes. Currently researching other brands.</li>
            <li> so nice, great selection and worked well, nice case as well.</li>
            <li> It came faster than expected. It was a good price. Some of the brushes won&#x27;t get polish on them or won&#x27;t make any designs on nails.</li>
            <li> They are great. Be careful though acetone makes the paint come off the handle and its hard to clean brushes with out using pure acetone.</li>
            <li> Dont like them at all threw them away not good product.</li>
            <li> as described. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I got these although I&#x27;m not a nail technician but now I can recreate some designs I have seen with practice using these nicely constructed brushes</li>
            <li> The package came in on time. I bought this kit as a gift for my wife and she loved it. She is able to do the fancy things that a salon would charge money for.</li>
            <li> Although I loved the variety and quality of the brushes, and the convenient case to store them in, cleaning nail polish off of these babies is no easy task. Anything with acetone in it will strip the hell out of the brush handles, and turn your hands into a black, sticky mess. Still, the price is right, and if you get a non-acetone brush cleaner, you&#x27;ll be golden. I personally haven&#x27;t had a problem since I switched cleaners.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes for my nail art.</li>
            <li> Great product--my friend loved it as a gift. Now just to figure out how to possibly use 15 different brushes for nail art...</li>
            <li> I bought this to use when doing nail art. The item came quickly. All items are as shown. The only thing I&#x27;ve began to notice when using it is that  the brushes I&#x27;ve used so far fall off the wooden handle. Extra glue and pliers help this problem to be solved. Other than that this is a good product.</li>
            <li> I like these, and use them, however, the black finish will come off in a brush cleaner if you aren&#x27;t careful. Not a problem - more of a cosmetic issue for how the brush looks. I have been able to do some fun designs. I mostly practice right now and havent done much on my own nails.</li>
            <li> My Giftee seemed to love it. . But as for the utilization ability, I cannot fairly give you my evaluation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Renee evers</li>
            <li> These brushes were a great buy at an even better price.  I am a casual nail artist at home and they are more than sufficient for my use.  I use these with nail polish and with acrylic craft paints to make my designs and they work just fine.  They clean well with polish remover.</li>
            <li> I love love love these brushes! they are perfect for those really tine detailing designs to do! and you get 15 for 8 bucks! anywhere else your looking at 20 dollars for just half of as many as you get! so many sizes and lengths! also Loveeee that it came with a marbling tool! I have been  looking for one of those! all in all another awesome buy from M.a.s.h. so inexpensive and still great quality!. I&#x27;m very pleased and happy I had purchased this item!  5 stars all the way!</li>
            <li> Loved this set best quality and price. My first design with these were mistletoe I also bought rhinestone and the fimo canes from Mash. Mash has great quality products for a great price and I will continue buying from them. I especially love the case the brushes come in and they are easy to clean. Since I have 2 sets of brushes one is for the acrylic paints and nail polish the other is for the washable paints. Using washable paints to do nail art is easier if your afraid to do a mistake you dont have to start over just comes off with water just make sure to add a base coat and when done a top coat :) have fun being creative with these brushes you have no limit.</li>
            <li> I just purchased these brushes and I am really impressed! The case is pretty nice and the brushes are all great. The price is wonderful. Great product!</li>
            <li> I bought this set of brushes for my daughter, she loves to do her nails and is trying to learn how to paint designs on them.  This set is the best value for great, professional brushes!  The black brush case is fantastic it has a slot for every brush and folds up like an envelope so it easily slides into her nail stuff container without taking up a lot of space. She absolutely loves this set she feels like a professional!  The shipping was fast too, I chose standard shipping and it arrived 2 days before expected!  I will definately purchase from them again!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this as a gift this christmas, and it looks substantial and like it cost more than it did (I was a bit leary, but so far MASH has not let me down), but i&#x27;ll have to keep you posted.</li>
            <li> The item shipped and was received very quickly. The description of the item is exactly what was received. I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with the promptness and condition of the item. Packaging was more than adequate for protection. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is a great brush set for someone who loves nail art. It is exactly what i was looking for, and i would definitely recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> One of the brushes were bent and broken, no time to exchange this is for a christmas gift.  I will give the person the option to exchange or return.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for my 12 year old daughter.  She absolutely loves it.  She&#x27;s been having \\&quot;nail parties\\&quot; with all her friends and we are seeing that she is quite a talented nail artist.  She says the brushes are what brings that talent out.  Definitely worth it!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool . I got this super fast and it was in perfect condition.It has 15 brushes in it and one of them is bent but it&#x27;s supposed to be. I love it</li>
            <li> I love my brush kit I use it all the time My nails are my hobby and this kit has helped me in my learning process</li>
            <li> Looooove this!! The only downside is that the case smells like moth balls really bad at first. Open it up, air it out maybe outside for a few days and it will be fine. All of the brushes are soft and good quality. I use them every day on my face and I love them. There are 3 larger brushes for blush and powder, enough middle sized brushes for eye shadows, etc.. and a lot of smaller ones for eye liners. It&#x27;s easy to wrap them up for traveling. I love them.</li>
            <li> This is very low quality. The paint comes off if you clean it with acetone. The tops fall of of the wooden handles and they stink of chemicals.  You can find a better set of nail art brushes for cheaper. There are also a lot of pointless brushes.</li>
            <li> Cheap kit. Sucky quality. Good fir just starting out.</li>
            <li> I got it as a gift, but my netetr half seems to like it a lot.  Construction seems OK too.</li>
            <li> Using it for all kind of purposes, great quality and value, had the kit now for over a year and still feels and looks like new!! (didn&#x27;t rate right away)</li>
            <li> I recently got these. I am pleased with the brushes, but expected the black case they are shown in also. Nope. They came in a small white plastic packet. Was disappointed with that, but the brushes seem to be very nice. I did send the seller a question about the case and got no answer. It&#x27;s all cool. I can&#x27;t wait to use them for some fancy stuff. I didn&#x27;t use them immediately &#x27;cause I had just done my nails. Oh well....in a couple of days maybe....</li>
            <li> These are my first nail art brushes, so I dont have anything to compare them to, but I LOVE these brushes! They are great, they get the job done well, and they were pretty inexpensive for such a large set. Im particularly fond of the striping brushes. I use them the most, and they havent let me down yet!  I cant say if this is a great set for pros, cause I just dont know what pros are looking for, but for beginners, this is definately a wonderful set!!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a small gift for my girlfriend who has recently gotten into painting designs on her nails. Good simple kit, she has used almost all of the brushes and loves it. It&#x27;s not super high quality but you can&#x27;t really expect that with such a low price. For what I spent I am extremely satisfied and so is my girlfriend!</li>
            <li> I still have not found a good way to clean these brushes after dipping them into nail polish. One of the brushes is already stained blue from the first use... They might work better if they were not so stiff after i use them (even after I clean them in nail polish remover).</li>
            <li> I am doing nail art nonstop on my own nails and my friends&#x27; nails also. They work perfectly and they came a day before expected!!</li>
            <li> everthing wasnt with the kit but oh well thats a chance u gotta take when ordering on line</li>
            <li> I ordered this product by M.A.S.H on Sunday And It Came The Following Thursday! Pretty Fast Shipping! It probably would have came on Wednesday but it was the 4th of July so there was no mail. I have used most of the brushes just playing around with it. I think there really nice and I love it! The only thing I wish they would have included was a little mini Instructions showing what each brush is used for! It is hard to know what each brush is used for unless your like a pro nail artist. It would be super helpful. other than that i love this product! And yes one of the brushes are suppose to be bent! I love the case! Its so cute! so if your going away on vacation for a couple of weeks you can bring your nail art with you!! lolz!I would reccomend this set! I love It!</li>
            <li> These brushes are awesome. For the 15 brushes you cant beath the price. They were shipped fast. Cant wait to try new nail designs with them.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!!! I had a difficult time trying to find a set of brushes that included all the ones needed to paint designs on nails, but I finally found this one.  What I really liked about this set is that each brush came with a protective cover to make sure the brushes stay in good condition.  They clean easily with a small amount of nail polish remover... just be careful not to get the polish remover on the wood, as it removes the black paint from the brushes.</li>
            <li> I already did a couple of designs people asked me where I&#x27;m doing my nails! And I even don&#x27;t draw good on paper, but with this brushes and youtube tutorials I did great, totally recommended! Even when some on the brushes unasemble from the handle, i just adjusted them a bit more and that&#x27;s it, love them! And like the case and that every brush has a plastic protective tip, so you can store them without preocupation.</li>

            <li> [[ASIN:B005BG02BU MASH Professional 15 piece Nail Art Brush Kit Set]] was ordered and arrived fast! It was ordered as a Christmas present for my daughter who loves to decorate her nails so I know she will find this set very useful and add to her nail creativity! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I received this for Christmas, along with about all my other nail supplies, and it is exactly what it looks like in the picture &amp; exactly everything I need to do my nail artwork! The black pouch is really nice and not so huge so it&#x27;s good for storage. It comes with so many brushes &amp; the quality looks good enough for me to use to do nail art! Love it &amp; can&#x27;t wait to start using it!</li>
            <li> I had been looking for nail brushes for quite a while and when i saw these I just had to have them especially at that price, when I got them I wasn&#x27;t hoping for them to be perfect but to get the job done, but they are absolutley perfect</li>
            <li> I love this set. I didn&#x27;t know what to do with all the brushes, but it&#x27;s not hard to figure it out. Some of them are good to use as makeup brushes. I have used two of them so far for that. In the end I love it! :)</li>
            <li> Really nice product for the price...wish there were a few size dotting tools and small detail brushes but overall great value.</li>
            <li> Has every tool you may want to use on your nail art. I totally recommend it if you want to get creative.</li>
            <li> Quite a few brushes! I like the case and the brushes are holding up well!</li>
            <li> Okay brushes for the price.  Nice little case--nicer than brushes.  A variety here--great for the beginner.  Happy with purchase, just wish brushes were a little better quality.</li>
            <li> This brush kit is awesome! It&#x27;s very chic and professional looking. The brushes are of excellent quality. The holder is just ... freakin&#x27; awesome. Material is nice and durable, the snaps are magnetic, the brush bristles are nice and don&#x27;t fray or poke out everywhere (except the fan brushes, but they&#x27;re supposed to). Very, very nice set. I&#x27;m once again very impressed with MASH. I highly recommend these brushes to nail artists everywhere.</li>
            <li> by purchasing this set, I am able to do my own nails, and it is much cheaper then going to the shop.  Its a money saver also.  Just require patience when doing your nails, but you can definitely get that same salon look.</li>
            <li> i bought this and i do nails and those brushes is like for real pain not for nail work, i used it end it didn&#x27;t do right work or designs. so end up giving it to daughter to paint.</li>
            <li> Bought for a friend who loves to do nail art, she loved this. Decent quality, very professional looking. I feel like the brushes could have been a little better quality but I am more knowledgeable about paint brushes for painting on canvas as opposed to nail art brushes. Seem to work well. Came timely, good price.</li>
            <li> I saw this and had to have it because of the great value. There are so many brushes in this kit, I&#x27;m pretty excited to get to using it. While I&#x27;m not a professional, and I don&#x27;t know what each brush is used for, I can see the potential for lots of different uses.</li>
            <li> These brushes work great for nails.  Lots of different sizes, perfect for all kinds of detail work.  Highly recommend, very good product at a very good price.</li>
            <li> Great product! The variety of brush tips is a great way to help you be creative. Aside from the great quality of the brushes, the fact that they come nearly organized in a pouch is very convenient too! My nail polish case is neatly organized now, AND if I get paint on the pouch it create an \\&quot;artsy\\&quot; look which is cool too!  Overall, great buy!!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo5X0036BEY8TJ]]I haven&#x27;t actually used these brushes yet but here is an up close look at each brush you get.&lt;br /&gt;Besides what I&#x27;ve said in the video, the shipping on these was extremely quick. I got them earlier then the earliest arrival day! That was with the free super saver shipping (5-8 days) I ordered mine the 14th at night got them the morning of the 18th!</li>
            <li> I ordered this item not expecting much because normally I am not very good at nails. It is really fantastic I gave my sisters and mother manicures with precision and ease. I also bought the nail rhinestones and dotting tools and I could not recommend them more. Yes one of the brushes is bent but that is on purpose. My only complaint is the m.a.s.h. logo is wearing off but it doesn&#x27;t affect the usefulness or quality of the brushes.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and easy to use. The little organizer they come in keeps dust out and is a great way to store them. They pair very well with the MASH dotting tool set. Arrived very quickly and were just as described. I work in a grocery store bakery and as a result of the work I do on my mails with these brushes and tools I now have a side job of doing my customer&#x27;s and their daughter&#x27;s nails! Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Great quality brushes for an even better price! i love the carrying case protects my brushes while they are put away</li>
            <li> Okay so yeah... these brushes are a bit cheap looking, but who cares! They work great!! This is my first brush set. I will be using them quite a bit.</li>
            <li> Love this set! Received in a timely manner too. Any brush you should ever need is in this set.</li>
            <li> I spilled my nail polish remover on one of these brushes while I was carefully painting my nails.  When I picked it up, my hand was completely coated in the black finish on these brushes.  No easy feat to get off when your nails are wet! It seems like a product that will most likely come in contact with nail polish remover should be resistant to it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife for her work.&lt;br /&gt;She said these are the cheapest she had ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very unfortunate to gift this.</li>
            <li> I recently just got into doing nail art &amp; needed a set, I ran across this one. The price was unbelievable! Most places has them for 50-80$ maybe more! So I was kind of skeptical of the quality, but I gave it a try. The product came 4 days earlier then expected! Nothing was broken &amp; was packed nicely. They are perfect! I would highly recommend these brushes!</li>
            <li> I felt that this product was extremely useful and helps me spice up my basic manicures! Worth the money and produces a professional-like finish!! Definitely would recommend the product to anyone in need. (:</li>
            <li> I bought this particular item because I wanted nail art tools to to help me learn how to do nail art without spending a lot of money! Well this is a very good buy and what you see is exactly what you get. The first time I used the brushes I was impressed on how easy they clean up...but...the black paint on the brushes easly comes off in brush cleaner or nail polish remover....so be careful with that...also they&#x27;re easily bent so that&#x27;s something else to be careful about...HOWEVER for the money and for novice users it&#x27;s a good deal until you&#x27;re ready to invest in more expensive durable items....</li>
            <li> Some brushes broke when I got them. There are some really nice detail brushes but overall it is average. I like the case though.</li>
            <li> Good looking product. The brushes will be used to create a lot of drawings on nails. They will serve this purpose well.</li>
            <li> Ohhh the fun I have been having :)&lt;br /&gt;Love these brushes, having the case to keep them organized is a great bonus!&lt;br /&gt;I loving doing nail art and these have been wonderful - Doing so many  of the cute designs I have seen on line!&lt;br /&gt;LOVE LOVE LOVE THEM!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great set. The brushes do their job, and give me a wide range of tools that encourage my creativity. I&#x27;ve really enjoyed working with this brushes, and creating awesome nail art. Just keep in mind that nail polish remover will strip the pretty black paint on the brush handles. So, be careful.</li>
            <li> I received these brushes pretty quickly. I was thrilled to get started using them with my nail art. Now a few things, when I received the brushes, one of them was bent at the metal part. Okay, no big deal I just bent it back using pliers. Another thing, I use the brushes for nail art, so obviously they&#x27;re being dipped in acetone/remover etc. I noticed that the tips of the brushes started dissolving... and the finish of the brush handles comes off on your hands if you have remover on your fingers, revealing plain wood. I understand the kit was only $9.99... but come on.. I expected some quality. This is MASH we&#x27;re talking about here.</li>
            <li> These are great brushes.  I don&#x27;t use them for my nails, I use them for painting with oil paints on canvas to get into small places and they are wonderful.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend, so I didn&#x27;t get to actually use the brushes. however the quality of the brushes looked really good same with the black case. It looked very professional. Also good price for the product, and good quality for a gift !</li>
            <li> I bought this for the wife . She has been using it for several months now with no trouble ..&lt;br /&gt;seems to be a good product !! would buy it again .</li>
            <li> I love the assortment you get with this and the case is great. Looking forward to better nail art now. Shipped super fast. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Very good quality I have a slight problem with the silver coming off the stick but it goes on and stays for awhile</li>
            <li> They looked pretty when they arrived, but when I opened the package, the lacquer on the handles stuck to the upper flap of the bag and damaged the handles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They looked pretty otherwise, but I got another brand that was only 2-3 dollars more, and those worked better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m nowhere near a skilled nail tech I just like experimenting the hairs from the brush kept falling out getting stuck in the wet polish</li>
            <li> The brushes work great and they are like regular paint brushes, not the cheap bristles but there is one thing that is a problem. Don&#x27;t get any nail polish remover on your fingers and then grab your nail art brush, the black handle is painted on and will be removed where ever the nail polish fingers are from. Other then that I would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t yet used them, but they seem to fall out of their casing. And they are very thin. (used thicker ones before) I love how many colors and designs you get though.</li>
            <li> i just got my nail brushes today i was so excited and they were in good condition im excited to start using them ! :)</li>
            <li> The brushes are all good except tht it would have been better if they had brush no on it as well the name.</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife for a gift, she really liked them, the case has magnetic buttons on the inside to hold it closed, there was a small tear on the inner seam, but that was ok you couldn&#x27;t see it.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I thought I&#x27;d get into nail art. The package arrived very quick.&lt;br /&gt;I like the case it came in, it&#x27;s very easy to carry around and hold all the items.&lt;br /&gt;The quality is OK, I took off one of the plastic covers for the dotter and the hole dotter metal head came off along with the package but was easily fixed.&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is a good product and worth the price I paid for it. I would recommend it to anyone looking to get into nail art!!</li>
            <li> These Brushes Are Exactly What It Says On The Description They arrived A Day Earlier Than They Were Supposed To And Came in a Nice Bubble Wrapped Envelope. Each Came With There own plastic cover ( Except Both fan Brushes) Ive Used All Brushes Already And No Bristles Have Come Off Also Ive Tugged On The Bristles And Theyre NOT Coming Loose! Ive Seen That people Cant Take The Polish off With nail Polish Remover? I Have, It Comes Off Quick And Easy i use Nail Polish Remover With Acetone (walgreens) And it Works Like A Charm. The Case looks nice its sturdy and the brushes are secure. I Am Also A begginner In Nail art And it Helps Me TREMENDOUSLY with making perfectly straight lines and cute designs!  These Brushes are of great quality and there at a great price! i do recommend to everyone!Begginers too!</li>
            <li> love the brushes still alittle confused about the fan looking brushes but ive done alot of designs only thing about this that i dont like that it came with that teeny tiny dotting tool....but i did just purchase a set of dotting tools..otherwise i love the brushes and the cute case that it is in.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my sister and she loved them great for nail art gives you a clean professional look and the seem to be long lasting.They have different brushes for different designs styles it even came with a marbling tool.</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to get these in the email today. I do a lot of nail art and have not had very good tools to do it with so this was pretty exciting to have the right tools. These are great for the price. They do come in the little case shown in the picture and the whole case was wrapped in bubble wrap when I received it. There was a pretty strong smell when I opened the case but I&#x27;m hoping that will go away after some time. I only used 1 brush so far and it seemed to work ok. There were a couple hairs that were longer than the rest that dragged a bit. But the rest of the brushes look pretty good. And I should be able to trim the few on that particular brush before its next use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all I&#x27;m pretty happy with this purchase and for the price you really can&#x27;t beat it. Even considering shipping it was only around $1 per brush. : )</li>
            <li> It is a complete amount of tools.&lt;br /&gt;I will use all of it.&lt;br /&gt;I am glad a have it&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> This is a terrific little starter set.  I had it for about a month before my daughter fell in love with it and I opted for one with dotting tools.</li>
            <li> Really a great deal. They were packed when the paint was wet and it smudged on the wood but it&#x27;s no biggie. The rest of the product was in good shape. Love that they came in the case. Should last if cared for. We used the brushes already. I cleaned them with nail polish remover but some nail polish stained the brush bristles. Still very usable!!!</li>
            <li> the brushes work great, but while using them, the black paint on the handles starts to rub off on your fingers &amp; get a little sticky. That&#x27;s pretty annoying. Especially if you are doing a nail design that takes a decent amount of time &amp; a steady hand. Not bad for the cost I guess.</li>
            <li> A few stray hairs needed to be removed before I used a couple of these brushes, besides that, a great set for the price!  If you are looking for an inexpensive nail brush set, look no further!! One side note, be careful with these brushes around your nail polish remover because the black painted handles will no longer be painted black...but that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> These where a great starter set for nail art. I loved them... they will mess up if you get remover on the shaft/handles I haven&#x27;t had any problems with them falling apart and I have had them about a year. the ones I can find are still very handy.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great so far! I&#x27;ve only used a couple so far and they are so holding up none of them have gotten hard or hard to use do to use. In a couple months I&#x27;ll come back to re-review if that changes.</li>
            <li> i was happy when this product arrived on time. i&#x27;m not so happy how when it&#x27;s exposed around acetone the color on the handle goes with it.</li>
            <li> i love doing my nails. and this product allows me to do more difficult nail art than i usually can. very well made ! arrives before it says.</li>
            <li> I ordered several nail art tools at the same time and I have not yet used these brushes. The quality appears to be ok. The case is a little generic compared to some of the others but still ok.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set a couple of weeks ago.  Everything in the package is as pictured...I just doubt that the brushes will last long, the set seems to not be very durable.  First, when I opened the pouch for the first time, the flap covering the brushes was sticking to the handles.  So much so that when I peeled it open, a portion of the paint or covering of the brush handles was stuck to the pouch!  The handles of the brushes were then marked slightly.  Then, after using one of the brushes with polish, I grabbed some remover on a cotton ball and was swabbing it clean.... and the BLACK PAINT on the handles came off onto the cotton ball (and my fingers)!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes look and function as intended...but whomever designed this set should have used other materials for the handles.  The black painted finish is not practical.</li>
            <li> Hbkhb jhb jhb jhb jhb khb khb khb khbk hbjh bib I bkj bkj b hbjh I hbkhb. Bi gib</li>
            <li> If you use any of these brushes for acetone touch-ups, BEWARE that the black finish will start to come off almost immediately on your hands or anything else you accidentally touch. These brushes are pretty cheaply made--the bristles are constantly falling out, and the metal piece connecting the brush to the handle fell off of one--but they serve my purposes as an amateur nail artist well enough. I would definitely invest a little more in my next set, though.</li>
            <li> i never bought these, this is a mistake</li>
            <li> The art didn&#x27;t turn out good in my opinion. Plus, the brushes wouldn&#x27;t come clean easily. Also, the bristles fell out after using them multiple times or soaking them while cleaning.</li>
            <li> Its amazing to get good quality brushes for so low price and on top of that i got the pouch to protect them?!!! Dont get better than that!</li>
            <li> I like the different style of brushes that come in the kit.&lt;br /&gt;You can do a variety of designs with the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;The price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Great for all types of things beside nails</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister as a gift. Received it and noticed that every single brush had damage to it. It looked as if the brushes were painted, and then packaged before being fully dry...so when you open it, you notice the imprint of the case on each of the nail brush&#x27;s paint. I emailed customer service. They were very pleasant. They sent me another. I was satisfied, until I received the new set of brushes. They had the exact same problem. By this time, there was no point to contact customer service because the gift was being given in 2 days. Needless to say, I bought something else. Customer service was nice, but the product remained the same....damaged. No thanks.</li>
            <li> some of them worked swell- overall they were alright..good enough. the brushes could break easily though, just saying :P that was my issue</li>
            <li> i love the case they come with it fits them perfect and nice material, havnt tried all the brushes but seem to work very good</li>
            <li> Great variety of brushes. Some I haven&#x27;t figured out how to use but they look like professional painters brushes, not just nail brushes.</li>
            <li> no good . i trashed everthing. do not make this thing.</li>
            <li> The brushes work well and have a good variety of sizes and shapes. But the Handles are painted. And paint and nail polish remover do not go well together. If I got even a little remover on it my entire hand was black. Othere than that they do not stand the test of time very well. But the case that they come in is very convenient</li>
            <li> Great nail art brushes for beginners to nail art. Has every brush you could possibly need, makes designing nail art so much easier! Granted, you do need a lot of practice when it comes to nail art, but these brushes do help. This is a great little set for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a newbie at nail art, but was getting more adventurous, so decided to invest in some brushes. I already own a set of MASH stamping plates, and they&#x27;re awesome, so I figured their  brushes would be too. The price is unbeatable, for the number of brushes you get. The shipping was super fast (oh wait, I think it was Prime Eligible...). I&#x27;ve used them a few times now, and am slowly learning which brush does what.&lt;br /&gt;In fact, I&#x27;d say the only thing missing really, is a little instruction sheet, with ideas of what to do, and the brushes to use. And they clean beautifully in acetone, but only pure acetone - anything else does not clean them properly.</li>
            <li> Love all the brushes and super fast shipping. Thanks</li>
            <li> This little set is perfect for the price. I even love the little fold-over case for it. Like someone else posted in a review, be careful when cleaning or using in acetone. If you dip the brush down past the metal bit that holds the brush to the handle the black paint will come off and get all over!!</li>
            <li> awful!!!! the brushes are painted black with a &amp;#34; M A S H&amp;#34; brand name on them! Im not sure if that is a real brand or not but hey are not the real mash anyways whoever it is selling them painted the brushes black and stamped the name because as soon as they get wet the color comes off and makes a terrible mess and the paint wont come off of material and barely come off the skin. The bristles of the brushes are made extremely cheap!  they break after the second use and you cant put the caps back on them because the bristles are everywhere! useless!!!! will never trust this seller! someone who fakes a brand or company name is shady enough for me!!! disgusting...</li>
            <li> Lots of brushes, good variety.  Great price.  I bought 2, one for each of my girls and they loved them!!</li>
            <li> I use these with acrylic paints (all purpose acrylic paint) for nail design. These are not well suited for nail enamel if that&#x27;s what you are buying them for because it will stick to the fibers and harden them up so you won&#x27;t be able to use the brush anymore. I find that the quality of these brushes is decent but only decent because some stray fibers mess up some of my designs and I also found that if working with acrylic paint, the more diluted with water the paint is, the better these brushes work for you. If you use just the paint and no water it&#x27;s pretty clunky and the lines are messy. For the price these brushes are good but I haven&#x27;t found a perfect \\&quot;set\\&quot; yet.</li>
            <li> the MASH brushes arrived on time and are exactly what I wanted.  the case makes it easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> This was a surprise gift and I must say I love it! I&#x27;m fairly new to nail art and am very excited to have these tools. They are a very decent quality as compared to paint brushes with an impressive variety of types. I&#x27;m still not sure what a couple of them are used for and I&#x27;m very eager to learn. They all have protective sheaths and there&#x27;s even a dotting tool. The only con I have found is the smell of the case. It&#x27;s a heavy vinyl/cheap plastic odor. It doesn&#x27;t emanate or anything but if it gets close to your nose, you know it&#x27;s there! I&#x27;m planning on airing mine out in the sun outside for a coupe hours. This is a great kit at a great price and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I wouldnt really know how to rate it since ive only used it once (a little lazy bug i am) but from using it the first time it was just fine. Through time i will be able to tell. Also the packaging smelled really odd.</li>
