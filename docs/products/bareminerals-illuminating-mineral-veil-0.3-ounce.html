            <li>This is a more neutral, pale color; I really liked the other one better.</li>
            <li>When I get low on this product, I always buy more, because of the finished look.</li>
            <li>This is mostly the same as the original product I bought at a retail store, but not the same color.  </li>
            <li>IF YOU REALLY WANT YOUR MAKEUP TO HAVE THAT</li>
            <li>VERY shiny.</li>
            <li>too much</li>
            <li>Definitely not appropriate to wear all over your face on its own - you will look like one of the Twilight vamps.</li>
            <li>I really like this illuminating Mineral Veil, it has a little sparkle in the powder and looks nice for an overall finished look.</li>

            <li>Now use for photos and special occasions not for everyday wear.</li>
            <li>I mix this with normal translucent powder for a lasting sheen</li>
            <li>but it has a little too much sparkle in it…like other mineral veils a little better.</li>

            <li> PROFESSIONAL LOOK</li>
            <li> I get compliments all of he time about the soft radiance of my skin.  </li>
            <li> Now use for photos and special occasions not for everyday wear.</li>

            <li> but it has a little too much sparkle in it…like other mineral veils a little better.</li>
            <li> It is not my complaint, but if you have a dark complexion, the product is a little too light to look natural.</li>
            <li> I put it over loose mineral powder for a glow, but it can be worn alone if you don&#x27;t need any sort of coverage.</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned, it does have a &#x27;sparkly&#x27; effect, so it needs to be used sparingly and I usually combine it with the Bare Escentuals Matt powder to tone it down in the daytime.</li>
            <li> A little sparkle goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Be careful!</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I didn&#x27;t see the other one advertised anywhere--it was called &amp;#34;illuminating gold&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> but you have to be very careful.</li>
            <li> I find that applying it with my fingers rather than with a brush cuts down on the &#x27;glitter effect&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Just a little dab will do you on the areas you want to to highlight.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>

            <li> Lightweight, easy to apply, great finishing touch!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. It provides wonderful coverage and I don&#x27;t go out without applying it. As others have mentioned, it does have a &#x27;sparkly&#x27; effect, so it needs to be used sparingly and I usually combine it with the Bare Escentuals Matt powder to tone it down in the daytime.

            <li> Thank you for providing this on Amazon!!&lt;br /&gt;Priced much better on here than anywhere else. Never tried the illuminating, so glad I did!! For 40+ skin it will make your skin glow!!</li>
            <li> IF YOU REALLY WANT YOUR MAKEUP TO HAVE THAT PROFESSIONAL LOOK THIS IS A MUST HAVE. IF I GET STRANDED ON A DESERT ISLAND I MUST HAVE THIS WITH ME.</li>
            <li> Great buy. Love Bare Minerals</li>
            <li> I accidentally ordered the plain powder and ended up throwing that away as I love the illuminating veil.  The illuminating veil literally perks my face up and makes me look years younger.  A little sparkle goes a long way!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for,  love this product and the glow it gives your skin!</li>
            <li> VERY shiny. I mix this with normal translucent powder for a lasting sheen but you have to be very careful. If you get a puff of this on your clothes it is going to stick. If you kiss someone their face will be shiny. Definitely not appropriate to wear all over your face on its own - you will look like one of the Twilight vamps.</li>
            <li> The luminescent effect of thlis Mineral Veil provides a glow I like, especially for special occasions when I want to look especially well &amp;#34;finished.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Amazing product! I get so many compliments on my makeup and skin when I finish my makeup with this product.</li>

            <li> I like this but it has a little too much sparkle in it…like other mineral veils a little better.</li>
            <li> Too shiny not really sheer. Now use for photos and special occasions not for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product</li>
            <li> I love bare escenutals it is the first makeup that I have been able to use for years without becoming allergic to.&lt;br /&gt;Love the coverage and lightness of the product, you don&#x27;t feel like you have makeup on.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff !  It goes on smoothly, you only need a little bit, and it makes my skin look better than any other product I&#x27;ve used. Love it!</li>
            <li> This product made me look like I was a corpse, like I had a white mask on.</li>
            <li> Be careful! too much and it makes you look like you have glitter on!</li>
            <li> nice product.  will buy again</li>
            <li> This product makes your skin look luminous. I put it over loose mineral powder for a glow, but it can be worn alone if you don&#x27;t need any sort of coverage. It is not my complaint, but if you have a dark complexion, the product is a little too light to look natural. I have used this product on and off for over 15 years and every time I go back to it, I wonder why I ever stopped.  I am 55 so the radiance softens lines and gives me a glow that warrants compliments on my skin.....I do not take offense when a youngster says I look great for my age!!</li>
            <li> Has great staying power and wears wonderfully!</li>
            <li> I use this all of the time.  I just dust it over my completed make up with a brush.  I get compliments all of he time about the soft radiance of my skin.  It&#x27;s this product!</li>
            <li> This is mostly the same as the original product I bought at a retail store, but not the same color.  I ordered this because I didn&#x27;t see the other one advertised anywhere--it was called &amp;#34;illuminating gold&amp;#34;.  I must say the names of these products have nothing to do with the color.  This is a more neutral, pale color; I really liked the other one better.</li>
            <li> I like this product. I have used it, like it, and&lt;br /&gt;will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Best price around on Bare Escentuals makeup</li>
            <li> Great product by Bare Minerals that I always use when putting on makeup. When I get low on this product, I always buy more, because of the finished look. I personally like the illuminating mineral veil, because of my age it looks better to me. Definitely recommend this product as part of anyone&#x27;s makeup ritual.</li>
            <li> Disappointing. I was not expecting a ghost-like look.</li>
            <li> use this product and love it</li>
