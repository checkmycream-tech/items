            <li>I love Crest products, but not this one.</li>
            <li>Husbands favorite toothpaste</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK but think I will try another flavor after this one is gone.</li>
            <li>Professional clean the best part is I can order it to DPO/APO addresses.</li>

            <li>Pretty good toothpaste, no complaints.</li>
            <li>Personal preference, otherwise good quality, shipped in good condition just don&#x27;t like the taste</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely stick with the Scope-infused brand, as it&#x27;s a wonderful improvement, and I feel much more confident that I have fresh breath after using it.</li>
            <li>Got a sample at my dentist and fell in love, it keeps my breath really fresh even after eating!</li>
            <li>Easy</li>
            <li>It makes my life easy and saves me time and money.</li>
            <li>While the taste is fine, I did not like the texture of this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Makes your mouth feel clean but not exactly the greatest flavor to me.</li>
            <li>I got this on sale with a coupon that Amazon periodically makes available.</li>
            <li>Buy the cheap brand and swish with Hydrogen Peroxide once a week.</li>
            <li>Cheap toothpaste</li>
            <li>Love the fresh feeling and fights cavaties.</li>
            <li>Love the fresh feeling it leaves in my mouth after brushing.</li>
            <li>Love how fresh and clean my teeth feel after brushing.  </li>
            <li>The Scope leaves your mouth feeling so fresh and so clean!</li>
            <li>Teeth feel clean and refreshed every time.</li>
            <li>like the taste and clean feeling of this toothpaste though.</li>
            <li>The toothpaste also tastes clean and minty.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels fresh and clean while my teeth look white and feel nice!</li>
            <li>I like this brand, it whitens my teeth and keeps my breath fresh and clean all day.</li>
            <li>Then I discovered this toothpaste and now my breath is fresh and my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>Keeps my teeth clean and breath fresh.</li>
            <li>: my mom is a dental hygienist, so I&#x27;ve been lucky to learn a lot about dental care)</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is my favorite and we cannot find it where we live.  </li>
            <li>In short, I love it!</li>
            <li>Top quality as far as I am concerned!</li>
            <li>Feels fresh in the mouth.</li>
            <li>I have been using Close Up for years because I liked the taste of cinnamon over regular toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>It makes my mouth feel so fresh.</li>
            <li>As far as the product, thought, I am highly satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>I have used it for years because I like the aftertaste better than many other products.  </li>
            <li>certainly nothing special about it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this for a couple of weeks, and I can&#x27;t honestly say that I notice any whitening as yet, but my mouth definitely feels fresh and clean after using it...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Thanks Crest!</li>
            <li>This is good since Crest is not available in the country i&#x27;m stationed at.</li>
            <li>far as toothpastes go, there isn&#x27;t really anything exceptional about this, but unless you&#x27;re going to buy special toothpaste from your dentist, you&#x27;re really not going to get anything &amp;#34;exceptional.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;(Note</li>
            <li>It tastes good and works as expected but made my sensitive teeth hurt.</li>
            <li>Refreshing flavor and stays in there for long...</li>
            <li>Good product as usual.</li>
            <li>Higher content of fluoride than regular toothpaste which is fine.</li>
            <li>I would prefer a slightly mintier flavor, but it is an effective toothpaste</li>
            <li>The toothpaste was fine the 2 star rating was because I received the travel size not the regular 5 ounce tube that was ordered.  </li>
            <li>Got it really fast, just as i couldn&#x27;t leave the house (health reasons).</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for making my life a lot easier.</li>
            <li>My family really likes this toothpaste because you get the combined benefit of Crest whitening toothpaste and the breath-freshening power of Scope.</li>
            <li>This is probably a bit more expensive than I&#x27;m used to paying for toothpaste, but the 15% off the rest of my order more than out weighs that.</li>
            <li>it does the job and keeps the smile pearly white</li>
            <li>BRAND.PRICE WAS GOOD AS USUAL COMPARED TO LOCAL DRUGSTORE..</li>
            <li>Excited to find it on Amazon with free shipping for when extra trips to the store are hard to fit in or you keep forgetting to add it to your list; however, the cost is almost double the Walmart price.</li>
            <li>I do have to say it took me a few brushes to get used to the taste of this, but my mouth feels so very clean</li>
            <li>This leaves my mouth feeling clean, my breath fresh, and it does not irritate my gums, which are a little sensitive, like other whitening toothpastes do.</li>
            <li>WHAT CAN I SAY ABOUT TOOTHPASTE OTHER THAN IT TASTES GOOD,LEAVES YOU FEELING FRESH</li>
            <li>I like having cheaper items in my subscribe and save to be able to bring the price point down on some more expensive things I buy.</li>
            <li>I used to use Colgate toothpaste, but switched to Crest Complete when I accidently bought the wrong kind one time.</li>
            <li>Tried other toothpastes and don&#x27;t get the same fresh feeling as I do with Crest.</li>
            <li>After using this toothpaste for a week and a half, I got a giant canker sore right under my  upper lip that rubs against my teeth.</li>
            <li>I have not had a cavity since I was in high school (over 20 years ago), and I only go to the dentist once a year since US dentists are not available where I live.</li>
            <li>It works fine just like any other toothpaste that I&#x27;ve used in the past (Colgate and Arm &amp; Hammer).</li>

            <li> The only minor issue is the taste.</li>
            <li> This was not overwhelmingly strong but stout enough to clear away any funky breath!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m now using far less toothpaste than I used to.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it felt like dry brushing after 30 seconds of use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s minty, but tastes a bit too synthetic for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, no problem and the active ingredients are comparable to other similar toothpastes.</li>
            <li> Burns my mouth and leaves it very dry.</li>
            <li> Boyfriend only uses crest with green scope.</li>
            <li> The Crest&#x27;s texture was noticeably different - it&#x27;s a bit looser with what feels like small globules or particles in a somewhat thinner paste compared to what I&#x27;ve been used to.</li>
            <li> It will due for now.</li>
            <li> I had used a similar product with scope in it in the past and thought that this was it.</li>
            <li> I like the taste of this and the freshy feeling lasts longer than some other products.</li>
            <li> We have been using this for well over a year and now subscribe and save for every other month shippings.</li>
            <li> My teeth are so fresh that that ocean is mad at me.</li>
            <li> Called Amazon and they are sending the correct size, but still a little worried that all my subscription orders are going to be screwed up.</li>
            <li> I rate this product low for false advertising.  </li>
            <li> and I thought this one looked like the Crest we usually use.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about changing my brands of toothpaste</li>
            <li> I do not smoke, drink coffee, tea or sodas, or have any other nasty habits that would stain teeth.</li>
            <li> Once upon a time, I had bad breath and dirty teeth.</li>
            <li> Helped in bad breath...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad</li>
            <li> I hate the taste of this.  </li>

            <li> I got this on sale with a coupon that Amazon periodically makes available.

            <li> excellent tooth past/ retired dental assistant(32 years)</li>
            <li> I had used a similar product with scope in it in the past and thought that this was it. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be as minty as I remember and may have been a different product.

            <li> Good product. No cavities!</li>
            <li> I like this brand, it whitens my teeth and keeps my breath fresh and clean all day.</li>
            <li> While the taste is fine, I did not like the texture of this toothpaste. It had a tendency to clump and seemed to dissolve during use. I found myself having to add more paste during brushing. Otherwise it felt like dry brushing after 30 seconds of use.</li>
            <li> Feels fresh in the mouth.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about changing my brands of toothpaste but I love the freshness Scope has to offer. This was not overwhelmingly strong but stout enough to clear away any funky breath! My mouth feels fresh and clean while my teeth look white and feel nice!</li>
            <li> I rate this product low for false advertising.  It does not do anything to whiten teeth.  I do not smoke, drink coffee, tea or sodas, or have any other nasty habits that would stain teeth. All the promises of whiter teeth are lies. I have used it for years because I like the aftertaste better than many other products.  I do not get cavities so it must work there. I brush after every meal. I alternate with Crest 3D White which is also a big fat lie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is my favorite toothpaste but would gladly switch if I found any toothpaste product that worked to whiten teeth.</li>
            <li> Great item like the subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> Refreshing flavor and stays in there for long... Helped in bad breath...</li>
            <li> good tasting toothpast that does the job.  Easy ordering with subscribe and save, never run out</li>
            <li> Boyfriend only uses crest with green scope. I&#x27;m now a big fan myself. Teeth feel clean and refreshed every time. Tried other toothpastes and don&#x27;t get the same fresh feeling as I do with Crest.</li>
            <li> Professional clean the best part is I can order it to DPO/APO addresses. This is good since Crest is not available in the country i&#x27;m stationed at.</li>
            <li> I have been using Close Up for years because I liked the taste of cinnamon over regular toothpaste.  I do have to say it took me a few brushes to get used to the taste of this, but my mouth feels so very clean after I brush...especially since I follow with Listerine.  It&#x27;s a great combination to keep your mouth fresh for hours after brushing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got Scope in it but the flavor isn&#x27;t overpowering.  Higher content of fluoride than regular toothpaste which is fine.</li>
            <li> Got it really fast, just as i couldn&#x27;t leave the house (health reasons). Thank you so much for making my life a lot easier.</li>
            <li> favorite brand of toothpaste, and at this price plus subscribe and save you cannot beat it!  Awesome being able to use amazon for these types of purchases.</li>
            <li> Keeps your teeth clean and your mouth smelling great.</li>
            <li> My teeth are so fresh that that ocean is mad at me.</li>
            <li> Great taste and size. Love amazon pricing and S&amp;S!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s toothpaste. It&#x27;s exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a couple of weeks, and I can&#x27;t honestly say that I notice any whitening as yet, but my mouth definitely feels fresh and clean after using it... and I&#x27;m now using far less toothpaste than I used to. I was finishing up a tube of Crest Regular paste and compared the two... I&#x27;ll definitely stick with the Scope-infused brand, as it&#x27;s a wonderful improvement, and I feel much more confident that I have fresh breath after using it. In short, I love it!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find toothpaste that do the work as this one.</li>
            <li> My favorite toothpaste</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste. It makes my mouth feel so fresh.</li>
            <li> Buy the cheap brand and swish with Hydrogen Peroxide once a week. Don&#x27;t swallow</li>
            <li> Great seller! On time and just as described! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I like the taste of this and the freshy feeling lasts longer than some other products. I know freshy isn&#x27;t a word but don&#x27;t judge.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste was fine the 2 star rating was because I received the travel size not the regular 5 ounce tube that was ordered.  Of course I was charged $4 for the trial size tube.  Called Amazon and they are sending the correct size, but still a little worried that all my subscription orders are going to be screwed up.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. No complaints here.</li>
            <li> Cheap toothpaste certainly nothing special about it. It tastes good and works as expected but made my sensitive teeth hurt.</li>
            <li> Good product as usual.</li>
            <li> CREST toothpastes have been our family staple for teeth care.  This cleans and freshens to our satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Crest is a great toothpaste and made in the USA.</li>
            <li> Received on tine, intact</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste.  Makes my mouth feel super clean and the taste is pleasant.  I received this item at a discount for review purposes</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste ... I feel refreshed every morning ...</li>
            <li> Got a sample at my dentist and fell in love, it keeps my breath really fresh even after eating! Just wish they helped sensitivity bc I still have to rotate in my Sensodine</li>
            <li> Love the fresh feeling and fights cavaties.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is my favorite and we cannot find it where we live.  This leaves my mouth feeling clean, my breath fresh, and it does not irritate my gums, which are a little sensitive, like other whitening toothpastes do. It is a good quality too - I have not had a cavity since I was in high school (over 20 years ago), and I only go to the dentist once a year since US dentists are not available where I live.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best.  The Scope leaves your mouth feeling so fresh and so clean!</li>
            <li> This tooth paste BURNS your mouth. I love Crest products, but not this one.</li>
            <li> Love it will buy again!</li>
            <li> Once upon a time, I had bad breath and dirty teeth. Then I discovered this toothpaste and now my breath is fresh and my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> Love how fresh and clean my teeth feel after brushing.  Very pleasant taste &amp; keeps my breath fresher longer.</li>
            <li> I actually found it for cheaper.</li>
            <li> Came all smashed up, but hey it&#x27;s toothpaste.</li>
            <li> My favorite toothpaste! Keeps my teeth clean and breath fresh. Flavor is great (for toothpaste)</li>
            <li> I now buy all of my cleaning, health, beauty, and household products from Amazon. It makes my life easy and saves me time and money.</li>
            <li> Husbands favorite toothpaste</li>
            <li> Makes your mouth feel clean but not exactly the greatest flavor to me. It&#x27;s OK but think I will try another flavor after this one is gone.</li>
            <li> I hate the taste of this.  Personal preference, otherwise good quality, shipped in good condition just don&#x27;t like the taste</li>
            <li> Will try a different brand. It contains sodium lauryl sulfate. After using this toothpaste for a week and a half, I got a giant canker sore right under my  upper lip that rubs against my teeth. Your mileage may vary. But that&#x27;s just me because between stress, drinking a lot of juice in the morning, and the SLS in the toothpaste caused this for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the taste and clean feeling of this toothpaste though. It&#x27;s too bad I have to now consider brands without SLS.</li>
            <li> I like having cheaper items in my subscribe and save to be able to bring the price point down on some more expensive things I buy. This is probably a bit more expensive than I&#x27;m used to paying for toothpaste, but the 15% off the rest of my order more than out weighs that.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Great product. Love the fresh feeling it leaves in my mouth after brushing. Cleans well also. Excited to find it on Amazon with free shipping for when extra trips to the store are hard to fit in or you keep forgetting to add it to your list; however, the cost is almost double the Walmart price. As far as the product, thought, I am highly satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I used to use Colgate toothpaste, but switched to Crest Complete when I accidently bought the wrong kind one time. What a happy accident because I like the flavor of Crest better than Colgate.&lt;br /&gt;As far as toothpastes go, there isn&#x27;t really anything exceptional about this, but unless you&#x27;re going to buy special toothpaste from your dentist, you&#x27;re really not going to get anything &amp;#34;exceptional.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;(Note: my mom is a dental hygienist, so I&#x27;ve been lucky to learn a lot about dental care)</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste ! Top quality as far as I am concerned! Thanks Crest!</li>
            <li> My family really likes this toothpaste because you get the combined benefit of Crest whitening toothpaste and the breath-freshening power of Scope. The toothpaste also tastes clean and minty. I now have subscribed to have this delivered at regular intervals.</li>
            <li> We have been using this for well over a year and now subscribe and save for every other month shippings.</li>
            <li> My favorite toothpaste!</li>
            <li> Pretty good toothpaste, no complaints.</li>
