            <li>I love these pads.  </li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m pretty impressed.</li>
            <li>My skin is noticeably softer and I think I&#x27;m seeing a reduction in fine lines and an improvement in skin texture.</li>
            <li>IT SEEMS TO SOFTEN  FINE LINES AND WRINKLES  </li>
            <li>I am please with the smooth results and would buy it again.</li>

            <li>I have olive skin and a good amount of acne scarring on my face, and this has helped immensely!</li>
            <li>Good for beginners, or those just starting to peel.  </li>
            <li>This would be good for teens or mature skin for a first peel,  </li>

            <li>If I use a fine micro scrub before hand it intensifies the action of the peel.</li>
            <li>Fast and good quality as usual.</li>
            <li>I WILL CERTAINLY BUY THIS AGAIN....</li>
            <li>I would say that these may work for others but for me, I may need something much stronger to get the results I want.</li>
            <li>Although I haven&#x27;t really seen much reduction in any of my neck wrinkles(why</li>
            <li>I THINK THIS REALLY DOES WORK</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and use these pads daily with absolutely no problem - my skin has never looked better!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Love these but this jar was open and dry</li>
            <li>I am going to reorder now so after using all of the pads, I definitely think it has had a positive effect on my skin!</li>
            <li>So be warned, if you have fair, thin, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>i just bought my next bottle at first</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;d buy them again</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost 49 years old but this helps my skin to look years younger!</li>
            <li>I thought I had sensitive skin but apparently not since I&#x27;ve started using these.</li>
            <li>Especially for the reasonable price compared to other products.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m pretty impressed. I&#x27;ve been applying this three times a week  for about a month. Have seen a difference, definitely brighter. The lines around my eyes seem to have softened. I will continue to use this product. Especially for the reasonable price compared to other products.</li>
            <li> Do not see any difference.  None!!!  Used an entire jar.  Starting second jar.  We shall see</li>
            <li> I love ptr products. I use many of his items. I am never disappointed with anything he makes. He tells you the key ingredients and strength. He makes quality stuff.</li>
            <li> This product works wonders never found something to work as it said it would. In a week my pores shrunk and after that my complexion cleared up very satisfied with product.</li>
            <li> I bought these a week ago. I thought I had sensitive skin but apparently not since I&#x27;ve started using these. I may get a tingling sensation but nothing that&#x27;s bothersome. I have been using them day and night anywhere between 1 - 3 minutes each time. I do notice that they soften any lines you have. This is not a solution for deep lines. I&#x27;m 35 and fairly healthy. I had some laugh lines coming in and want to try to maintain or reverse these. I would say that these may work for others but for me, I may need something much stronger to get the results I want.</li>
            <li> I ordered again. The peel is mild but I feel it works. If I use a fine micro scrub before hand it intensifies the action of the peel.</li>
            <li> Love the way this makes my skin feel and look</li>
            <li> Just two weeks of using them daily, you see a noticable difference in the eveness and glow of my skin. I have olive skin and a good amount of acne scarring on my face, and this has helped immensely! I&#x27;ll be ordering again for sure</li>
            <li> Cleaned skin well, but not a difference in wrinkles.</li>
            <li> i just bought my next bottle at first i cldnt see any results but saturday i looked in the mirror and ws like dang i cn deffinatley see softer lines and the left side wrinkles in the upper eye forehead as almost disappeared i hv bought lots of products but none tht i hv seen results like these i use every morning and two wks to see results tht will make u want more. wow.</li>
            <li> I love these pads.  They are gentle enough to use every day and do a great job.  My skins feels so good after use.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great item would order from them again.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice that it did anything at all.</li>
            <li> Looked like box had been opened. Did not live up to all the hype.</li>
            <li> Although I haven&#x27;t really seen much reduction in any of my neck wrinkles(why i got it), my skin looks glowing the next morning when i use it at night. I have super acne prone skin and had no problems at all with this product. I am going to reorder now so after using all of the pads, I definitely think it has had a positive effect on my skin!</li>
            <li> These are great, I was looking for an alternative to getting monthly peels and I hope these will suffice.  Skin is left feeling very soft, smooth, and nice.</li>
            <li> Ive been using these I believe for almost a year. These are incredible! The age spots around my cheek bones have lessened by at least 60% . I use these daily &amp; have not found them to be drying to my skin, in fact I sometimes leave the product on my face over night &amp; wash it off in the morning to see fresher, brighter, softer skin. I&#x27;m almost 49 years old but this helps my skin to look years younger!</li>
            <li> The seal was broken (looks like it had been peeled up a little and then pushed back on). I didn&#x27;t trust the product and never used it.</li>
            <li> great! Fast and good quality as usual. PTR pads are the beeze knneze covered in cheeze greaze if you pleaze...</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to try this brand and so it was nice to find it in a 20 count size. I am please with the smooth results and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This reminds me of the glycolic peel Avon sells.  This works but I can get the same results from the Avon peel for less money.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and use these pads daily with absolutely no problem - my skin has never looked better!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for 4 days. My skin is noticeably softer and I think I&#x27;m seeing a reduction in fine lines and an improvement in skin texture. So far, I&#x27;d buy them again</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin. I broke out using this product. Was not able to use as directed so really can&#x27;t review.</li>
            <li> I THINK THIS REALLY DOES WORK IT SEEMS TO SOFTEN  FINE LINES AND WRINKLES  I WILL CERTAINLY BUY THIS AGAIN....</li>
            <li> It does wat it says it does, my skin is smoother n clearer!  Will b definitively buying again n recommending it.</li>
            <li> Love these but this jar was open and dry I should have sent back but they went into the trash I will get them from sap hora from now on</li>
            <li> Good for beginners, or those just starting to peel.  Leaves a sticky residue, so be prepared.  It does what it is supposed to do, but I prefer the Avon Anew peel pads which are stronger.  This would be good for teens or mature skin for a first peel,  Eventually you&#x27;ll want something stronger.</li>
            <li> I have no doubt that, if used continuously, this product would result in a facial peel. But, my skin is sensitive and I just couldn&#x27;t use them past two days. My face got red and began to peel around the eyelids (if you&#x27;ve ever had a peel , you know what that looks like), and, three days later, having not used them., I am still peeling! I cannot use them, so why the 4 stars? Because it does what it says it does....I just have very sensitive, thin skin. So be warned, if you have fair, thin, sensitive skin.</li>
