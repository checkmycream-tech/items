            <li>and I have to do a review for my favorite Garden Botanika)</li>
            <li>Love love love this.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>A bit more</li>
            <li>and I love it),</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>It lightly enhances your own lip&#x27;s color and adds a touch of sheen.  </li>
            <li>I love it and recommend it.</li>
            <li>Love the moisturizing effect and color.</li>
            <li>My favorite moisturizing chapstick with just a hint of color.</li>
            <li>This product is perfect for dry lips.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes and adds the perfect rosy pink color.</li>
            <li>An overall good lip tint!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re missing out on the most perfect lip tinting lip balm!</li>
            <li>It does have that nice, silky feeling, but the color goes on BRIGHT red!  </li>
            <li>The red tint builds beautifully: a couple swipes and your lips get a hint of reddish-pink.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice (mild cherry) and the flavor is lovely too, not like cherry cough medicine, but a mild, sweet cherry flavor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The Cherry is not too cherry and goes on in a nice light pass of \\&quot;blush\\&quot; on the first pass.  </li>
            <li>The perfect lip balm with a little bit of color.</li>
            <li>When applying this product, I find that it does not go on smoothly but rather tugs at my lips a bit.</li>
            <li>knew Burt Bee&#x27;s made a lip balm with a touch of color, but to be honest, shelling out $4.99 for a slender tube really goes against my grain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and adds a hint of color.</li>
            <li>Looks nice on m and protects my lips really well specially during winter.</li>
            <li>I think this will be my new favorite!</li>
            <li>I LOVE Nivea products, so thought this would turn out to be as good as their other lip care I have.  </li>
            <li>I understand some women like the extremely bright, screaming red....</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t like the way lip gloss looks on my full lips.</li>
            <li>This balm applies nicely and feels silky soft on the lips.</li>
            <li>and it looks very age appropriate.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought this at a popular drugstore in the Philippines when I visited for the summer, and I HAVE NO REGRETS.</li>
            <li>product is great for old and young alike.  </li>
            <li>My lips look healthier since using this, probably because of the SPF and that I apply it more often than other balms that are not as nice.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a nice shade of red</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I love this flavored lip balm with the light shade of the cherry color red that this provides.  </li>
            <li>(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this bundle of lip balm because is the same thing, is just what I expected, a KISS of color (it can be more color if you use more), my lips are more smoothed, the color it give looks very natural and healthy.</li>
            <li>,right?</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of colour and bonus SPF 10</li>
            <li>and nobody wants to be called a cougar unless it&#x27;s true</li>
            <li>I mean, I look like a vampire that just finished a good feeding, bright red dripping from my lips.  </li>
            <li>This product is great for every day use.no need for lipstick as it&#x27;s tinted only problem I found was you can&#x27;t find it in Britain and got hammered with vat and delivery.come on british shops</li>
            <li>and she liked it as her lips get dry</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.   </li>
            <li>The flavor is really good, not overpowering, and it isn&#x27;t heavily fragranced, so you don&#x27;t need to worry about it stinging your lips if they are chapped.</li>
            <li>It is a decent amount of color without looking like a lipstick nor a chapstick - just the right in between.</li>
            <li>It leaves behind a light, sheer cherry tint and incredible moisture--</li>
            <li>The Passion Fruit tint offers a nice healthy pink sheer tint and bonus, it tastes yummy (hubs luvs it when kissing me).  </li>
            <li>Although the ones that I got seemed to be a newer version (there are straight and not curved like these ones), they were pretty much the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was light, moist, and had a slight tint which gave a very natural healthy tint to the lips.</li>
            <li>, I find the cherry tint to be rather bright and artificial-looking, at least on my lips.  </li>
            <li>The color is not too empowering unless you put too much and the taste is candy-like.</li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t lipstick-y or too glossy, and it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Oh, and by the way...went to the drugstore and saw this very item here for almost five bucks just for ONE.</li>
            <li>I really like this lip care.  </li>
            <li>Surprisingly, I got the products earlier than expected.  </li>
            <li>and they definately taste kissable, a classic cherry flavor.  </li>
            <li>I like wearing a simple, tinted lip balm on days when I don&#x27;t want to do lipstick, and I have purchased many different brands of tinted balms in search of the \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; product.  </li>
            <li>do like the cherry scent of this product, but that turned out to be the main selling point.  </li>
            <li>At least I know now where to get more of this  product, cheaper and faster!</li>
            <li>Through lunch, through most of the day, and even now -- when I just reapplied it -- I thought my lips still held a little bit of the color.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Bravo, Nivea!gh most of the day, and even now -- when I just reapplied it -- I thought my lips still held a little bit of the color.  </li>
            <li>If I HAD to complain about anything, I would say that I find I put it on more than I do my normal lip stuff, BUT that is also because I am used to wearing longwearing lipcolor/stain that basically tattooes my lips for a few hours</li>
            <li>so you can wear it in the beach or normal</li>
            <li>It went right into my basket without even a second thought.  </li>
            <li>B004Y9GZRK Maybelline New York Baby Lips</li>
            <li>it made it as far as my car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it right then and there... in public.  </li>
            <li>Gave one to my teenage niece who does not wear much make-up</li>
            <li>I even asked my 6 year old what she thought....</li>
            <li>I remember buying this lip balm in CVS Pharmacies but have not been able to find it in store lately, so decided to check Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sheer and doesn&#x27;t leave much tint.</li>
            <li>My lips didn&#x27;t taste funny, didn&#x27;t feel dry, and I got the touch of color I&#x27;ve been craving for the upcoming summer days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My lips didn&#x27;t taste funny, didn&#x27;t feel dry, and I got the touch of color I&#x27;ve been craving for the upcoming summer days.    </li>
            <li>I seriously, couldn&#x27;t be happier. :)</li>
            <li>The balm is offered in a few flavors: Cherry tint offers a refreshing sheer red that makes my lips look kissable and natural</li>
            <li>All I need is this lip balm that gives a little light red tint on the lips.</li>
            <li>I barely taste anything, and when I do, it tastes like cherry or strawberry</li>
            <li>First, the color actually bleeds outside my lip line, and second, it is not particularly moisturizing, something I expect in a balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also use this product under lipstick to provide a smooth base when I want to wear more color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smooth, shiny, &amp;#34;wet-looking&amp;#34;, slick, and EXTREMELY moisturizing.</li>
            <li>but she wants a little moisture and color and has tried quite a few lip tints and although this one may not give her quite as much color as she&#x27;d prefer, she appreciates its moisture and SPF</li>

            <li> Through lunch, through most of the day, and even now -- when I just reapplied it -- I thought my lips still held a little bit of the color.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bravo, Nivea!gh most of the day, and even now -- when I just reapplied it -- I thought my lips still held a little bit of the color.  </li>
            <li> If I HAD to complain about anything, I would say that I find I put it on more than I do my normal lip stuff, BUT that is also because I am used to wearing longwearing lipcolor/stain that basically tattooes my lips for a few hours</li>
            <li> so you can wear it in the beach or normal</li>
            <li> It went right into my basket without even a second thought.  </li>
            <li> B004Y9GZRK Maybelline New York Baby Lips</li>
            <li> it made it as far as my car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it right then and there... in public.  </li>
            <li> Gave one to my teenage niece who does not wear much make-up</li>
            <li> I even asked my 6 year old what she thought....</li>
            <li> I remember buying this lip balm in CVS Pharmacies but have not been able to find it in store lately, so decided to check Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sheer and doesn&#x27;t leave much tint.</li>
            <li> My lips didn&#x27;t taste funny, didn&#x27;t feel dry, and I got the touch of color I&#x27;ve been craving for the upcoming summer days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My lips didn&#x27;t taste funny, didn&#x27;t feel dry, and I got the touch of color I&#x27;ve been craving for the upcoming summer days.    </li>
            <li> I seriously, couldn&#x27;t be happier. :)</li>
            <li> The balm is offered in a few flavors: Cherry tint offers a refreshing sheer red that makes my lips look kissable and natural</li>
            <li> All I need is this lip balm that gives a little light red tint on the lips.</li>
            <li> I barely taste anything, and when I do, it tastes like cherry or strawberry</li>
            <li> First, the color actually bleeds outside my lip line, and second, it is not particularly moisturizing, something I expect in a balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also use this product under lipstick to provide a smooth base when I want to wear more color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smooth, shiny, &amp;#34;wet-looking&amp;#34;, slick, and EXTREMELY moisturizing.</li>
            <li> but she wants a little moisture and color and has tried quite a few lip tints and although this one may not give her quite as much color as she&#x27;d prefer, she appreciates its moisture and SPF</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, is not heavy or clumping, like other lip balms.  </li>
            <li> I can only use this about once a day because it actually makes my lips too dry to use this balm all day long....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s moisturizing and has just a hint of sheer deep pink tint to it.</li>
            <li> In addition, I find that the product is rather like a lip stain; the plus side of this is that it does last quite a long time, but there are several down sides to this as well.  </li>
            <li> The second makes it a little darker...</li>
            <li> Why can&#x27;t I find a lip balm that isn&#x27;t so shiny wet</li>
            <li> I expected a &amp;#34;tint&amp;#34; of color, not to be painted up like a toddler that just got into mommy&#x27;s makeup bag.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m bummed all the other colors were basically sold out or I&#x27;d have gone in to buy the rest and give them a whirl.&lt;br</li>
            <li> opt for the other shade of Nivea lip care as well.</li>
            <li> I just wish that more stores would carry it. :(</li>
            <li> I have the pale blue tube (they also offer Kiss of Shimmer, plain, have not tried yet~ will review as soon as I do)</li>
            <li> I wear this product under lipstick, it works okay as sort of a base.  </li>
            <li> why, I thought, can&#x27;t I find a simple lip balm that offers ultra-moisture and lip protection with just a little bit of color so that my lips -- which are dull, dull, dull -- don&#x27;t have to look like colorless strips on my face?  </li>
            <li> Not nearly as bold as lipstick.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of having a slight tint to it as it can replace wearing lipstick.</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t particularly like wearing \\&quot;Kiss of Flavor\\&quot; alone--which is unfortunate, as this is the reason I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> I was really surprised, because I always expect a weird taste when it comes to any lip product.</li>
            <li> I use it year round.</li>
            <li> Was having lots of trouble finding it in the store, so I bought a six pack from this vendor.  </li>
            <li> This product goes on gently, no tugging, and leaves behind a kiss of color, moisture and flavor.  </li>
            <li> I (almost) never wear make up &#x27;cause I&#x27;m lazy.</li>
            <li> Nothing worse than a middle-aged woman with half her lipstick worn off---the word &amp;#34;cougar&amp;#34; might spring to mind</li>
            <li> I think it has hardly any flavor, rather it is just the smell that hints at a taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;  Oh, and don&#x27;t get it on your clothes, hard to get the stain out.</li>
            <li> I was also disappointed with the actual color produced--rather than a \\&quot;sheer\\&quot; effect</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re like me, you&#x27;re not really big into carting around a lipstick with you (plus it that stuff tastes awful!  </li>
            <li> I had had a difficult time finding this product in stores, and decided to buy this bulk pack off Amazon.</li>
            <li> who always complains about how difficult it is to locate this brand in retail stores</li>
            <li> she tilted her head with a disgusted look, and cautiously said, &amp;#34;It looks very wet and weird....</li>
            <li> I buy very expensive make up</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sick of wearing lipstick</li>
            <li> I use it like base for the lipstick, after the lipstick and alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I found it but was very disappointed with what was shipped to me.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Surprisingly, I got the products earlier than expected.  It was exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.   Good job! At least I know now where to get more of this  product, cheaper and faster!</li>
            <li> This product is great for every day use.no need for lipstick as it&#x27;s tinted only problem I found was you can&#x27;t find it in Britain and got hammered with vat and delivery.come on british shops get the stock in.loved this item.</li>
            <li> Kiss of Flavor equates to a Kiss of Lip Heaven. Living in the desert I am always on the lookout for the perfect lip balm, I found it. Nivea&#x27;s Kiss of Flavor glides onto your lips, feels silky but not sticky, last&#x27;s for quite some time. The balm is offered in a few flavors: Cherry tint offers a refreshing sheer red that makes my lips look kissable and natural (I have a lot of color in my lips) ... and they definately taste kissable, a classic cherry flavor.  The Passion Fruit tint offers a nice healthy pink sheer tint and bonus, it tastes yummy (hubs luvs it when kissing me).  For those days that I don&#x27;t want color I have the pale blue tube (they also offer Kiss of Shimmer, plain, have not tried yet~ will review as soon as I do)</li>
            <li> I like wearing a simple, tinted lip balm on days when I don&#x27;t want to do lipstick, and I have purchased many different brands of tinted balms in search of the \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; product.  I was drawn to Nivea&#x27;s \\&quot;Kiss of Flavor\\&quot; for the promise of a sheer cherry tint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the cherry scent of this product, but that turned out to be the main selling point.  When applying this product, I find that it does not go on smoothly but rather tugs at my lips a bit. I was also disappointed with the actual color produced--rather than a \\&quot;sheer\\&quot; effect, I find the cherry tint to be rather bright and artificial-looking, at least on my lips.  In addition, I find that the product is rather like a lip stain; the plus side of this is that it does last quite a long time, but there are several down sides to this as well.  First, the color actually bleeds outside my lip line, and second, it is not particularly moisturizing, something I expect in a balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I wear this product under lipstick, it works okay as sort of a base.  However, I don&#x27;t particularly like wearing \\&quot;Kiss of Flavor\\&quot; alone--which is unfortunate, as this is the reason I purchased it.  Currently, I prefer Maybelline&#x27;s [[ASIN:B004Y9GZRK Maybelline New York Baby Lips Moisturizing Lip Balm, Peach Kiss, 0.15 Ounce]] as an excellent tinted balm.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for the perfect lip balm and this is it. I loved it. The color is not too empowering unless you put too much and the taste is candy-like. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I found Nivea&#x27;s Kiss of Flavor Cherry Tinted Lip Care today when I went on the hunt for something that offered just a kiss of color for every day use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re like me, you&#x27;re not really big into carting around a lipstick with you (plus it that stuff tastes awful!  Gads!) or in hauling around a lipgloss that could leak in your purse (yuck!) and get all sticky, or in carrying around a compact-style lip stain (which rock, by the way and I have to do a review for my favorite Garden Botanika) that you have to stick your finger into in order to apply and then try to figure out what to do with your now brightly red-colored finger.  Sigh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why, I thought, can&#x27;t I find a simple lip balm that offers ultra-moisture and lip protection with just a little bit of color so that my lips -- which are dull, dull, dull -- don&#x27;t have to look like colorless strips on my face?  Why can&#x27;t I find a lip balm that isn&#x27;t so shiny wet that I look like I smeared Vasaline all over my face or so sparkly I feel like I should be in a disco (and I&#x27;m not 12 dang it!  I shouldn&#x27;t sparkle!)????&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew Burt Bee&#x27;s made a lip balm with a touch of color, but to be honest, shelling out $4.99 for a slender tube really goes against my grain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I spotted it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nivea&#x27;s Kiss of Flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hmmm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Checked it out, read the ingredients, which included Almond oil and Vitamin E.  For $2.99 in the store?  SOLD! It went right into my basket without even a second thought.  The balm didn&#x27;t even make it home before I cracked into it to try it... it made it as far as my car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it right then and there... in public.  In the parking lot.  And I love it!  Now I&#x27;m bummed all the other colors were basically sold out or I&#x27;d have gone in to buy the rest and give them a whirl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cherry is not too cherry and goes on in a nice light pass of \\&quot;blush\\&quot; on the first pass.  The second makes it a little darker... the third?  Yeah, baby, now we&#x27;re talking color!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It stayed on too.  Through lunch, through most of the day, and even now -- when I just reapplied it -- I thought my lips still held a little bit of the color.  Best of all?  My lips didn&#x27;t taste funny, didn&#x27;t feel dry, and I got the touch of color I&#x27;ve been craving for the upcoming summer days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely a must try, must have product in whatever \\&quot;Kiss of\\&quot; color you decide to try for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bravo, Nivea!gh most of the day, and even now -- when I just reapplied it -- I thought my lips still held a little bit of the color.  Best of all?  My lips didn&#x27;t taste funny, didn&#x27;t feel dry, and I got the touch of color I&#x27;ve been craving for the upcoming summer days.    This is definitely a must try, must have product in whatever \\&quot;Kiss of\\&quot; color you decide to try for yourself.    Bravo, Nivea!</li>
            <li> Best lip gloss ever! Goes on smoothly and adds a hint of color. Not nearly as bold as lipstick.</li>
            <li> Love love love this. I&#x27;m sick of wearing lipstick and I don&#x27;t like the way lip gloss looks on my full lips. This is the happy medium and healthier for my lips. I use the shimmer one also with nude lipstick and smoky eyes for a glam look.</li>
            <li> I love this. This balm applies nicely and feels silky soft on the lips. The red tint builds beautifully: a couple swipes and your lips get a hint of reddish-pink. A bit more and it&#x27;s a nice shade of red that&#x27;s not overpowering. The scent is nice (mild cherry) and the flavor is lovely too, not like cherry cough medicine, but a mild, sweet cherry flavor.</li>
            <li> This lip care product has a nice shine to it. It seems to care for my lips and keep them from drying out. I like the idea of having a slight tint to it as it can replace wearing lipstick. I prefer my lip care products to not have SPF in them however this one seems to work well enough to overlook that.</li>
            <li> Ever since I discovered this I haven&#x27;t worn any lipstick... Looks nice on m and protects my lips really well specially during winter.</li>
            <li> This is great lip balm! If you layer it, it deepens the tint on your lips! The flavor is really good, not overpowering, and it isn&#x27;t heavily fragranced, so you don&#x27;t need to worry about it stinging your lips if they are chapped. This would look great on anyone, any age...it isn&#x27;t lipstick-y or too glossy, and it is very moisturizing. If I HAD to complain about anything, I would say that I find I put it on more than I do my normal lip stuff, BUT that is also because I am used to wearing longwearing lipcolor/stain that basically tattooes my lips for a few hours so I can&#x27;t smudge everything or eat it off. Nothing worse than a middle-aged woman with half her lipstick worn off---the word &amp;#34;cougar&amp;#34; might spring to mind and nobody wants to be called a cougar unless it&#x27;s true,right? Oh yeah. I remember those ladies. Those were the ones at bus stops that my mother would point out never to look in the eye. I digress. Get the lip balm. And if you like the light and frosty look (I happen to look good in it and I love it), opt for the other shade of Nivea lip care as well. I will be leaving a review of it later. Oh, and by the way...went to the drugstore and saw this very item here for almost five bucks just for ONE. Happy Amazoning!</li>
            <li> The perfect lip balm with a little bit of color.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this at a popular drugstore in the Philippines when I visited for the summer, and I HAVE NO REGRETS. There are NO negatives whatsoever about this product. I just wish that more stores would carry it. :( When I came back to the US, I immediately searched in all of my surrounding stores and online, and I can confirm that they can be found at CVS and Walgreens. Although the ones that I got seemed to be a newer version (there are straight and not curved like these ones), they were pretty much the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These ones however were just like the ones from the Philippines. Smooth, shiny, &amp;#34;wet-looking&amp;#34;, slick, and EXTREMELY moisturizing. It also perfectly stains your lips! I wear it over night, apply some in the morning, and go to school with brighter, shinier (but still natural-looking), healthier lips! I seriously, couldn&#x27;t be happier. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you something that I think we ALL could agree upon. Weird-tasting lip balm or chap stick is a TOTAL turn-off. This amazing lip balm however, does not taste yucky at all! I was really surprised, because I always expect a weird taste when it comes to any lip product. I barely taste anything, and when I do, it tastes like cherry or strawberry (I own both)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: GET. IT. You will regret skipping over this product. You will not be disappointed! No negatives at all, just positives. You&#x27;re missing out on the most perfect lip tinting lip balm!</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for dry lips. I use it year round. It goes on very smoothly, which is a plus. I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  I own the strawberry and the cherry.  This product goes on gently, no tugging, and leaves behind a kiss of color, moisture and flavor.  It lightly enhances your own lip&#x27;s color and adds a touch of sheen.  It does not feel sticky.  I think it has hardly any flavor, rather it is just the smell that hints at a taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are trying to choose between the strawberry and cherry, note the cherry has a darker tint.  I also use this product under lipstick to provide a smooth base when I want to wear more color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is great for old and young alike.  Gave one to my teenage niece who does not wear much make-up and she liked it as her lips get dry and it looks very age appropriate.  My 70ish mother says at her age lipstick just falls into the cracks but she wants a little moisture and color and has tried quite a few lip tints and although this one may not give her quite as much color as she&#x27;d prefer, she appreciates its moisture and SPF (4).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply stated, it is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Best chap-stick I have every bought.</li>
            <li> I buy very expensive make up (Chanel, Dior, Guerlain) but when it comes to a lip gloss this is the only thing I wear. My bf loves it and it has a touch of color that doesn&#x27;t look like you are doing and &amp;#34;extra effort&amp;#34; also I go to the beach often and this is the best option for a trip. Each one lasts about two months for me using it on a daily basis, so I always go for the package of 6, that way if I lost one, I can have another one just in case. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I used to buy LaBello lip balm (is a brand of Nivea), but I can&#x27;t find it anymore in my country... :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this bundle of lip balm because is the same thing, is just what I expected, a KISS of color (it can be more color if you use more), my lips are more smoothed, the color it give looks very natural and healthy. I use it like base for the lipstick, after the lipstick and alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great thing is the SPF10 so you can wear it in the beach or normal basis.&lt;br /&gt;It smell so good, it came in individual packages in a sealed bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this for people who just want a kiss of color.</li>
            <li> I really like this lip care.  Hint of color and very good for lips.</li>
            <li> Everything was as I ordered.  Was having lots of trouble finding it in the store, so I bought a six pack from this vendor.  Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about finding it!</li>
            <li> I ordered a bunch of these and put them everywhere; purse, backpack, bathroom, bedside table. Great smell and gives a touch of color. Great product and love the way it feels!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  It goes on smoothly, is not heavy or clumping, like other lip balms.  It tastes good and has a beautiful hint of color.  My lips look healthier since using this, probably because of the SPF and that I apply it more often than other balms that are not as nice.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Nivea products, so thought this would turn out to be as good as their other lip care I have.  It does have that nice, silky feeling, but the color goes on BRIGHT red!  I mean, I look like a vampire that just finished a good feeding, bright red dripping from my lips.  I understand some women like the extremely bright, screaming red....well good news, this is for you!  I expected a &amp;#34;tint&amp;#34; of color, not to be painted up like a toddler that just got into mommy&#x27;s makeup bag.  I even asked my 6 year old what she thought....she tilted her head with a disgusted look, and cautiously said, &amp;#34;It looks very wet and weird....&amp;#34;  Oh, and don&#x27;t get it on your clothes, hard to get the stain out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this tinted lip balm for a couple of years. I keep one in the car, bedside table, purse, etc. so I always have some handy. It&#x27;s moisturizing and has just a hint of sheer deep pink tint to it. I love it and recommend it.</li>
            <li> This lip tint delivered pretty good! It was light, moist, and had a slight tint which gave a very natural healthy tint to the lips. I wished it lasted longer, but it did prevent chapping. An overall good lip tint!</li>
            <li> It moisturizes and adds the perfect rosy pink color. I don&#x27;t wear anything else. It&#x27;s awesome and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I picked this up on a whim at a local drugstore and I&#x27;m so glad I did! It leaves behind a light, sheer cherry tint and incredible moisture-- I think this will be my new favorite!</li>
            <li> Love the moisturizing effect and color. It is a decent amount of color without looking like a lipstick nor a chapstick - just the right in between.</li>
            <li> I (almost) never wear make up &#x27;cause I&#x27;m lazy. All I need is this lip balm that gives a little light red tint on the lips. Cherry is the best flavor too!</li>
            <li> I had had a difficult time finding this product in stores, and decided to buy this bulk pack off Amazon. My favorite moisturizing chapstick with just a hint of color. Love it! I keep one in my office, at home, and in my purse.</li>
            <li> I love this flavored lip balm with the light shade of the cherry color red that this provides.  I can only use this about once a day because it actually makes my lips too dry to use this balm all day long....It tastes and smells great though and the shade is rocking red but NOT solid red......very pretty and delicious.</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of colour and bonus SPF 10, I&#x27;m happy I ordered 6 so I can share the wealth.</li>
            <li> who always complains about how difficult it is to locate this brand in retail stores so is is thrilled to have this resource!</li>
            <li> I remember buying this lip balm in CVS Pharmacies but have not been able to find it in store lately, so decided to check Amazon. I found it but was very disappointed with what was shipped to me. It isn&#x27;t the creamy formula that gave just the perfect color on my lips. It&#x27;s sheer and doesn&#x27;t leave much tint.</li>
