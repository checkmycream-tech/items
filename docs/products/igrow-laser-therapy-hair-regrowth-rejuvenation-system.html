            <li>Customer service is excellent and will help answer any questions.</li>
            <li>They have the best customer service of any business.</li>
            <li>Love the item !!!</li>
            <li>Lol.</li>
            <li>They seem like a genuinely good company.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I feel good about that.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the results and will continue with this regime to get the maximum growth results for the full 9 months.&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>Even before buying this product, I did some of my own research.</li>
            <li>The fact that its a one time expense is nice also.</li>
            <li>The light is bright, but it does NOT burn the scalp.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;He&#x27;s thinned out more noticibly since then and we suspect if it did work, it was keeping him from going balder faster.</li>
            <li>My wife took a picture of the top of my head so we could evaluate this for ourselves.</li>
            <li>the years I have tried many vitamins and remedies, never produced results like this.</li>
            <li>I know this type of laser therapy is backed by science, but it feels more like a miracle to me.</li>
            <li>I called iGrow and their customer service was enthusiastic and friendly.</li>
            <li>I noticed very full thickness in the crown after maybe six months.</li>
            <li>Can be good, but i will use for 4 months before i really know</li>
            <li>I use the device diligently three times a week for 25 minutes each time, it is effortless and painless and so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to assemble.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Beware its guaranteed for life at huge price to return it.</li>
            <li>The customer service people we totally cool about it: &amp;#34;It works for some, but not all.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Many thanks to blogger OverMachoGrande.</li>
            <li>In addition to this I notice that there is more fullness on the overall top of my head.</li>
            <li>This product takes 6 months to see results but so far very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Even though their own research might be backed by them, I looked at others and they seem to come with a similar conclusion.</li>
            <li>In fact, I can see this clearly after washing my hair and using a comb to separate over the top of my head.</li>
            <li>This is worth every penny, will last you, and honestly works.  </li>
            <li>On the downside, I haven&#x27;t been able to grow the hair back at the front of my forehead, but I haven&#x27;t lost any hair either</li>
            <li>This device looks funny but it works.</li>
            <li>The earlier in life you start using it, the better results you will have.</li>
            <li>For the first month, I still lost a decent amount of hair.</li>
            <li>so I decided that if it did, it was a sound investment, and if it didn&#x27;t, I&#x27;d get money money back.</li>
            <li>and we didn&#x27;t see much improvement.</li>
            <li>If you are suffering from generic hair loss/hereditary- patterned baldness, this iGrow laser light cap will NOT work for you.</li>
            <li>I had tried hair club laser, laser comb and this iGrow laser cap and many other hair loss</li>
            <li>There is new hair growth!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>When I bought the iGrow, I was a freakish, hairless monstrosity, now my whole body is completely covered in hair.</li>
            <li>I have had thinning in the top back of my head for many years, never bald, but definitely thin spots that seemed to be getting worse.&lt;br /&gt;After using the Igrow for about 3 months</li>
            <li>After the first two weeks, I noticed that my hair felt slightly different.</li>
            <li>I know hair loss can be very emotional and with so many \\&quot;fixes\\&quot; on the market it can be expensive and overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Too early to tell if it works at this point</li>
            <li>Over the period of 3 months I could see the new hair starting to come in.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product consistently for 4 months 20 minutes every other day.</li>
            <li>37 year old male.</li>
            <li>I am currently 43 yrs old male and lost about 50% of my hair and is getting thinning as day progress.</li>
            <li>This has given me hope that there will be better solutions down the line but at least I&#x27;m no longer losing hair.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> From the FDA website:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;The Theradome Laser Helmet LH8O PRO is a prescription use therapeutic device indicate d to promote hair&lt;br /&gt;growth in FEMALES, with androgenic alopecia, having Ludwig and Savin Hair Loss Scale classification 1-Il&lt;br /&gt;and Fitzpatrick Skin-Types I to IV.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not approved for men with male pattern baldness. You need to mention this in your advertising.</li>
            <li> Can be good, but i will use for 4 months before i really know</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but I can prove it worked for me based on videos I took on the crown of my head. Can&#x27;t say it worked for the front however. The trick is you have to RELIGOUSLY use for every OTHER day (I did before bedtime) 25 minutes. I noticed very full thickness in the crown after maybe six months. I even took it on vacations with me. Lol. That&#x27;s how dedicated I was. Then I stopped using it to maybe once every two weeks and the thinness in the crown came back. I&#x27;m&lt;br /&gt;Now on the every other day cycle again.  37 year old male.</li>
            <li> I bought the iGrow for my husband a year and a half ago. They guaranteed the product would work so I decided that if it did, it was a sound investment, and if it didn&#x27;t, I&#x27;d get money money back. He used it according to the directions (20 min or so every other day) for six months and we didn&#x27;t see much improvement. I called iGrow and their customer service was enthusiastic and friendly. They said give it another six months and they&#x27;d honor the guarantee. We did. Still not much, and they extended it another six months. When we didn&#x27;t see results after that, I asked for the refund and got it immediately as soon as they received the contraption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He&#x27;s thinned out more noticibly since then and we suspect if it did work, it was keeping him from going balder faster. Could be, might not be. The customer service people we totally cool about it: &amp;#34;It works for some, but not all.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get it under that guarantee, you can&#x27;t go wrong, I promise. They seem like a genuinely good company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to write this review after I saw it on a blog called &amp;#34;Worst Things For Sale,&amp;#34; it&#x27;s not. Whether we got bamboozled or not, they refunded us minus a small stocking fee and I feel good about that.</li>
            <li> Do not be fooled that this looks like a gimicky, overly expensive product for gullible people. I&#x27;ve been using this product consistently for 4 months 20 minutes every other day. After the first two weeks, I noticed that my hair felt slightly different. A little bit fuller, a little bit stronger. For the first month, I still lost a decent amount of hair. On the second, I lost very little hair. Then on the third month, I lost almost no hair at all. There is almost no hair I see in the shower drain! This product by itself has saved my hair. Even before buying this product, I did some of my own research. Even though their own research might be backed by them, I looked at others and they seem to come with a similar conclusion. I have tried Rogaine and Rogaine has done nothing for me. It is both messy and makes my scalp itch. This product on the other was very simple to use. It takes only 2 button presses to start a 20 minute session. On the downside, I haven&#x27;t been able to grow the hair back at the front of my forehead, but I haven&#x27;t lost any hair either and my hairline is no longer receding. This has given me hope that there will be better solutions down the line but at least I&#x27;m no longer losing hair.</li>
            <li> I cut my hair with a #1 which is the lowest setting for a barbers razor the day I got my Igrow. My wife took a picture of the top of my head so we could evaluate this for ourselves. Over the period of 3 months I could see the new hair starting to come in. This device looks funny but it works. The fact that its a one time expense is nice also. I now look forward to relaxing with it on. I use it 2 or 3 times a day for 15 minutes or so and no one bothers me while I have it on. I think the kids are afraid of it :). My wife was very skeptical when I bought it but now she also uses it. Everyones different, you wont know till you try.</li>
            <li> I have had thinning in the top back of my head for many years, never bald, but definitely thin spots that seemed to be getting worse.&lt;br /&gt;After using the Igrow for about 3 months I noticed that the hair seemed to stop shedding as much and thin spots were actually less noticeable. I use the device diligently three times a week for 25 minutes each time, it is effortless and painless and so easy to use. After over four months I can definitely see thickening in those areas. In fact, I can see this clearly after washing my hair and using a comb to separate over the top of my head. There is new hair growth! In addition to this I notice that there is more fullness on the overall top of my head. I am very happy with the results and will continue with this regime to get the maximum growth results for the full 9 months.&lt;br /&gt;Over the years I have tried many vitamins and remedies, never produced results like this. I have also been taking biotin supplements with this device for any added benefit they might provide.&lt;br /&gt;This device works and it is backed by a well known US company. Customer service is excellent and will help answer any questions. I know hair loss can be very emotional and with so many \\&quot;fixes\\&quot; on the market it can be expensive and overwhelming. This is worth every penny, will last you, and honestly works.  Take the plunge and give it a chance. I would not write this unless I thought it would help someone else. I know this type of laser therapy is backed by science, but it feels more like a miracle to me.</li>
            <li> This product takes 6 months to see results but so far very easy to use. I have used only 1 month now.</li>
            <li> If you are suffering from generic hair loss/hereditary- patterned baldness, this iGrow laser light cap will NOT work for you. I don&#x27;t know if there are anything out there will work for that type of hair loss problem. I had tried hair club laser, laser comb and this iGrow laser cap and many other hair loss vitamins pills nothing is working. I am currently 43 yrs old male and lost about 50% of my hair and is getting thinning as day progress.</li>
            <li> When I bought the iGrow, I was a freakish, hairless monstrosity, now my whole body is completely covered in hair. I look like a gigantic pile of wigs! This is not what I wanted! But if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, it may work for you.</li>
            <li> Easy to assemble.  Easy to use.  The light is bright, but it does NOT burn the scalp.  I highly recommend it.  The earlier in life you start using it, the better results you will have.</li>
            <li> Too early to tell if it works at this point</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!! This product does nothing. My husband used this device faithfully for six months and zero hair growth. Now we can&#x27;t get our $700 back because it&#x27;s been too long. We can&#x27;t even contact the seller to complain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Amazon refunded our money. They have the best customer service of any business.</li>
            <li> For the price the count of $5 650nm lasers is too low and pattern not effective. I returned this to my seller and then found the $600 unit with 220 lasers after reading blogs on worldhairloss.org. Many thanks to blogger OverMachoGrande. My results are quite visible after only 5 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Semper fidelis,&lt;br /&gt;Dave</li>
            <li> Product as advertised and timely delivery</li>
            <li> Love the item !!! Bought it for my brother about a month ago and his hair is growing like crazy !</li>
            <li> light goes on and off rapidly and is almost impossible to wear without vomiting. Tried to return it with wholesale warehouse but the wanted 125 to take it back. Beware its guaranteed for life at huge price to return it.</li>
