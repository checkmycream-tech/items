    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Awesome results I&#x27;ve had to deal w unsightly hair all my life now</li>
            <li>Feels great.</li>
            <li>I suffer from pcos and I love this product, works wonderfully,</li>
            <li>Does not work, but smells great and works good as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Has a pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>The scent is not all that pleasant either.</li>
            <li>It works fairly well.  </li>
            <li>I quit using it fairly soon.</li>
            <li>Gigi is good after a Nair or Veet job.</li>
            <li>This lotion had a nice consistency &amp; pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Goes on easy and feels great.  </li>
            <li>Smells amazing, too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of weirded out by all the comments talking about how you have to rub it in.</li>
            <li>I was glad to find it comes in a large bottle this stuff works great.</li>
            <li>Just started using this product and smells great and skin feels amazing soft.</li>
            <li>It works wonderful when the hair grows back in after waxing my loweer leg!</li>
            <li>Nothing outstanding yet,</li>
            <li>then disappears like magic.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even sure that this works at all...</li>
            <li>so I ordered 2 more bottles to give it a chance to work better.</li>
            <li>my hair regrowth becomes more and more minimized the more I use it.</li>
            <li>I did not notice my hairs growing slower, and I keep pretty good track of that.</li>
            <li>So far it is a great product.</li>
            <li>Glad this product is available.</li>
            <li>This product easily gives me an additional week to two weeks between waxing.</li>
            <li>I have used it for about a month but intend on trying to remember to use it everyday for best results.</li>
            <li>i have great amounts of facial hair, minimizes hair growth greatly, takes abought a month to see results, use daily or even 2 times a day</li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>only used it for 5 days, but the company was very good in getting it to me fast.</li>
            <li>The texture is more if a cream oil, I think, but it has a very pleasant scent and works as well as the more expensive lotion.</li>
            <li>Kind of medicinal and old lady ish.</li>
            <li>one good thing about it is that, although the hair grew in at the same rate it always does, I did notice that it was softer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this product after trying many others and really like the way the lotion feels and works.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a quick fix miracle cure</li>
            <li>I gave it good long go, but I don&#x27;t think it works at all.  </li>
            <li>Waxing is definitely worth-</li>
            <li>Still, for less than 10 bucks this is a good product to purchase for this problem.  </li>
            <li>I purchased it with an epilator and used the epilator first, without this product for a couple months, and then started using this with it and saw no difference.  </li>
            <li>This is the only redeeming quality of this product.</li>
            <li>The only problem is you probably should use it more than once just after you shave.</li>
            <li>Works really well for me!</li>
            <li>My second bottle, I love it.....</li>
            <li>I bought this to try it out because I didn&#x27;t want to pay $20 for 6 ounces of a similar lotion I was buying from a famous waxing chain.</li>
            <li>I will not reorder if hair growth does not improve since difference at this point is pretty insignificant</li>
            <li>I started my first bottle in January and it lasted about four months.</li>
            <li>Better than local in-store price.</li>
            <li>Less shaving for sure!  </li>
            <li>Compared with not using it at all?&lt;br /&gt;Either way, it&#x27;ll have to be over a long time, and who has no life to check each day how many hair has grown out of a certain region?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I find I go thru it fairly fast as I use it once a day.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s hope the hair don&#x27;t grow fast .</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li>Haha</li>
            <li>Only I hope that it doesn&#x27;t smell so strong - baby powder smell that I don&#x27;t particularly care for.</li>
            <li>I would suggest using it every day to make it reach its full potential.</li>
            <li>was main reason I bought it.</li>
            <li>I had high expectations for this.</li>
            <li>I like to mix it with a little aromatherapy body oil when I put it on to make it a more &amp;#34;spa&amp;#34; experience and when I use it every day -</li>
            <li>I do have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This lotion definitely works with consistent use.</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It did not irate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This lotion does slow hair growth, but in the ingrown and razor bump department, Tend Skin is a better product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a month and it is a decent enough lotion.</li>
            <li>low price great quality, before I had to shave my underarms and legs every day, after I used GIGI slow grow lotion for a few days my underarms&#x27; hair and legs are gone for three weeks, I&#x27;m getting another one for my daughter</li>
            <li>Slows facial and other growth of hair, and conditions skin, very much worth the price.</li>
            <li>I have to say I really can tell the rate of hair growth on all three areas has slowed down.</li>

            <li> Only I hope that it doesn&#x27;t smell so strong - baby powder smell that I don&#x27;t particularly care for.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a month and it is a decent enough lotion.</li>
            <li> low price great quality, before I had to shave my underarms and legs every day, after I used GIGI slow grow lotion for a few days my underarms&#x27; hair and legs are gone for three weeks, I&#x27;m getting another one for my daughter</li>
            <li> Slows facial and other growth of hair, and conditions skin, very much worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have to say I really can tell the rate of hair growth on all three areas has slowed down.</li>
            <li> mean, how do they know if it really is inhibiting hair grow or not?</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t quite tell if this product makes the hair less, but gradually it definitely makes the hairs thinner and whiter</li>
            <li> This lotion really works to slow down regrowth of hair after waxing.</li>
            <li> My only method of hair removal is shaving with a little tweezing here and there.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s only been a few weeks.</li>
            <li> The cream stays in a white layer on your skin for a few minutes, but then dries in well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this will slow hair growth because I find it unpleasant smelling and also kind of non absorbant</li>
            <li> Also, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Maybe it will work for other people.</li>
            <li> I have bought the kit in the past from gigi and always it comes with a tiny bottle.</li>
            <li> YOu do have to use small amount and rub it in or it will be white.</li>
            <li> but it does help and is cheaper than other options.</li>
            <li> I use it once a day and usually before I got to bed because it does look white on your skin if you don&#x27;t rub it in thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Compared with other products?</li>
            <li> and I prefer other lotions to this as lotions go.</li>
            <li> At least, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad and it didn&#x27;t cause any kind of allergy.</li>
            <li> The slow grow lotion bottle arrived with loose cap so half of the bottle leaked outside</li>
            <li> My method of hair removal is depilatory cream, so after the cream, I applied the Gigi Slow Grow, then used it daily in between using the hair removal cream.  </li>
            <li> use it daily, seems to slow down shaving time.</li>
            <li> After 2.5-3 weeks of almost daily use after a shower, I noticed hair growth slow down.  </li>
            <li> Hair growth does not seem to be at all slowed down by using this product.</li>
            <li> like I said, nothing that will have you jumping up and down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely less hair regrowth since using it.</li>
            <li> Wish their was a slightly stronger formula or something to lessen appearance.</li>
            <li> It seems my skin feels softer and there is less hair growth on both my legs and face.</li>
            <li> I did notice my usually thick coarse hair coming in a little less heavy, but</li>
            <li> Smell is ok but not good or bad.</li>
            <li> it comes less often and they are blonde and extremely thin</li>
            <li> AT ALL, WASTE MONEY</li>
            <li> I shave everyday and have 5 o clock shadow immediately after.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my face for about three weeks to slow the hair growth that I have due to PCOS.</li>
            <li> After almost a month of using this everyday I notice a small difference.</li>
            <li> Feels sticky after use and is not very effective.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to see the hairs at times.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not a total loss, but a disappointment in preventing hair growth.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t slow the hair growth at all</li>
            <li> Gigi Slow Grow Lotion with Argan Oil, works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I used this product on a regular basis, and was disappointed</li>
            <li> I am Italian and have horrible course black hair on my legs.</li>
            <li> mean, I&#x27;ll keep using it because I spend my hard earned money on it, but it stinks so</li>
            <li> But sadly, it didn&#x27;t work for its intended purpose, slowing the growth of hair.</li>
            <li> It seriously could use some fragrance to mask the bad smell.</li>
            <li> Stinks and doesnt work as well as jergens shave minimizing lotion</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it smells bad.</li>
            <li> ;( disappointed</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> It does not have a awful odor.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is neither here nor there.  It moisturizes the area and that is it.  It does not inhibit growth.</li>
            <li> This lotion does slow hair growth, but in the ingrown and razor bump department, Tend Skin is a better product.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this. I purchased it with an epilator and used the epilator first, without this product for a couple months, and then started using this with it and saw no difference.  I gave it two stars as I did not have any skin reaction from it, but it did not do what I had hoped.  Maybe it will work for other people.</li>
            <li> so far so good. only used it for 5 days, but the company was very good in getting it to me fast.</li>
            <li> Awesome results I&#x27;ve had to deal w unsightly hair all my life now it comes less often and they are blonde and extremely thin</li>
            <li> This lotion definitely works with consistent use.</li>
            <li> I have bought the kit in the past from gigi and always it comes with a tiny bottle. I find I go thru it fairly fast as I use it once a day. I was glad to find it comes in a large bottle this stuff works great.</li>
            <li> DIDNOT WORK AT ALL, WASTE MONEY</li>
            <li> It works wonderful when the hair grows back in after waxing my loweer leg! Without it the growth kinda hurts.</li>
            <li> It does not have a awful odor. YOu do have to use small amount and rub it in or it will be white. I have used it for about a month but intend on trying to remember to use it everyday for best results. So far it is a great product.</li>
            <li> I did not notice my hairs growing slower, and I keep pretty good track of that.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my face for about three weeks to slow the hair growth that I have due to PCOS. I have noticed a difference as the hair is starting to grow slower and come in finer. Nothing outstanding yet, but it&#x27;s only been a few weeks. I do have very sensitive skin and this does not irritate and even helps to minimize the bumps. It isn&#x27;t a quick fix miracle cure but it does help and is cheaper than other options. I will do a follow up @ six months as well. The reason I&#x27;m not giving this 5 stars is because I was hoping this product to work faster, but it still does work! I use it twice per day on my face.</li>
            <li> It works fairly well.  I use it once a day and usually before I got to bed because it does look white on your skin if you don&#x27;t rub it in thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I use the cream daily after shaving.  I have yet to see a change in the growth rate at all.</li>
            <li> i used the entire bottle according to instructions and there&#x27;s no difference in the growth rate of the hair after use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how people rate this product.&lt;br /&gt;I mean, how do they know if it really is inhibiting hair grow or not? Compared with other products? Compared with not using it at all?&lt;br /&gt;Either way, it&#x27;ll have to be over a long time, and who has no life to check each day how many hair has grown out of a certain region?&lt;br /&gt;I mean, I&#x27;ll keep using it because I spend my hard earned money on it, but it stinks so bad.&lt;br /&gt;Did the product maker even try smelling it? It seriously could use some fragrance to mask the bad smell.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this will slow hair growth because I find it unpleasant smelling and also kind of non absorbant I quit using it fairly soon. I just didnt want to smell like that... Kind of medicinal and old lady ish.</li>
            <li> The cream stays in a white layer on your skin for a few minutes, but then dries in well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely less hair regrowth since using it.</li>
            <li> I used it on my bikini line.  My method of hair removal is depilatory cream, so after the cream, I applied the Gigi Slow Grow, then used it daily in between using the hair removal cream.  I used this product on a regular basis, and was disappointed it didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one good thing about it is that, although the hair grew in at the same rate it always does, I did notice that it was softer.  When I stopped using it, the hair was coarse again, so I started using it to keep the hair softer.  This is the only redeeming quality of this product.</li>
            <li> I suffer from pcos and I love this product, works wonderfully, i have great amounts of facial hair, minimizes hair growth greatly, takes abought a month to see results, use daily or even 2 times a day</li>
            <li> Feels great. use it daily, seems to slow down shaving time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m testing it, so I don&#x27;t know if it will work as described. At least, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad and it didn&#x27;t cause any kind of allergy.</li>
            <li> The slow grow lotion bottle arrived with loose cap so half of the bottle leaked outside</li>
            <li> Goes on easy and feels great.  Initially appears white (to see coverage) then disappears like magic.  After 2.5-3 weeks of almost daily use after a shower, I noticed hair growth slow down.  Less shaving for sure!  Has a pleasant scent.  Would like to see this product in stores rather than mail away.</li>
            <li> This product easily gives me an additional week to two weeks between waxing. Wish their was a slightly stronger formula or something to lessen appearance.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t quite tell if this product makes the hair less, but gradually it definitely makes the hairs thinner and whiter so it&#x27;s hard to see the hairs at times. I like it as it seems to gradually do the work. Only I hope that it doesn&#x27;t smell so strong - baby powder smell that I don&#x27;t particularly care for.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product. Does not have the desired results. Hair growth does not seem to be at all slowed down by using this product. The scent is not all that pleasant either.</li>
            <li> I love this product. The only problem is you probably should use it more than once just after you shave. I would suggest using it every day to make it reach its full potential. Smells amazing, too.</li>
            <li> Stinks and doesnt work as well as jergens shave minimizing lotion</li>
            <li> This product was opened when I got it</li>
            <li> I love it! low price great quality, before I had to shave my underarms and legs every day, after I used GIGI slow grow lotion for a few days my underarms&#x27; hair and legs are gone for three weeks, I&#x27;m getting another one for my daughter</li>
            <li> Works really well for me! I get a Brazilian wax every 5 weeks but had to call back before my last appointment to tell them that I needed to reschedule because I didn&#x27;t need a wax yet. I don&#x27;t even apply it every day, only when I remember (maybe every 1-2 days?).</li>
            <li> Actually does minimize hair growth and actually lessens it even during the times I forgot to use it! Waxing is definitely worth-it having this product</li>
            <li> My second bottle, I love it.....Spring and Summer must have</li>
            <li> I did receive my order on time, but I ordered the one that contains Argan oil, and the one that I have received has not argan oil at all. I don&#x27;t know if it will work, but it receives 2 stars because I received different thing than the one I ordered - Argan oil in it was main reason I bought it. ;( disappointed</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t slow the hair growth at all but it works as a after shave &amp; it does help with razor bumps</li>
            <li> Does not work, but smells great and works good as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any results when used with the epilator</li>
            <li> Just started using this product and smells great and skin feels amazing soft. Let&#x27;s hope the hair don&#x27;t grow fast .</li>
            <li> This lotion had a nice consistency &amp; pleasant smell. It did not leave my skin oily. But sadly, it didn&#x27;t work for its intended purpose, slowing the growth of hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this to try it out because I didn&#x27;t want to pay $20 for 6 ounces of a similar lotion I was buying from a famous waxing chain. I really like this lotion. The texture is more if a cream oil, I think, but it has a very pleasant scent and works as well as the more expensive lotion.</li>
            <li> Gigi Slow Grow Lotion with Argan Oil, works like a charm. Slows hair growth 75% ! Glad this product is available.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product after trying many others and really like the way the lotion feels and works.  It seems my skin feels softer and there is less hair growth on both my legs and face. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Feels sticky after use and is not very effective. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I always buy this. I do not like these boxes. I do care to say anything.  That is it I am done.</li>
            <li> I just bought this at Sally&#x27;s and put some on my legs. I&#x27;m kind of weirded out by all the comments talking about how you have to rub it in. I don&#x27;t see why you would have to point that out. With any type of lotions or gels you should be rubbing it in well until it gets absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways. I don&#x27;t think it smells bad. Hopefully I&#x27;ll see results because I have cactus legs.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect anything too drastic when it comes to results. I did notice my usually thick coarse hair coming in a little less heavy, but like I said, nothing that will have you jumping up and down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even sure that this works at all...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a month and it is a decent enough lotion. Smell is ok but not good or bad. I am Italian and have horrible course black hair on my legs.I shave everyday and have 5 o clock shadow immediately after. I also have sensitive skin. After almost a month of using this everyday I notice a small difference. The bottle is almost gone so I ordered 2 more bottles to give it a chance to work better. I hope it helps me not feel like such a hairy beast! Haha I will not reorder if hair growth does not improve since difference at this point is pretty insignificant and I prefer other lotions to this as lotions go.It did not irate my sensitive skin. I will write an update after bottle number 2 and 3.</li>
            <li> This lotion does seem to work. I don&#x27;t have to tweeze as often after using it a couple of weeks and the hair growth does seem to have slowed. It doesn&#x27;t come back as coarse either but it does come back. Still, for less than 10 bucks this is a good product to purchase for this problem.  Gigi is good after a Nair or Veet job. It will make the job last longer. It&#x27;s moisturizing and has a smell that I didn&#x27;t find bothersome. I use it every day whether I removed hair that day or not. The white film goes away after it absorbs and can be worn under make up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for over a year and have noticed no difference.  I still have to use depilatories and tweezers just as often as ever.  I gave it good long go, but I don&#x27;t think it works at all.  It is a lotion and can be used for moisturizing so it&#x27;s not a total loss, but a disappointment in preventing hair growth.</li>
            <li> It works but you have to be patient and stick with it, consistency is key. The thicker/coarser the hair growth the longer it takes to see results. I use it on my face, legs and bikini area. My only method of hair removal is shaving with a little tweezing here and there. I have to say I really can tell the rate of hair growth on all three areas has slowed down. Also, a little goes a long way. I started my first bottle in January and it lasted about four months.</li>
            <li> Slows facial and other growth of hair, and conditions skin, very much worth the price. Better than local in-store price.</li>
            <li> This lotion really works to slow down regrowth of hair after waxing. I like to mix it with a little aromatherapy body oil when I put it on to make it a more &amp;#34;spa&amp;#34; experience and when I use it every day - especially twice a day- my hair regrowth becomes more and more minimized the more I use it. It also works when used after shaving. I have only used it on the body, under the arms and on the legs.</li>
            <li> We (my sons and I) use this lotion after shaving and it helps the hair to be finer and easier to shave.</li>
