            <li>This is probably one of the best, underrated toothbrushes on the market.</li>
            <li>I was happy to find these best-in-class tooth brushes on Amazon!  </li>
            <li>Just what I needed.works great</li>
            <li>great</li>
            <li>These items are really the best for oral cleansing.</li>
            <li>The head is large with many bristles and feels absolutely great.</li>
            <li>My favorite toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I would recommend, without hesitation, this or any Reach product to help in the road to healthy teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>Perhaps medium bristle might work better.</li>
            <li>We all have our preferences for personal use items and I find this to be the best cleaning toothbrush on the market.  </li>
            <li>Good Product and right price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had a love affair with having clean and health teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge toothbrush nerd.</li>
            <li>Works great compared to those smaller headed brushes.</li>
            <li>Perfect for me and for some reason it&#x27;s hard to find in the stores these days.</li>
            <li>It was an excellent value; the brush cleans OK, just not perfectly.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re good brushes, but not really soft.</li>
            <li>Only drawback is wish they would&#x27;ve sent more assortment of colors!</li>
            <li>The right product and delivered quickly.  </li>
            <li>Size is important and this toothbrush is just large enough to do an effective job.</li>
            <li>They are worth the quality like it&#x27;s brand name.</li>
            <li>(I also use the same brush for it&#x27;s original purpose, and it does a fine job there, too!)</li>
            <li>Better than most other toothbrushes I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>These brushes have the right shape head, ergonomic handle and what EVERY dentist recommends--soft bristles.</li>
            <li>I think the Advanced model is defective because the back side kills you mouth.</li>
            <li>This handle was flat and not as comfortable.</li>
            <li>Once I do this, I can go to town with this particular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It blows away the more expensive top shelf brushes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i&#x27;ve tried others but this is the only one that feels right to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most of the new brushes out there have small skinny heads that have poor surface coverage, it doesn&#x27;t feel as effective.</li>
            <li>And this seller did send the Reach soft type as stated in their ad.</li>
            <li>-sized head with soft bristles that are easier on the gums.&lt;br /&gt;angled neck for reaching every tooth</li>
            <li>Therefore, I&#x27;ve always felt comfortable with the Reach toothbrushes especially this model, since it is difficult to find in my city and especially a toothbrush to fit within the toothbrush holder.  </li>
            <li>I typically run my toothbrush under some hot water to get it extra pliable and soft.</li>
            <li>Terrific full-head soft bristle toothbrush, with tongue scraper on the back.  </li>

            <li> Easiest to handle &amp; brush back of teeth, but bristles not exactly soft.</li>
            <li> I was one of the dentists&#x27; earliest patients to try, back in the early 1980s, the teeth whitening products which at that time was harsh and bulky--a clear but heavy cast of your teeth was made and similar to today you had to put the solution within that cast and wear this for hours--waking hours--one could not sleep with this</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a hard brush to find as well.</li>
            <li> These brushes are hard to find elsewhere but they seem to have plenty on sale.</li>
            <li> Yes, sad, I know.</li>

            <li> Met expectations.  The right product and delivered quickly.  No surprises.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed.works great</li>
            <li> Just your basic toothbrush.  Perfect for me and for some reason it&#x27;s hard to find in the stores these days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a love affair with having clean and health teeth and gums.

            <li> Wonderful toothbrushes.  And this seller did send the Reach soft type as stated in their ad.</li>
            <li> I had a Reach toothbrush that had a rounder handle. This handle was flat and not as comfortable.</li>
            <li> Handle is too flexible</li>
            <li> Bought these for craft use, and they&#x27;re perfect for that! (I also use the same brush for it&#x27;s original purpose, and it does a fine job there, too!)</li>

            <li> great toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;been using them for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;full-sized head with soft bristles that are easier on the gums.&lt;br /&gt;angled neck for reaching every tooth surface.&lt;br /&gt;good handle length and rubber grips for holding it comfortably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve tried others but this is the only one that feels right to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;good value through amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;using subscribe &amp; save on this item for two reasons:&lt;br /&gt; - discount&lt;br /&gt; - i don&#x27;t have to remember to replace them every 3 months.  it&#x27;s automatic!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge toothbrush nerd. Yes, sad, I know. This is probably one of the best, underrated toothbrushes on the market. The head is large with many bristles and feels absolutely great. I typically run my toothbrush under some hot water to get it extra pliable and soft. Once I do this, I can go to town with this particular toothbrush. Most of the new brushes out there have small skinny heads that have poor surface coverage, it doesn&#x27;t feel as effective. It&#x27;s a hard brush to find as well. It blows away the more expensive top shelf brushes. When I do locate this brush, I buy a bunch of them.</li>
            <li> The order came as promised and undamaged. These brushes are hard to find elsewhere but they seem to have plenty on sale. Works great compared to those smaller headed brushes. Only drawback is wish they would&#x27;ve sent more assortment of colors!</li>
            <li> These items are really the best for oral cleansing. They are worth the quality like it&#x27;s brand name.</li>
            <li> These are the hardest, stiffest toothbrushes I&#x27;ve ever seen to be called &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;.  Neither of us could use them so they went into the cleaning supplies.</li>
            <li> We all have our preferences for personal use items and I find this to be the best cleaning toothbrush on the market.  Size is important and this toothbrush is just large enough to do an effective job.</li>
            <li> Good Product and right price. Don&#x27;t scrub hard and they last.</li>
            <li> I could not use this toothbrush. I think the Advanced model is defective because the back side kills you mouth.</li>
            <li> Terrific full-head soft bristle toothbrush, with tongue scraper on the back.  My dentist provided me the \\&quot;compact\\&quot; Colgate brushes.  I was happy to find these best-in-class tooth brushes on Amazon!  Oral B and Colgate have taken up all the shelf space at my grocery store...I despise that \\&quot;grocery-store-practice.</li>
            <li> These brushes have the right shape head, ergonomic handle and what EVERY dentist recommends--soft bristles. This price for bulk cannot be beat! They don&#x27;t expire and should be replaced every three months, so discounted bulk buy is a no-brainer.</li>
