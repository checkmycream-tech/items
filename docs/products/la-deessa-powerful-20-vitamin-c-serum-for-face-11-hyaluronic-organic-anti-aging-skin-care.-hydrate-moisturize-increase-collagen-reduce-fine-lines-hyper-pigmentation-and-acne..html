            <li>The owner of the company is so sweet and down right amazing!</li>
            <li>I have very dry and sensitive skin and read so many good things about Vitamin C Serum.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve really seen a huge difference in my skin since using this.</li>
            <li>There are alot of serums out there and this one will have its own personal section in my medicine cabinet for forever.</li>
            <li>The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclaimer: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free - for review purposes.</li>
            <li>I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using &lt;</li>
            <li>I have vowed to never get any kind of plastic surgery unless medically necessary.  </li>
            <li>I received a complimentary product to test.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and leaves my face feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I tried the La Deesa 20% Vitamin C Anti-Aging Elixir, and although I&#x27;ve only been using it for almost a week, I love the instant toning and tightening this amazing Elixir gives to my face.  </li>
            <li>Rose and La Deessa have a life long customer in</li>
            <li>Many reputable manufacturers and developers are bringing to the average person the products and devices once only available to the rich and famous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only that, but the healthy glow I have, even under makeup, makes me happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Apart from it feeling soft and smooth</li>
            <li>but I would not buy this as a first choice.</li>
            <li>First let me start with that</li>
            <li>My skin instantly feels tighter and more hydrated upon first application.</li>
            <li>Purchasing my second bottle, I love the glow and tightness</li>
            <li>only suggestion is use this product during night time and wear sunscreen or a moisturizer with spf protection during the day for better results.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it!!  </li>
            <li>loved this left my face feeling fresh and younger looking</li>
            <li>I waited to write my review until I had used it consistently for a month</li>
            <li>Plus, itâ€™s not expensive.  </li>
            <li>My pores were smaller, and my skin had more of a radiant glow.</li>
            <li>I tried La Deessaâ€™s Premium Anti-Aging Elixir 20% Vitamin C Serum for three two weeks and let me tell you about the results I found â€“ smoother skin, lightening of spots on my face, and the overall feel of my face being more hydrated.  </li>
            <li>I didnâ€™t want to believe that this product really did that, but it did!  </li>
            <li>If applying toner, do so first.  </li>
            <li>It makes skin smooth and even I have a sensitive skin I don&#x27;t get any rash from this product.</li>
            <li>I use this and a all natural organic facial cream Love it!</li>
            <li>and I noticed a positive change in my skin.</li>
            <li>I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all).</li>
            <li>I have noticed positive changes in my skins apperance.</li>
            <li>Nice sized bottle will last a super long time!</li>
            <li>and I can say my skin looks better than it has in a very long time.</li>
            <li>I suffer from redness, large pores, and a loss of elasticity.</li>
            <li>It also acts as a moisturizer for your skin, so definitely recommend that your grab one or more of these up while you can - even if you are young or don&#x27;t have skin issues you never know when they will start, so get started while you can!  </li>
            <li>The serum does have a very &amp;#34;water-like&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>and it really has minimized my pores.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen much difference in my skin at all.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>and while they left my skin feeling smooth, they never removed the redness or shrank my pores.&lt;br</li>
            <li>How much do I have to use each day?  </li>
            <li>After buying a few of these serums, I decided to make my own.  </li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>:/ Before the stinky smell it made my face baby soft, i loved it.</li>
            <li>I had less hyperpigmentation, and my fine lines have all but diminished!</li>
            <li>it will keep them from going wild and taking over before their time ;)</li>
            <li>Watered down or just cheap!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The mixture did moisten my skin and make it more soft, which my hands are always very dry.</li>
            <li>As I get older, I notice more fine lines, puffy and tired eyes and a less-glowing look to my face.  </li>
            <li>Especially if you get out of the shower when your pores are more open and you apply it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will not be repurchasing this product any time soon, but maybe once I&#x27;m a bit older I might reconsider.</li>
            <li>Once the liquid touches the skin it turns almost sticky like.. but dries immediately and your left with soft, smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend these products because of the results but also because I am hypersensitive to EVERYTHING</li>
            <li>highly recommend this line of skin</li>
            <li>Highly reccommend it.</li>
            <li>After a few weeks, it was even better, and you could literally see and feel the difference in my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Compared to other Vitamin C serums I find this one very high in quality and would definitely recommend it to others seeking to give their skin a more &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li>I will give the new bottle a rty and then update my review accordingly.</li>
            <li>Its not fabulous but its a nice additive to my daily routine.</li>
            <li>The company was very professional in addressing this concern.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly the same if not better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She simply explained that true serums do not include the emollients (oils, lubricants and thickening agents) that create the thicker, creamier texture of a traditional moisturizing lotion or cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m disappointed, I didn&#x27;t see much difference, itâ€™s just Ok, but I will give it more time.</li>
            <li>delivers!The liquid is clear.</li>
            <li>Now, I am critical of myself, so I guess I wasnâ€™t paying much attention to the difference it was having on my face.</li>
            <li>makes my face feel so soft ...</li>
            <li>My friends and family have nearly all commented on my improved appearance.</li>
            <li>It makes my face soft as silk and completely fades into my skin with no greasy feel.</li>
            <li>Itâ€™s gentle enough that I use it on my eyes and neck - no stinging - and they look smoother.  </li>
            <li>My Face looks so young and soft.</li>
            <li>Growing old gracefully?  </li>
            <li>It would seem that this tiny bottle will last for 5-6 months so it is economical as well.</li>
            <li>This sinks in right away.</li>
            <li>I purchased my first bottle of La Deessa vitamin c serum from a local medical clinic where I am a patient.</li>
            <li>am seeing firmness, no more crows-feet, smaller pores, no breakouts, no irritation, discoloration gone and all I have is a brighter more glowing and youthful</li>
            <li>to the serum in order to keep it as highly concentrated as possible it has that &amp;#34;water-like&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I wish the liquid was a little more thick, it was kind of hard to apply with the dropper and how watery the ingredients are</li>
            <li>That is, until folks started saying how my complexion is starting to clear up, lighten up and brighten up.</li>
            <li>I think the packaging is nice, you receive a little dropper as this formula is a clear thin liquid.</li>
            <li>Do not go overboard with this stuff a few drops at the most is all you need.</li>
            <li>I have tried other Vitamin C serums in the past and they are a really nice way to give your skin an even tone and give your skin a little bit of a lift.</li>
            <li>I actually prefer the water-like consistency if it is more concentrated versus the thick serum, creams and elixirs that have less potency.</li>

            <li> The best way I can describe the smell of the elixir to you is to describe it as smelling like witch hazel or aloe vera.</li>

            <li> I love it, glides on smoothly, absorbs quickly</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve really seen a huge difference in my skin since using this.</li>
            <li> There are alot of serums out there and this one will have its own personal section in my medicine cabinet for forever.</li>
            <li> The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disclaimer: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free - for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using &lt;</li>
            <li> I have vowed to never get any kind of plastic surgery unless medically necessary.  </li>
            <li> I received a complimentary product to test.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and leaves my face feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I tried the La Deesa 20% Vitamin C Anti-Aging Elixir, and although I&#x27;ve only been using it for almost a week, I love the instant toning and tightening this amazing Elixir gives to my face.  </li>
            <li> Rose and La Deessa have a life long customer in</li>
            <li> Many reputable manufacturers and developers are bringing to the average person the products and devices once only available to the rich and famous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not only that, but the healthy glow I have, even under makeup, makes me happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Apart from it feeling soft and smooth</li>
            <li> but I would not buy this as a first choice.</li>
            <li> First let me start with that</li>
            <li> My skin instantly feels tighter and more hydrated upon first application.</li>
            <li> Purchasing my second bottle, I love the glow and tightness</li>
            <li> only suggestion is use this product during night time and wear sunscreen or a moisturizer with spf protection during the day for better results.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it!!  </li>
            <li> loved this left my face feeling fresh and younger looking</li>
            <li> I waited to write my review until I had used it consistently for a month</li>
            <li> Plus, itâ€™s not expensive.  </li>
            <li> My pores were smaller, and my skin had more of a radiant glow.</li>
            <li> I tried La Deessaâ€™s Premium Anti-Aging Elixir 20% Vitamin C Serum for three two weeks and let me tell you about the results I found â€“ smoother skin, lightening of spots on my face, and the overall feel of my face being more hydrated.  </li>
            <li> I didnâ€™t want to believe that this product really did that, but it did!  </li>
            <li> If applying toner, do so first.  </li>
            <li> It makes skin smooth and even I have a sensitive skin I don&#x27;t get any rash from this product.</li>
            <li> I use this and a all natural organic facial cream Love it!</li>
            <li> and I noticed a positive change in my skin.</li>
            <li> I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all).</li>
            <li> I have noticed positive changes in my skins apperance.</li>
            <li> Nice sized bottle will last a super long time!</li>
            <li> and I can say my skin looks better than it has in a very long time.</li>
            <li> I suffer from redness, large pores, and a loss of elasticity.</li>
            <li> It also acts as a moisturizer for your skin, so definitely recommend that your grab one or more of these up while you can - even if you are young or don&#x27;t have skin issues you never know when they will start, so get started while you can!  </li>
            <li> The serum does have a very &amp;#34;water-like&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> and it really has minimized my pores.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen much difference in my skin at all.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> and while they left my skin feeling smooth, they never removed the redness or shrank my pores.&lt;br</li>
            <li> How much do I have to use each day?  </li>
            <li> After buying a few of these serums, I decided to make my own.  </li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> :/ Before the stinky smell it made my face baby soft, i loved it.</li>
            <li> I had less hyperpigmentation, and my fine lines have all but diminished!</li>
            <li> it will keep them from going wild and taking over before their time ;)</li>
            <li> Watered down or just cheap!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The mixture did moisten my skin and make it more soft, which my hands are always very dry.</li>
            <li> As I get older, I notice more fine lines, puffy and tired eyes and a less-glowing look to my face.  </li>
            <li> Especially if you get out of the shower when your pores are more open and you apply it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will not be repurchasing this product any time soon, but maybe once I&#x27;m a bit older I might reconsider.</li>
            <li> Once the liquid touches the skin it turns almost sticky like.. but dries immediately and your left with soft, smooth skin.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend these products because of the results but also because I am hypersensitive to EVERYTHING</li>
            <li> highly recommend this line of skin</li>
            <li> Highly reccommend it.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks, it was even better, and you could literally see and feel the difference in my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Compared to other Vitamin C serums I find this one very high in quality and would definitely recommend it to others seeking to give their skin a more &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li> I will give the new bottle a rty and then update my review accordingly.</li>
            <li> Its not fabulous but its a nice additive to my daily routine.</li>
            <li> The company was very professional in addressing this concern.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly the same if not better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She simply explained that true serums do not include the emollients (oils, lubricants and thickening agents) that create the thicker, creamier texture of a traditional moisturizing lotion or cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed, I didn&#x27;t see much difference, itâ€™s just Ok, but I will give it more time.</li>
            <li> delivers!The liquid is clear.</li>
            <li> Now, I am critical of myself, so I guess I wasnâ€™t paying much attention to the difference it was having on my face.</li>
            <li> makes my face feel so soft ...</li>
            <li> My friends and family have nearly all commented on my improved appearance.</li>
            <li> It makes my face soft as silk and completely fades into my skin with no greasy feel.</li>
            <li> Itâ€™s gentle enough that I use it on my eyes and neck - no stinging - and they look smoother.  </li>
            <li> My Face looks so young and soft.</li>
            <li> Growing old gracefully?  </li>
            <li> It would seem that this tiny bottle will last for 5-6 months so it is economical as well.</li>
            <li> This sinks in right away.</li>
            <li> I purchased my first bottle of La Deessa vitamin c serum from a local medical clinic where I am a patient.</li>
            <li> am seeing firmness, no more crows-feet, smaller pores, no breakouts, no irritation, discoloration gone and all I have is a brighter more glowing and youthful</li>
            <li> to the serum in order to keep it as highly concentrated as possible it has that &amp;#34;water-like&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I wish the liquid was a little more thick, it was kind of hard to apply with the dropper and how watery the ingredients are</li>
            <li> That is, until folks started saying how my complexion is starting to clear up, lighten up and brighten up.</li>
            <li> I think the packaging is nice, you receive a little dropper as this formula is a clear thin liquid.</li>
            <li> Do not go overboard with this stuff a few drops at the most is all you need.</li>
            <li> I have tried other Vitamin C serums in the past and they are a really nice way to give your skin an even tone and give your skin a little bit of a lift.</li>
            <li> I actually prefer the water-like consistency if it is more concentrated versus the thick serum, creams and elixirs that have less potency.</li>
            <li> This elixir helps combat aging skin, loss of collagen, loss of skin firmness, loss of skin elasticity, face wrinkles, eye wrinkles, neck wrinkles, chest wrinkles, sagging skin, dry skin, dull skin, age spots, discoloration, hyperpigmentation, acne, and mild acne scar repair.</li>
            <li> it gives my skin, as well has help heal old scars and dark spots.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t been using it that long, but starting to see a difference in my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> my dry patches were instantly gone, so i used it to cut the shea butter i use for my hands</li>
            <li> And Vitamin C is essential to helping the cells in our skin renew and rejuvenate themselves, especially from sun damage or other problems.  </li>
            <li> but I had to be quite careful with them as they can make my skin very dry and flaky if I don&#x27;t dilute them with moisturizer or use less frequently.  </li>
            <li> Let dry and sink in for 10 minutes, then moisturizer.</li>
            <li> As the serum began to dry, I could already feel my face getting tighter.</li>
            <li> Wash your face and pat it dry.  </li>
            <li> Have dry skin</li>
            <li> And I can&#x27;t see how \\&quot;a few drops\\&quot; is enough for an entire face.</li>
            <li> i have been drying my skin out because i am so completely tired of break outs, i needed something that my skin will drink and it wont end up a hour or two later an oily mess, so after my shower and my skin being completely dried out i reached for this to try it out, first i had to smell it, no such thing no smell strange to me</li>
            <li> The bottle label and ingredients are different from previous bottles.  </li>
            <li> It actually has helped reduce the circles under my eyes, and given my skin a radience it didn&#x27;t previously have.</li>
            <li> Between the two, it does keep the wrinkle, less obvious.  </li>
            <li> I am 45 years old, I have large pores and ugly dark spots from having adult acne.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about wrinkles yet, but I definitely have noticed that some of my dark spots on my face have become noticeably lighter!</li>
            <li> it got a stinky smell like a wet towel that has been sitting out.</li>
            <li> After using  for a few weeks now I have noticed that some spots on my face are lighter and in some cases gone entirely!  </li>
            <li> Over the next few days, the changes were noticeable.</li>
            <li> Have been using for several weeks, so hard to comment on results...yet, but I actually believe I am seeing some lightening in my dark spots and acne scars.</li>
            <li> It is less dry and no side effects too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mother of two, and needless to say, my skin isn&#x27;t exactly what it used to be.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time I tried La Deessa, I was skeptical, as I am with any product.</li>
            <li> I had acne scarring and it lightened some of it slightly, but it&#x27;s just not strong enough to heal my skin.</li>
            <li> When I began, My skin was overall very dull, Deep frown lines, crows feet, and uneven tone.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t make a final decision on it until I try it for at least another week.</li>
            <li> I opened the bottle and sniffed--no odd smell.</li>
            <li> Everyone wants natural items, no one wants nasty residue and unhealthy additives in their skincare products.  </li>
            <li> I could also feel my skin get slightly tighter as the elixir dried on my face.</li>
            <li> Iâ€™ve been using this for a few months (less than 6) now</li>
            <li> I have noticed my skin is a little brighter since using this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for a little over Three weeks now and already have seen improvements in my skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a little over a month now and it still amazes me every time I look in the mirror, as I continue to notice the wonders this product is providing to my skin.</li>
            <li> I used the little glass dropper to add a few drops to my face, neck, and chest, and I rubbed it in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this everyday for a little over 3 weeks now</li>
            <li> Since she does not add any unnecessary chemicals or traditional emollients, etc.</li>
            <li> This serum has been part of my nightly routine for a few months now.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how I have lived without it all these years??</li>
            <li> Then, apply a small amount to face, neck, and decollete.  </li>
            <li> Although I have a history of sun damage, uneven, spotty skin is subtly changing.</li>
            <li> but it was just hard to get the drops on my skin with just using that alone</li>
            <li> No need to rub in hard to your skin.</li>
            <li> I would encourage anyone to try it and be consistant with using it at least once a day</li>
            <li> I hate getting old...</li>
            <li> Well at least without surgery for me!  </li>
            <li> It has been a game changer....</li>
            <li> Used other vitamin C serums, this was the worst!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have noticed my skin is a little brighter since using this product.</li>
            <li> It has this tingle-y feeling to it. Especially if you get out of the shower when your pores are more open and you apply it. I had acne scarring and it lightened some of it slightly, but it&#x27;s just not strong enough to heal my skin. I think my skin has a bit more glow to it after using this product (I have olive/warm toned brown skin). I cannot say how it works on wrinkles, because I don&#x27;t have any. I like this product, but I wish it did more for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not be repurchasing this product any time soon, but maybe once I&#x27;m a bit older I might reconsider.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, use moisturizer after.</li>
            <li> I love anything that is Anti-Aging.  As I get older, I notice more fine lines, puffy and tired eyes and a less-glowing look to my face.  I tried the La Deesa 20% Vitamin C Anti-Aging Elixir, and although I&#x27;ve only been using it for almost a week, I love the instant toning and tightening this amazing Elixir gives to my face.  Not only that, but the healthy glow I have, even under makeup, makes me happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact it has organic Aloe and 11% Hyaluronic Acid as well as the 20% Vitamin C, which gives your complexion a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I love the versatility of it for one. This elixir helps combat aging skin, loss of collagen, loss of skin firmness, loss of skin elasticity, face wrinkles, eye wrinkles, neck wrinkles, chest wrinkles, sagging skin, dry skin, dull skin, age spots, discoloration, hyperpigmentation, acne, and mild acne scar repair.I don&#x27;t have to worry about wrinkles yet, but I definitely have noticed that some of my dark spots on my face have become noticeably lighter! I also love the way it feels against my skin! It dries quickly and leaves my face feeling soft and smooth. Apart from it feeling soft and smooth I could also feel my skin get slightly tighter as the elixir dried on my face. Pretty impressive if you ask me. This elixir can be used every morning before applying your makeup and every evening before going to bed. The best way I can describe the smell of the elixir to you is to describe it as smelling like witch hazel or aloe vera. Aloe is the second ingredient so I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s it. The serum does have a very &amp;#34;water-like&amp;#34; consistency though. The company was very professional in addressing this concern. She simply explained that true serums do not include the emollients (oils, lubricants and thickening agents) that create the thicker, creamier texture of a traditional moisturizing lotion or cream. Since she does not add any unnecessary chemicals or traditional emollients, etc. to the serum in order to keep it as highly concentrated as possible it has that &amp;#34;water-like&amp;#34; consistency. Honestly, if a product is working I don&#x27;t care what consistency it has. I actually prefer the water-like consistency if it is more concentrated versus the thick serum, creams and elixirs that have less potency. So far, I am enjoying the benefits of this elixir and I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to see beautiful results!</li>
            <li> More of a watery consistency, I felt it was okay but I would not buy this as a first choice. I wish the liquid was a little more thick, it was kind of hard to apply with the dropper and how watery the ingredients are but once it was on my skin and rubbed in I found the results to be alright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mixture did moisten my skin and make it more soft, which my hands are always very dry. I do like the dropper applicator but it was just hard to get the drops on my skin with just using that alone so I dropped the drops onto my fingers and applied it that way. I was provided a sample for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I will be buying more of this very soon. I wish it would come in a bigger bottle though</li>
            <li> Such An Awesome product! I&#x27;ve been using the product for a little over Three weeks now and already have seen improvements in my skin. I have acne prone skin and have seen great improvements with less breakouts and my skin seems a lot smoother.I Love that it&#x27;s plant based and Organic. I&#x27;ve been looking for a product like this for awhile now. Can&#x27;t wait to see even more improvements with The anti-aging And Wrinkle care for my skin the longer I use it.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t regret buying this...have received many complements.  and you littereally feel your face get tighter after using it.  you also will notice your skin has a glow afterwards too.  not worried about these wrinkles now that I have found this.  it will keep them from going wild and taking over before their time ;)</li>
            <li> First let me start with that I am 45 years old, I have large pores and ugly dark spots from having adult acne. I can say after using the product for 3 weeks folks started to ask if I was in love or pregnant (God forbid). I was being told almost daily my face had a  glow, a healthy glow. I told them I had started using La Deessaâ€™s Vitamin C serum. Now, I am critical of myself, so I guess I wasnâ€™t paying much attention to the difference it was having on my face. That is, until folks started saying how my complexion is starting to clear up, lighten up and brighten up. One of my doctors even used the word Luminous! LOL, that explains why La Deessa calls the product Luminous 2.5% Retinol. It is starting to lighten up even the darkest spots I have. By the grace of God I donâ€™t have many wrinkles, yet. Nonetheless, I am using the Ageless Peptide Eye Serum and I think that has even softened some of the finer lines I do have. I wish La Deessa made a sunscreen, but until they do I will use what I have. I highly recommend these products because of the results but also because I am hypersensitive to EVERYTHING and I havenâ€™t had an reaction or break out while using them. Awesome products La Deessa!!</li>
            <li> Great Price Great Product Great Service !!! What more could i say thank you very much.</li>
            <li> The bottle label and ingredients are different from previous bottles.  I will give the new bottle a rty and then update my review accordingly.</li>
            <li> nice, ... and can see a difference.. hoping I can snag another one for the 1.00 deal..... makes my face feel so soft ... and frankly I&#x27;ll prolly buy it again even at full cost. that&#x27;s how much I like it... :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure how many anti aging products I have tried, but I do have to say this is the top of the line! Absolutely, amazing! I have finally found something that is actually taking my aging spots away, and my wrinkles are definitely reduced! Thank you La Deessa you have a very, very wonderful product and I will continue using it! God Bless you! Lisa</li>
            <li> I love this product from La Deessa! My skin instantly feels tighter and more hydrated upon first application. I love the bottle it&#x27;s perfect size and so easy to use a few drops so you aren&#x27;t wasting any. This product smells like Aloe but it&#x27;s not overwhelming. I personally like to use it when i get out of the shower and before bed. I have been using it for 2 weeks and have already noticed my fine lines diminishing!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it twice a day and it really has minimized my pores. ( I have been gifted with large pores) I feel it tighten my skin and give me a nice glow from the vitamin C</li>
            <li> Good product, use it daily and feel that I can see a difference in reduction of lines/wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I have used the product twice daily for the last weeks  and I can see no difference at all ! . I won&#x27;t make a final decision on it until I try it for at least another week.</li>
            <li> I love this!! I had a spot on my face that has been there almost one year.. This took care of it!! Super Excited and love love it..</li>
            <li> Very happy so far with this product. Have been using for several weeks, so hard to comment on results...yet, but I actually believe I am seeing some lightening in my dark spots and acne scars.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C on your skin is a must! This product is plant based which is really amazing! It is 72% certified organic. Does not leave your skin greasy feeling. Apply 2 daily for best results morning and night. Can be worn under your makeup. Product is made in the USA. Do not go overboard with this stuff a few drops at the most is all you need. Product has no smell to me. Absorbs super quickly. No need to rub in hard to your skin. If you want to give your skin a herbal treatment this product delivers!The liquid is clear. Nice sized bottle will last a super long time! I was sent this bottle free to review for this company and give honest real reviews</li>
            <li> Purchasing my second bottle, I love the glow and tightness it gives my skin, as well has help heal old scars and dark spots. I get comments all the time about how great my skin looks being in my 30&#x27;s. I use this and a all natural organic facial cream Love it!</li>
            <li> Once the liquid touches the skin it turns almost sticky like.. but dries immediately and your left with soft, smooth skin.  I love this product. I put this on my surgical scar as well and it&#x27;s definitely making a noticable change in its apperance.</li>
            <li> This stuff was amazing at first but overtime it got a stinky smell like a wet towel that has been sitting out. Now I dont want to use it anymore :/ Before the stinky smell it made my face baby soft, i loved it. wondering why it started to smell like that?</li>
            <li> great for bags under my eye , and my skin .</li>
            <li> A wonderful face serum</li>
            <li> This is one of many vitamin c serums, that&lt;br /&gt; I have tried. I am using the 3 piece set.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this line of skin care.&lt;br /&gt;I was given this item, free, for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> Really have enjoyed using this product. After washing I apply and it leaves my face feeling moisturizer with no sticky feeling. I have noticed a brighter complection after use.</li>
            <li> This sinks in right away. I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts as of yet, I have combination acne prone skin. I have noticed how nicer my skin feels and looks.</li>
            <li> Great product! Leaves my skin feeling very smooth!</li>
            <li> It does help with the bags under the eyes.</li>
            <li> I purchased my first bottle of La Deessa vitamin c serum from a local medical clinic where I am a patient. I trust this clinic. They are always on the leading edge of alternative and regenerative medicine. They exhaustively research everything, prior to offering to their patients. So, I was pretty confident that it would improve my skin. But, it actually exceeded my expectations! I noticed a difference within one day. Iâ€™ve been using La Deessa for 2 weeks now, as recommended, applying it the evening and in the morning before my make-up. My skin feels tighter and looks brighter. My friends and family have nearly all commented on my improved appearance. I was so happy with the results, I went to buy another bottle and it was already Sold Out! They recommended that I buy at Amazon. So, here I am! Buying my 2nd bottle. I would highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> I reviewed OZ Naturals as well. This product is exactly the same if not better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin tone is brighter and smoother with reduction in inflammation from acne breakout or sun damage. Being $10 cheaper than OZ Naturals, I would recommend purchasing this product instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only suggestion is use this product during night time and wear sunscreen or a moisturizer with spf protection during the day for better results.</li>
            <li> Love my La Desaa Vitamin C Serum! The owner of the company is so sweet and down right amazing! This product leaves your skin feeling baby bottom smooth, hydrates your skin and repairs sun damage!  I was sent 2 bottle just because I was the first to order in my state! Will definitely be back! I support this company and its mission. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li> Thank you La Deessa for sending me this great product to try out!  I am now one your dedicated Vitamin C Serum fans!  This formula hydrates my skin perfectly and leaves it feeling smooth.  After using  for a few weeks now I have noticed that some spots on my face are lighter and in some cases gone entirely!  It has even helped with my fine lines!  Love this stuff and I would highly recommend it!!  I am not sure how I have lived without it all these years??</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe what I get for this price.  I&#x27;ve worked for years in spas and comparable serums are five times the cost.  Plus, this is organic.  Found on the EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep site.  Excellent product!</li>
            <li> I received this serum free for review and really like it. I have tried other Vitamin C serums in the past and they are a really nice way to give your skin an even tone and give your skin a little bit of a lift. I think the packaging is nice, you receive a little dropper as this formula is a clear thin liquid. Applying to the skin is easy and the product doesn&#x27;t tingle or sting.  My skin looked a lot fresher after I applied this. The product is organic and plant based which always makes me feel more comfortable when I use a product. Compared to other Vitamin C serums I find this one very high in quality and would definitely recommend it to others seeking to give their skin a more &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li> This serum gives visible results.  It&#x27;s a good value and would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2weeks and can see a difference in pore size.  Some of the discolouration is lighter, but not all. Quite tricky to spread over your face.</li>
            <li> My skin loves this stuff! It feels great on your skin and I noticed a positive change in my skin.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen much difference in my skin at all.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product in the morning and night for 9 days.  Love the feel and quality of my skin.  I have used a multitude of products.  Shall stick with this. Have already reordered.  Do not want to be without.</li>
            <li> works good thanks i can see a difference</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Feels great on my skin.  I received the shipment the day after ordering it.  Amazing service La Deessa!</li>
            <li> After using the serum for about two weeks, my skin was noticeably softer and smoother. I had less hyperpigmentation, and my fine lines have all but diminished! I love this serum and I know you will too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does this Elixir work great, it has soo many more benefits!&lt;br /&gt;Never tested on animals&lt;br /&gt;Paraben Free&lt;br /&gt;Sulfate Free&lt;br /&gt;Vegan&lt;br /&gt;Alcohol Free&lt;br /&gt;Filler Free&lt;br /&gt;Phthalates Free</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I had just given birth and was severely sleep deprived. I was given this product by a friend and noticed a huge difference in the bags under my eyes after just one use.  I have used this product for a little over a month now and it still amazes me every time I look in the mirror, as I continue to notice the wonders this product is providing to my skin.</li>
            <li> I use this every day twice a day and I love it, I am trying to go to preventative route when it comes to my skin care, I&#x27;m 27 and feel like its time to prevent anything from happening lol and I love this serum. There are alot of serums out there and this one will have its own personal section in my medicine cabinet for forever. I love it, glides on smoothly, absorbs quickly and it seems to even be evening out my skintone :) #bonuspoints! :)&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#60;3 La Deessa &#x3D; Quality :)</li>
            <li> Received great detailed inst. from the seller.  Great vitamin C serum!!</li>
            <li> What can I say..LOVE IT &amp;#60;LOVE IT LOVE IT ! It actually has helped reduce the circles under my eyes, and given my skin a radience it didn&#x27;t previously have. Highly reccommend it.</li>
            <li> loved this left my face feeling fresh and younger looking</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with this Serum. I waited to write my review until I had used it consistently for a month so I could give an honest opinion on its effectiveness. When I began, My skin was overall very dull, Deep frown lines, crows feet, and uneven tone. After one month of using twice daily, I look like a different person. The frown lines are dramatically reduced, the crows feet, undetectable, and my overall complexion is bright, and even, and much more youthful. I will never be without this stuff again. La Deessa truly nailed it with this fountain of youth serum :)</li>
            <li> Burned when I used it!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. It makes my face soft as silk and completely fades into my skin with no greasy feel.</li>
            <li> Iâ€™ve been using this for a few months (less than 6) now and I give it an A+! Itâ€™s gentle enough that I use it on my eyes and neck - no stinging - and they look smoother.  Plus, itâ€™s not expensive.  Try it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for almost a month now.  Its smooth going on.  Dries quickly.  I wait 5mins and put my regular face cream on.  Between the two, it does keep the wrinkle, less obvious.  But I have to use it all the time, or my face wrinkles up again. UGH! I hate getting old...lol&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed, I didn&#x27;t see much difference, itâ€™s just Ok, but I will give it more time.</li>
            <li> This serum has been part of my nightly routine for a few months now. I have noticed smoother skin and the prevention of blemishes. Although I have a history of sun damage, uneven, spotty skin is subtly changing.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff!  Fantastic price.  I&#x27;ve really seen a huge difference in my skin since using this.</li>
            <li> After buying a few of these serums, I decided to make my own.  Way cheaper, and I think my skin looks way better.</li>
            <li> My problems didn&#x27;t worsen, but no improvement either. And I can&#x27;t see how \\&quot;a few drops\\&quot; is enough for an entire face. It took a dropper to do my face and neck. I used this morning and night for over a month, after washing. Let dry and sink in for 10 minutes, then moisturizer. Exfoliating twice weekly. No dice. Happy others got results, but I didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 2-11-15&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to say that Miss Rose completely blew my mind. She spoke with me via telephone &amp; asked me several questions about my skin &amp; the different products I have used. She is very kind &amp; patient,&amp; helped me with some suggestions. I have never encountered such customer service EVER. I am now using this serum along with the eye serum over it. It&#x27;s working!my skin is tightening and pores appear smaller. I plan to incorporate the Retinol 2.5% soon! I am adding 2 stars to give this a 5.</li>
            <li> very good, fast shipping</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mother of two, and needless to say, my skin isn&#x27;t exactly what it used to be. I suffer from redness, large pores, and a loss of elasticity. I&#x27;ve tried numerous remedies, including facial peels, moisturizing lotions, etc. and while they left my skin feeling smooth, they never removed the redness or shrank my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tried La Deessa, I was skeptical, as I am with any product. I opened the bottle and sniffed--no odd smell. It actually smelled somewhat like aloe, which is the second ingredient listed on the bottle. I used the little glass dropper to add a few drops to my face, neck, and chest, and I rubbed it in. As the serum began to dry, I could already feel my face getting tighter. It was pretty impressive. I didn&#x27;t notice a big difference in the redness and pore size right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I continued applying La Deessa Vitamin C Serum twice a day--once in the morning before I applied my makeup and once at night after I removed my makeup. Over the next few days, the changes were noticeable. My pores were smaller, and my skin had more of a radiant glow. After a few weeks, it was even better, and you could literally see and feel the difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am incredibly satisfied with LaDeessa Premium Anti Aging Elixir, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a pick-me-up for their skin. It works!</li>

            <li> If you are truly looking for an anti aging serum that works....look no further!!! I was given this product for free to review, thank you so much btw, and I am so glad I was chosen for this review!! I&#x27;ve been using this everyday for a little over 3 weeks now and I can totally see a difference in my crows feet!! I am so thankful to have found this product!! I won&#x27;t purchase anything else, ever again!!</li>
            <li> I tried La Deessaâ€™s Premium Anti-Aging Elixir 20% Vitamin C Serum for three two weeks and let me tell you about the results I found â€“ smoother skin, lightening of spots on my face, and the overall feel of my face being more hydrated.  I didnâ€™t want to believe that this product really did that, but it did!  So what is in this bottle you askâ€¦It is made with certified organic ingredients and is made in the USA (which I think we all like).  So how does this product work?  How much do I have to use each day?  Wash your face and pat it dry.  If applying toner, do so first.  Then, apply a small amount to face, neck, and decollete.  If desired, follow with moisturizer.  Itâ€™s recommended to use the serum each evening before bed and every morning prior to applying makeup.  I did apply twice a day per the instructions.</li>
            <li> A product that changes to your fear not in a month but then we will be buying it again since it works so well my dermatologist said it was the perfect combination</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. My Face looks so young and soft. Would recommend this to others</li>
            <li> So after trying this product today mind you i just received it today luckily the mail came before my shower and i was dieing to try this i have been drying my skin out because i am so completely tired of break outs, i needed something that my skin will drink and it wont end up a hour or two later an oily mess, so after my shower and my skin being completely dried out i reached for this to try it out, first i had to smell it, no such thing no smell strange to me so i used some on my face my dry patches were instantly gone, so i used it to cut the shea butter i use for my hands and it worked for that too! i cant wait to make some beauty bars with this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation). I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all). Your experience may differ. The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> love it will be ordering again</li>
            <li> Use this often. Haven&#x27;t seen a lot of results. I have more than one bottle  will see.</li>
            <li> I have very dry and sensitive skin and read so many good things about Vitamin C Serum. This particular brand has been working very good for me - I have been using it at night and I have been loving it so far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please do check my in depth blog review on this product: http://wp.me/p1u6bQ-fB&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free - for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers. I&#x27;m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user&#x27;s standpoint.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of weeks and I&#x27;ve noticed a drastic change in my skin. It&#x27;s soft and smooth and glowing :) love this stuff </li>
            <li> great product. My face is so smooth and silky. It is less dry and no side effects too. I will keep on using this product till i&#x27;m out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used this kind of products buying on Amazon but it is wonderful.  It makes skin smooth and even I have a sensitive skin I don&#x27;t get any rash from this product.</li>
            <li> I use this after I wash my face. Since I started using it, my face feels smoother and firmer. Fine lines a going away without irritation. Am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my skin, but it feel good going on.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It is by far the best VITAMINE C &amp;#34;Serum&amp;#34; I have ever used.  So light on the skin but very powerful! I have noticed positive changes in my skins apperance. What I have noticed is an over all tighter and brighter look, skin tone has also evened out.  I&#x27;m 55... I&#x27;m so glad I found this product.  It has been a game changer.... I would encourage anyone to try it and be consistant with using it at least once a day and I think you will notice a differenct!  I noticed as well as my friends and family!  They are now commenting on how beautiful my skin looks! I will be using this product for the rest of my life!  Thank you for letting me share my experience!  I hope it has helped you! I&#x27;m all about the win win!</li>
            <li> The jury is still out as to whether this makes a difference - have only been using it about 2 1/2 weeks.</li>
            <li> my mother&#x27;s gift,She is very satisfied</li>
            <li> Noticed a huge change in fine lines by applying day and night! Have dry skin so it&#x27;s great to have a product I can apply a moisturizer over if needed. Love how natural it is too, great ingredients.</li>
            <li> [...]    review    I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using &lt;[...] Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> Used other vitamin C serums, this was the worst! Watered down or just cheap! With 20% C , I felt nothing , saw nothing. Will not purchase thru Amazon again</li>
            <li> Works okay. Its not fabulous but its a nice additive to my daily routine.</li>
            <li> This might be worthy of 5 stars but I don&#x27;t know yet. I&#x27;ve used it for just over 3 weeks and I can say my skin looks better than it has in a very long time. It would seem that this tiny bottle will last for 5-6 months so it is economical as well. I&#x27;ve used prescription retinoids which also helped my skin but I had to be quite careful with them as they can make my skin very dry and flaky if I don&#x27;t dilute them with moisturizer or use less frequently.  This product doesn&#x27;t seem to have that affect at all. I do still use a retinoid in conjunction with this. It comes with instructions and you simply wash your face and then apply this prior to any moisturizer or retinoid. Love it, it was a good buy.</li>
            <li> Growing old gracefully?  Well at least without surgery for me!  I have vowed to never get any kind of plastic surgery unless medically necessary.  I think it&#x27;s okay to be myself and age BUT if I can help stop the aging process and make my skin look better naturally all the better for me!  I had not heard of La Deessa before this promotion, but they do sell a great product and it&#x27;s awesome.  It is plant-based and almost all organic, making it a great product for you to use on your skin.  Everyone wants natural items, no one wants nasty residue and unhealthy additives in their skincare products.  And Vitamin C is essential to helping the cells in our skin renew and rejuvenate themselves, especially from sun damage or other problems.  It also acts as a moisturizer for your skin, so definitely recommend that your grab one or more of these up while you can - even if you are young or don&#x27;t have skin issues you never know when they will start, so get started while you can!  :)  I received a complimentary product to test.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t been using it that long, but starting to see a difference in my skin tone.  Will have to see how it works as the time goes by.</li>
            <li> The absolute best line of skin care I have tried!!!!  My under eyes have responded like never before!!!!  Also, Rose is an absolute class act!!!! I received a shipment of this product that was shattered on arrival!  With one email to her she took care of me and replaced the product for me.  Even though the product was broke in shipping and no fault of her own she took care of it no questions asked!!!!  Rose and La Deessa have a life long customer in me!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please believe me.  This review is me and entirely me.  Thank you for reading</li>
            <li> Recommended , the best is really good.</li>
