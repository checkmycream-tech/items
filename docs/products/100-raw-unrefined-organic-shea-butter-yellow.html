            <li>it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>I have bought this product 3 times already and they all have been a successful experience for me.</li>

            <li>I was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased w this product.</li>
            <li>It was as good as the Mountain Rose Herb organic Shea butter</li>
            <li>I love this shea butter!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Absolutely in love with this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this product!</li>
            <li>Fantastic product and great vendor support for a variety of options for use.</li>
            <li>I would skip this product and go for a lotion of some kind, which is what I ended up doing.</li>
            <li>The shea butter came very well packed and in excellent condition.</li>
            <li>I make my own face and body lotions.  </li>
            <li>Goes on nice and creamy and not oily.</li>
            <li>Also if you put some on your hands and warm it up by rubbing it gets oily which makes it easier to apply all over your body.</li>
            <li>I also really appreciated the e-mail I received from the Adwi company with some great skincare recipes and suggestions using the Shea butter!</li>
            <li>Nice smell.</li>
            <li>Great product--smells good and moisturizes really well!</li>
            <li>but it is very easy to spread.</li>
            <li>but it melts in your hand and becomes very easy to spread after that.</li>
            <li>I chose this one primarily because of statements by others regarding good customer service and satisfaction.</li>
            <li>It is the best Shea butter that I&#x27;ve used this far.</li>
            <li>Not to worry, you won&#x27;t smell like coco butter as the pleasant fragrance goes away quickly.    </li>
            <li>I got this for my first time to make homemade lotion and it was a great product and priced well.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smooth and does not leave a greesy feel on the skin.</li>
            <li>Lol kinda strange, but it has great health/beauty benefits.</li>
            <li>But I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>would love to purchase it again</li>
            <li>and I wanted to give it some time before I was able to review it.</li>
            <li>I love Adwi Organics.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this Shea Butter</li>
            <li>So glad I tried this brand.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more soon</li>
            <li>and I fell in love</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>It goes on nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>I love it .....</li>
            <li>Creamy texture, nutty flavor, fabulous effect on the skin!</li>
            <li>however I can&#x27;t say for sure.</li>
            <li>Also adwi Organics has a better smell.</li>
            <li>I thought the product was one of the better Shea butters on the market....</li>
            <li>Give it a try :)</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li>Just used it and love the quality, feel, and absorption.</li>
            <li>More like a paste.</li>
            <li>Quick shipment, very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>My questions were answered quickly and courteously.</li>
            <li>No offensive perfumes, ideal for use &amp;#34;as is&amp;#34; or for adding other ingredients to concoct your own beauty product.</li>
            <li>I love how smooth and creamy it is</li>
            <li>Other brands that I&#x27;ve tried have been dry/crumbly but one is perfect!</li>
            <li>Easy to work with.</li>
            <li>What I received looked and smelled as I would expect of a high quality Shea butter, and was delivered when it was supposed to be delivered, well protected and in good form.</li>
            <li>Sometimes 100% Shea butter can be strong but this smell was a good normal Shea butter</li>
            <li>You have to warm it up first by rubbing it in your hands</li>
            <li>Quick shipping!</li>
            <li>If you have it on your beauty desk you may thru all your body lotions, hair wax, hand creams away, cos you will never find anything as good as natural as shea butter!</li>
            <li>Addressing complaints I came across in my research for a substitute brand, I happily report that the Adwi Shea butter I received was free of mold, obvious impurities, foul smell, compromised packaging, and delayed delivery.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth.  </li>
            <li>Produces fantastic lotion and face products.  </li>
            <li>It has been years since my feet and heals have been so smooth.</li>
            <li>Smooth texture, melts into the skin without a waxy after feel.</li>
            <li>The product rubs on smooth and absorbs well.</li>
            <li>and I just could find one that went on smooth and provided results.  </li>
            <li>I received some of this shea butter through a free trial.</li>
            <li>my feet would be smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li>Overall it is a very nice product and I will buy it again and recommend you do as well.</li>
            <li>Ordered this product based on the reviews of others and I am not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>The product came on time, and so far I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Super smooth butter - no grit.  </li>
            <li>The butter smells and feel nice and the packaging is simple and fitting.</li>
            <li>After using this for four days I no longer have to clean skin off the bed.     </li>
            <li>My doctor was so impressed by how soft my skin is following surgery that he wanted to know what I was using.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel very soft and gives it a nice glow as well as already helping to fade my acne scars and has not made me breakout.</li>
            <li>Natural, moisturizing, love it!</li>
            <li>I really like that this is unfiltered since it rubs on my skin very smoothly.</li>
            <li>It was amazing, it made my skin really soft.</li>
            <li>this stuff is cool</li>
            <li>It has helped her skin tremendously.</li>
            <li>It shipped quickly and is phenomenal--I&#x27;m not trying anything else for my skin again.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal Holyfield!!</li>
            <li>Perfect moisturizer for all skin types but especially for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Well, not so great, but it fades away after a few minutes, so it does not interfere with my perfume</li>
            <li>but this was quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li>Though the product did not work for me, the prompt customer service is worth mentioning.  </li>
            <li>I also love that it&#x27;s not heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li>This Raw Shea Butter is not heavy and greasy, so I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>They contacted me promptly and put through a credit right away and said I did not have to return the product since there was a blizzard here and a travel ban in effect.  </li>
            <li>A great price for unrefined organic &amp; raw.</li>
            <li>Will certainly purchase again!</li>
            <li>It shipped very fast.</li>
            <li>Great shea butter overall thick with great sealing properties especially for skin and hair</li>
            <li>The Shea butter scent is very light, unlike the last company I ordered from, and I don&#x27;t mind it at all.</li>
            <li>This was my first time buying Shea butter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really helping my sons eczema!</li>
            <li>I have Tried so many different medicated ointments and creams and nothing seemed to work.</li>
            <li>Overall I am pleased with keeping it as one of my staple products.</li>
            <li>After the first use, I was hooked.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s in the first stages of cracking.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>idk what exactly it does</li>
            <li>This is my first time working with shea butter</li>
            <li>The cost is also very reasonable for the large amount of shea butter you are receiving.</li>
            <li>I found this particular brand of Shea Butter to be worth the money.</li>
            <li>and I bought this brand after reading the positive reviews associated with it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>my lips have been really dry and most balms just coat the lip.</li>
            <li>I also been rubbing the excess on my lips and my lips are super soft.</li>
            <li>It also spreads on nice and smooth and for those who are familiar with Shea butters, sometimes they&#x27;re really hard and require a lot of massaging to make them manageable, so that&#x27;s definitely another plus.</li>
            <li>A wonderfully pure shea butter and a main ingredient in my homemade body balms!</li>
            <li>you only need a little, it is best used by putting a small amount in your hand and letting it warm up when it has softened it goes on easy....makes your skin feel soft and moist...</li>
            <li>Great product, big jar, it really helps to hydrate skin, skin feels hydrated all day long, I like that is a natural product</li>
            <li>I warm a little in my hand and use it.</li>
            <li>great product, but arrived with broken lid</li>
            <li>, that was very helpful.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>But this makes my skin smooth without added any extra oils and shine to my face!</li>
            <li>I use it on the whole family.</li>
            <li>I primarily use it with essential oils (rub it together in my hands).</li>
            <li>It blended really well with the oils that I used.</li>
            <li>It is 100%  real Shea butter.</li>
            <li>I use it straight from the bottle just rubbing a bit between my hands to melt it and smoothing it on.</li>
            <li>About the product, l found it very greasy and not moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>and when I put it on, it is very greasy and for an hour or two afterwards, feels somewhat moist,</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>it is soothing for my skin and has made my complexion so much nicer.  </li>
            <li>In summer the consistency is very workable.</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that it remains solid in form, but soft to the touch before you apply it to desired areas.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different natural and organic lotions to no avail.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this, I have been trying to use natural products whenever possible.  </li>
            <li>My hair is softer and the mixture turn out nice and fluffy.</li>
            <li>I love how rich and thick it is</li>
            <li>I wanted to give it a good amount of time and several different ways to use it before writing the review and requesting the refund since it is money back guaranteed.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s velvety smooth and really sooth the very dry skin on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li>It is scentless and has a little natural odor which is kind of earthly ...</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t last it fades quickly....</li>
            <li>I recently received this product last week and I love it.</li>
            <li>Most facial lotions and eye creams make my skin red and puffy.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>High quality.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>at high speed with an electric hand mixer.  </li>
            <li>High quality Shea butter.</li>
            <li>Works really well for replenishing super dry skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve made several successful batches of hard lotion and body butter</li>
            <li>It does not have an overpowering smell and it soaks into the skin relatively fast, leaving skin soft but not greasy.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this raw Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>While I love the fact that this shea butter is unrefined, raw, organic and grade A, it&#x27;s the hardest shea butter I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li>My main reason for wanting to try it was for my 1 year old&#x27;s eczema.</li>
            <li>When applying this initially it felt a bit more greasy than expected</li>
            <li>i cut back on using them due to that fact, although I truly enjoyed the product.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this product to use in combination with coconut oil and essential oils to make a foot balm for my dry heals.</li>
            <li>I got this for my 18 month old who has eczema and after about 2 weeks  </li>
            <li>Skin feels so soft when using it.</li>
            <li>Since starting the fast of Ramadan</li>
            <li>I use it on my naturally curly hair to add weight and combat dryness.</li>
            <li>I use it on my natural coils and it looks in the moisture without leaving residue.</li>
            <li>You can tell that its all natural by the form that it is in and the smell is natural with no added perfume scent.</li>
            <li>I also use it after my shower at night and it absorbs into my skin and makes my skin soooo soft.</li>
            <li>I must say I was surprised with the results,  </li>
            <li>If u like natural remedies for skin and hair this product is for u.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even gentle enough to use on her face.</li>
            <li>I have used this for nearly a month now</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin so soft and keeps it moisturized all day.</li>
            <li>I have &amp;#34;winter itch&amp;#34; and this has so helped soothe AND keep my skin soft and supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The twist cap container keeps butter fresh unlike the flimsy snap on lids from other companies.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the coco butter-like inherent fragrance of this brand and like knowing it is raw.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>However, I live in MA and have 20 plus inches of snow and a blizzard going on outside, with a travel ban in effect, so I will have to wait until the blizzard subsides to request the refund.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your skin very hydrated and moisturized for a very long time.</li>
            <li>I loved the concept of buying the organic raw shea butter, but the content is rock hard</li>
            <li>The final result was amazingly fluffy and rich.</li>
            <li>and you need so little well worth the price you pay.  </li>
            <li>I find that rough areas are softening and going away and dryness is much improved.    </li>
            <li>I need a substantial product with a certain amount of staying power to overcome dryness from gardening and constant hand washing and generally dry skin.  </li>
            <li>The price on this raw Shea butter was much better than other brands.</li>
            <li>So I tend to use my other organic shea butter which is much easier to manager.</li>
            <li>Much smoother than other Shea butters I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I live in OH and have chronic dry skin.</li>
            <li>This product leaves her skin feeling smooth and moist, not greasy and heavy like with other products.</li>
            <li>I am sorry to say this but the shea butter carried a very strong smell that even the lavender essential oil could not mask.  </li>
            <li>It will give any dry skin the hydration it needs leaving the skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>I recommend this Shea Butter to anyone with dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am really disappointed because I was really looking forward to making my own body lotions</li>
            <li>It is super hard and only melts when rubbed into the skin, so</li>
            <li>This was the first time I used the Raw Unrefined Shea Butter.</li>

            <li> However, I decided to try this by itself and I have yet to make the foot balm as this stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> I have bought this product 3 times already and they all have been a successful experience for me.</li>
            <li> and it smells nice too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product and would recommend it to anyone who desires beautiful looking skin.</li>

            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased w this product.</li>
            <li> It was as good as the Mountain Rose Herb organic Shea butter</li>
            <li> I love this shea butter!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely in love with this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product and great vendor support for a variety of options for use.</li>
            <li> I would skip this product and go for a lotion of some kind, which is what I ended up doing.</li>
            <li> The shea butter came very well packed and in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> I make my own face and body lotions.  </li>
            <li> Goes on nice and creamy and not oily.</li>
            <li> Also if you put some on your hands and warm it up by rubbing it gets oily which makes it easier to apply all over your body.</li>
            <li> I also really appreciated the e-mail I received from the Adwi company with some great skincare recipes and suggestions using the Shea butter!</li>
            <li> Nice smell.</li>
            <li> Great product--smells good and moisturizes really well!</li>
            <li> but it is very easy to spread.</li>
            <li> but it melts in your hand and becomes very easy to spread after that.</li>
            <li> I chose this one primarily because of statements by others regarding good customer service and satisfaction.</li>
            <li> It is the best Shea butter that I&#x27;ve used this far.</li>
            <li> Not to worry, you won&#x27;t smell like coco butter as the pleasant fragrance goes away quickly.    </li>
            <li> I got this for my first time to make homemade lotion and it was a great product and priced well.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smooth and does not leave a greesy feel on the skin.</li>
            <li> Lol kinda strange, but it has great health/beauty benefits.</li>
            <li> But I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> would love to purchase it again</li>
            <li> and I wanted to give it some time before I was able to review it.</li>
            <li> I love Adwi Organics.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Shea Butter</li>
            <li> So glad I tried this brand.</li>
            <li> Will be ordering more soon</li>
            <li> and I fell in love</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> It goes on nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love it .....</li>
            <li> Creamy texture, nutty flavor, fabulous effect on the skin!</li>
            <li> however I can&#x27;t say for sure.</li>
            <li> Also adwi Organics has a better smell.</li>
            <li> I thought the product was one of the better Shea butters on the market....</li>
            <li> Give it a try :)</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li> Just used it and love the quality, feel, and absorption.</li>
            <li> More like a paste.</li>
            <li> Quick shipment, very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> My questions were answered quickly and courteously.</li>
            <li> No offensive perfumes, ideal for use &amp;#34;as is&amp;#34; or for adding other ingredients to concoct your own beauty product.</li>
            <li> I love how smooth and creamy it is</li>
            <li> Other brands that I&#x27;ve tried have been dry/crumbly but one is perfect!</li>
            <li> Easy to work with.</li>
            <li> What I received looked and smelled as I would expect of a high quality Shea butter, and was delivered when it was supposed to be delivered, well protected and in good form.</li>
            <li> Sometimes 100% Shea butter can be strong but this smell was a good normal Shea butter</li>
            <li> You have to warm it up first by rubbing it in your hands</li>
            <li> Quick shipping!</li>
            <li> If you have it on your beauty desk you may thru all your body lotions, hair wax, hand creams away, cos you will never find anything as good as natural as shea butter!</li>
            <li> Addressing complaints I came across in my research for a substitute brand, I happily report that the Adwi Shea butter I received was free of mold, obvious impurities, foul smell, compromised packaging, and delayed delivery.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth.  </li>
            <li> Produces fantastic lotion and face products.  </li>
            <li> It has been years since my feet and heals have been so smooth.</li>
            <li> Smooth texture, melts into the skin without a waxy after feel.</li>
            <li> The product rubs on smooth and absorbs well.</li>
            <li> and I just could find one that went on smooth and provided results.  </li>
            <li> I received some of this shea butter through a free trial.</li>
            <li> my feet would be smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> Overall it is a very nice product and I will buy it again and recommend you do as well.</li>
            <li> Ordered this product based on the reviews of others and I am not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> The product came on time, and so far I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Super smooth butter - no grit.  </li>
            <li> The butter smells and feel nice and the packaging is simple and fitting.</li>
            <li> After using this for four days I no longer have to clean skin off the bed.     </li>
            <li> My doctor was so impressed by how soft my skin is following surgery that he wanted to know what I was using.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel very soft and gives it a nice glow as well as already helping to fade my acne scars and has not made me breakout.</li>
            <li> Natural, moisturizing, love it!</li>
            <li> I really like that this is unfiltered since it rubs on my skin very smoothly.</li>
            <li> It was amazing, it made my skin really soft.</li>
            <li> this stuff is cool</li>
            <li> It has helped her skin tremendously.</li>
            <li> It shipped quickly and is phenomenal--I&#x27;m not trying anything else for my skin again.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal Holyfield!!</li>
            <li> Perfect moisturizer for all skin types but especially for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Well, not so great, but it fades away after a few minutes, so it does not interfere with my perfume</li>
            <li> but this was quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li> Though the product did not work for me, the prompt customer service is worth mentioning.  </li>
            <li> I also love that it&#x27;s not heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li> This Raw Shea Butter is not heavy and greasy, so I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> They contacted me promptly and put through a credit right away and said I did not have to return the product since there was a blizzard here and a travel ban in effect.  </li>
            <li> A great price for unrefined organic &amp; raw.</li>
            <li> Will certainly purchase again!</li>
            <li> It shipped very fast.</li>
            <li> Great shea butter overall thick with great sealing properties especially for skin and hair</li>
            <li> The Shea butter scent is very light, unlike the last company I ordered from, and I don&#x27;t mind it at all.</li>
            <li> This was my first time buying Shea butter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really helping my sons eczema!</li>
            <li> I have Tried so many different medicated ointments and creams and nothing seemed to work.</li>
            <li> Overall I am pleased with keeping it as one of my staple products.</li>
            <li> After the first use, I was hooked.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s in the first stages of cracking.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> idk what exactly it does</li>
            <li> This is my first time working with shea butter</li>
            <li> The cost is also very reasonable for the large amount of shea butter you are receiving.</li>
            <li> I found this particular brand of Shea Butter to be worth the money.</li>
            <li> and I bought this brand after reading the positive reviews associated with it.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> my lips have been really dry and most balms just coat the lip.</li>
            <li> I also been rubbing the excess on my lips and my lips are super soft.</li>
            <li> It also spreads on nice and smooth and for those who are familiar with Shea butters, sometimes they&#x27;re really hard and require a lot of massaging to make them manageable, so that&#x27;s definitely another plus.</li>
            <li> A wonderfully pure shea butter and a main ingredient in my homemade body balms!</li>
            <li> you only need a little, it is best used by putting a small amount in your hand and letting it warm up when it has softened it goes on easy....makes your skin feel soft and moist...</li>
            <li> Great product, big jar, it really helps to hydrate skin, skin feels hydrated all day long, I like that is a natural product</li>
            <li> I warm a little in my hand and use it.</li>
            <li> great product, but arrived with broken lid</li>
            <li> , that was very helpful.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> But this makes my skin smooth without added any extra oils and shine to my face!</li>
            <li> I use it on the whole family.</li>
            <li> I primarily use it with essential oils (rub it together in my hands).</li>
            <li> It blended really well with the oils that I used.</li>
            <li> It is 100%  real Shea butter.</li>
            <li> I use it straight from the bottle just rubbing a bit between my hands to melt it and smoothing it on.</li>
            <li> About the product, l found it very greasy and not moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> and when I put it on, it is very greasy and for an hour or two afterwards, feels somewhat moist,</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> it is soothing for my skin and has made my complexion so much nicer.  </li>
            <li> In summer the consistency is very workable.</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that it remains solid in form, but soft to the touch before you apply it to desired areas.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different natural and organic lotions to no avail.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this, I have been trying to use natural products whenever possible.  </li>
            <li> My hair is softer and the mixture turn out nice and fluffy.</li>
            <li> I love how rich and thick it is</li>
            <li> I wanted to give it a good amount of time and several different ways to use it before writing the review and requesting the refund since it is money back guaranteed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s velvety smooth and really sooth the very dry skin on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> It is scentless and has a little natural odor which is kind of earthly ...</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t last it fades quickly....</li>
            <li> I recently received this product last week and I love it.</li>
            <li> Most facial lotions and eye creams make my skin red and puffy.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> High quality.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> at high speed with an electric hand mixer.  </li>
            <li> High quality Shea butter.</li>
            <li> Works really well for replenishing super dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made several successful batches of hard lotion and body butter</li>
            <li> It does not have an overpowering smell and it soaks into the skin relatively fast, leaving skin soft but not greasy.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this raw Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> While I love the fact that this shea butter is unrefined, raw, organic and grade A, it&#x27;s the hardest shea butter I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> My main reason for wanting to try it was for my 1 year old&#x27;s eczema.</li>
            <li> When applying this initially it felt a bit more greasy than expected</li>
            <li> i cut back on using them due to that fact, although I truly enjoyed the product.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product to use in combination with coconut oil and essential oils to make a foot balm for my dry heals.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 18 month old who has eczema and after about 2 weeks  </li>
            <li> Skin feels so soft when using it.</li>
            <li> Since starting the fast of Ramadan</li>
            <li> I use it on my naturally curly hair to add weight and combat dryness.</li>
            <li> I use it on my natural coils and it looks in the moisture without leaving residue.</li>
            <li> You can tell that its all natural by the form that it is in and the smell is natural with no added perfume scent.</li>
            <li> I also use it after my shower at night and it absorbs into my skin and makes my skin soooo soft.</li>
            <li> I must say I was surprised with the results,  </li>
            <li> If u like natural remedies for skin and hair this product is for u.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even gentle enough to use on her face.</li>
            <li> I have used this for nearly a month now</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft and keeps it moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> I have &amp;#34;winter itch&amp;#34; and this has so helped soothe AND keep my skin soft and supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The twist cap container keeps butter fresh unlike the flimsy snap on lids from other companies.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy the coco butter-like inherent fragrance of this brand and like knowing it is raw.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> However, I live in MA and have 20 plus inches of snow and a blizzard going on outside, with a travel ban in effect, so I will have to wait until the blizzard subsides to request the refund.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your skin very hydrated and moisturized for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I loved the concept of buying the organic raw shea butter, but the content is rock hard</li>
            <li> The final result was amazingly fluffy and rich.</li>
            <li> and you need so little well worth the price you pay.  </li>
            <li> I find that rough areas are softening and going away and dryness is much improved.    </li>
            <li> I need a substantial product with a certain amount of staying power to overcome dryness from gardening and constant hand washing and generally dry skin.  </li>
            <li> The price on this raw Shea butter was much better than other brands.</li>
            <li> So I tend to use my other organic shea butter which is much easier to manager.</li>
            <li> Much smoother than other Shea butters I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I live in OH and have chronic dry skin.</li>
            <li> This product leaves her skin feeling smooth and moist, not greasy and heavy like with other products.</li>
            <li> I am sorry to say this but the shea butter carried a very strong smell that even the lavender essential oil could not mask.  </li>
            <li> It will give any dry skin the hydration it needs leaving the skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I recommend this Shea Butter to anyone with dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed because I was really looking forward to making my own body lotions</li>
            <li> It is super hard and only melts when rubbed into the skin, so</li>
            <li> This was the first time I used the Raw Unrefined Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> It is thick yet easily absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> it makes my skin so soft all day long, big plus for me because my face was very dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it only for a few days on a few dry patches and by day 3 I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li> The reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is that its so firm I had to melt it down and add oils to soften it, at a busy time when I would have appreciated the option to use it &amp;#34;neat&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I got this for my two year old who has been going swimming for quite some time now and his skin for really rough and dry and ezecma on his face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Store in small air tight glass container at a cool room te pasture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Will last you a long time!</li>
            <li> but then in an hour or two, my skin goes back to being dry.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and its not heavy which is a plus.</li>
            <li> Have gotten this a few times and loved it,  this time it was gritty and doesn&#x27;t blend as well, hoping it is a bad batch?</li>
            <li> The only thing is every time I used it, I&#x27;ve used it on my hair with other hair products</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way considering I&#x27;ve had it for about 2 or 3 weeks and have barely made a dent in it.</li>
            <li> Like I said, I have tried several preparations both using this by itself and with other ingredients and have not had any luck.  </li>
            <li> It is very hard at first</li>
            <li> I use it for my dry feet.</li>
            <li> my face no longer feels dry</li>
            <li> It has been just what I needed for my children&#x27;s extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally found a product that I trust on my babies delicate sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Noticable improvement to my dry skin spots after using it just once!</li>
            <li> Really really difficult if not impossible to spread into my skin.</li>
            <li> He has very dry feet and peeling skin.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t apply anything to my face unless prescribed by my dermatologist because i have EXTREMELY oily and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have a burn mark on my finger that is real dry and peels.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a few months back</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.    </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> If my face is feeling tight and dry, I will rub some of the shea butter between my hands, then &amp;#34;pat&amp;#34; it all over my face--&amp;#62;this</li>
            <li> u can use this with other oils mix in almond oil</li>
            <li> Quality is not consistent</li>
            <li> This is due to metal implanted in his feet &amp; legs.</li>
            <li> I usually buy that was currently out of stock.</li>
            <li> I always melt it down in a casual double boiler set-up on very low heat, add my choice of carrier oil to it to bring it to a creamier consistency, than add essential oils tailored to my needs.</li>
            <li> I have no idea what took me so long to buy raw shea butter.</li>
            <li> My heels are a little rough even after coming from getting a pedicure.</li>
            <li> its not real solid where its hard to scoop out of the jar.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s barely there, not strong at all... but hard to ignore since it&#x27;s on my skin.</li>
            <li> The consistency was hard at the temperature in my home and has maintain so to the last few spoonfuls.  </li>
            <li> Slightly oily but once that process of the skin soaking it all in passes you will like the way</li>
            <li> Everyday when I get done with my shower,  I rub this between my hands and then massage into my skin from the neck down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing a little difference in her skin.</li>
            <li> It has a little bit of a scent - sort of nutty???  </li>
            <li> I think I was expecting this to be a little softer and therefore easier to scoop out of the jar.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shea butter to make hair and body products for my two little girls.</li>
            <li> This shea butter seemed a little smoother as if there was some oils added</li>
            <li> wife bought this expensive French Shea butter cream which did wonders on my dry legs</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Better than using all the harsh chemical lotions that you get the stores.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If comes out fluffy like whipped</li>
            <li> but thats what you would get from any raw shea butter.</li>
            <li> After one week of using this raw Shea butter, my legs no longer look like they&#x27;re covered in alligator skin.</li>
            <li> raw Shea butter&lt;</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little hard to apply.</li>
            <li> Just a very small tad on my hair defines my curls and moisturizes my hair without making it greasy or weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Other natural Shea butters I&#x27;ve tried were hard and clumpy with an unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I like the texture--a creamy cheese like paste that melts in palms upon rubbing, with very little grainy residue.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even get a small portion out with my fingers and need to use a spoon.</li>
            <li> Shea butter is very firm by nature.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using it on my psoriasis lately and seems to be relieving my skin.</li>
            <li> Has a thick consistency that melts into my skin.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone that suffers from cracked dry skin and u can also use it as a body massage cream</li>
            <li> I began applying this Shea butter to their skin and in very little time I saw a dramatic improvement.</li>
            <li> batch if it&#x27;s possible for shea butter to go bad?  </li>
            <li> I would buy from this company again knowing that they stand behind their guarantee.</li>
            <li> He has had bad reactions to shea butter in the past.</li>
            <li> no more using vaseline  ever !!!</li>
            <li> I used this product for my infant who suffers from excema.</li>
            <li> Works as promised - smells really nasty</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> As advertised. Perfect to make homemade moisturizers and lip balms. Quick shipment, very satisfied.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I loved the concept of buying the organic raw shea butter, but the content is rock hard so I can&#x27;t even use it (and probably won&#x27;t). I would skip this product and go for a lotion of some kind, which is what I ended up doing.</li>
            <li> Great product! I have never used Shea butter before so I was a lil hesitant to purchase it. But I am glad I did. I got this for my two year old who has been going swimming for quite some time now and his skin for really rough and dry and ezecma on his face. I started using it and it helped him dramatically. I like it u can use this with other oils mix in almond oil, coconut oil rub wala done👌&lt;br /&gt;Better than using all the harsh chemical lotions that you get the stores.&lt;br /&gt;I would love to purchase it again&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not too pleasing but you get to use it. I don&#x27;t mind it.</li>
            <li> Natural, moisturizing, love it! No offensive perfumes, ideal for use &amp;#34;as is&amp;#34; or for adding other ingredients to concoct your own beauty product.</li>
            <li> This was my first time buying Shea butter. I chose this one primarily because of statements by others regarding good customer service and satisfaction. When I received it I had questions about unrefined shea butter and freshness. My questions were answered quickly and courteously. I&#x27;ve made several successful batches of hard lotion and body butter and I&#x27;m very happy with the product.  I&#x27;ll definitely buy again</li>
            <li> The shea butter came very well packed and in excellent condition. The shea was gray with very nice aroma.  The consistency was hard at the temperature in my home and has maintain so to the last few spoonfuls.  I have made salves, soaps, and scrubs and it is the best.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I got this for my first time to make homemade lotion and it was a great product and priced well.</li>
            <li> I use it in my creams and it is great!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> great product, but arrived with broken lid</li>
            <li> I got this for my 18 month old who has eczema and after about 2 weeks  I&#x27;m seeing a little difference in her skin. It does however stink. The smell seems to go away after an hour or so though. It shipped very fast.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price!!!</li>
            <li> Super smooth butter - no grit.  The twist cap container keeps butter fresh unlike the flimsy snap on lids from other companies.  A great price for unrefined organic &amp; raw.</li>
            <li> Great product. I purchased this a few months back and I wanted to give it some time before I was able to review it. I like it, it has a nice consistency and a great smell. My skin feels good. Will definitely buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Adwi Organics!</li>
            <li> I make my own face and body lotions.  I love Adwi Organics.  Their Shea butter is not gritty.  It&#x27;s smooth.  Melts great.  Produces fantastic lotion and face products.  Great shipping and I order from Adwi when ever I can.  Great support.  Great product.  Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really helping my sons eczema!</li>
            <li> I love this shea butter! it makes my skin so soft all day long, big plus for me because my face was very dry. i will buy it again. Also, the seller sent me an email asking about how i like the product and service. I like that they are asking, that is good customer service.</li>
            <li> this stuff is cool I can&#x27;t wait to try all the recipes you sent, that was very helpful. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I like this product. I use it for my dry feet. My feet are a lot softer and smoother. This Raw Shea Butter is not heavy and greasy, so I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product and great vendor support for a variety of options for use. Will continue to purchase from this vendor in the future.</li>
            <li> Great product, very happy</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product to use in combination with coconut oil and essential oils to make a foot balm for my dry heals. However, I decided to try this by itself and I have yet to make the foot balm as this stuff is amazing! It has been years since my feet and heals have been so smooth.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product 3 times already and they all have been a successful experience for me. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have a burn mark on my finger that is real dry and peels. I have Tried so many different medicated ointments and creams and nothing seemed to work. I tried ADWI Shea Butter and I feel I finally found a cure for my burn.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Skin feels so soft when using it. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Great product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this Shea Butter it&#x27;s amazing! Since starting the fast of Ramadan my lips have been really dry and most balms just coat the lip. ADWI Shea butter actually penetrates and leaves them feeling hydrated. Works really well for replenishing super dry skin. It also spreads on nice and smooth and for those who are familiar with Shea butters, sometimes they&#x27;re really hard and require a lot of massaging to make them manageable, so that&#x27;s definitely another plus. 👍</li>
            <li> This is the real deal Holyfield!! Smooth texture, melts into the skin without a waxy after feel. And the smell?? Buttery and delish. I&#x27;m a business owner, and I recently used some to make salve for eczema. The final result was amazingly fluffy and rich. Will certainly purchase again!</li>
            <li> I like this shea butter it is the best,  awesome...no more using vaseline  ever !!!</li>
            <li> Used it in my homemade lip balm. Love it!</li>
            <li> This jar is HUGE!!!!  It has a little bit of a scent - sort of nutty???  Not offensive and it blends well with my oils.  Has a thick consistency that melts into my skin.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Ordered this product based on the reviews of others and I am not disappointed.  I need a substantial product with a certain amount of staying power to overcome dryness from gardening and constant hand washing and generally dry skin.  I like the results I am getting with this product.  I find that rough areas are softening and going away and dryness is much improved.    I use it on my naturally curly hair to add weight and combat dryness. A little goes a long way.    I enjoy the coco butter-like inherent fragrance of this brand and like knowing it is raw.  Not to worry, you won&#x27;t smell like coco butter as the pleasant fragrance goes away quickly.    So glad I tried this brand. Will buy again. Recommended.</li>
            <li> This is perfect. Exactly what I expected. The product rubs on smooth and absorbs well. You have to warm it up first by rubbing it in your hands but it only takes a second. It smells and feels like a great quality.</li>
            <li> Great product--smells good and moisturizes really well! I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff. A little goes a long way and I&#x27;ve been using it on my psoriasis lately and seems to be relieving my skin.</li>
            <li> Have gotten this a few times and loved it,  this time it was gritty and doesn&#x27;t blend as well, hoping it is a bad batch? Quality is not consistent</li>
            <li> Great product, big jar, it really helps to hydrate skin, skin feels hydrated all day long, I like that is a natural product and I receive the benefits I was looking for</li>
            <li> The product came on time, and so far I am very pleased with it. The butter smells and feel nice and the packaging is simple and fitting. The cost is also very reasonable for the large amount of shea butter you are receiving. I will definitely be reordering from Adwi in the future!</li>
            <li> I received my order of Shea Butter and was very impressed. The quality is perfect for homemade hair products which is what I will be using mine for. Will be ordering more soon</li>
            <li> This is the best Shea butter I&#x27;ve used.  I have been experimenting with Shea butter for several years now and I just could find one that went on smooth and provided results.  I happy to say I have found my Shea butter love😙</li>
            <li> This brand of Shea Butter just melts between your hands! I use it on my natural coils and it looks in the moisture without leaving residue. I also love the fact that it remains solid in form, but soft to the touch before you apply it to desired areas.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I love how rich and thick it is but it is very easy to spread. I have been using this as one of the ingrediants of my all purpose salve with essential oils.</li>
            <li> Very nice Shea butter. Creamy and moisturizing. Neutral smell. Great for making diy body care.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this raw Shea Butter. You can tell that its all natural by the form that it is in and the smell is natural with no added perfume scent. I usually don&#x27;t apply anything to my face unless prescribed by my dermatologist because i have EXTREMELY oily and sensitive skin. But this makes my skin smooth without added any extra oils and shine to my face! I also use it after my shower at night and it absorbs into my skin and makes my skin soooo soft. Great Product! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I really loved the consistency of this butter! Other brands that I&#x27;ve tried have been dry/crumbly but one is perfect!</li>
            <li> I used a sample of adwi for two weeks and I fell in love this product is awesome my skin feels amazing and my face no longer feels dry I would recommend this product to anyone that suffers from cracked dry skin and u can also use it as a body massage cream</li>
            <li> This shea butter is the best, smoothest, purest shea butter I&#x27;ve used...its not real solid where its hard to scoop out of the jar. I love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this Shea Butter and it is a great product. Goes on nice and creamy and not oily. It can be used for body and hair for total body gloss.</li>
            <li> High quality. Great value.</li>
            <li> Very happy w the product and the service.</li>
            <li> I would give this a 5star but the smell isn&#x27;t very pleasant... It&#x27;s barely there, not strong at all... but hard to ignore since it&#x27;s on my skin.</li>
            <li> Great shea butter overall thick with great sealing properties especially for skin and hair</li>
            <li> I found this particular brand of Shea Butter to be worth the money. If your looking for something that&#x27;s gonna leave your skin moisturized without feeling like your putting an extra coat of oil on your skin then this will do just that! It goes on nice and smooth. A little goes a long way and its not heavy which is a plus. The only thing is every time I used it, I&#x27;ve used it on my hair with other hair products so I can&#x27;t speak on  how it acts in my hair alone. Although for skin care its wonderfulllllll. It leaves your skin very hydrated and moisturized for a very long time. Overall I am pleased with keeping it as one of my staple products.</li>
            <li> I think I was expecting this to be a little softer and therefore easier to scoop out of the jar. It softens on contact, but I may prefer the softer body butters to this. That said, the product is what it was advertised to be - wonderful Shea butter.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I used the Raw Unrefined Shea Butter. I was very pleased with the results. I would recommend this to others. After the first use, I was hooked.  I must say I was surprised with the results,  but in a marvelous way. I use it on the whole family.</li>
            <li> I was totally turned off by shea butter until I tried Adwi. Other natural Shea butters I&#x27;ve tried were hard and clumpy with an unpleasant smell. But, not Adwi! I love how smooth and creamy it is and it smells nice too! Definitely a permanent addition to my skin care products!</li>
            <li> I love it .....you only need a little, it is best used by putting a small amount in your hand and letting it warm up when it has softened it goes on easy....makes your skin feel soft and moist...last all day.  The jar is so big and you need so little well worth the price you pay.  It is scentless and has a little natural odor which is kind of earthly ...it doesn&#x27;t last it fades quickly....</li>
            <li> Arrived as described and loved the smell.  I will buy again</li>
            <li> Works as promised - smells really nasty but thats what you would get from any raw shea butter. Will last you a long time!</li>
            <li> I really like that this is unfiltered since it rubs on my skin very smoothly. I primarily use it with essential oils (rub it together in my hands). Noticable improvement to my dry skin spots after using it just once!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for someone as a gift and she loves it.</li>
            <li> This butter seems to be working great in preventing stretch marks and healing skin that&#x27;s in the first stages of cracking. It does not have an overpowering smell and it soaks into the skin relatively fast, leaving skin soft but not greasy. It is super hard and only melts when rubbed into the skin, so it&#x27;s a little hard to apply. I would recommend it for pregnancy without hesitation.</li>
            <li> Wonderful seller and product!! I highly recommend it. It goes on very smooth and does not leave a greesy feel on the skin. I warm a little in my hand and use it. I bought it to try on my toddler&#x27;s eczema, but ended up using it myself. The best on the market!</li>
            <li> I purchased this shea butter to make hair and body products for my two little girls. It blended really well with the oils that I used. Great product!  Definitely would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I received some of this shea butter through a free trial. My main reason for wanting to try it was for my 1 year old&#x27;s eczema. He has had bad reactions to shea butter in the past. I later learned that all shea butters are not created equal. This shea butter helped with a flare up and also corrected the chemical irritations on my hands from cleaning without gloves.    Also my husband used this on his feet and they looked totally different. He has very dry feet and peeling skin. This is due to metal implanted in his feet &amp; legs. Nothing helped and each morning would begin with my brushing skin off the foot of our bed. After using this for four days I no longer have to clean skin off the bed.     When applying this initially it felt a bit more greasy than expected but this was quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased w this product. If u like natural remedies for skin and hair this product is for u.</li>
            <li> While I love the fact that this shea butter is unrefined, raw, organic and grade A, it&#x27;s the hardest shea butter I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I can&#x27;t even get a small portion out with my fingers and need to use a spoon. So I tend to use my other organic shea butter which is much easier to manager.</li>
            <li> Absolutely in love with this product! Creamy texture, nutty flavor, fabulous effect on the skin! It is perfect for homemade body butters if u make them and it might be used as it is. Perfect moisturizer for all skin types but especially for dry skin. If you have it on your beauty desk you may thru all your body lotions, hair wax, hand creams away, cos you will never find anything as good as natural as shea butter! I do recommend!</li>
            <li> Great producer! Quick shipping! Thanks!</li>
            <li> It came on time and was packaged well. It is very hard at first but it melts in your hand and becomes very easy to spread after that. A little goes a long way considering I&#x27;ve had it for about 2 or 3 weeks and have barely made a dent in it. It makes my skin feel very soft and gives it a nice glow as well as already helping to fade my acne scars and has not made me breakout. Overall it is a very nice product and I will buy it again and recommend you do as well.</li>
            <li> A wonderfully pure shea butter and a main ingredient in my homemade body balms!</li>
            <li> This Shea butter is great! It is 100%  real Shea butter. Similar to the Shea butter that my boyfriend brings me from Africa when he visits home. This shea butter seemed a little smoother as if there was some oils added however I can&#x27;t say for sure. Also adwi Organics has a better smell. Sometimes 100% Shea butter can be strong but this smell was a good normal Shea butter smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it for almost everything. In my hair after wash I use it to twist my hair. It&#x27;s great for locking in moisture. Also if you put some on your hands and warm it up by rubbing it gets oily which makes it easier to apply all over your body. It will give any dry skin the hydration it needs leaving the skin feeling soft. Immediately after it may see. Slightly oily but once that process of the skin soaking it all in passes you will like the way your skin feels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it for rashes idk what exactly it does but it help to take away irratation. I thought the product was one of the better Shea butters on the market.... Wayyyy better than the yellow fake Shea butter others sell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone. Give it a try :)</li>
            <li> Excellent texture. Not oily on the skin. A little goes a long way. Softens my skin throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with my order of Adwi&#x27;s organic Shea butter! It has been just what I needed for my children&#x27;s extremely dry skin. I use it straight from the bottle just rubbing a bit between my hands to melt it and smoothing it on. The Shea butter scent is very light, unlike the last company I ordered from, and I don&#x27;t mind it at all. I also really appreciated the e-mail I received from the Adwi company with some great skincare recipes and suggestions using the Shea butter!</li>
            <li> I live in OH and have chronic dry skin. I have tried many different natural and organic lotions to no avail. After one week of using this raw Shea butter, my legs no longer look like they&#x27;re covered in alligator skin. I am amazed! The price on this raw Shea butter was much better than other brands. I will definitely be buying this again!</li>
            <li> Great product. Much smoother than other Shea butters I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I used this product for my infant who suffers from excema. I tried numerous products such as aveeno, cetaphyl and aquafor, and none of them compare to adwiorganics shea butter. It has helped her skin tremendously. This product leaves her skin feeling smooth and moist, not greasy and heavy like with other products. It&#x27;s even gentle enough to use on her face. I&#x27;ve finally found a product that I trust on my babies delicate sensitive skin. Thanks adwiorganics!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Purchased to make soap and deodorant! Smelled like what I&#x27;ve read Shea butter smells like! Lol kinda strange, but it has great health/beauty benefits. Good quality I think. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this, I have been trying to use natural products whenever possible.  I have used this for nearly a month now, I have tried it by itself and used it for a couple of different recipes from the company themselves and it simply does not work for me.  I wanted to give it a good amount of time and several different ways to use it before writing the review and requesting the refund since it is money back guaranteed.  However, I live in MA and have 20 plus inches of snow and a blizzard going on outside, with a travel ban in effect, so I will have to wait until the blizzard subsides to request the refund.  About the product, l found it very greasy and not moisturizing.  I have dry skin and when I put it on, it is very greasy and for an hour or two afterwards, feels somewhat moist, but then in an hour or two, my skin goes back to being dry.  The difference with this is that my face also feels drier than if I use commercial products 1 or 2 hours later.  Like I said, I have tried several preparations both using this by itself and with other ingredients and have not had any luck.  I will request a refund when the weather improves and the travel ban is lifted so I can get to UPS.  I will update on the customer service of the company after requesting the refund.    UPDATE:  I just wanted to add that the customer service was very good.  Though the product did not work for me, the prompt customer service is worth mentioning.  They contacted me promptly and put through a credit right away and said I did not have to return the product since there was a blizzard here and a travel ban in effect.  It was a relief not worrying about having to get to the ups store in this weather.  I would buy from this company again knowing that they stand behind their guarantee.</li>
            <li> This product just made the best WHIPPED Shea butter cream!  It&#x27;s velvety smooth and really sooth the very dry skin on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s how I make it.&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: all must be at room temperature&lt;br /&gt;2 oz. raw Shea butter&lt;br /&gt;2 tablespoons 100% emu oil&lt;br /&gt;5-10 drops essential oil, optional, I used lavender, tea tree and E oils.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t use any of the essential oils if you don&#x27;t want any oily residue on your skin or cut way back on the amount.&lt;br /&gt;Whip at high speed with an electric hand mixer.  If comes out fluffy like whipped cream.&lt;br /&gt;Store in small air tight glass container at a cool room te pasture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife bought this expensive French Shea butter cream which did wonders on my dry legs so I was trying to duplicate it.  I&#x27;m very, very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I like the texture--a creamy cheese like paste that melts in palms upon rubbing, with very little grainy residue. however I was concerned to have read elsewhere that Shea butter contains latex-like substances that may aggravate latex allergy. i cut back on using them due to that fact, although I truly enjoyed the product.</li>
            <li> My doctor was so impressed by how soft my skin is following surgery that he wanted to know what I was using. He is very impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> I recently received this product last week and I love it. My heels are a little rough even after coming from getting a pedicure. So when I received this I&#x27;ve been using it in the morning and night after getting out of the shower n I must say I see a big difference. My feet are a lot softer and smoother. I can see using this for a month my feet would be smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom. I also love that it&#x27;s not heavy and greasy. Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin.  Most facial lotions and eye creams make my skin red and puffy.  But this Shea Butter is wonderful!  I&#x27;ve been using it on my face every day for two weeks now and it is soothing for my skin and has made my complexion so much nicer.  I recommend this Shea Butter to anyone with dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This product is the best! I placed an order and it arrived in a timely manner and the quality of this shea butter is absolutely wonderful. I will be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li> I have no idea what took me so long to buy raw shea butter. It shipped quickly and is phenomenal--I&#x27;m not trying anything else for my skin again. Shea Butter for life!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft and keeps it moisturized all day. I use this from head to toe. Just a very small tad on my hair defines my curls and moisturizes my hair without making it greasy or weighing it down. If my face is feeling tight and dry, I will rub some of the shea butter between my hands, then &amp;#34;pat&amp;#34; it all over my face--&amp;#62;this I do at bedtime. Everyday when I get done with my shower,  I rub this between my hands and then massage into my skin from the neck down. I have &amp;#34;winter itch&amp;#34; and this has so helped soothe AND keep my skin soft and supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell? Well, not so great, but it fades away after a few minutes, so it does not interfere with my perfume</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product! It is the best Shea butter that I&#x27;ve used this far. It is thick yet easily absorbed into the skin. I&#x27;ve been using it only for a few days on a few dry patches and by day 3 I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference. I also been rubbing the excess on my lips and my lips are super soft. I will defintely continue using this!</li>
            <li> Update Based on my Third Tub of Adwi Shea: In summer the consistency is very workable. Upped my rating from 4 to 5 starts.  It was as good as the Mountain Rose Herb organic Shea butter I usually buy that was currently out of stock. Addressing complaints I came across in my research for a substitute brand, I happily report that the Adwi Shea butter I received was free of mold, obvious impurities, foul smell, compromised packaging, and delayed delivery. What I received looked and smelled as I would expect of a high quality Shea butter, and was delivered when it was supposed to be delivered, well protected and in good form. Shea butter is very firm by nature. I always melt it down in a casual double boiler set-up on very low heat, add my choice of carrier oil to it to bring it to a creamier consistency, than add essential oils tailored to my needs. The reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is that its so firm I had to melt it down and add oils to soften it, at a busy time when I would have appreciated the option to use it &amp;#34;neat&amp;#34;. Still, I would recommend Adwi Shea butter.</li>
            <li> I have two children eczema. I began applying this Shea butter to their skin and in very little time I saw a dramatic improvement. This was a great way of treating their eczema. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product and would recommend it to anyone who desires beautiful looking skin.</li>
            <li> Got my sample! Just used it and love the quality, feel, and absorption. My use is for skin and hair. My hair is softer and the mixture turn out nice and fluffy. My skin is glowing without a greasy feeling! This will be my choice of shea butter from here on out!</li>
            <li> It was amazing, it made my skin really soft.</li>
            <li> Really really difficult if not impossible to spread into my skin. More like a paste.</li>
            <li> Seller communication is incredible!  My psoriasis is already improving!</li>
            <li> I am sorry to say this but the shea butter carried a very strong smell that even the lavender essential oil could not mask.  This is my first time working with shea butter and I bought this brand after reading the positive reviews associated with it.  I am really disappointed because I was really looking forward to making my own body lotions but I don&#x27;t think I can use what I&#x27;ve made because of the smell.  Could it be that I was just sent a &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; batch if it&#x27;s possible for shea butter to go bad?  I would appreciate a response from Adwi Organics.</li>
            <li> High quality Shea butter.</li>
            <li> Product came just as described. Easy to work with. Great consistency. Nice smell.</li>
