            <li>I also love the fact that they look so real not like other ones ive had on!</li>
            <li>I love bold n thick.</li>
            <li>Anyone who wears fake lashes should know that Red Cherry are the best lashes money can buy...</li>
            <li>I bought about a dozen different styles to try and although I like them all, I tend to go back to the #48&#x27;s the most.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend you this product.</li>
            <li>This style is a medium very full dark lash.</li>
            <li>they are long and full.</li>
            <li>they are very natural looking.</li>
            <li>Gives you that great dramatic look, definitely recommend them!!</li>
            <li>soft to the touch and lookso</li>
            <li>not heavy or over-bearing.</li>
            <li>I was worried it would be a bit much to use with the naked palettes</li>
            <li>They are not rounded to follow the natural curve of your eyelid.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for false eyelashes and they last up to a few usages and stays on eyes perfect.  </li>
            <li>My favorite are the 213, but I wanted something a little more dramatic, so I tried these.</li>
            <li>ive been wearing red cherry lashes for a few years now i like them because they arnt a cheap quality</li>
            <li>They were exactly what I expected !</li>
            <li>They are a bit long, but I cut them a little to fit the structure of my face.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend if going for natural look.</li>
            <li>LOOKS GOOD, NOT AN ARTIFICIAL LOOK.</li>
            <li>The lash line is thin giving these lashes a natural look and they are easily reusable.</li>
            <li>these are just not dramatic enough or long enough for me.</li>
            <li>I wear them everyday and shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>If you are looking for full and thick lashes, these are it.</li>
            <li>They are big and black great for a dramatic look!</li>

            <li> If you are looking for full and thick lashes, these are it.</li>
            <li> They are big and black great for a dramatic look!</li>
            <li> The length is so long I would have to cut.</li>
            <li> long..</li>
            <li> These #117 are very thick and give you a nice dramatic look.</li>
            <li> But the reason for the 4 starts instead of 5 is that in the picture the eyelashes look thick, full and black but in person there not as thick as in the picture and they are farely long</li>
            <li> These would not be everyday wear for me, but they definitely give me drama when I want it, without looking like a drag queen.</li>
            <li> I ordered these just to try them out, I got these and a couple other pairs as well.</li>
            <li> so i had to cut them a little</li>
            <li> a little thick cause</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like that they were too dramatic, too thick and too long.</li>
            <li> These were worse than other brands I&#x27;ve just picked up at Walmart/ CVS.</li>
            <li> Fake Eyelashes are long</li>
            <li> A little to dramatic for me.</li>
            <li> THEY WERE A LITTLE ON THE EXPENSIVE SIDE BECAUSE IF YOU CAN FIND THEM IN THE STORE</li>
            <li> They are VERY THICK, and looks like a spider sitting on both eyes.</li>
            <li> but I wanted dramatic lashes for when I do smokey eyes for nighttime.  </li>
            <li> I chose the wrong size way too dramatic for me.</li>
            <li> These eyelashes were incredibly difficult to put on and don&#x27;t form to the eye-</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t wear if you going to watch a sad movie if you know you will cry you will ruin them</li>

            <li> Good lashes but couldnt fit on my eye so i had to cut them a little</li>
            <li> I bought based on reviews, but I didn&#x27;t get it. These were worse than other brands I&#x27;ve just picked up at Walmart/ CVS. These eyelashes were incredibly difficult to put on and don&#x27;t form to the eye- just stick out in a straight line.</li>
            <li> They were exactly what I expected ! Very nice</li>
            <li> This style is a medium very full dark lash. I was worried it would be a bit much to use with the naked palettes but  they look great, so don&#x27;t be scared to use at daytime.</li>
            <li> Love these! Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> i love the length of these eyelashes</li>
            <li> Great value! Will be getting all lashes on amazon from now on</li>
            <li> Look Amazing just as awesome as my #1 favorite one by sephora. Only thing is if you cry for anything they will get ruined. They get destroyed by water. So don&#x27;t wear if you going to watch a sad movie if you know you will cry you will ruin them</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear eyelashes that much only once in a blue moon and that&#x27;s really rare, but I thought the price was not bad for 6 so went with it.. After trying them on they looked really good.</li>
            <li> I chose the wrong size way too dramatic for me. The length is so long I would have to cut. I am thinking of just using as ends but the quality is very good. And easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different styles of lashes and this is my favorite one. The reason being is that I wear glasses and this gives me the look I want with my glasses on.</li>
            <li> these are amazing, i love them. long.. but beautiful n full</li>
            <li> Anyone who wears fake lashes should know that Red Cherry are the best lashes money can buy... However, they have sooooooooo many styles. These #117 are very thick and give you a nice dramatic look. I love them. But my faves for every day are the #48&#x27;s. Check them out as well. I bought about a dozen different styles to try and although I like them all, I tend to go back to the #48&#x27;s the most. They are beautifully curled, the perfect thickness and look totally natural. They give the perfect look for day or night! But these 117&#x27;s are beautiful as well. Try a bunch! :)</li>
            <li> I had heard great things about Red Cherry lashes so i decided to try them on my own. The shipping was quick it got here within a couple days and when i saw them i couldnt wait to try them on. I opened my package and it was very nicely packaged and i was even more surprised because there was a handwritten note in there from the seller and a coupon for next time that included a free gift. That to me was really surprising and it seems like they care about what their customers think. But the reason for the 4 starts instead of 5 is that in the picture the eyelashes look thick, full and black but in person there not as thick as in the picture and they are farely long so you just have to cut a bit off. I also love the fact that they look so real not like other ones ive had on! there so easy to put on, manage and move around. Overall im a very happy customer and I LOVE MY NEW LASHES!!(:</li>
            <li> love these lashes.  full  and beautiful.  great way to extend my makeup artistry. and are affordable enough to use on clients.</li>
            <li> these are good for nice, simple look. they are very natural looking. I wish they were fuller, thicker and longer...too make eyes really pop but they are good for everyday wear. They do make you look like you have pretty lashes but I wanted dramatic lashes for when I do smokey eyes for nighttime.  I would definitely recommend if going for natural look. lashes came quick.</li>
            <li> Love them for a night out!</li>
            <li> They are good quality, I just wish they were longer.</li>
            <li> Just got them today I love them.</li>
            <li> Loved the multi pack I can only find 2 packs</li>
            <li> I love them and would buy more!</li>
            <li> Red Cherry lashes are by far the best lashes that I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I will definitely be purchasing more of them.</li>
            <li> LOOKS GOOD, NOT AN ARTIFICIAL LOOK.</li>
            <li> I love Red Cherry lashes. My favorite are the 213, but I wanted something a little more dramatic, so I tried these. They are not rounded to follow the natural curve of your eyelid. They are VERY THICK, and looks like a spider sitting on both eyes. A little to dramatic for me.</li>
            <li> BEEN USING THESE LASHES FOR 2 OR MORE YEARS. THEY WERE A LITTLE ON THE EXPENSIVE SIDE BECAUSE IF YOU CAN FIND THEM IN THE STORE THEY ARE ONLY .99 A PACK. THE AREA I RELOCATED TO DOES NOT SELL THEM SO I HAD TO ORDER THEM FROM AMAZON.</li>
            <li> I ordered these just to try them out, I got these and a couple other pairs as well. I must say I love these and the #48.</li>
