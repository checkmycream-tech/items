            <li>/&gt;The smell is pleasant.</li>
            <li>It is priced fairly.</li>
            <li>Some sanitizers either didn&#x27;t smell good or didn&#x27;t apply well.  </li>
            <li>Good economy size.</li>
            <li>Good product but overpriced here.</li>
            <li>Good value- good product.</li>

            <li>but after applying it i feel better !</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>, so it’s nice to see them on</li>
            <li>This item that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>This sanitizer leaves no residual coating which I find nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a need for it this year, however, and think it&#x27;s been effective.</li>
            <li>I would have liked it to be a bit lower in price.  </li>
            <li>Gloves are nice</li>
            <li>This bottle was a nice way to refill my mini bottles of hand sanitizer.  </li>
            <li>, This is extremely handy in getting rid of stickiness.</li>
            <li>This hand sanitizer is VERY easy on the hands.  </li>
            <li>There was no packing material inside the way-too-small box from Amazon, and the Purell Hand Sanitizer bottle&#x27;s top broke as a result spilling hand sanitizer gel out of the bottle and all over the inside of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There doesn&#x27;t seem to be any way to report this problem to Amazon and/or get a replacement item since it is listed as a hazardous material.</li>
            <li>I myself am on the fence about how good hand sanitizer is in every classroom, super bugs suck.</li>
            <li>Excellent, Super fast shipping</li>
            <li>What more is there to say?</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t be able to tell that it&#x27;s there.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s interesting because Purrell doesn&#x27;t advertise any moisturizing properties of this</li>
            <li>used Purrell on more than just my hands.</li>
            <li>what&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li>and it most certianly serves its purpose.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and great product.  </li>
            <li>Love the product.  </li>
            <li>Love the Purell  name.  </li>
            <li>Love the pump.</li>
            <li>Germ X smells better.</li>
            <li>This is a bit more than a quart</li>
            <li>When I found a great price for this size bottle of Purell at a reasonable price, I snatched it up.  </li>
            <li>Perfect size for carrying in the back of my SUV.  </li>
            <li>I use this product many times a day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of those issues most people won&#x27;t talk about.  </li>
            <li>I would suggest getting the refill size, and purchasing a pump top separately.</li>
            <li>It is the best hand sanitizer our family has used and it is portable if you save the smaller bottles.</li>
            <li>The more you buy the cheaper it gets.</li>
            <li>Athletic supporters, prolonged workouts or running - which gets things nice and warm and moist from sweat, are an ideal breeding ground for this fungus, no matter how much you wash (yourself or the articles of clothing) - but another, lesser known fact is that a hot bath is also a GREAT way to give yourself jock itch.</li>
            <li>I use this alot so nice to have a super size jug of it  :).  </li>
            <li>Great size if you use it frequently.  </li>
            <li>It is so easy to use, and like.</li>
            <li>In fact, stop reading if you&#x27;re easily offended or squeamish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells fine.</li>
            <li>It does an excellent job of reducing redness of the acne and also makes each pimple less swollen.</li>
            <li>This applies just fine and does the trick.  </li>
            <li>Great in first aid and Trauma kits in little bottles for wound and equipment cleaning on the fly.</li>
            <li>This 1 liter jug of Purell is huge.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the Advanced version, which is 70% ethyl alcohol.  </li>
            <li>It is the &#x27;advanced&#x27; formula though</li>
            <li>It smells like rubbing alcohol with a light fragrance.</li>
            <li>I always get the scent free / fragrance free so that anyone with allergies doesn&#x27;t have any qualms about a quick spritz when they come over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worth buying it!</li>
            <li>They did not have any significant hand sanitation.  </li>
            <li>Stick with the original, unless of course, you prefer the Aloe added, moisturizing type.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly, kills those germs quickly, and leaves my skin feeling cool and smooth.  </li>
            <li>We will die clean.</li>
            <li>Excellent  - concentrated Good for a lot  of refills on items  needed, such as small sprayer pens  for hand use</li>
            <li>Love the large size.  </li>
            <li>it will come right off!</li>
            <li>Better than those chemical anti-bacterial soaps that seem to hurt more than help, this enormous pump station is great for a quick sanitation session when the traditional soap and water is out of reach.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the product photo full you.</li>
            <li>I do a quick clean up afterwards.  </li>
            <li>no leaks from the container - good, solid pump..  </li>
            <li>Large, packaged well, great for my son&#x27;s nursery and sitting next to the changing table</li>
            <li>We use this for quick hand sanitizing through out the day.</li>
            <li>I like the big bottle - easy to refill and the sanitizer itself is probably the best on the market you can get as a private person for a reasonable amount of money.</li>
            <li>Great for preventing other programmers hand germs from contaminating your keyboard!</li>
            <li>But since it is required, all I can say is the big bottle made a good first impression with the teacher.</li>
            <li>It is not loaded with perfumes /basically it doesn&#x27;t stink like many others.&lt;br /&gt;Actually smells very little (kind of neutral with alcohol ) and overall smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it has made me more disease-free, but I feel like I&#x27;m at least attempting to something good for myself.</li>
            <li>Comes in handy to keep form constantly washing hands.</li>
            <li>I would normally buy this in the store but this was too easy.</li>
            <li>The built in pump helps the students get just the right amount that they need.  </li>
            <li>The hand pump is good quality and worked well for average use or refills.  </li>
            <li>The product itself is useful, and I like the large size for my dance studio.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Purrell is slippery at first, but rubs in within seconds.</li>
            <li>so I assume more protection from germs etc.bottle too big tho.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>and it just means it has a higher alcohol percentage.</li>
            <li>(If you think that Purrell is significantly better than Germ-X, disregard this review - to me, it&#x27;s all the same).  </li>
            <li>The Purell Hand Sanitizer was exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Myself - I rely on a hot bath to ease sore muscles and years ago injured joints.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t keep the sanitizer somewhere hot.  </li>
            <li>He is sensitive to fragrances and doesn&#x27;t mind Purell&#x27;s Original.  </li>
            <li>I think when you&#x27;re talking about 30 young kids, you want them to have clean</li>
            <li>I bought this because it does not leave a very noticeable, pasty residue on your hands like many of the generic brands do.  </li>
            <li>Usually Amazon is really good to me with protecting their items from damage, but not this time.</li>
            <li>that with these purell sanitizers and our home has been pretty germ free (As much as possible, anyway).</li>
            <li>I ordered two at the end of the school year because I ran out and was stunned at just how large these containers are.</li>
            <li>Areas that don&#x27;t dry up quickly, or get re-sweaty pretty quickly are almost certain to allow the fungal spores to grow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The 1 lt size is very economical.&lt;br</li>
            <li>NOBODY wants germs.  </li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>to the size of the bottle (it&#x27;s a liter), I filled up a smaller bottle with a cap to sit in the glovebox.  </li>
            <li>I bought the &amp;#34;big bottle&amp;#34; because teachers really don&#x27;t get all the supplies they need.</li>
            <li>It can go away very soon and can help me a lot.</li>
            <li>This hand sanitizer dispenses the right amount evaporates quickly should you choose not to use a dry paper towel to finish.</li>
            <li>i recommend pruell highly</li>
            <li>I am a high school teacher and let me tell you this product is gold.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This is also very comparable to store prices so it&#x27;d probably more worth it to buy from the store because it guarantees that it won&#x27;t arrive broken.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a little bulky to keep in handy places around the house, we just transfer some to a smaller bottles, basically we just use this as a refill.</li>
            <li>am still giving 5 stars as this is not the product&#x27;s fault but Amazon should be more careful about these fragile items.</li>
            <li>The big size is a plus because you get a lot of material for such a cheap price of $10.</li>
            <li>My only regret is that this product (in the same size and form factor) doesn&#x27;t seem to be available with aloe.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended for professional offices anywhere.</li>
            <li>smells like more alcohol than other similar  products we&#x27;ve used  </li>
            <li>not sure it cleared all gems in my hand :-)</li>
            <li>and I have this exact one in multiple spots in my house.</li>
            <li>I use Germ-X normally because its cheaper, but this Purell isn&#x27;t as harsh smelling and keeps my hands feeling smooth instead of drying them out like the cheaper brands.  </li>
            <li>The fungus from your feet (even if you don&#x27;t actively have athlete&#x27;s foot) will use the warm water as a medium to settle in other areas.  </li>
            <li>That is what was pictured on the page, although the description calls it the “original,” which I believe had a slightly lower percentage of alcohol.</li>
            <li>As simple as this product is, a slightly viscous, germ killing, rubbing alcohol - only the original Purell is worth buying.</li>
            <li>So far no issues with car temps &amp;#62;120.  </li>
            <li>We keep one near each changing station and one in the kitchen</li>
            <li>also bought one of those hospital style automatic dispensers to put near the door for family and friends who come to visit</li>
            <li>you can buy this locally for a reasonably competitive price, I would recommend doing so.</li>
            <li>and they quickly fixed my problem!&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li>The product doesn&#x27;t stand up well to being heated frequently (like in your car).  </li>
            <li>the fact that this doesn&#x27;t have moisturizer in it doesn&#x27;t completely bother me, however it would be nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>good news is - no need to continue with expensive jock itch creams...  </li>
            <li>We have tons of the smaller bottles spread throughout the house and when one gets low I whip out this 1 liter and fill it right up.</li>
            <li>Have a few of these throughout the house to have nearby to keep my hands clean for the babies.</li>
            <li>This genuine Purell will dry faster and cleaner than any other brand and leaves no greasy residue.</li>
            <li>most commonly - are the same types of fungus found in afflictions of athlete&#x27;s foot.  </li>
            <li>The only negative aspect of the purchase is that the shipping cost is greater than the cost of the product.</li>
            <li>It can be used to fill smaller bottles to take with you, or used directly on your hands.  </li>
            <li>One arrived with a broken pump top.</li>
            <li>For the record, a liter has approximately 34 ounces, making this more than twice the price.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that anything antibacterial, such as antibacterial hand soap, would have the same effect on my acne, but Purrell was just much easier to apply and didn&#x27;t dry out my skin like the hand soap.</li>
            <li>However, don&#x27;t use just before going out to be social as it smells way too hospital.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In general, I&#x27;ve found Purell to be the &amp;#34;cream of the crop&amp;#34;, and that it has a high concentration of ethanol, which is the active ingredient.  </li>
            <li>live in &amp;#34;The North&amp;#34;, and I&#x27;m personally kinda picky about dry skin....</li>
            <li>It is getting hard to find these large (one liter) bottles of hand sanitizer at the stores around where I live.  </li>
            <li>Large sturdy bottle stands up to being used multiple times a day by little hands.  </li>
            <li>Luckily I have other containers to dump into, but all 3 bottles I ordered were broken at the top, the push to was completely forced inward on the bottles causing them to break and the caps to crack and chip</li>

            <li> Stick with the original, unless of course, you prefer the Aloe added, moisturizing type.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly, kills those germs quickly, and leaves my skin feeling cool and smooth.  </li>
            <li> We will die clean.</li>
            <li> Excellent  - concentrated Good for a lot  of refills on items  needed, such as small sprayer pens  for hand use</li>
            <li> Love the large size.  </li>
            <li> it will come right off!</li>
            <li> Better than those chemical anti-bacterial soaps that seem to hurt more than help, this enormous pump station is great for a quick sanitation session when the traditional soap and water is out of reach.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the product photo full you.</li>
            <li> I do a quick clean up afterwards.  </li>
            <li> no leaks from the container - good, solid pump..  </li>
            <li> Large, packaged well, great for my son&#x27;s nursery and sitting next to the changing table</li>
            <li> We use this for quick hand sanitizing through out the day.</li>
            <li> I like the big bottle - easy to refill and the sanitizer itself is probably the best on the market you can get as a private person for a reasonable amount of money.</li>
            <li> Great for preventing other programmers hand germs from contaminating your keyboard!</li>
            <li> But since it is required, all I can say is the big bottle made a good first impression with the teacher.</li>
            <li> It is not loaded with perfumes /basically it doesn&#x27;t stink like many others.&lt;br /&gt;Actually smells very little (kind of neutral with alcohol ) and overall smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it has made me more disease-free, but I feel like I&#x27;m at least attempting to something good for myself.</li>
            <li> Comes in handy to keep form constantly washing hands.</li>
            <li> I would normally buy this in the store but this was too easy.</li>
            <li> The built in pump helps the students get just the right amount that they need.  </li>
            <li> The hand pump is good quality and worked well for average use or refills.  </li>
            <li> The product itself is useful, and I like the large size for my dance studio.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Purrell is slippery at first, but rubs in within seconds.</li>
            <li> so I assume more protection from germs etc.bottle too big tho.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> and it just means it has a higher alcohol percentage.</li>
            <li> (If you think that Purrell is significantly better than Germ-X, disregard this review - to me, it&#x27;s all the same).  </li>
            <li> The Purell Hand Sanitizer was exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Myself - I rely on a hot bath to ease sore muscles and years ago injured joints.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t keep the sanitizer somewhere hot.  </li>
            <li> He is sensitive to fragrances and doesn&#x27;t mind Purell&#x27;s Original.  </li>
            <li> I think when you&#x27;re talking about 30 young kids, you want them to have clean</li>
            <li> I bought this because it does not leave a very noticeable, pasty residue on your hands like many of the generic brands do.  </li>
            <li> Usually Amazon is really good to me with protecting their items from damage, but not this time.</li>
            <li> that with these purell sanitizers and our home has been pretty germ free (As much as possible, anyway).</li>
            <li> I ordered two at the end of the school year because I ran out and was stunned at just how large these containers are.</li>
            <li> Areas that don&#x27;t dry up quickly, or get re-sweaty pretty quickly are almost certain to allow the fungal spores to grow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The 1 lt size is very economical.&lt;br</li>
            <li> NOBODY wants germs.  </li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> to the size of the bottle (it&#x27;s a liter), I filled up a smaller bottle with a cap to sit in the glovebox.  </li>
            <li> I bought the &amp;#34;big bottle&amp;#34; because teachers really don&#x27;t get all the supplies they need.</li>
            <li> It can go away very soon and can help me a lot.</li>
            <li> This hand sanitizer dispenses the right amount evaporates quickly should you choose not to use a dry paper towel to finish.</li>
            <li> i recommend pruell highly</li>
            <li> I am a high school teacher and let me tell you this product is gold.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is also very comparable to store prices so it&#x27;d probably more worth it to buy from the store because it guarantees that it won&#x27;t arrive broken.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little bulky to keep in handy places around the house, we just transfer some to a smaller bottles, basically we just use this as a refill.</li>
            <li> am still giving 5 stars as this is not the product&#x27;s fault but Amazon should be more careful about these fragile items.</li>
            <li> The big size is a plus because you get a lot of material for such a cheap price of $10.</li>
            <li> My only regret is that this product (in the same size and form factor) doesn&#x27;t seem to be available with aloe.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended for professional offices anywhere.</li>
            <li> smells like more alcohol than other similar  products we&#x27;ve used  </li>
            <li> not sure it cleared all gems in my hand :-)</li>
            <li> and I have this exact one in multiple spots in my house.</li>
            <li> I use Germ-X normally because its cheaper, but this Purell isn&#x27;t as harsh smelling and keeps my hands feeling smooth instead of drying them out like the cheaper brands.  </li>
            <li> The fungus from your feet (even if you don&#x27;t actively have athlete&#x27;s foot) will use the warm water as a medium to settle in other areas.  </li>
            <li> That is what was pictured on the page, although the description calls it the “original,” which I believe had a slightly lower percentage of alcohol.</li>
            <li> As simple as this product is, a slightly viscous, germ killing, rubbing alcohol - only the original Purell is worth buying.</li>
            <li> So far no issues with car temps &amp;#62;120.  </li>
            <li> We keep one near each changing station and one in the kitchen</li>
            <li> also bought one of those hospital style automatic dispensers to put near the door for family and friends who come to visit</li>
            <li> you can buy this locally for a reasonably competitive price, I would recommend doing so.</li>
            <li> and they quickly fixed my problem!&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t stand up well to being heated frequently (like in your car).  </li>
            <li> the fact that this doesn&#x27;t have moisturizer in it doesn&#x27;t completely bother me, however it would be nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> good news is - no need to continue with expensive jock itch creams...  </li>
            <li> We have tons of the smaller bottles spread throughout the house and when one gets low I whip out this 1 liter and fill it right up.</li>
            <li> Have a few of these throughout the house to have nearby to keep my hands clean for the babies.</li>
            <li> This genuine Purell will dry faster and cleaner than any other brand and leaves no greasy residue.</li>
            <li> most commonly - are the same types of fungus found in afflictions of athlete&#x27;s foot.  </li>
            <li> The only negative aspect of the purchase is that the shipping cost is greater than the cost of the product.</li>
            <li> It can be used to fill smaller bottles to take with you, or used directly on your hands.  </li>
            <li> One arrived with a broken pump top.</li>
            <li> For the record, a liter has approximately 34 ounces, making this more than twice the price.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that anything antibacterial, such as antibacterial hand soap, would have the same effect on my acne, but Purrell was just much easier to apply and didn&#x27;t dry out my skin like the hand soap.</li>
            <li> However, don&#x27;t use just before going out to be social as it smells way too hospital.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In general, I&#x27;ve found Purell to be the &amp;#34;cream of the crop&amp;#34;, and that it has a high concentration of ethanol, which is the active ingredient.  </li>
            <li> live in &amp;#34;The North&amp;#34;, and I&#x27;m personally kinda picky about dry skin....</li>
            <li> It is getting hard to find these large (one liter) bottles of hand sanitizer at the stores around where I live.  </li>
            <li> Large sturdy bottle stands up to being used multiple times a day by little hands.  </li>
            <li> Luckily I have other containers to dump into, but all 3 bottles I ordered were broken at the top, the push to was completely forced inward on the bottles causing them to break and the caps to crack and chip</li>
            <li> Careful - because stuff down there can be sensitive.. but a couple of pumps or purell rubbed on and around your junk will kill most of the common fungii that cause smelly crotch, and will help keep you &amp;#34;fresher&amp;#34; down there in general.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s seemingly lasting forever as it&#x27;s a large quantity and each pump doesn&#x27;t excessively distribute product.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it can be hard to judge just how much you need, especially for children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One of the bottles arrived with the pump open and the bottle slightly crushed.</li>
            <li> For a long time I wouldn&#x27;t touch this stuff.  </li>
            <li> the rest - Please excuse this unorthodox TMI review...  </li>
            <li> I found out after placing the order that I could have gotten this same size from a big box retailer for less.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Besides that, it is just plain old purell.</li>
            <li> I noticed that if I put it on dry cracked skin, that part remains moisturized for hours.</li>
            <li> It cleans your hands and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry them out.</li>
            <li> Not a big deal, not worth returning.</li>
            <li> Buying small bottles of this stuff at the grocery store just does NOT cut it when you have a little boy haha</li>
            <li> I do a lot of work in a variety of building environments that you typically wouldn&#x27;t want to have afterwards (think medical offices).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll pick it up at the store next time, being that it is half the price there.  </li>
            <li> We have been ordering this big size and just refill our little bottles that we keep in our vehicles and in my purse.</li>
            <li> So what if were killing essential bacteria and destroying the biome?</li>
            <li> You cannot toss four heavy objects like this into a carton and ship them without internal support because the plastic pumps are breakable.</li>
            <li> This brand is getting harder and harder to find at stores.  </li>
            <li> In the 4 weeks of heavy use, I only went through about 1/3 of a bottle.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 bottles, and they were not wrapped in anything, just placed in a box with other items.</li>
            <li> go through these like you wouldn’t believe as I am in contact with other people all day at my job.  </li>
            <li> (you can see it in one of my other reviews).</li>
            <li> I always keep extra and sanitizer around to refill my small bottles around the house.  </li>
            <li> Dont get me wrong, I love Purell and feel there is no quality comptition in this arena, however my lower assignment of score reflects the fact that my bottle of purell arrived broken; half of the pump is missing making it harder to pump product through the pump.</li>
            <li> Not worth to return as the return shipping will probably exceed the product&#x27;s value.</li>
            <li> The drugstore I go to stopped carrying these big bottles at least six months ago</li>
            <li> so I guess I will buy it locally and Amazon loses the sale.</li>
            <li> down there WILL get a burning sensation from it..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the typical Purell bottles you see sitting on people&#x27;s desks.</li>
            <li> I had been to multiple dermatologists and had been prescribed 3 different treatments for my acne, but all treatments had failed.</li>
            <li> It gets a little less gel-like, but still works</li>
            <li> I bought a bunch of little bottles and we just keep one or two of these in the car</li>
            <li> I solve that by giving it a few minutes to work then covering the smell with hand lotion.</li>
            <li> One bottle had leaked a few ounces into the box, soaking the corner.</li>
            <li> The missing piece ws not in the box i arrived in, no, so someone had to pack it in the condition i receieved it in.</li>
            <li> I tried a few budget brands (knock-offs) and they are junk.</li>
            <li> product works well but would have been completely useless if I had no other containers.</li>
            <li> I think Costco or Sam&#x27;s Club also sells this, though the past few times I&#x27;ve been, they haven&#x27;t had it.</li>
            <li> Product needs no more praise.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s got a small footprint for the vastness of liquid, making storage space not an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;we</li>
            <li> My wife and I have a small child and with that comes lots of visitors and the associated sickness that they bring in the house.</li>
            <li> However, due to insufficient packaging by Amazon, mine had the pump broken.</li>
            <li> The cap arrived broken</li>
            <li> One of Three bottles in my orders was broken the Pomp and does not operate.</li>
            <li> came damaged to my door as the pump was broken</li>
            <li> Because the bottle came to me with the twist off cap and plunger broken, I could not use it as is, and I could not return it for a replacement.  </li>
            <li> However, I ordered two and both pump tops arrived broken to pieces.</li>
            <li> A sticker leave behind some goo?</li>
            <li> really prevented some nasty colds</li>
            <li> The worst part about it is that since I was already used to the version that had &amp;#34;moisturizers&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;vitamin E&amp;#34; stuff, that this didn&#x27;t actually have</li>
            <li> The item came with a broken nozzle on the pump so it&#x27;s inconvenient to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m taking care of my mom these days and sometimes washing her hands is nearly impossible.</li>
            <li> In the days before hand sanitizers, I was always getting sick, now, I never do.&lt;br</li>

            <li> The 1 lt size is very economical.&lt;br /&gt;It is a little bulky to keep in handy places around the house, we just transfer some to a smaller bottles, basically we just use this as a refill.</li>
            <li> Product needs no more praise. I ordered 2 bottles, and they were not wrapped in anything, just placed in a box with other items. One of the bottles arrived with the pump open and the bottle slightly crushed. Not a big deal, not worth returning. I&#x27;m just saying items like this should be wrapped in something prior to shipping.</li>
            <li> The cap arrived broken</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t use the generic brands.  This genuine Purell will dry faster and cleaner than any other brand and leaves no greasy residue.</li>
            <li> Excellent, Super fast shipping</li>
            <li> I bought this because it does not leave a very noticeable, pasty residue on your hands like many of the generic brands do.  I&#x27;ve said enough.</li>
            <li> What can I say: its a big thing of hand sanitizer that seems to work. As advertised, arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> NOBODY wants germs.  Like nobody.  Buy a big bottle of germ cleaner and get rid of them before they get you!!</li>
            <li> I keep this in my patrol car at all times and use a ton of it. Love it and perfect size.</li>
            <li> Purell is a well known sanitizer that I have been using for years. It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue. However, due to insufficient packaging by Amazon, mine had the pump broken. The pump went all the way into the bottle through the plastic neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still giving 5 stars as this is not the product&#x27;s fault but Amazon should be more careful about these fragile items. Not worth to return as the return shipping will probably exceed the product&#x27;s value.</li>
            <li> It does what it says. What more is there to say? It smells fine. It is priced fairly. So what if were killing essential bacteria and destroying the biome? We will die clean.</li>
            <li> This 1 liter jug of Purell is huge. Don&#x27;t let the product photo full you. It&#x27;s not the typical Purell bottles you see sitting on people&#x27;s desks. This thing is like a big water bottle. The big size is a plus because you get a lot of material for such a cheap price of $10. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months every day and It&#x27;s only 20% used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is pleasant. It&#x27;s the signature sanitizing alcohol smell, a smell that imbues cleanliness and perfection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purrell is slippery at first, but rubs in within seconds. It does not leave any grimy or oily residue after it&#x27;s rubbed in. You won&#x27;t be able to tell that it&#x27;s there. It also doesn&#x27;t try out skin. In fact, it actually moisturizes. I noticed that if I put it on dry cracked skin, that part remains moisturized for hours. That&#x27;s interesting because Purrell doesn&#x27;t advertise any moisturizing properties of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Purrell on more than just my hands. I used it on my face to cure my acne. I had been to multiple dermatologists and had been prescribed 3 different treatments for my acne, but all treatments had failed. On a whim, I decided to put Purrell on my face. It does an excellent job of reducing redness of the acne and also makes each pimple less swollen. I noticed that anything antibacterial, such as antibacterial hand soap, would have the same effect on my acne, but Purrell was just much easier to apply and didn&#x27;t dry out my skin like the hand soap.</li>
            <li> Terrific.  It is getting hard to find these large (one liter) bottles of hand sanitizer at the stores around where I live.  I always try to buy them and use them to refill the smaller bottles.  It saves a lot of money.  The drugstore I go to stopped carrying these big bottles at least six months ago, so it’s nice to see them on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I go through these like you wouldn’t believe as I am in contact with other people all day at my job.  In the days before hand sanitizers, I was always getting sick, now, I never do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the Advanced version, which is 70% ethyl alcohol.  That is what was pictured on the page, although the description calls it the “original,” which I believe had a slightly lower percentage of alcohol.</li>
            <li> We purchased this for a local classroom at a school to use.  The built in pump helps the students get just the right amount that they need.  Sometimes it can be hard to judge just how much you need, especially for children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this.</li>
            <li> Bought four. One arrived with a broken pump top. You cannot toss four heavy objects like this into a carton and ship them without internal support because the plastic pumps are breakable.</li>
            <li> Purell is a miracle product ..it not only sanitizes ,it heal , i have use it on pimple ,bee stings ,cuts, and itches  with a a very  short tme they are all gone  i recommend pruell highly</li>
            <li> Chickens, Chickens and tons of eggs. Someone has to cleanse them before I can sell them...the eggs that is. This does it!</li>
            <li> smells like more alcohol than other similar  products we&#x27;ve used  so I assume more protection from germs etc.bottle too big tho.</li>
            <li> I do a lot of work in a variety of building environments that you typically wouldn&#x27;t want to have afterwards (think medical offices).  I bought this to use in the car after finishing up and washing my hands to get anything the soap missed, and it has been working very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to the size of the bottle (it&#x27;s a liter), I filled up a smaller bottle with a cap to sit in the glovebox.  So far no issues with car temps &amp;#62;120.  It gets a little less gel-like, but still works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say the smell is somewhere between rubbing alcohol and a lemon.</li>
            <li> This was part of my nieces classroom supplies. I bought the &amp;#34;big bottle&amp;#34; because teachers really don&#x27;t get all the supplies they need. I myself am on the fence about how good hand sanitizer is in every classroom, super bugs suck. But since it is required, all I can say is the big bottle made a good first impression with the teacher. I think when you&#x27;re talking about 30 young kids, you want them to have clean hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides that, it is just plain old purell. It&#x27;s not fancy scented bath and body work hand sanitizer. I think it has smelled the same since I was a child.</li>
            <li> I send them into school for the teachers and to refill my car one.  Great value for the price  stay healthy</li>
            <li> Some sanitizers either didn&#x27;t smell good or didn&#x27;t apply well.  This applies just fine and does the trick.  No fragrant smell to it beyond the &amp;#34;alcohol&amp;#34; smell.  Like the quantity and that I can get it subscribe and save.  Have a few of these throughout the house to have nearby to keep my hands clean for the babies.</li>
            <li> what&#x27;s not to love? We keep one near each changing station and one in the kitchen and it most certianly serves its purpose. Better than those chemical anti-bacterial soaps that seem to hurt more than help, this enormous pump station is great for a quick sanitation session when the traditional soap and water is out of reach. It&#x27;s seemingly lasting forever as it&#x27;s a large quantity and each pump doesn&#x27;t excessively distribute product. Just enough to do the job. Plus it&#x27;s got a small footprint for the vastness of liquid, making storage space not an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;we also bought one of those hospital style automatic dispensers to put near the door for family and friends who come to visit (you can see it in one of my other reviews). Couple that with these purell sanitizers and our home has been pretty germ free (As much as possible, anyway).</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and great product.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Worth buying it! not sure it cleared all gems in my hand :-) but after applying it i feel better !</li>
            <li> What a rip off.  I somehow got the idea there were 3 of these in an order.  I an buy this for $3.00 on sale in the market.</li>
            <li> I like the big bottle - easy to refill and the sanitizer itself is probably the best on the market you can get as a private person for a reasonable amount of money.</li>
            <li> Pain and Mob Programming Friend! I use this often when Pair or Mob Programming at my office and at home. Great for preventing other programmers hand germs from contaminating your keyboard!</li>
            <li> One of Three bottles in my orders was broken the Pomp and does not operate. However, I can not return it because the safety reasons. This item that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Buying small bottles of this stuff at the grocery store just does NOT cut it when you have a little boy haha</li>
            <li> This sanitizer leaves no residual coating which I find nice.</li>
            <li> I am a high school teacher and let me tell you this product is gold. I ordered two at the end of the school year because I ran out and was stunned at just how large these containers are. I am a bit of a germ-a-phobe at work and home so I know I will get a lot of use out of this product once school begins again in August. I plan on ordering this item again and again for the size you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Large sturdy bottle stands up to being used multiple times a day by little hands.  I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s kindergarten classroom and they keep it by the door.  It doesn&#x27;t tip over when being pumped.</li>
            <li> For a long time I wouldn&#x27;t touch this stuff.  I&#x27;ve had a need for it this year, however, and think it&#x27;s been effective.</li>
            <li> Excellent  - concentrated Good for a lot  of refills on items  needed, such as small sprayer pens  for hand use I the grocery store . Good economy size.</li>
            <li> Love the product.  Love the Purell  name.  I would have liked it to be a bit lower in price.  Maybe by $1.  But the convenience of delivery has a lot to be said.  Love the large size.  Love the pump.</li>
            <li> There was no packing material inside the way-too-small box from Amazon, and the Purell Hand Sanitizer bottle&#x27;s top broke as a result spilling hand sanitizer gel out of the bottle and all over the inside of the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There doesn&#x27;t seem to be any way to report this problem to Amazon and/or get a replacement item since it is listed as a hazardous material. The check box for &amp;#34;return/replacement&amp;#34; was not an option for this item. So I&#x27;m stuck with what is left in the bottle with no way to let Amazon know they should get with the program and pack things like this properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 Stars for the product. I can&#x27;t ding Purell for Amazon&#x27;s oversight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can buy this locally for a reasonably competitive price, I would recommend doing so.</li>
            <li> Excellent scent and perfect blend of alcohol, glycerin, and moisturizer. Best bang for the buck!  Highly Recommended for professional offices anywhere.</li>
            <li> Although I think hand sanitizers are over priced, I like everyone else buy them. I like Purell and Germ X about the same but Germ X smells better. I buy the big bottle because everyone in the house uses it all the time.</li>
            <li> Purell is the best when it comes to hand sanitizers so this is an automatic five stars. However, this bottle got damaged during transit. Usually Amazon is really good to me with protecting their items from damage, but not this time. The convenience of the pump is ruined. Please bubble-wrap your items!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Purell hand sanitizer! It is the &#x27;advanced&#x27; formula though and it just means it has a higher alcohol percentage. 70% now (i believe &#x27;regular&#x27; was 62%).&lt;br /&gt;item came damaged to my door as the pump was broken but i called amazon and they quickly fixed my problem!&lt;br /&gt;5 stars for purell and amazon&#x27;s customer service!</li>
            <li> Daughter has 3 kids. This is a bit more than a quart&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why don&#x27;t they sell this stuff by the gallon? LOL</li>
            <li> Just go to Wal-mart and buy some. I think Costco or Sam&#x27;s Club also sells this, though the past few times I&#x27;ve been, they haven&#x27;t had it.</li>
            <li> I am a hand sanitizer freak.  When I found a great price for this size bottle of Purell at a reasonable price, I snatched it up.  As the title states, I do like the product.  however, I have to warn you that this product is not returnable.  Because the bottle came to me with the twist off cap and plunger broken, I could not use it as is, and I could not return it for a replacement.  I use it as a refill for my smaller bottles, but I did want to use it &amp;#34;as is.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Perfect size for carrying in the back of my SUV.  Whenever I go to the grocery oi pump gas I do a quick clean up afterwards.  This is enough product to last years.  It is uneffected by temperature extremes.</li>
            <li> Bought this for 9.99 with a $1 coupon, making it 8.99.  Checked out drugstore.com a week later, and found 30 ounce bottles of germ-x for 3.99 each.  For the record, a liter has approximately 34 ounces, making this more than twice the price.  Womp womp.  (If you think that Purrell is significantly better than Germ-X, disregard this review - to me, it&#x27;s all the same).  Anyway, won&#x27;t be ordering hand sanitizer from Amazon anymore.</li>
            <li> We use this for quick hand sanitizing through out the day. It cleans your hands and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry them out.</li>
            <li> The Purell Hand Sanitizer was exactly as advertised.  My only regret is that this product (in the same size and form factor) doesn&#x27;t seem to be available with aloe.</li>
            <li> I give this rating on the faith that it is working as I have no way of knowing whether it is.  I would hope to find a sanitizer which is easier on my hands, preferably one that also served as a hand lotion.</li>
            <li> This is a repeat purchase.  It is so easy to use, and like.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! This brand is getting harder and harder to find at stores.  I don&#x27;t like the Germ-X that seems to be what all of the stores have.  We have been ordering this big size and just refill our little bottles that we keep in our vehicles and in my purse.</li>
            <li> It is what I want. It can go away very soon and can help me a lot. So I recommend it</li>
            <li> I work with peoples computers and cell phones all day that have been coughed on and sneezed on and who knows what else. Gloves are nice but I have an easier time with tiny screws without them. For that reason, a liter of Purell has a permanent spot on the work bench.</li>
            <li> I use this product many times a day. I like to be sanitized.</li>
            <li> We all know about purell for hand sanitizing.. that&#x27;s a no brainer, and to that end this product does a great job..  no leaks from the container - good, solid pump..  great price for the volume..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the rest - Please excuse this unorthodox TMI review...  In fact, stop reading if you&#x27;re easily offended or squeamish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people - no matter how hygienically minded, suffer from smelly crotch syndrome..  ie: crotch rot, swamp crotch, jock itch, etc.  It&#x27;s one of those issues most people won&#x27;t talk about.  What a lot of people don&#x27;t realize is that it&#x27;s fungal.  The fungii involved - Epidermophyton floccosum or  Trichophyton rubrum, most commonly - are the same types of fungus found in afflictions of athlete&#x27;s foot.  Athletic supporters, prolonged workouts or running - which gets things nice and warm and moist from sweat, are an ideal breeding ground for this fungus, no matter how much you wash (yourself or the articles of clothing) - but another, lesser known fact is that a hot bath is also a GREAT way to give yourself jock itch. Myself - I rely on a hot bath to ease sore muscles and years ago injured joints. The fungus from your feet (even if you don&#x27;t actively have athlete&#x27;s foot) will use the warm water as a medium to settle in other areas.  Areas that don&#x27;t dry up quickly, or get re-sweaty pretty quickly are almost certain to allow the fungal spores to grow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is - no need to continue with expensive jock itch creams...  purell f&#x27;ing works..  Careful - because stuff down there can be sensitive.. but a couple of pumps or purell rubbed on and around your junk will kill most of the common fungii that cause smelly crotch, and will help keep you &amp;#34;fresher&amp;#34; down there in general.  give it a try - just remember anything with a lot of nerve endings down there WILL get a burning sensation from it.. you&#x27;ve been warned.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly, kills those germs quickly, and leaves my skin feeling cool and smooth.  However, don&#x27;t use just before going out to be social as it smells way too hospital.  I solve that by giving it a few minutes to work then covering the smell with hand lotion.</li>
            <li> The product itself is useful, and I like the large size for my dance studio. However, I ordered two and both pump tops arrived broken to pieces. One bottle had leaked a few ounces into the box, soaking the corner. I would suggest getting the refill size, and purchasing a pump top separately.</li>
            <li> I have already written a product review on Purell.  It is the best hand sanitizer our family has used and it is portable if you save the smaller bottles.</li>
            <li> My family and I have used Purell for years. There are different brands of hand sanitizers on the market, but we trust Purell. It has enough alcohol in it to kill the germs on our hands, while not over drying our hands. I buy different sizes of Purell and keep them around my house, vehicles, workplace, and on me.</li>
            <li> Purell is overpriced but it does the job.</li>
            <li> I use this instead of hand soap in my house. Great in first aid and Trauma kits in little bottles for wound and equipment cleaning on the fly.</li>
            <li> I found out after placing the order that I could have gotten this same size from a big box retailer for less.  Good product but overpriced here.</li>
            <li> I use this on a daily basis and it was convenient to add this to my subscribe and save order with Amazon. I would normally buy this in the store but this was too easy. I&#x27;ve gone through a couple of these over time and I have this exact one in multiple spots in my house. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This hand sanitizer is VERY easy on the hands.  I use Germ-X normally because its cheaper, but this Purell isn&#x27;t as harsh smelling and keeps my hands feeling smooth instead of drying them out like the cheaper brands.  I&#x27;ll pick it up at the store next time, being that it is half the price there.  Awesome product, but not an awesome deal..</li>
            <li> This hand sanitizer dispenses the right amount evaporates quickly should you choose not to use a dry paper towel to finish. Your hand will feel and be noticeable cleaner.</li>
            <li> I bought this bottle when traveling abroad to work in a medical facility.  They did not have any significant hand sanitation.  This bottle was a nice way to refill my mini bottles of hand sanitizer.  It survived the travel oversee with out problem.  The hand pump is good quality and worked well for average use or refills.  In the 4 weeks of heavy use, I only went through about 1/3 of a bottle.</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a subscribe and save item. I was happy with the price and size. However Amazon dropped the item from their subscribe and save program so I guess I will buy it locally and Amazon loses the sale. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Dont get me wrong, I love Purell and feel there is no quality comptition in this arena, however my lower assignment of score reflects the fact that my bottle of purell arrived broken; half of the pump is missing making it harder to pump product through the pump. The missing piece ws not in the box i arrived in, no, so someone had to pack it in the condition i receieved it in.</li>
            <li> I keep one by each cat litter location.  Does not replace hand washing in all circumstances.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have a small child and with that comes lots of visitors and the associated sickness that they bring in the house. We have tons of the smaller bottles spread throughout the house and when one gets low I whip out this 1 liter and fill it right up. I always get the scent free / fragrance free so that anyone with allergies doesn&#x27;t have any qualms about a quick spritz when they come over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another note, This is extremely handy in getting rid of stickiness. A sticker leave behind some goo? Some of this on a paper towel and it will come right off!</li>
            <li> I always keep extra and sanitizer around to refill my small bottles around the house.  I have allergies and this works great and helps to save money.</li>
            <li> This is a giant bottle of Purell.  It can be used to fill smaller bottles to take with you, or used directly on your hands.  It&#x27;s a ton of Purell!</li>
            <li> Purell&#x27;s sanitizer gives him the peace of mind he needs to face all the germs of the world.  He is sensitive to fragrances and doesn&#x27;t mind Purell&#x27;s Original.  Plus it is not sticky or greasy.  Great size if you use it frequently.  NOTE:  Don&#x27;t keep the sanitizer somewhere hot.  The product doesn&#x27;t stand up well to being heated frequently (like in your car).  I bought a bunch of little bottles and we just keep one or two of these in the car so we don&#x27;t waste too much.</li>
            <li> really prevented some nasty colds</li>
            <li> An excellent product.  I use this to refill smaller Purell dispensers.  The only negative aspect of the purchase is that the shipping cost is greater than the cost of the product.</li>
            <li> Good value- good product. It is not loaded with perfumes /basically it doesn&#x27;t stink like many others.&lt;br /&gt;Actually smells very little (kind of neutral with alcohol ) and overall smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. The more you buy the cheaper it gets. It smells like rubbing alcohol with a light fragrance. I recommend this product for caregivers. I&#x27;m taking care of my mom these days and sometimes washing her hands is nearly impossible. This helps.</li>
            <li> The best part about this is that there is a lot of it.  The worst part about it is that since I was already used to the version that had &amp;#34;moisturizers&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;vitamin E&amp;#34; stuff, that this didn&#x27;t actually have that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in &amp;#34;The North&amp;#34;, and I&#x27;m personally kinda picky about dry skin.... I don&#x27;t like it!  So, in the winter I use unscented lotion.  I already have said lotion on hand, so the fact that this doesn&#x27;t have moisturizer in it doesn&#x27;t completely bother me, however it would be nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, I&#x27;ve found Purell to be the &amp;#34;cream of the crop&amp;#34;, and that it has a high concentration of ethanol, which is the active ingredient.  I don&#x27;t know if it has made me more disease-free, but I feel like I&#x27;m at least attempting to something good for myself.</li>
            <li> The item came with a broken nozzle on the pump so it&#x27;s inconvenient to use. This is also very comparable to store prices so it&#x27;d probably more worth it to buy from the store because it guarantees that it won&#x27;t arrive broken. Since there is a sanitation issue with this product, we can&#x27;t return the item.</li>
            <li> I use this alot so nice to have a super size jug of it  :).  Comes in handy to keep form constantly washing hands.</li>
            <li> As simple as this product is, a slightly viscous, germ killing, rubbing alcohol - only the original Purell is worth buying. I tried a few budget brands (knock-offs) and they are junk. Also, while some people may like the Aloe added version, I find it leaves a slimy feeling. Stick with the original, unless of course, you prefer the Aloe added, moisturizing type.</li>
