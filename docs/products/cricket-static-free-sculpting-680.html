            <li>My hair is very, very fine and sheds way more quickly than what I believe is &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to replace it with the same exact one and was so happy to find it still available and at a great price.</li>
            <li>Soft on the scalp and style your hair great.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes, If you are looking for a great Static Free brush look no more, you have found it right here and for a great price too:)</li>
            <li>The handle is very comfortable and the brush is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The best wet hair brush on the market!</li>
            <li>The bristles are sturdy, but not hard and it feels good on the scalp when I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li>Great Brush - have bought several.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It looks cheap even though I don&#x27;t think the quality has changed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not quite as good for me as the Styling 220 for general hair brushing.  </li>
            <li>It really is &amp;#34;Static Free&amp;#34;!  :-)</li>
            <li>This is by far my most favorite hairbrush.</li>
            <li>I just love Cricket hair brushes as my hair tends to get static easily due to being very fine.  </li>
            <li>I was so happy to find the exact same hairbrush here on Amazon again.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you why I love it so much</li>
            <li>Seems like a good brush but only time will tell!</li>
            <li>It really helps with static.</li>
            <li>Also a great price with a decent enough style.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say much more about it, other than it is a great product which I intend to continue to purchase as long as it is available for sale.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Cricket Static free brushes for 15 years, they are the only ones that I use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s anti-static and very strong, which is especially important as my husband has thick, curly hair which tends to eat brushes alive.  </li>
            <li>Best brush for wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li>This is my all-time favorite general use hair brush.</li>
            <li>Most brushes cause my hair to build up a static charge within just a few strokes and it floats in the air as if I am in outer space.  </li>
            <li>The first brush was purchased from a hair salon at twice the cost.</li>
            <li>This brush is not static free as claimed, so you will still need to use something like clingfree, argon oil, or some kind of styling product</li>
            <li>Same amount of static in hair, no difference in using this brush.</li>
            <li>It also takes more strokes to get a smooth finish because there are so few bristles.  </li>
            <li>It looks almost cheap on first view but after several weeks of using it</li>
            <li>I just wish now that they would make a large 2&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and post brushed</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!  </li>
            <li>Gently detangles without breakage/tugging.  </li>
            <li>Why do they make us write so much about a brush</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still giving it 4 stars because it&#x27;s much more gentle on my hair and scalp than other brushes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>, it just seems to work better than other brushes.  </li>
            <li>round brush that is static free with the same bristles.</li>
            <li>I needed to replace an old brush that worked very well.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin hair and this brush is just right for me.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this type for several years and bought this one for my husband who has much thicker hair and really likes it.</li>
            <li>I purchased this same exact brush over 20 years</li>
            <li>but overall this is a very lightweight but high quality brush</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually have major issues with static</li>
            <li>It is not static free.  </li>
            <li>and then I can see if I still have enough hair to warrant a new one.</li>
            <li>After 11 years my old one finally broke so buy a replacement.</li>
            <li>When I originally bought it in a salon, it was very expensive, however on amazon this brush is super affordable.  </li>
            <li>All the red tips are long gone from old brush</li>

            <li> Had high hopes for it, but unfortunately it failed, for me.</li>
            <li> But a little heavy.</li>
            <li> &amp; it always got entangled, but no more since I started using this.</li>
            <li> It replaces my worn out (and, sadly, discontinued) Aveda styling brushes.</li>

            <li> Great Brush - have bought several.  Everyone in the family uses one</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually have major issues with static but overall this is a very lightweight but high quality brush and I&#x27;m glad I purchased it. It looks almost cheap on first view but after several weeks of using it I&#x27;m very happy with it and it keeps my frizzy hair in check.</li>
            <li> I like it! Verry good comb, and static free!</li>
            <li> Love this hair brush. This is the second one I have purchased. The first brush was purchased from a hair salon at twice the cost. It is lightweight and does not create any static during brushing. Can&#x27;t say much more about it, other than it is a great product which I intend to continue to purchase as long as it is available for sale.</li>
            <li> I used this brush for over 10yrs, until it finally broke (I think my husband had something to do with it).  I found this brush is still floating around and was very happy!  When I originally bought it in a salon, it was very expensive, however on amazon this brush is super affordable.  The quality is there, and is an overall perfect brush!  The handle is comfortable, and brush head is a bit flexable so it won&#x27;t yank hair, plus the anti-static feature is good for keeping hair smooth.  Must have brush!</li>
            <li> This is by far my most favorite hairbrush. I had picked one up at a hair salon in Hawaii 20 years ago and it lately kind of fell apart a bit. (Still pretty good a 20 year lifespan!). I was so happy to find the exact same hairbrush here on Amazon again. So here we go for the next 20 years again and then I can see if I still have enough hair to warrant a new one.</li>
            <li> Great brush, we bought two.  It&#x27;s anti-static and very strong, which is especially important as my husband has thick, curly hair which tends to eat brushes alive.  This brush works through the toughest tangles without losing bristles or shattering the handle. Also a great price with a decent enough style.</li>
            <li> Wife loves the static free feature!</li>
            <li> I purchased this same exact brush over 20 years and I just now had to replace it.  I wanted to replace it with the same exact one and was so happy to find it still available and at a great price.</li>
            <li> I use this to detangle my hair after shampoo/conditioner and it is excellent.  Gently detangles without breakage/tugging.  Only downside is handle broke when I used it when my hair was long (below shoulder length).  I&#x27;m still giving it 4 stars because it&#x27;s much more gentle on my hair and scalp than other brushes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This is my beautician&#x27;s favorite as well. I have very long hair &amp; it always got entangled, but no more since I started using this. My hair got healthier &amp; smoother! Good cost performance, as well.</li>
            <li> This brush is not static free as claimed, so you will still need to use something like clingfree, argon oil, or some kind of styling product</li>
            <li> Same amount of static in hair, no difference in using this brush. Had high hopes for it, but unfortunately it failed, for me.</li>
            <li> This is my all-time favorite general use hair brush. Works great if you have to de-tangle windblown hair.  It doesn&#x27;t pull and damage your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about this brush? It really is &amp;#34;Static Free&amp;#34;!  :-)</li>
            <li> What can I say about a brush?  I&#x27;ve had one like this for years and it finally wore out.  I couldn&#x27;t believe I found the same brush at Amazon.  I can&#x27;t tell you why I love it so much, it just seems to work better than other brushes.  The bristles are sturdy, but not hard and it feels good on the scalp when I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li> Great price and as expected, very good brush.</li>
            <li> I needed to replace an old brush that worked very well.  Ironically, I found the same one online and it had a  great price and free shipping.  What a deal!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t pull my hair, detangles easily, love how its light and makes detangling very easy and fast, great product would buy more</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair and this brush is just right for me.  I have been using this type for several years and bought this one for my husband who has much thicker hair and really likes it.</li>
            <li> The best wet hair brush on the market! After 11 years my old one finally broke so buy a replacement.</li>
            <li> Brush is very very nice. But a little heavy. Why do they make us write so much about a brush</li>
            <li> Best brush to use when blow drying straight hair. It replaces my worn out (and, sadly, discontinued) Aveda styling brushes. I plan to order more!</li>
            <li> This brush doesn&#x27;t hurt my scalp and doesn&#x27;t cause static.  I love it.  I think I bought four of them after the initial one.</li>
            <li> I just love Cricket hair brushes as my hair tends to get static easily due to being very fine.  But not with Cricket!  I just wish now that they would make a large 2&amp;#34; round brush that is static free with the same bristles.</li>
            <li> love this brush. works great on my hair, static control.</li>
            <li> My favorite brushes.  Soft on the scalp and style your hair great.</li>
            <li> Been using for years and they still work great</li>
            <li> Seems like a good brush but only time will tell!</li>
            <li> Just like the ones from a salon! Very pleased!</li>
            <li> This hairbrush is the nicest brush for blowdrying your hair. It really helps with static. The handle is very comfortable and the brush is easy to clean. I have purchased this for friends and family before because they commented on how nice my brush was when they visited. This is my second purchase of this brush and that was after using the other for several years without needing to replace it.</li>
            <li> Great, high quality static free sculpting brush at a great price.  I recommend this for anyone looking for a good, affordable brush.</li>
            <li> The brush is all black not black and red.&lt;br /&gt;It looks cheap even though I don&#x27;t think the quality has changed.&lt;br /&gt;The picture should have been changed.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to see this brush on here. I have one just like it that I had bought from a salon about 20 years ago and love it! I have fine hair and post brushed don&#x27;t work in it. All the red tips are long gone from old brush so I&#x27;m thrilled to find this one. This made my day!</li>
