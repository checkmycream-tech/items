            <li>Best blowdryer I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li>Even with the ion switch &#x27;on&#x27; the Sedu still does not leave the hair as beautiful as the Volare.</li>
            <li>lol &amp;</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have the fly away</li>
            <li>Its great, blows air like a jet engine...</li>
            <li>This blow dryer is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>My stylist is great, and became my great friend, but no matter how well she treated my hair, and how many conditioners, etc.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s that good.</li>

            <li>Love this dryer!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Nicely made.</li>
            <li>own this and the Sedu Revolution</li>
            <li>Comes in a fancy box, looks nice and shiny and does the job.</li>
            <li>Excellent blowing power and extremely high</li>
            <li>Loving sleep more than beauty in the mornings, 2.</li>
            <li>and although that is nice sometimes I do wish to create more body/texture.</li>
            <li>Which turned out to be great, and while drying my hair with difficulty at first, because of my lack of practice, I managed.</li>
            <li>, I cannot stop myself from congratulating me for my accurate decision!</li>

            <li>i love this dryer</li>
            <li>Amazon had a WAY better price than CosmoProf, so I decided to buy here.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I love the three heat settings.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this dryer.</li>
            <li>There is no on/off ion switch like there is with the Sedu so you will get silky sleek hair everytime even if you want more of a voluminous look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I decided to get myself a nice, professional hair drier, and checked the Babyliss Pro with all the great feedback.</li>

            <li>I hope to get many years of use out of and would purchase another without a question.</li>
            <li>Love this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>I love three things about this drier:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair&#x27;s never looked better.</li>
            <li>: I love the compact size.</li>
            <li>Love all the settings it has.</li>
            <li>Love this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money!!  </li>
            <li>Easy to maneuver to any direction.</li>
            <li>, it remains to be seen how long this hairdryer will hold up, but for now, I&#x27;m pretty sure this is the best purchase I&#x27;ve made in years.</li>
            <li>The drying time is much less now, and the hair is great!</li>
            <li>The drying time is much less now, and the hair is great!</li>
            <li>The dryer worked fine for about a month then it caught on fire.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Temperature wise the cool shot gets pretty cool</li>
            <li>This hair dryer works so good and dries hair super fast.</li>
            <li>It is very powerful and dries my hair more quickly than anything I have bought before.  </li>
            <li>I had I noticed a huge difference, no frizzy hair</li>
            <li>The airflow is amazing  and dries my hair so fast.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic dryer.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>I use good old Dove shampoo and conditioner, the cheap stuff.</li>
            <li>Of course, everything done is the salon always seems to be better than home, so I didn&#x27;t run out and buy one right away.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t pass on this one ladies, worth every penny!</li>
            <li>It was worth it!</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is so sleek powerful, well made and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>Instead of a cool shot button there is a &#x27;turbo shot&#x27; where a &#x27;cool shot&#x27; would be located.</li>
            <li>For your info, I use all the buttons at full speed always.</li>
            <li>For your info, I use all the buttons at full speed always.</li>
            <li>I love my new hair dryer!</li>
            <li>So glad I finally bought it!! :)</li>
            <li>This dryer is fast, easy to work with, not</li>
            <li>but other than that..the blow dryer is amazing!</li>
            <li>Babyliss Pro is powerful, fast, and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>Babyliss Pro is powerful, fast, and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>The cool setting is great to set the style after I use the hot setting and my round brush to create it.</li>
            <li>Im glad i did because even this mid-size one is heavier than my old feather lite hair dryer.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is worth the price.  </li>
            <li>This blow dryer is worth the money.</li>
            <li>That said, for me it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>As quick as this dries, I may just stop having to rock the &amp;#34;mom bun&amp;#34; daily. :)</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m pretty inspired right now.</li>
            <li>Where as a Sedu &#x27; cool is more of a room temp and doesn&#x27;t truly cool the air, low heat is warmer than that of the Volare, and the high heat is cooler than the Volare high heat.</li>
            <li>it curls up to much!</li>
            <li>I just received it yesterday and used it this morning for the first time.</li>
            <li>I spent $10 or so more to get this mid-size model because i didnt want to deal with the weight of the full size one.</li>
            <li>Volare has bigger temperature jumps between the temp settings,  where asthe Sedu has a more consistent/less noticeable change in temperature settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It definitely leaves the hair extremely healthy feeling</li>
            <li>After using it and learning to manage it (because it is so fast!)</li>
            <li>After using it and learning to manage it (because it is so fast!)</li>
            <li>i really have been spoiled by it!</li>
            <li>first client</li>
            <li>the lowest heat is warm but not hot, and the highest heat is EXTREMELY hot.  </li>
            <li>I feel that since the blower is so fast, I can avoid the heat fto touch my hair for so long, thus making a more healthier drying experience for my hair everytime.</li>

            <li>My hair changed a lot, and the huge amounts of money I used to spend at the beaty salon were no longer necessary.</li>
            <li>I can have my hair ready in 35-40 minutes.ds, but I have to wait for my hair to outgrow the damage (grrr!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can have my hair ready in 35-40 minutes.</li>
            <li>I never thought I&#x27;d spend this much on a hair drier of all things</li>
            <li>The air is very concentrated and reminds me of a domestically-safe jet engine packaged in a hair drier.</li>
            <li>It drys my hair much faster then my Chi ever did and the cuticle on my hair stays down more</li>
            <li>It basically said that the V1 can be a little bulky for home use, but the V2 puts out just as much power, just in a more compact size.</li>
            <li>so you get about a half inch more air flow</li>
            <li>I am not a salon styilst, just someone who likes to dry her hair at home at anytime, even at midnight if it is when the time is available.</li>
            <li>Extremely powerful which gets your hair dry faster without using too much heat!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a bit more than 3 years, my FHi dryer fell to the floor and the little fan inside broke.</li>
            <li>I always just dry &amp; then flat iron, for many reasons.</li>
            <li>this is a super blow dry</li>
            <li>are roughly the same size, the Sedu is more ergonomic and easier to grip.</li>
            <li>And, the most important part is that my ridiculously thick hair is completely dry when I&#x27;m finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My most recent one lasted ten months, and it didn&#x27;t even get used daily.</li>
            <li>It has great blowing power and takes her half of the time to dry her hair compared with other ones she had before.</li>
            <li>too heavy and does a fantastic job.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit smaller in size than the other dryer I had, which is just fine for me.</li>
            <li>It is a bit smaller in size than the other dryer I had, which is just fine for me.</li>
            <li>airstream is very very powerful, it&#x27;s blown a few of my makeup products off my bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I notice that while I still have damaged hair from the repaired old dryier, the half hair closer to the roots which is not damaged has remained healthy, keeping its natural waviness for when I decide to let it dry alone.&lt;br</li>

            <li>(it&#x27;s not exactly small either, but it was worth to bring it with me and not have to use the little dryer the hotel offers).</li>
            <li>fast and strong,save a lot of time to dry my client hair</li>
            <li>Yes it is a little pricey but worth every penny</li>
            <li>I strongly advise you not to attempt repair with any other generic piece of whatever that is not original or not from the FHI repair service (if they have any, I dont know, because I live in the Caribbean).</li>
            <li>I wanted a smaller dryer for traveling and that would dry my curly hair fast.  </li>
            <li>Even with me fighting the round brush in one hand &amp; the dryer in the other, my hair is smooth &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This has a &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; as a temperature setting instead of having to hassle a &#x27;cool shot button&#x27; like the Sedu or other typical blow dryers.</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s a professional tool, it has an extra long cord, which i like.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t shared this hair dryer with my daughter because I know once she tries it I will be stuck with her old one!</li>
            <li>/&gt;With a &#x27;regular&#x27; blow dryer such as a Revlon brand one it takes me about 30 mins to blow dry my hair completely without styling it on its highest heat, with the Sedu it takes me 20 on its lowest heat,</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to any one looking for an above average hair dryer</li>

            <li> It drys my hair much faster then my Chi ever did and the cuticle on my hair stays down more</li>
            <li> It basically said that the V1 can be a little bulky for home use, but the V2 puts out just as much power, just in a more compact size.</li>
            <li> so you get about a half inch more air flow</li>
            <li> I am not a salon styilst, just someone who likes to dry her hair at home at anytime, even at midnight if it is when the time is available.</li>
            <li> Extremely powerful which gets your hair dry faster without using too much heat!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a bit more than 3 years, my FHi dryer fell to the floor and the little fan inside broke.</li>
            <li> I always just dry &amp; then flat iron, for many reasons.</li>
            <li> this is a super blow dry</li>
            <li> are roughly the same size, the Sedu is more ergonomic and easier to grip.</li>
            <li> And, the most important part is that my ridiculously thick hair is completely dry when I&#x27;m finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My most recent one lasted ten months, and it didn&#x27;t even get used daily.</li>
            <li> It has great blowing power and takes her half of the time to dry her hair compared with other ones she had before.</li>
            <li> too heavy and does a fantastic job.  </li>
            <li> It is a bit smaller in size than the other dryer I had, which is just fine for me.</li>
            <li> It is a bit smaller in size than the other dryer I had, which is just fine for me.</li>
            <li> airstream is very very powerful, it&#x27;s blown a few of my makeup products off my bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I notice that while I still have damaged hair from the repaired old dryier, the half hair closer to the roots which is not damaged has remained healthy, keeping its natural waviness for when I decide to let it dry alone.&lt;br</li>

            <li> (it&#x27;s not exactly small either, but it was worth to bring it with me and not have to use the little dryer the hotel offers).</li>
            <li> fast and strong,save a lot of time to dry my client hair</li>
            <li> Yes it is a little pricey but worth every penny</li>
            <li> I strongly advise you not to attempt repair with any other generic piece of whatever that is not original or not from the FHI repair service (if they have any, I dont know, because I live in the Caribbean).</li>
            <li> I wanted a smaller dryer for traveling and that would dry my curly hair fast.  </li>
            <li> Even with me fighting the round brush in one hand &amp; the dryer in the other, my hair is smooth &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This has a &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; as a temperature setting instead of having to hassle a &#x27;cool shot button&#x27; like the Sedu or other typical blow dryers.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s a professional tool, it has an extra long cord, which i like.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t shared this hair dryer with my daughter because I know once she tries it I will be stuck with her old one!</li>
            <li> /&gt;With a &#x27;regular&#x27; blow dryer such as a Revlon brand one it takes me about 30 mins to blow dry my hair completely without styling it on its highest heat, with the Sedu it takes me 20 on its lowest heat,</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to any one looking for an above average hair dryer</li>
            <li> The cord is thick and round versus a traditional easy to tangle rope</li>
            <li> Relatively quiet and extra long cord.</li>
            <li> Lets see for how long this one will last.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to go over my hair w a flat iron using the Volare</li>
            <li> Where as with the Sedu I still need to do a bit of styling if using a flat iron.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and shiny and not drier-burned like it was with the previous hair</li>
            <li> , the smaller nozzles are roughly the same size.</li>
            <li> And it does a fantastic job of smoothing it out, even on my worse days!  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone with very long hair</li>
            <li> TAKES NO TIME TO GET MY HAIR DRY.  </li>
            <li> wish they could made this blow dry a featherweight in the fulture&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> I used to go to a beaty salon to have my hair dry.</li>
            <li> I dry my daughter&#x27;s and mother&#x27;s hair too.</li>
            <li> I dry my daughter&#x27;s and mother&#x27;s hair too.</li>
            <li> and I blow dry with just the drier and my hands-- no comb or styling products.</li>
            <li> 5 minutes to dry my hair!</li>
            <li> Overall, I like using this dryer, but I have had to get it replaced twice in less than three years.</li>
            <li> Oh and I got red when I ordered black.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super big</li>
            <li> I can always trade it in and get something else&amp;#34; and since this was one of the more expensive models I&#x27;d get a small refund as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mainly I&#x27;m not coordinated enough to use a round brush &amp; hold a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I rarely dry my hair at home due to 1.</li>
            <li> only thing I disliked about the Volare was the lack of ability to turn off the ion charge.</li>
            <li> When I had my hair wet, it looked</li>
            <li> Seating in front of a mirror, I would bravely spent 1 hour drying my hair.</li>
            <li> Too heavy for personal use.</li>
            <li> and if you ask me in person I&#x27;d plead the fifth before telling you how much I spent on it.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry under 5 minutes!!</li>
            <li> It takes me on average 15-20 minutes to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> It takes less time for me to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> THE ONLY BAD THING IS THAT THE STYLING ATTACHMENTS GET VERY HOT.</li>
            <li> I showed her this and some other pro dryers</li>
            <li> I did notice a weird smell, I&#x27;m hoping it was just the dryer components heating up for the first time.</li>
            <li> Every other hair drier feels diffused after using the Volare V2.</li>
            <li> It took a few days to figure out how to blow dry my hair and get the style I wanted but once that was figured out</li>
            <li> and it does the job in half of the time than my other blowdryer.</li>
            <li> I hardly ever write reviews of products -- I can&#x27;t even remember the last one I wrote.</li>
            <li> It took usually 45-50 minutes for my stylist to dry my hair, which is just not long, thick and wavy</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is no cool blast.  </li>
            <li> This dryer has cut my styling time to less than half of what it&#x27;s always been.</li>
            <li> She got tired with those $20-30 dryers that have 1-2 years life and takes too long to dry her hair.</li>
            <li> I used, my hair got scorched enough that a some of it was always breaking in half, the natural waviness lost in an ugly way (the half of the hair closest to the roots, the other half wavy still...</li>
            <li> I have thick, long hair and this was recommended by my hair stylist.</li>
            <li> In my 20s I bought the round brush blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Bought it for mom for Christmas...can get her hair dried in under two minutes...</li>
            <li> Oozes quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer for a few months now</li>
            <li> It is heavy though so don&#x27;t drop it on your toe</li>
            <li> And isn&#x27;t too heavy either.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, long hair, and 3.</li>
            <li> I have loooooong thick frizzy hair and has cut my drying time in half.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommend to anyone crazy enough to spend ~$150 on a hair drier.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> i love this dryer but i dislike the cord...it curls up to much! but other than that..the blow dryer is amazing! love it!</li>
            <li> My hair is dry under 5 minutes!! Well worth the money I would recommend it to anyone with very long hair</li>
            <li> My stylist used this blow dryer on me and I thought it worked great! Of course, everything done is the salon always seems to be better than home, so I didn&#x27;t run out and buy one right away. I rarely dry my hair at home due to 1. Loving sleep more than beauty in the mornings, 2. I have very thick, long hair, and 3. My blow dryer is a $20 vidal sassoon from 10 years ago. It takes me on average 15-20 minutes to dry my hair. I finally decided to buy one. Amazon had a WAY better price than CosmoProf, so I decided to buy here. I just received it yesterday and used it this morning for the first time. 5 minutes to dry my hair! Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went with the V2 over the V1 after reading a salon blog about it. It basically said that the V1 can be a little bulky for home use, but the V2 puts out just as much power, just in a more compact size. As quick as this dries, I may just stop having to rock the &amp;#34;mom bun&amp;#34; daily. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife. She got tired with those $20-30 dryers that have 1-2 years life and takes too long to dry her hair. I showed her this and some other pro dryers and she picked this one and couldn&#x27;t be happier. It has great blowing power and takes her half of the time to dry her hair compared with other ones she had before. Well worth the money. Lets see for how long this one will last.</li>
            <li> Love this dryer! Well worth the money!!  So glad I finally bought it!! :)</li>
            <li> VERY QUIET.  PLENTY OF SETTINGS.  TAKES NO TIME TO GET MY HAIR DRY.  THE ONLY BAD THING IS THAT THE STYLING ATTACHMENTS GET VERY HOT.</li>
            <li> this is a super blow dry I ever see,&lt;br /&gt;its fast and strong,save a lot of time to dry my client hair&lt;br /&gt;I wish they could made this blow dry a featherweight in the fulture&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> Best drier I&#x27;ve ever used! Lots of heat and blowing power. Nicely made.</li>
            <li> Overall, I like using this dryer, but I have had to get it replaced twice in less than three years. I would not recommend it, as it is not a long-lasting product. My most recent one lasted ten months, and it didn&#x27;t even get used daily.</li>
            <li> I wanted a salon quality dryer and got it!  This dryer is fast, easy to work with, not too heavy and does a fantastic job.  Best I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve NEVER styled my hair with a blow dryer. I always just dry &amp; then flat iron, for many reasons. Mainly I&#x27;m not coordinated enough to use a round brush &amp; hold a blow dryer. In my 20s I bought the round brush blow dryer. You know the all in one, lol &amp; it worked okay but my hair was still frizzy. This blow dryer is AMAZING! Even with me fighting the round brush in one hand &amp; the dryer in the other, my hair is smooth &amp; shiny. Just like when I leave the salon! Don&#x27;t pass on this one ladies, worth every penny! I did notice a weird smell, I&#x27;m hoping it was just the dryer components heating up for the first time.</li>
            <li> I love my new hair dryer! The airflow is amazing  and dries my hair so fast. I love the three heat settings. The cool setting is great to set the style after I use the hot setting and my round brush to create it. I spent $10 or so more to get this mid-size model because i didnt want to deal with the weight of the full size one. Im glad i did because even this mid-size one is heavier than my old feather lite hair dryer. I haven&#x27;t shared this hair dryer with my daughter because I know once she tries it I will be stuck with her old one!</li>
            <li> Best blow dryer on the market. Extremely powerful which gets your hair dry faster without using too much heat! It also gives shine to my hair. I love it!</li>
            <li> I wanted a smaller dryer for traveling and that would dry my curly hair fast.  This is a fantastic dryer.  My hair is curly and midlength and it dries in 7 minutes!  And it does a fantastic job of smoothing it out, even on my worse days!  I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this dryer. The only complaint I have is no cool blast.  Oh and I got red when I ordered black.</li>
            <li> Excellent blowing power and extremely high heat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own this and the Sedu Revolution 4000i.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has a &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; as a temperature setting instead of having to hassle a &#x27;cool shot button&#x27; like the Sedu or other typical blow dryers. Instead of a cool shot button there is a &#x27;turbo shot&#x27; where a &#x27;cool shot&#x27; would be located. There is no on/off ion switch like there is with the Sedu so you will get silky sleek hair everytime even if you want more of a voluminous look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The airstream is very very powerful, it&#x27;s blown a few of my makeup products off my bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a &#x27;regular&#x27; blow dryer such as a Revlon brand one it takes me about 30 mins to blow dry my hair completely without styling it on its highest heat, with the Sedu it takes me 20 on its lowest heat, and with this one it&#x27;s 10 minutes on its lowest heat. (For highest heat take off about 5 minutes from the Sedu and about 7 for the Volare). Now if I&#x27;m giving myself a blow out (styling) 40 for Revlon at highest heat, 30 for Sedu at lowest heat, and 20 for the Volare at lowest heat. Take about 5 minutes off the Sedu time for highest heat, and 10 minutes off the Volare time for highest heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Temperature wise the cool shot gets pretty cool the lowest heat is warm but not hot, and the highest heat is EXTREMELY hot.  Where as a Sedu &#x27; cool is more of a room temp and doesn&#x27;t truly cool the air, low heat is warmer than that of the Volare, and the high heat is cooler than the Volare high heat. Volare has bigger temperature jumps between the temp settings,  where asthe Sedu has a more consistent/less noticeable change in temperature settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both are roughly the same size, the Sedu is more ergonomic and easier to grip. The larger nozzle on the Volare seems to be longer than that of the Sedu so you get about a half inch more air flow, the smaller nozzles are roughly the same size. A diffuser doe NOT come with each of these and will need to be orderedseperately. The cord is thick and round versus a traditional easy to tangle rope cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I disliked about the Volare was the lack of ability to turn off the ion charge. It definitely leaves the hair extremely healthy feeling and although that is nice sometimes I do wish to create more body/texture. Even with the ion switch &#x27;on&#x27; the Sedu still does not leave the hair as beautiful as the Volare. I don&#x27;t have to go over my hair w a flat iron using the Volare it&#x27;s that good. Where as with the Sedu I still need to do a bit of styling if using a flat iron. The Sedu blow outs hold their volume/curl longer.</li>
            <li> I am not a salon styilst, just someone who likes to dry her hair at home at anytime, even at midnight if it is when the time is available. I used to go to a beaty salon to have my hair dry. It took usually 45-50 minutes for my stylist to dry my hair, which is just not long, thick and wavy: I have a lot of it, too (my stylist used to joke saying I had to heads in one, but sometimes another stylist would come to give her a hand... imagine to people pulling at your hair at the same time... it felt as if they were trying to split my head in two, sometimes!). My stylist is great, and became my great friend, but no matter how well she treated my hair, and how many conditioners, etc. I used, my hair got scorched enough that a some of it was always breaking in half, the natural waviness lost in an ugly way (the half of the hair closest to the roots, the other half wavy still... When I had my hair wet, it looked weird).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day I decided to get myself a blowdryer, and got the FHI 2000. Which turned out to be great, and while drying my hair with difficulty at first, because of my lack of practice, I managed. Seating in front of a mirror, I would bravely spent 1 hour drying my hair. It was worth it! My hair changed a lot, and the huge amounts of money I used to spend at the beaty salon were no longer necessary. Once I encountered my former stylist in the supermarket, and she thought I was visiting another beauty salon, she didn&#x27;t believe me when I told her it was me (she didnt tell me, but from her face I could tell she didnt believe me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a bit more than 3 years, my FHi dryer fell to the floor and the little fan inside broke. I strongly advise you not to attempt repair with any other generic piece of whatever that is not original or not from the FHI repair service (if they have any, I dont know, because I live in the Caribbean). I did that, and regretted it a lot, since the repaired dryer damaged my hair. I had to condition it lots and lots afterwards, but I have to wait for my hair to outgrow the damage (grrr!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I decided to get myself a nice, professional hair drier, and checked the Babyliss Pro with all the great feedback. After using it and learning to manage it (because it is so fast!), I cannot stop myself from congratulating me for my accurate decision! My sister tried it (she has wavy and think hair too), and immediately ordered one for her. I dry my daughter&#x27;s and mother&#x27;s hair too. The drying time is much less now, and the hair is great! I notice that while I still have damaged hair from the repaired old dryier, the half hair closer to the roots which is not damaged has remained healthy, keeping its natural waviness for when I decide to let it dry alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Babyliss Pro is powerful, fast, and easy to manage. It is a bit smaller in size than the other dryer I had, which is just fine for me. I feel that since the blower is so fast, I can avoid the heat fto touch my hair for so long, thus making a more healthier drying experience for my hair everytime. For your info, I use all the buttons at full speed always. I can have my hair ready in 35-40 minutes.ds, but I have to wait for my hair to outgrow the damage (grrr!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I decided to get myself a nice, professional hair drier, and checked the Babyliss Pro with all the great feedback.

            <li> awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Exclent product, just two minutes tondy my hair without damage</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is worth the price.  It drys my hair much faster then my Chi ever did and the cuticle on my hair stays down more so I don&#x27;t have the fly away look.  My hairdresser recommended this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Its great, blows air like a jet engine...Bought it for mom for Christmas...can get her hair dried in under two minutes...</li>
            <li> Oozes quality. Easy to maneuver to any direction. Relatively quiet and extra long cord. i really have been spoiled by it!</li>
            <li> This dryer works so well.  Cuts the drying time by a lot!</li>
            <li> Too heavy for personal use.</li>
            <li> I would give this 6 stars. Absolutely exceptional!! I would advice you all to purchase. Yes it is a little pricey but worth every penny</li>
            <li> Best blow dryer I have ever had!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer for a few months now and it&#x27;s fantastic. I have loooooong thick frizzy hair and has cut my drying time in half. Comes in a fancy box, looks nice and shiny and does the job. Since it&#x27;s a professional tool, it has an extra long cord, which i like. It&#x27;s not super big so i&#x27;ve even packed it in my carry on for vacation (it&#x27;s not exactly small either, but it was worth to bring it with me and not have to use the little dryer the hotel offers).</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is so sleek powerful, well made and easy to handle. I hope to get many years of use out of and would purchase another without a question.</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer.  It takes less time for me to dry my hair. I would highly recommend this product to any one looking for an above average hair dryer</li>
            <li> if you want your hair straight and dried faster, GET THIS!!!!&lt;br /&gt;you won&#x27;t be sorry&lt;br /&gt;It BLOWS you STRAIGHT****************Yeh&lt;br /&gt;BUY THIS</li>
            <li> I work for a salon that provides you with everything but your shears and I HATED the blow dryer they provide. I went to Cosmoprof and saw that this model was on sale and I decided to give it a shot thinking &amp;#34;if I hate it I can always trade it in and get something else&amp;#34; and since this was one of the more expensive models I&#x27;d get a small refund as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first client I had I noticed a huge difference, no frizzy hair and it does the job in half of the time than my other blowdryer. (Also, to fellow cosmetologists, I recommend the power styler from Daroko to use with your blowdryer)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely a case of &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;. This blow dryer is worth the money. If you are ok the beauty industry this is a great investment.</li>
            <li> The dryer worked fine for about a month then it caught on fire. It was not the electrical cord but the inside of the dryer  that was on fire. If it had been closer to my head my hair would have been on fire.</li>
            <li> I never thought I&#x27;d spend this much on a hair drier of all things and if you ask me in person I&#x27;d plead the fifth before telling you how much I spent on it. That said, for me it&#x27;s worth every penny. I&#x27;ve been using this baby for three months now twice a day. Prior to that I was using a hair drier that retailed for ~$100 which performed well but it doesn&#x27;t come close to the Babyliss Volare V2. I love three things about this drier:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Shine: I use good old Dove shampoo and conditioner, the cheap stuff. My hair&#x27;s never looked better. My hair is soft and shiny and not drier-burned like it was with the previous hair drier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Air flow: whether Ferrari is just an advertising point or not, there&#x27;s no question that this hair drier MOVES AIR. The air is very concentrated and reminds me of a domestically-safe jet engine packaged in a hair drier. Every other hair drier feels diffused after using the Volare V2. I use mine without any of the plastic attachments. I have hair that is shoulder length or longer and I blow dry with just the drier and my hands-- no comb or styling products. It took a few days to figure out how to blow dry my hair and get the style I wanted but once that was figured out it&#x27;s just plug and play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Size: I love the compact size. Don&#x27;t know why but I&#x27;m just tickled by the size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend to anyone crazy enough to spend ~$150 on a hair drier.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t help but to brag about this to everyone. This hair dryer works so good and dries hair super fast. It is heavy though so don&#x27;t drop it on your toe like I did! Love all the settings it has.</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer.  It does the best job.  And isn&#x27;t too heavy either.  Only hair dryer you&#x27;ll ever need.</li>
            <li> Best blowdryer I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li> I hardly ever write reviews of products -- I can&#x27;t even remember the last one I wrote. However, I&#x27;m pretty inspired right now. This dryer has cut my styling time to less than half of what it&#x27;s always been. It&#x27;s not frizzy, so I&#x27;m not doing tons of follow-up flat-ironing. And, the most important part is that my ridiculously thick hair is completely dry when I&#x27;m finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, it remains to be seen how long this hairdryer will hold up, but for now, I&#x27;m pretty sure this is the best purchase I&#x27;ve made in years.</li>
            <li> I have thick, long hair and this was recommended by my hair stylist. It is very powerful and dries my hair more quickly than anything I have bought before.  I would highly recommend this.</li>
