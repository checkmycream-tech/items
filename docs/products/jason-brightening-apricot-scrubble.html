            <li>and they do not feel effective to me.  </li>
            <li>I liked St/</li>
            <li>I love the product and am very happy I can get it here,  however if you use it too much it actually clogs your pores.</li>
            <li>This scrub is better than St Ives and doesn&#x27;t support a company I don&#x27;t believe in.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>

            <li>it just exfoliates my face better</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>What more is there to say?</li>
            <li>This is a better and safer product for me and for the environment.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably continue to use it until either I find something better or until the price goes up.</li>
            <li>This is the BEST facial scrub ever!</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>and I love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a replacement for another prominent brand when I learned that they conduct animal testing.  </li>
            <li>and I love the apricot smell.  </li>
            <li>The best thing about it is that it doesn&#x27;t collect in our water systems, lakes and oceans (like many facial scrub products with those plastic beads)!</li>
            <li>Skin is now glowing with love.</li>
            <li>The scent is lovely and relaxing.</li>
            <li>Love that it makes the face feel nice and clean without drying it out.  </li>
            <li>I am pregnant and i love that it is a safe, non-toxic product free of paragons, phthalates and sls.</li>
            <li>Makes your face feel oil free and smooth. :)</li>
            <li>I love the way it exfoliates my skin and leaves it feeling clean.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face really smooth &amp; silky.</li>
            <li>I like their Smooth as Silk shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li>cruelty free.</li>
            <li>I am happy to say, this brand is even nicer than the one I just left.  </li>
            <li>I tried free samples of a product like this that Jason made 20 years ago.</li>
            <li>The wash rinses off my skin cleanly and doesn&#x27;t leave a deposit or film.</li>
            <li>That is hard to do but this stuff is great !!!!.</li>
            <li>Not bad, not bad.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant and the natural beads works for gentle scrubbing.</li>
            <li>I decided to make the switch last month and replaced both my face wash (switched to Burt&#x27;s Bees) and apricot scrub, and I am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>so I liked it more than other brands.</li>
            <li>Good for the oily months of summer AND the dry months of winter.</li>
            <li>This really is a &amp;#34;scrub,&amp;#34; with beads that cleanse and smooth.</li>
            <li>As someone with acne prone skin, I was worried that the lack of chemicals wouldn&#x27;t be able to clear my skin.</li>
            <li>I love how natural this product is.</li>
            <li>No harm done - it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>The micro beads made of apricot seed hulls are natural and safe for the environment.</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li>Had a good scrub to it and left my face feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Leaves face soft, clean smooth</li>
            <li>But still a good alternative to other products</li>
            <li>It has a very pleasant smell and the little bits of apricot pit are exfoliating and much better for the environment than cleansers with little plastic beads.  </li>
            <li>I use it every other shower, and my skin is nice and soft :)</li>
            <li>I was in search for a cruelty free, sulfate free scrub that wouldn&#x27;t irritate my skin; I finally found one!</li>
            <li>I used it growing up in Hawaii and just recently found it on Amazon : )  </li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t ever sure if it was actually doing anything, but I did it anyways because I have acne prone skin</li>
            <li>This is a good product from a great brand, but it&#x27;s not gentle enough to use everyday.</li>
            <li>My skin is super soft and glows like the sun!</li>
            <li>Skin feels very soft and fresh.</li>
            <li>Clean feeling, but not dry!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive but works very well.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Cleans well, and is gentle despite the scrub.</li>
            <li>I feel it would be to much for my skin otherwise.</li>
            <li>I use this on my face to really polish it.</li>
            <li>We really l ike this face wash.  </li>
            <li>no longer get much acne.</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way, it feels great &amp;</li>
            <li>My face feels much cleaner after using my new products and as of</li>
            <li>because it was super scrubby, this one is similar, but not as grainy.</li>
            <li>This product is the same but only ever better.</li>
            <li>It leaves your face feeling fresh and clean without a harsh drying effect.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have had no issues.  </li>
            <li>It gets rid of dead skin and leaves my face so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I refer its natural ingredient list over St. Ives.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Truth be told, all it&#x27;s got going for it, as far as I&#x27;m concerned, is that it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li>My skin is so much softer overall as well.</li>
            <li>natural.</li>
            <li>This is a natural wash, so I can use it often without worrying about chemicals.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve never liked animal-testing, but I&#x27;ve not been able to afford the friendlier products until recently.  </li>
            <li>No other apricot scrub comes close to this.</li>
            <li>Turns out all the chemicals have been drying out my skin enough for me to not have problems with the oil, so this natural product thing has been a learning experience.</li>
            <li>I do wish they would of left it truly natural.</li>
            <li>The grains are pretty big and sharp.  </li>
            <li>This is a little more scrubby - in a harsh way - than I wish it was.  </li>
            <li>I take my face super seriously as its sensitive, and this will now be my go-to cleanser.</li>
            <li>For the price its worth it and this little bottle goes a long way</li>
            <li>Just got it a few days ago and used it for the first time last night.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m half black, half white, so my skin does tend to be oily.</li>
            <li> I use this as an alternative to St. IVES because it does not have added scent or other irritants that aggravate your skin.</li>
            <li> the other brand, it felt like I was washing my face with grainy cream ...</li>
            <li> It helps get rid of flaky skin and black heads.</li>
            <li> The little plastic beads do not break down and are getting into the waterways.  </li>
            <li> Has little walnut scrubbies in it.  </li>
            <li> I have trouble finding a face wash that fulfills these 2 things.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a good product from a great brand, but it&#x27;s not gentle enough to use everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been switching over my makeup and beauty products for companies that don&#x27;t test on animals. As someone with acne prone skin, I was worried that the lack of chemicals wouldn&#x27;t be able to clear my skin. I was wrong! I love how natural this product is. Definitely purchasing this again!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. A little bit goes a long way, it feels great &amp; I refer its natural ingredient list over St. Ives. I had always used April but I believe they disappeared years ago. I take my face super seriously as its sensitive, and this will now be my go-to cleanser.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. I love the product and am very happy I can get it here,  however if you use it too much it actually clogs your pores. This is a product I would recommend to spas that give back massages. An apricot scrub from Jason is wonderful : ) No other apricot scrub comes close to this.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face really smooth &amp; silky.</li>
            <li> Love this scrub!  This scrub is better than St Ives and doesn&#x27;t support a company I don&#x27;t believe in.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It exfoliates just enough to brighten skin while moisturizing and cleansing at the same time. I use this product several times a week if not daily and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I am pregnant and i love that it is a safe, non-toxic product free of paragons, phthalates and sls.</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I use this, its great. Makes your face feel oil free and smooth. :)</li>
            <li> I like this product way better than ST. Ives apricot scrub it just exfoliates my face better</li>
            <li> Love it! It cleanses my face will and doesn&#x27;t cause it to dry out or make me break out. I have trouble finding a face wash that fulfills these 2 things.</li>
            <li> This is a little more scrubby - in a harsh way - than I wish it was.  The grains are pretty big and sharp.  I didn&#x27;t like using it on my face, but it was great to use on my body.  No harm done - it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> Good scrub. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Leaves face soft, clean smooth it feels great. Love it I used in the morning and night. It smells very good.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave any film or residue on my skin, and works well with my Clarisonic. Good for the oily months of summer AND the dry months of winter. Perfect scrub for cruelty-free skin.</li>
            <li> I love the way it exfoliates my skin and leaves it feeling clean. You only need a small amount to do the job.</li>
            <li> Love that it makes the face feel nice and clean without drying it out.  Inexpensive but works very well.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Cleans well, and is gentle despite the scrub. What more is there to say?</li>
            <li> This product has been a wonderful addition to my skincare routine. You should give it a try. A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000QUJ1O0 JASON Brightening Apricot Scrubble, 4 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> Too creamy, not scrubby. I had to return</li>
            <li> The micro beads made of apricot seed hulls are natural and safe for the environment. The wash rinses off my skin cleanly and doesn&#x27;t leave a deposit or film. Steer away from other similar products using plastic.</li>
            <li> This is my standard face wash for the shower that I&#x27;ve been using for years.  I find the apricot bits easier to rinse off in the shower.  It has a very pleasant smell and the little bits of apricot pit are exfoliating and much better for the environment than cleansers with little plastic beads.  I&#x27;ve used the type with plastic beads before and they do not feel effective to me.  The little plastic beads do not break down and are getting into the waterways.  This is a better and safer product for me and for the environment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Jason products for few year now. They use quality ingredients. I like their Smooth as Silk shampoos and conditioners. I like apricot scrub a lot. Skin feels very soft and fresh.</li>
            <li> but have a weird smell, i guess jason have been changing products… so i like this one, but cuz of smell i won&#x27;t buy another one.</li>
            <li> I like this. It works well.  I only need to use a little, tiny bit-I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great item! Great experience!</li>
            <li> Truth be told, all it&#x27;s got going for it, as far as I&#x27;m concerned, is that it&#x27;s natural. Jason doesn&#x27;t test on animals (I checked PETA&#x27;s list). No chemical crap, organic ingredients, decently priced. Not bad, not bad. I used this to replace St. Ives after I found out that it&#x27;s owned by Unilever (they don&#x27;t even bother denying that they test on animals). I liked St/ Ives because it was super scrubby, this one is similar, but not as grainy. I&#x27;m half black, half white, so my skin does tend to be oily. Turns out all the chemicals have been drying out my skin enough for me to not have problems with the oil, so this natural product thing has been a learning experience. Overall, it&#x27;s alright. I have to use a cleanser now to mop up all the excess oil, but I&#x27;m still not worried. I&#x27;ll probably continue to use it until either I find something better or until the price goes up. If it goes above $6, I&#x27;m out.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  I have eczema that can cause redness and itching around my mouth and flaking skin on my nose.  Since using this (about a week), I haven&#x27;t had any problems.  My skin is so much softer overall as well.</li>
            <li> Good product, I will buy again I do wish they would of left it truly natural. But still a good alternative to other products I only use it a couple of times a week. I feel it would be to much for my skin otherwise. Would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My face loves you Jason!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I have eczema and this doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, while cleaning it thoroughly. Also, microbeads are horrible for the environment and this stuff is a great alternative. A+</li>
            <li> I use this as an alternative to St. IVES because it does not have added scent or other irritants that aggravate your skin. I use this on my face to really polish it.For the price its worth it and this little bottle goes a long way (i&#x27;d say if you use it regularly you can get 1-2 months out of it.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST facial scrub ever! I used it growing up in Hawaii and just recently found it on Amazon : )  It gets rid of dead skin and leaves my face so soft and smooth. I follow up with an acne facial wash to prevent any spots. This is a definite must have for every household!!!</li>
            <li> Love this. It helps get rid of flaky skin and black heads. I use it every other shower, and my skin is nice and soft :)</li>
            <li> Clean feeling, but not dry!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few years now and I love the way it makes my skin feel. It is a great price for what you get. I have tried more expensive product and keep coming back to this one.</li>
            <li> We really l ike this face wash.  It leaves your face feeling fresh and clean without a harsh drying effect.</li>
            <li> great on my skin. no longer get much acne. doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out. natural. cruelty free.</li>
            <li> Does a great job at cleansing the pores without being too abrasive.  I have very sensitive skin and have had no issues.  You only need a small amount too so the tube will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for another prominent brand when I learned that they conduct animal testing.  I am happy to say, this brand is even nicer than the one I just left.  I thought I was making a sacrifice ... instead, I discovered something better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the other brand, it felt like I was washing my face with grainy cream ... wasn&#x27;t ever sure if it was actually doing anything, but I did it anyways because I have acne prone skin and when I woke up one morning and saw that my skin was doing relatively well, I became petrified of doing anything to change my then-current regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never liked animal-testing, but I&#x27;ve not been able to afford the friendlier products until recently.  I decided to make the switch last month and replaced both my face wash (switched to Burt&#x27;s Bees) and apricot scrub, and I am very pleased with the results.  My face feels much cleaner after using my new products and as of yet I don&#x27;t see any adverse reactions.</li>
            <li> This really is a &amp;#34;scrub,&amp;#34; with beads that cleanse and smooth.</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant and the natural beads works for gentle scrubbing. I use it once a week on my face and at times, on my body. It cleans well and does not leave any residue.</li>
            <li> I was in search for a cruelty free, sulfate free scrub that wouldn&#x27;t irritate my skin; I finally found one! My skin is super soft and glows like the sun!</li>
            <li> Has little walnut scrubbies in it.  Great exfoliation and I love the apricot smell.  This is a natural wash, so I can use it often without worrying about chemicals.  My husband uses it too!</li>
            <li> Just got it a few days ago and used it for the first time last night. Love that it&#x27;s natural. Had a good scrub to it and left my face feeling soft and smooth. Great product for the price. I will definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li> I tried free samples of a product like this that Jason made 20 years ago. This product is the same but only ever better. That is hard to do but this stuff is great !!!!.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been using the Jason Apricot Scrubble for years. It is great for face and body. The best thing about it is that it doesn&#x27;t collect in our water systems, lakes and oceans (like many facial scrub products with those plastic beads)!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel like velvet. Skin is now glowing with love. The scent is lovely and relaxing. Not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> Good product for your face. It is not so creamy so I liked it more than other brands.</li>
