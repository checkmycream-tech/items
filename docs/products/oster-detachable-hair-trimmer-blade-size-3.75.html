            <li>Plastic comb attachments work better for this length.</li>
            <li>I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I use it regularly and it works perfect.  </li>
            <li>First of all, this blade works great, cuts clean, much better than the plastic attachment.&lt;br</li>

            <li>The blade gets all the fine hair unlike the clip on type.  </li>

            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t love the classic 76.  </li>

            <li>those just occasionally use the 3.75 size blade, it will be just fine.</li>
            <li>I really recommend spending a few more dollars to get the AgION one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Oster and high quality.  </li>
            <li>If this fits your trimmer and is the size you need,  I highly recommend the Oster blades.</li>
            <li>Judging by the color of the metal, the top piece is the same as my other AgIONs, but the bottom one looks like just stainless steel.</li>
            <li>A great addition to the removable cutting head set for my Oster Classic 76 Hair Clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes grooming simple and fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the one I received is not an AgION Collection, so it could be from the old stock.</li>
            <li>I searched the Amazon site and found this one from Quick E Shop selling a couple of dollars less than others.</li>
            <li>, it looks very cool, not like using plastic guard that always left some hair behind, worth every cent of your money, it will last forever in my view.</li>

            <li> The blade is nice and sharp right out of the box and size 3 3/4 makes sure my wife doesn&#x27;t cut my hair too short.</li>
            <li> Good tool I use it as a 4 guard fast and clean cut.it does not snag hair and I use it on my andis</li>
            <li> So much better than the plastic attachments.  The blade gets all the fine hair unlike the clip on type.  You won&#x27;t regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an Oster - what else is there to say!  The blade is well made with no burrs or surface blemishes.  It cuts hair according to the size and attaches to the clippers very easily.</li>
            <li> this is a great product cuts hair very smooth and clean great for all levels of expertise of use .</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love the classic 76.  Cuts great.</li>

            <li> A great addition to the removable cutting head set for my Oster Classic 76 Hair Clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But where&#x27;s the bridge between the size 2 and 3 3/4?  I had to but a comb set to get a #3 for my 10 year old son&#x27;s favorite buzz cut length.  I&#x27;d toss the combs in a heartbeat if a size three clipper blade was available.</li>
            <li> New and on time!! Thanks! Will come in use for many years to come. Will do business with them again.</li>
            <li> I started using right away every day since always reliable. If I had to I&#x27;d order them with no worries</li>
            <li> Not the product I was expecting.  Blade quality leaves a lot to be desired.  Plastic comb attachments work better for this length.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s perfect for giving a great haircut to our son who serves in the military.  This will last us a long time.</li>

I guess I have paid the lesson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those just occasionally use the 3.75 size blade, it will be just fine.I really recommend spending a few more dollars to get the AgION one.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about getting this along with the classic 76 I got too.  I am glad I did.  I use it regularly and it works perfect.  The size is the equivalent of a #4 attachment which is what I use to do the sides of my head.  It&#x27;s great quality, much better than the plastic attachments and is very easy to take on/off.</li>
