            <li>This product works great for me</li>
            <li>Fantastic scent!!!</li>
            <li>I have tried others but this one seems to hold a pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>Good deoderant with a good price.</li>
            <li>love the brand, great price</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and helps alright with sweat.</li>
            <li>Smells really nice.  </li>
            <li>Would repurchase since it does smell good and is cheap!</li>
            <li>I like this Suave deodorant and the scent was nice.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, but I can&#x27;t wear it at work because it doesn&#x27;t work for more than a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>Plus it smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love the turning bottom.</li>
            <li>It goes on nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>It is more like a tween deodorant since the smell is so strong.</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;m more used to a clean scent instead of a floral.</li>
            <li>Glides on smoothly and easily and works well.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really smell like deodorant which is my favorite thing about it!</li>
            <li>Want a different kind next time good price good value bang for buck</li>
            <li>So the ingredience in Suave Sweet Pea and violet needs to be revisited by the makers.</li>
            <li>Not a bad deodorant for the price.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use other Deodorant, love it!!</li>
            <li>It definitely has a nice, mild feminine smell to it.</li>
            <li>fresh</li>
            <li>It definitely keeps me smelling good and feeling dry for close to 24 hours...even after the gym.</li>
            <li>Only wish we could get this brand and the huge variety here in Australia.</li>
            <li>This works just as well and is much cheaper</li>
            <li>Ok was just as I expected.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have a problem with it coming off on my blacks.</li>
            <li>smells good and worth the money compared to other expensive deo sticks :)...</li>
            <li>though anti-perspirants/deodorants are suppose to keep you dry and smelling good, not this product I should have believed the other persons rating</li>
            <li>I feel it could help a little bit better though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK for everyday and around the house.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really a sweater unless I&#x27;m really working out</li>
            <li>do not get confused with the image :)</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve always used Suave in the past but not this Sweet Pea and Violet scent.  </li>
            <li>If I wear too much it does make little balls.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I find that strange because I purchased a different Suave 24-hr Protection Deodorant with a different scent, and that stuff is *</li>
            <li> The only drawback is the scent is a little too overpowering and loud enough to clash with perfume.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure any of them really keep you from sweating.</li>
            <li> and I stayed dry and sweat smelling like powder.</li>
            <li> the product performs as expected.  </li>
            <li> Delivered as expected.</li>
            <li> There is a little moisturizer to it.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it everyday</li>
            <li> I used to be a Secret only girl.</li>
            <li> but when I use this product for everyday use</li>
            <li> not great, wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confused</li>
            <li> Tried it for the price, it is not good for perspiration or odor!!</li>
            <li> I hate the powder smell that comes with Secret deodorants.</li>

            <li> the product performs as expected.  But the scent - yuck.  I will still use it, but wont buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have tried others but this one seems to hold a pleasant scent.  I&#x27;m not sure any of them really keep you from sweating.</li>
            <li> not great, wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li> Smells really nice.  Glides on smoothly and easily and works well.  This product works great for me</li>
            <li> Again Suave I believe to be on my list of stable items - would never be without them.  Only wish we could get this brand and the huge variety here in Australia.</li>
            <li> Tried it for the price, it is not good for perspiration or odor!!</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant my daughter likes to use. So A++</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and helps alright with sweat. I feel it could help a little bit better though. Would repurchase since it does smell good and is cheap!</li>
            <li> will stick to my regular D.O since this one did not work for me. It is more like a tween deodorant since the smell is so strong.</li>
            <li> I like this Suave deodorant and the scent was nice. The only drawback is the scent is a little too overpowering and loud enough to clash with perfume.

            <li> Fantastic scent!!! works fab, do buy and try.....</li>
            <li> Arrived in perfect shape. Thank you!</li>
            <li> love the brand, great price</li>
            <li> My wife loves it everyday</li>
            <li> I used to be a Secret only girl. This works just as well and is much cheaper</li>
            <li> It works; what else can I say.</li>
            <li> This is my preferred brand of deodorant and it works just as advertised. 24 hour protection, even if I&#x27;m moving and sweating. Plus it smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> Ok was just as I expected. Smaller sized. Want a different kind next time good price good value bang for buck</li>
            <li> I love the turning bottom.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really smell like deodorant which is my favorite thing about it! It definitely has a nice, mild feminine smell to it. But not overpowering. I hate the powder smell that comes with Secret deodorants. It goes on nice and smooth. There is a little moisturizer to it. It definitely keeps me smelling good and feeling dry for close to 24 hours...even after the gym. I don&#x27;t really have a problem with it coming off on my blacks. If I wear too much it does make little balls.</li>
            <li> I like smell!!&lt;br /&gt; I can&#x27;t use other Deodorant, love it!!</li>
            <li> Good deoderant with a good price. Delivered as expected.</li>
            <li> It smells nice, but I can&#x27;t wear it at work because it doesn&#x27;t work for more than a couple of hours. I find that strange because I purchased a different Suave 24-hr Protection Deodorant with a different scent, and that stuff is *awesome* and lasts all day. This one just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> smells good and worth the money compared to other expensive deo sticks :)... i like it  and it&#x27;s a pack of two not four ..do not get confused with the image :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confused I though anti-perspirants/deodorants are suppose to keep you dry and smelling good, not this product I should have believed the other persons rating but I&#x27;ve always used Suave in the past but not this Sweet Pea and Violet scent.  For whatever reason when I use this deodorant I sweat mind you I&#x27;m not really a sweater unless I&#x27;m really working out but when I use this product for everyday use I sweat so I tried another deorant from Suave Powder fresh and I stayed dry and sweat smelling like powder. So the ingredience in Suave Sweet Pea and violet needs to be revisited by the makers.</li>
            <li> appreciate a lower cost brand being on subscribe &amp; save</li>
