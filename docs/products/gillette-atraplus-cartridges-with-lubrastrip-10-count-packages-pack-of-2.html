            <li>The head is happy again!</li>
            <li>All products were perfect except the door bin.  </li>
            <li>WEll, I was so HAPPY to find the refills here!</li>
            <li>They work great!</li>
            <li>Of the three the Atra seems to be the best with the Sensor (not Sensor 3 or disposable ones)</li>
            <li>otherwise they are very good on the face.</li>
            <li>Great product I have uses for years.</li>
            <li>Great product, Great Seller</li>
            <li>excellent price from amazon...not a lot more to say...have been using this product for about 20 years....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used most of the Gillette razor/cartridge combos over the years and the AtraPlus is the best of them all.</li>
            <li>I have been using Gillette Atra plus for a good number of years with great results.</li>
            <li>If I ever learn good technique then I will start using a double-edge safety razor, but until then...</li>
            <li>This is a good price for these blades (under subscribe and save)</li>
            <li>I think this is good</li>
            <li>Do they want you to toss a perfectly good razor handle?</li>
            <li>Good price too here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Gives a good close shave.</li>
            <li>you have too look around for sales or on line to get good buys</li>
            <li>The original Gillette blades are the best.  </li>
            <li>I better stock up soon!...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame because it did fit great..</li>
            <li>It is effective without shredding my face.</li>
            <li>I have always liked this design.</li>
            <li>these razor are the best razors ever made the new ones they sell in the stores and pharmacys</li>
            <li>All razors need to be replaced frequently in order to be most effective, so buying them in these packs is the best way.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and these timeless razor blades by Gillette are bar none, the best out there!!  </li>
            <li>I tried many aftermarket brands and the Gillettes are by far the best.  </li>
            <li>The angle of the blade when shaving is very important.  </li>
            <li>Then I looked online and was able to find the 3-blade blades that come with the razor.  </li>
            <li>I could not find these anywhere after we moved, so glad I can still get them here.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve lost track of how many years I&#x27;ve used these razor blades.  </li>
            <li>This is the best double edge blade I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Better than Sensor, better than TracII.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see the point in anything more than two blades, thus I have stuck with this one.</li>
            <li>Glad I did.</li>
            <li>so I wanted to switch to something better and cheaper.  </li>
            <li>Looked at many stores in town searched the web and then went to Amazon and found them.</li>
            <li>Have used the Atra for many years and like it very much so am glad I found refills.</li>
            <li>Used these blades for many years.  </li>
            <li>3 blades are better than 2.  </li>
            <li>LOve these.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product and it arrived promptly.</li>
            <li>I have used these razors for years, and LOVE them...  </li>
            <li>Those kind of razor and blades becoming more and more rare, because of the expansion of those 3 to 5 blades ones, I was really glad to be able to find those here.</li>
            <li>These blades, though a bit cheaper than the generic ones offered on Amazon, are narrower, sharper, and easily the best replacement blade.</li>
            <li>And these blades give me a very clean shave.  </li>
            <li>5... blades when 2 will do just fine for most people.</li>
            <li>I tried some other brands and this one is still the best.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>These Atra blades work fine, but they just can&#x27;t compare to the shave I get from the Mach3.  </li>
            <li>These blades made in China fit my 30 year old Atra razor just fine and give a good shave.</li>
            <li>Those are also available here on Amazon, but not with free shipping.  </li>
            <li>Wish this was still available (still not as of 11/22/14).  </li>
            <li>Used to shave with this blade years ago until Gillette mailed me a free Mach3 in the mail</li>
            <li>I received a free trial disposable five blade from someone, but it did not do as well for me as the Atra</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s come true, but who needs 3... or</li>
            <li>I really wanted to keep using the Atra because the price is much better, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li>While I appreciate a US made product like anyone else, the Personna blades simply didn&#x27;t do as good a job for me.</li>
            <li>Through numerous trials of different sized razors, the twin blade Atra is still the best out there.  </li>
            <li>thanks for the fast service and good value, it seems that the stores don&#x27;t carry this product as much as they use to.</li>
            <li>I could not fine this in the stores I showed at and was happy to purchase it online because the cost of a new razor has increased more than I care to pay</li>
            <li>The blades fit the razor, but they did a real number on my scalp.  </li>
            <li>Order is complete and I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li>These Gillette blades are worth the difference in price.  </li>
            <li>The package recommended Atra blades, so I figured these were the right ones.  </li>
            <li>Price was right and it was convenient.</li>
            <li>right up there as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the new ones, but my skin can&#x27;t handle those multiple blades razor, so I have to downgrade back to Gillette AtraPlus, which worked the best for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The AtraPlus cartridges are far superior to the generic and \\&quot;off brand\\&quot; items.  </li>
            <li>I love the razor and this is the only place I know to get  the blades.</li>
            <li>Evidently, I like them.</li>
            <li>They seem to hold up pretty well too.  </li>
            <li>These blades are what I put into my Headblade, and I have for more than ten years now - ever since I started rockin&#x27;</li>
            <li>Although, I am not sure how much better 4 blades are better than 3.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for about 20 years, or since it first came out.</li>
            <li>(They had like 5 or 6 blades, and did not handle the contours of my face very well!)</li>
            <li>I also tried using the Personna blades sold here on Amazon as well as in many supermarkets, pharmacies, and dollar stores (under various brands).</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, the Lubrastrip works well and is an improvement over the plain Atra blades.    </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need cartridges with five blades - these two blade Atras are perfect, razor sharp, and glide easily in narrow places.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m thrilled I found them on Amazon, for less.</li>
            <li>shop was doing a really fast shipping with \\&quot;Prime\\&quot;, and the product was as described.</li>
            <li>These blades work really well.  </li>
            <li>I use this in my razor and [[ASIN:B000NFEX46 Headblade]], and really have no complaints.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t care much for disposible handles.  </li>
            <li>More blades may mean more irritation for people with sensitive skin, so Mach-3 is the highest I want to go.  </li>
            <li>I have an older Gillette razor which I have been using since the 1970&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>The only thing is they weren&#x27;t shipped quickly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this particular type of cartridge since, oh, 1980 which is when I decided it was time to start shaving again.</li>
            <li>These blades are hard if not impossible to find in stores, so it is much appreciated that they are still available on line.  </li>
            <li>I tried some others that were highly rated on Amazon, and did not like them at all,</li>
            <li>While the Mach 3 wasn&#x27;t bad, anything beyond that had heads that were way too large to be able to effectively shave with.</li>
            <li>Maybe I should rock a new look</li>
            <li>I do not want to get one of those new razors with 5+ blades.</li>
            <li>Because they are available to me only on Amazon and not in my local stores I will continue to buy them here.</li>
            <li>I almost bought some razor blades from this site when I decided to check the local drug store first.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t ever put a razor to my face, ever since I got my first Braun electric way back in the day.  </li>
            <li>Remember the old SNL commercial parody of the &amp;#34;Triple-Trac&amp;#34; when twin blades were first coming out?</li>
            <li>These old-school razor blades are sometimes hard to find in stores, but they work much better than the newer ones.</li>
            <li>They allow me to continue using my old Atra handle and are much cheaper than the current 5-blade cartridges pushed by the companies.</li>
            <li>I have used this cartridge for nearly twenty years.</li>
            <li>They are more and more difficult to find in stores and when you do they are much more expensive than here.</li>
            <li>Too reasonably priced and not enough profit?</li>
            <li>When the Gillette Ultra Super Turbo eXTreme Whisker Clearcutter with 7 blades, or 9!, comes out, maybe then I&#x27;ll switch.</li>
            <li>Left razor burns all over and the back of my head became very scabby after 2 days of use.  </li>
            <li>I have been cursed with a coarse beard and sensitive skin, and I recently came to the conclusion that I will have to shave EVERY day if I want to have a smooth shave with little to no razor bumps &amp; blemishes.  </li>
            <li>They are deadly sharp, and stay sharp and comfortable for longer than I would expect.</li>
            <li>Gillette has apparently stopped making the Atra blades.</li>
            <li>I tried some off brands from a major drug chain and another from a big box retailer.  </li>
            <li>Unlike the Atra, the pivot point of the Mach-3 is at the bottom of the blade: if the angle is wrong, then the Mach-3 will pivot to a better angle; if the pressure is a little too strong, the Mach-3&#x27;s pivot will also correct for that; and if both the pressure and the angle are bad, then the Mach-3 may result in a good shave regardless of how much your shaving technique sucks.    </li>

            <li> Left razor burns all over and the back of my head became very scabby after 2 days of use.  </li>
            <li> I have been cursed with a coarse beard and sensitive skin, and I recently came to the conclusion that I will have to shave EVERY day if I want to have a smooth shave with little to no razor bumps &amp; blemishes.  </li>
            <li> They are deadly sharp, and stay sharp and comfortable for longer than I would expect.</li>
            <li> Gillette has apparently stopped making the Atra blades.</li>
            <li> I tried some off brands from a major drug chain and another from a big box retailer.  </li>
            <li> Unlike the Atra, the pivot point of the Mach-3 is at the bottom of the blade: if the angle is wrong, then the Mach-3 will pivot to a better angle; if the pressure is a little too strong, the Mach-3&#x27;s pivot will also correct for that; and if both the pressure and the angle are bad, then the Mach-3 may result in a good shave regardless of how much your shaving technique sucks.    </li>
            <li> but it does not last long before replacement is necessary.</li>
            <li> All their highly touted &amp;#34;extra-special&amp;#34; extra blades, this-and that which sell for exorbitant prices are no better than these</li>
            <li> The pivot point of the Atra is in the middle of the blade, which acts like a seesaw fulcrum: if you have the right pressure but a slightly wrong angle, the Atra will pivot to a more correct angle and shave well; if you have the wrong pressure but a good angle, it may result in irritation; and if both your pressure and angle are bad (like me), then it may result in irritation with nicks and cuts (and razor burn).    </li>
            <li> These are getting harder to find in local stores.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve been using these Gillette Atra Plus blades for as long as I can remember.  </li>

            <li> Atra blades are much less expensive than most other blades (e.g., Fusion), but it just doesn&#x27;t work for me...</li>

            <li> These razor blades are getting harder and harder to find and my husband loves his razor that uses these.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other razors &amp; blades a handful of times over the last 30 years and was never impressed enough to change:</li>
            <li> 2-pack is a steal, 20 blades for a lot less than what I pay when I buy them in stores - IF I can find them.  </li>
            <li> Lately, I was tired of paying the price for the Mach3 blades, so I found an Atra handle online and ordered these blades, which are much cheaper than the Mach3.  </li>
            <li> I noticed similar irritation when I used the Sensor two-blade razor, and I think that the reason was due to the pivot point and my poor technique.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Remember the old SNL commercial parody of the &amp;#34;Triple-Trac&amp;#34; when twin blades were first coming out? It&#x27;s come true, but who needs 3... or 5... blades when 2 will do just fine for most people. These are getting harder to find in local stores.</li>
            <li> These blades made in China fit my 30 year old Atra razor just fine and give a good shave. Surprisingly, the Lubrastrip works well and is an improvement over the plain Atra blades.    Why am I sticking with using only 2 blades at once when I could be using 5 blades at once? It&#x27;s not enough difference in blade count. When the Gillette Ultra Super Turbo eXTreme Whisker Clearcutter with 7 blades, or 9!, comes out, maybe then I&#x27;ll switch.</li>
            <li> I bought these blades as replacement blades after I used up the 4 blades that came with my HeadBlade.  The package recommended Atra blades, so I figured these were the right ones.  The blades fit the razor, but they did a real number on my scalp.  Left razor burns all over and the back of my head became very scabby after 2 days of use.  Then I looked online and was able to find the 3-blade blades that come with the razor.  They are more than 2x as expensive as the Atra blades, but your head will thank you for it.  Those are also available here on Amazon, but not with free shipping.  I found them at the local Walgreens for approximately the same price and saved on the shipping.  The head is happy again!</li>
            <li> I could not find these anywhere after we moved, so glad I can still get them here. I tried purchasing two other razors for my husband and he only likes this one!</li>
            <li> I love the razor and this is the only place I know to get  the blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lost track of how many years I&#x27;ve used these razor blades.  Maybe 40?  At least.  Evidently, I like them.</li>
            <li> These are some of the sharpest and longest lasting blades Gillette ever made in the two blade configuration. Because they are available to me only on Amazon and not in my local stores I will continue to buy them here.</li>
            <li> I have used this cartridge for nearly twenty years. This is the best double edge blade I have ever used. Better than Sensor, better than TracII. They are deadly sharp, and stay sharp and comfortable for longer than I would expect. I don&#x27;t see the point in anything more than two blades, thus I have stuck with this one.</li>
            <li> excellent price from amazon...not a lot more to say...have been using this product for about 20 years....</li>
            <li> These razor blades are getting harder and harder to find and my husband loves his razor that uses these.  Will continue ordering until we can no longer get them.</li>
            <li> These blades are hard if not impossible to find in stores, so it is much appreciated that they are still available on line.  They allow me to continue using my old Atra handle and are much cheaper than the current 5-blade cartridges pushed by the companies.</li>
            <li> Those kind of razor and blades becoming more and more rare, because of the expansion of those 3 to 5 blades ones, I was really glad to be able to find those here. I&#x27;ve tried the new ones, but my skin can&#x27;t handle those multiple blades razor, so I have to downgrade back to Gillette AtraPlus, which worked the best for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shop was doing a really fast shipping with \\&quot;Prime\\&quot;, and the product was as described. So now I know where I can order those blades when I need them. Hopefully, this shop will offers this product for a long long time though.</li>
            <li> You can buy a 10 pack of these razor blades at Walgreens for $15.95.  I almost bought some razor blades from this site when I decided to check the local drug store first.  Glad I did.</li>
            <li> I have been cursed with a coarse beard and sensitive skin, and I recently came to the conclusion that I will have to shave EVERY day if I want to have a smooth shave with little to no razor bumps &amp; blemishes.  I&#x27;ve been using Mach-3 blades for a some time with mediocre results -- maybe because I haven&#x27;t been shaving every day -- so I wanted to switch to something better and cheaper.  Atra blades are much less expensive than most other blades (e.g., Fusion), but it just doesn&#x27;t work for me... and I think I may know why: my shaving technique sucks.    The angle of the blade when shaving is very important.  The pivot point of the Atra is in the middle of the blade, which acts like a seesaw fulcrum: if you have the right pressure but a slightly wrong angle, the Atra will pivot to a more correct angle and shave well; if you have the wrong pressure but a good angle, it may result in irritation; and if both your pressure and angle are bad (like me), then it may result in irritation with nicks and cuts (and razor burn).    Unlike the Atra, the pivot point of the Mach-3 is at the bottom of the blade: if the angle is wrong, then the Mach-3 will pivot to a better angle; if the pressure is a little too strong, the Mach-3&#x27;s pivot will also correct for that; and if both the pressure and the angle are bad, then the Mach-3 may result in a good shave regardless of how much your shaving technique sucks.    More blades may mean more irritation for people with sensitive skin, so Mach-3 is the highest I want to go.  If there is a (cheaper) two-blade razor with a bottom pivot, then I will try it.  I noticed similar irritation when I used the Sensor two-blade razor, and I think that the reason was due to the pivot point and my poor technique.  I really wanted to keep using the Atra because the price is much better, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.  If I ever learn good technique then I will start using a double-edge safety razor, but until then... it&#x27;s Mach-3 for me.</li>
            <li> These blades work really well.  I can&#x27;t use an electric razor.  I have to use blades.  And these blades give me a very clean shave.  They seem to hold up pretty well too.  I recommend them.</li>
            <li> Been using these blades for 30 years now and it&#x27;s the only one my face can take!  I would recommend!</li>
            <li> These are the only cartridges my husband uses. It can be difficult to find them but Amazon always comes through for many products. They were well packaged and I will continue to order them.</li>
            <li> Husband loves these razor blades.  They are more and more difficult to find in stores and when you do they are much more expensive than here.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ve been using these Gillette Atra Plus blades for as long as I can remember.  I don&#x27;t ever put a razor to my face, ever since I got my first Braun electric way back in the day.  But I shave my head every other day.  These blades are what I put into my Headblade, and I have for more than ten years now - ever since I started rockin&#x27; the shaved head look.  (Damn, ten years?  Maybe I should rock a new look already?)&lt;br /&gt;This 2-pack is a steal, 20 blades for a lot less than what I pay when I buy them in stores - IF I can find them.  And that&#x27;s the thing.  These are hard to come by sometimes&gt;  So I&#x27;m thrilled I found them on Amazon, for less.</li>
            <li> Looked at many stores in town searched the web and then went to Amazon and found them. Have used the Atra for many years and like it very much so am glad I found refills. I tried some other brands and this one is still the best.</li>
            <li> I use this in my razor and [[ASIN:B000NFEX46 Headblade]], and really have no complaints.  All razors need to be replaced frequently in order to be most effective, so buying them in these packs is the best way.  Throw in the subscription discount, and you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> Great product I have uses for years. It is effective without shredding my face. Easy to use. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> It appears they stopped making and selling the AtraPlus blades --- I and my face take a beating without this razor</li>
            <li> This is a good price for these blades (under subscribe and save) when compared to Walmart, Rite Aid, etc.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need cartridges with five blades - these two blade Atras are perfect, razor sharp, and glide easily in narrow places.  Through numerous trials of different sized razors, the twin blade Atra is still the best out there.  These blades, though a bit cheaper than the generic ones offered on Amazon, are narrower, sharper, and easily the best replacement blade.</li>
            <li> I have an older Gillette razor which I have been using since the 1970&#x27;s. It is all metal, works well and was a gift from my father-in-law. I see no reason to get another razor. I bought these AtraPlus cartridges from Amazon, because this time when I ran out I could not find them in the stores I regularly visit.</li>
            <li> Used these blades for many years.  Wish this was still available (still not as of 11/22/14).  Price was right and it was convenient.</li>
            <li> Great product, Great Seller</li>
            <li> I STARTED MY HUSBAND ON THESE BLADES YEARS AGO AND THEY ARE GETTING TO HARD TO FIND, EVEN AT WALMART, THEY ARE ALWAYS ON WAITLIST, EXPENSIVE TOO!!!  THX</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and these timeless razor blades by Gillette are bar none, the best out there!!  Go order them and you will see for yourself</li>
            <li> Used to shave with this blade years ago until Gillette mailed me a free Mach3 in the mail (those dirty bums! ha ha).  Lately, I was tired of paying the price for the Mach3 blades, so I found an Atra handle online and ordered these blades, which are much cheaper than the Mach3.  These Atra blades work fine, but they just can&#x27;t compare to the shave I get from the Mach3.  3 blades are better than 2.  Although, I am not sure how much better 4 blades are better than 3.</li>
            <li> LOve these.  The only thing is they weren&#x27;t shipped quickly and I had to shave.  I think this is good</li>
            <li> All products were perfect except the door bin.  The bin arrived broke. It&#x27;s a shame because it did fit great..</li>
            <li> thanks for the fast service and good value, it seems that the stores don&#x27;t carry this product as much as they use to.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product and it arrived promptly. Cartridges for ATRA razors were easy to find but the razor was almost impossible to locate. Amazon. com came thru again! Order is complete and I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I have been shopping in the local stores and cannot find the refills for my husband&#x27;s razor. Do they want you to toss a perfectly good razor handle? WEll, I was so HAPPY to find the refills here! They work great!</li>
            <li> I received a free trial disposable five blade from someone, but it did not do as well for me as the Atra Plus. The Atra plus gave me a sharper edge and a smoother shave. I have used this product for about 20 years, or since it first came out.</li>
            <li> The original Gillette blades are the best.  I have been using this configuartion of blades for shaving since 1979.  I tried many aftermarket brands and the Gillettes are by far the best.  Good price too here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> These old-school razor blades are sometimes hard to find in stores, but they work much better than the newer ones.</li>
            <li> I have used these razors for years, and LOVE them...  I tried some others that were highly rated on Amazon, and did not like them at all, (They had like 5 or 6 blades, and did not handle the contours of my face very well!), so I am thankful that I can still buy these Lubra-strip razors on-line...  I better stock up soon!...</li>
            <li> I could not fine this in the stores I showed at and was happy to purchase it online because the cost of a new razor has increased more than I care to pay and I don&#x27;t care much for disposible handles.  I just like the close shave I get with this product and hope to have enough cartridges to last for some time.</li>
            <li> I should have kept count.  I&#x27;ve been using this particular type of cartridge since, oh, 1980 which is when I decided it was time to start shaving again. And I&#x27;m still using the same metal razor -- big kudos to Gillette for that in itself!!  I&#x27;ve tried other razors &amp; blades a handful of times over the last 30 years and was never impressed enough to change: twin blades, triple blades, quad blades, 82 blades, etc.  This twin works for my face  and my way of shaving, and that&#x27;s the part that counts.  TV ads for other brands don&#x27;t persuade me to consider a change of razor.</li>
            <li> Amazon is the only place I could find razor blades for my razors.  I think Atra has stopped making these razor blades.  I still use my Atra razor, which I purchased almost 20 years ago.</li>
            <li> Hard to find product. May be discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product forever but it does not last long before replacement is necessary.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used most of the Gillette razor/cartridge combos over the years and the AtraPlus is the best of them all. While the Mach 3 wasn&#x27;t bad, anything beyond that had heads that were way too large to be able to effectively shave with. I went back to a two blade system trying the Sensor, Trac II and the Atra types. Of the three the Atra seems to be the best with the Sensor (not Sensor 3 or disposable ones) right up there as well. I also tried using the Personna blades sold here on Amazon as well as in many supermarkets, pharmacies, and dollar stores (under various brands). While I appreciate a US made product like anyone else, the Personna blades simply didn&#x27;t do as good a job for me.</li>
            <li> Gillette has apparently stopped making the Atra blades. Too reasonably priced and not enough profit? All their highly touted &amp;#34;extra-special&amp;#34; extra blades, this-and that which sell for exorbitant prices are no better than these but sadly these seem to be a soon to be thing of the past. I bought what I could afford.&lt;br /&gt;I may have to give up shaving.</li>
            <li> Gives a good close shave. I have been using these for several years, never had any issues. x x x</li>
            <li> these razor are the best razors ever made the new ones they sell in the stores and pharmacys are too expensive and they irratatre the skin  atra blade should continue selling these blades the are getting a little expensive at times you have too look around for sales or on line to get good buys otherwise they are very good on the face.</li>
            <li> The AtraPlus cartridges are far superior to the generic and \\&quot;off brand\\&quot; items.  I tried some off brands from a major drug chain and another from a big box retailer.  Both were very hard on my face.  These Gillette blades are worth the difference in price.  And Amazon manages to get me pricing that I can&#x27;t match in the big box stores for the Gillette brand.</li>
            <li> IVE BEEN USING THEM FOR LONGER THAN I WISH TO REMEMBER AND THEY ARE NOT CARRIED BY THE USUAL OUTLETS ANYMORE THANK YOU FOR BEING A RELIABLE SOURCE FOR ME IM 84 AND NEED ALL THE HELP I CAN GETCHARLES BRADY</li>
            <li> I have always liked this design. Thin enough to get into those tight places. They stay sharp for a long time. I do not want to get one of those new razors with 5+ blades. They are rediculous.</li>
            <li> I have been using Gillette Atra plus for a good number of years with great results.The shaves are alway close.</li>
