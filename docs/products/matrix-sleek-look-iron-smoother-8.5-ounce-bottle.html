            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>The smell of this is amazing.  </li>
            <li>but I feel kind of jipped.</li>
            <li>Better price than in a salon, helps straighten curly/wavy hair and also gives a nice sheen.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of the products... love them!  </li>
            <li>have noticed that most iron smoothers have some type of oil in them, but this does not.  </li>
            <li>so there&#x27;s none of the crunchy feeling, and it does an ok job of repelling humidity.</li>
            <li>It keeps your hair straight for days - and it smells great too.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Matrix for years and love it.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>After hair is done it leaves a nice smooth look.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and GREAT price:):)</li>
            <li>Love the product</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I found a product I like.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product!</li>
            <li>and I knew I needed to get more.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great for anyone living in high humidity areas like Florida!  </li>
            <li>My hair is so smooth!</li>
            <li>This product I believe is the replacement for Matrix Vavoom Gold Heat - which is the best flat iron protector in the world.</li>
            <li>Love this product for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>Great product for naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>Also, throughout the day my hair got tangled easily</li>
            <li>Holds your curls perfectly without making them feel heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li>It protects my hair while straightening, adds shine, and smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>Have used it and pleased with results that were different than my original quest, but good product.</li>
            <li>It works great for flat ironing my hair!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with that, so I give this 5 stars.</li>
            <li>It didnt smell as much as my original bottle either,</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s ok, too much hold</li>
            <li>I love the Matrix products and the iron smoother has always worked very well for me.  </li>
            <li>was seeking another product, but this one is good also, just different.  </li>
            <li>and I have the most straight sleek hair</li>
            <li>Every couple of days, I do a quick cleaning of those styling tools with a cotton ball doused in rubbing alcohol.  </li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m low on the iron smoother spray, I came to Amazon knowing I&#x27;d find a good price and have it shipped right to my door.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>It protects your hair from the damage caused by styling irons as well as keeps it smooth and straight.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found thus far, but wishing I could do better</li>
            <li>it was not as good as expected from a Matrix product.</li>
            <li>right before Christmas was a bonus.</li>
            <li>However I didn&#x27;t really see how denatured alcohol (probably used so the product dries quickly) and a bunch of words that I don&#x27;t know what they are can protect my hair.</li>
            <li>I really like this product!  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for several years &amp; love it.  </li>
            <li>I live in a rural area and it was nice to find it for sale online.</li>
            <li>Love the way it smoothes through the flat iron.</li>
            <li>In case you&#x27;re interested in a curly-haired girl&#x27;s quest for straight flat-ironed hair:    I&#x27;ve also tried:</li>
            <li>After my hair is dry, I spritz it with this product, making sure that I get underneath as well.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you let your hair completely dry after spraying it with this.</li>
            <li>I found it to be more comparable to hairspray rather than a &amp;#34;smoother.&amp;#34;  The product uses the terms sleek and smooth but the more accurate description is dull and stiff.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair with a rougher texture, which it definitely needs because it is so fine and thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>VP/VA Copolymer prohibits your hair from absorbing moisture (therefore avoiding frizzies).</li>
            <li>crazy sleek - best</li>
            <li>Fast service</li>
            <li>Nice hold without that sticky stiff feeling</li>
            <li>Overall, I really enjoy this product for rainy days (there were 40 mph winds and gushing down rain, and my hair was still straight and frizz free!)</li>
            <li>This product is amazing when it comes to humidity.... as long as you wash your hair daily.</li>
            <li>Regular hair sprays work fine, but most are too heavy and make the hair stiffish.  </li>
            <li>Cannot live without this product!</li>
            <li>I do not have the bottle in front of me, but I think the main ingredient is alcohol.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a hair product that will leave flat ironed hair smooth, soft and resistant to humidity stay away.</li>
            <li>You have to spray sections of your hair individually as you straighten, because if you spray your whole head then your hair will get crisp before straightening it.   </li>
            <li>I blow dry most mornings and then flat iron in sections spraying each section with a protector spray.</li>
            <li>have experimented with several other hair products, but this is definitely my favorite.  </li>
            <li>so you get a bit of that crunchy feeling, not very good at repelling humidity, not terrible though.   </li>
            <li>I appreciate the competitive price and fast shipping, but clearly the packaging left something to be desired.  </li>
            <li>It has no-hold, leaves your hair soft and smooth-running your fingers through your hair is a dream-</li>
            <li>Because I have coarse, very frizzy hair</li>
            <li>I was surprised when they took it off the market, but I can still get it</li>
            <li>I have hair that is frizzy and naturally curly.</li>
            <li>The only thing I have ever used that really works to help this problem is this stuff.</li>
            <li>I usually wash every two days and try to get the most out of my straightened hair, but this product made my hair feel gross immediately.</li>
            <li>I mainly use this as a protectant for my hair from the heat of the flat iron.</li>
            <li>At first it may seem that it just makes your hair look wet and matted, but after a few brushes through it, it eventually makes my hair super shiny and sleek looking.</li>
            <li>I use it on my bangs every day when I blow dry them, and it keeps them straight and protected.</li>
            <li>It definitely makes my hair much, much straighter and smoother while flat ironing.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty hard to make your hair greasy by using to much.</li>
            <li>Complete fan of Matrix and their entire line of products ...</li>
            <li>The whole process takes less than a minute, and prevents the build up.</li>

            <li> /&gt;This does leave a residue on my curling iron and flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Smoothes &amp; protects my hair from the flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have VERY thin and fine hair, and I have to be extra careful how I style it.  </li>
            <li> It takes about 2 minutes for the product to naturally dry.  </li>
            <li> I apply it on my dry hair and then straighten it.</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer said, you only have to use a tiny bit of this product for it to work or your hair will feel sticky and not smooth.</li>
            <li> A little does alot; so be careful as too much product can make your hair stiff.  </li>
            <li> I think the cap became loose in shipping.  </li>
            <li> but you can still find it occasionally on the web, black bottle gold nozzle.</li>
            <li> The liquid in the bottle is about an inch and a half from the top now, so I lost some of the product in transit - which is disappointing.  </li>
            <li> The only ingredient that does it for me is the very last one (ingredient with the least amount in the product), the silk amino acids.    </li>
            <li> I use this spray on my wet hair, and when it dries, and doesn&#x27;t have the poofy, frizzy style that happens without it.</li>
            <li> It was in a plastic bag, but the inside was all wet and sticky.  </li>
            <li> He needs something for his thin, flyaway hair and he really likes this product.</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling terrible and actually produced more fly-aways than without it.  </li>
            <li> It is easier to use compared to other products like this</li>
            <li> The thing is - I&#x27;ve even ordered this same product online in the past and didn&#x27;t have this leak issue then.  </li>
            <li> I let them heat up for about 30 seconds, unplug them, and then carefully wipe down the metal parts with the alcohol saturated cotton ball.  </li>
            <li> I comb through my hair with a wide-tooth comb, and then style it as usual with a curling iron and flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I have very coarse, thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> Sodium Citrate is used to keep the acidity down in the product.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair crunchy and it&#x27;s hard to get the flat iron through after spraying it.</li>
            <li> My hair salon does not sell it, so I typically buy it here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I wash my hair as usual, apply a bit of mousse, and blow dry as usual.  </li>
            <li> It did not smooth nor condition my hair.</li>
            <li> It says it is heat flammable if you use your flat iron with it when wet (scary).    </li>
            <li> It is so disappointing that matrix doesn&#x27;t have a new equivalent.     </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also hard to wash out.    </li>
            <li> , at least this one doesn&#x27;t have any hold</li>
            <li> I am cacasian with thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> this one is not good.  </li>
            <li> The product has an alcohol base to it, so it&#x27;s clear there is hairspray in there that proved to be quite sticky on surfaces that the spray reached.</li>
            <li> I was not happy.</li>
            <li> I like the product but the package is poor quality</li>
            <li> but on days where the weather is unlikely to have an impact I doubt I will use it.</li>
            <li> When I got it, it was opened and had weird debris in it.  </li>
            <li> None of the ingredients were toxic or dangerous.    </li>
            <li> I paid $18 for it at a salon and was sorely disappointed when I tried it.  </li>
            <li> I just wish it was a spray, it&#x27;s annoying pumping a bit on my hands and working it into each section of hair.</li>

            <li> I have been using Matrix Sleek Look Iron Smoother for a couple of years.  My hair salon does not sell it, so I typically buy it here on Amazon.  I have VERY thin and fine hair, and I have to be extra careful how I style it.  Otherwise, my scalp shows through quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have experimented with several other hair products, but this is definitely my favorite.  I wash my hair as usual, apply a bit of mousse, and blow dry as usual.  After my hair is dry, I spritz it with this product, making sure that I get underneath as well.  It takes about 2 minutes for the product to naturally dry.  I comb through my hair with a wide-tooth comb, and then style it as usual with a curling iron and flat iron.  After I am finished, I follow up with my regular hair spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that most iron smoothers have some type of oil in them, but this does not.  I do not have the bottle in front of me, but I think the main ingredient is alcohol.  It leaves my hair with a rougher texture, which it definitely needs because it is so fine and thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does leave a residue on my curling iron and flat iron.  Every couple of days, I do a quick cleaning of those styling tools with a cotton ball doused in rubbing alcohol.  I let them heat up for about 30 seconds, unplug them, and then carefully wipe down the metal parts with the alcohol saturated cotton ball.  The whole process takes less than a minute, and prevents the build up.</li>
            <li> This is a great product</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer said, you only have to use a tiny bit of this product for it to work or your hair will feel sticky and not smooth. It definitely makes my hair much, much straighter and smoother while flat ironing. I have very coarse, thick curly hair. Make sure you let your hair completely dry after spraying it with this. It says it is heat flammable if you use your flat iron with it when wet (scary).    I mainly use this as a protectant for my hair from the heat of the flat iron. However I didn&#x27;t really see how denatured alcohol (probably used so the product dries quickly) and a bunch of words that I don&#x27;t know what they are can protect my hair. The only ingredient that does it for me is the very last one (ingredient with the least amount in the product), the silk amino acids.    So, I decided to look up all of the ingredients in the product. I&#x27;m definitely not a chemist; this was just found by googling so don&#x27;t hold me to this.    VP/VA Copolymer prohibits your hair from absorbing moisture (therefore avoiding frizzies). Potassium Dimethicone PEG 7 Panthenyl Phosphate gives your hair softness and silkiness without being greasy. Polyurethane 6 looks like another hairspray or bonding type product. Can&#x27;t find out what PEG 40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil is, but I&#x27;m assuming an oil would be another hair softener. Methyl Gluceth 20 is an emollient which is a humectant and gives a smooth/gentle feel to the hair. Sodium Citrate is used to keep the acidity down in the product. Lysine Hydrochloride is one of the essential amino acids that the body needs for building proteins. None of the ingredients were toxic or dangerous.    I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with that, so I give this 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Great product for naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of products over the years... this one is not good.  I paid $18 for it at a salon and was sorely disappointed when I tried it.  It left my hair feeling terrible and actually produced more fly-aways than without it.  I found it to be more comparable to hairspray rather than a &amp;#34;smoother.&amp;#34;  The product uses the terms sleek and smooth but the more accurate description is dull and stiff.</li>
            <li> This product is basically hair spray. If you are looking for a hair product that will leave flat ironed hair smooth, soft and resistant to humidity stay away. I am cacasian with thick wavy hair. I blow dry most mornings and then flat iron in sections spraying each section with a protector spray. This product leaves my hair crunchy and it&#x27;s hard to get the flat iron through after spraying it. Even though it says it protects against humidity, I think it attracts water from the air, which makes it feel sticky. It&#x27;s also hard to wash out.    This product I believe is the replacement for Matrix Vavoom Gold Heat - which is the best flat iron protector in the world. It has no-hold, leaves your hair soft and smooth-running your fingers through your hair is a dream- and it&#x27;s pretty hard to make your hair greasy by using to much. it&#x27;s discontinued but you can still find it occasionally on the web, black bottle gold nozzle. It is so disappointing that matrix doesn&#x27;t have a new equivalent.     In case you&#x27;re interested in a curly-haired girl&#x27;s quest for straight flat-ironed hair:    I&#x27;ve also tried: chi 44 iron guard - it&#x27;s ok, too much hold so you get a bit of that crunchy feeling, not very good at repelling humidity, not terrible though.   Got2b crazy sleek - best I&#x27;ve found thus far, but wishing I could do better, at least this one doesn&#x27;t have any hold so there&#x27;s none of the crunchy feeling, and it does an ok job of repelling humidity. I just wish it was a spray, it&#x27;s annoying pumping a bit on my hands and working it into each section of hair.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing when it comes to humidity.... as long as you wash your hair daily. Because I have coarse, very frizzy hair I usually wash every two days and try to get the most out of my straightened hair, but this product made my hair feel gross immediately. Also, throughout the day my hair got tangled easily so I had to keep a brush on me at work (not somehting I have ever had to do before). The product has an alcohol base to it, so it&#x27;s clear there is hairspray in there that proved to be quite sticky on surfaces that the spray reached. You have to spray sections of your hair individually as you straighten, because if you spray your whole head then your hair will get crisp before straightening it.   Overall, I really enjoy this product for rainy days (there were 40 mph winds and gushing down rain, and my hair was still straight and frizz free!) but on days where the weather is unlikely to have an impact I doubt I will use it.</li>
            <li> I really like this product!  It protects your hair from the damage caused by styling irons as well as keeps it smooth and straight.  A little does alot; so be careful as too much product can make your hair stiff.  It keeps your hair straight for days - and it smells great too.  Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Cant find this in stores anymore! Love it!</li>
            <li> Smells really good and holds ur curl.</li>
            <li> I love the Matrix products and the iron smoother has always worked very well for me.  I live in a rural area and it was nice to find it for sale online.</li>
            <li> Complete fan of Matrix and their entire line of products ... Nice hold without that sticky stiff feeling</li>
            <li> Regular hair sprays work fine, but most are too heavy and make the hair stiffish.  The salon where I&#x27;d always found this product, has changed management and no longer has it.  SO, rather than run all over the county trying to get it, I found it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I color my hair; I&#x27;m older so my cleverly hidden greys are wiry.  Matrix Sleek Look Smoother keeps me looking gorgeous!</li>
            <li> was seeking another product, but this one is good also, just different.  Have used it and pleased with results that were different than my original quest, but good product.</li>
            <li> Product smells great and works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Matrix for years and love it.  I was surprised when they took it off the market, but I can still get it so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> It is good to use when your using the hair drier.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years &amp; love it.  Smoothes &amp; protects my hair from the flat iron.</li>
            <li> Cannot live without this product!</li>
            <li> I use this spray on my wet hair, and when it dries, and doesn&#x27;t have the poofy, frizzy style that happens without it. Love it!</li>
            <li> I feel like this leaves a residue feeling on my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is frizzy and coarse. I used this and I have the most straight sleek hair and I love it. I swear by this and recommend it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> it was not as good as expected from a Matrix product. It did not smooth nor condition my hair. I was not happy.</li>
            <li> It works great for flat ironing my hair!  Love the way it smoothes through the flat iron. After hair is done it leaves a nice smooth look.</li>
            <li> Holds your curls perfectly without making them feel heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li> I have hair that is frizzy and naturally curly. Every time I straighten my hair, it will go straight, but after a few minutes it will just become wavy. When I straighten my hair it lacks shine and it just won&#x27;t hold. The only thing I have ever used that really works to help this problem is this stuff. I love this! It is easier to use compared to other products like this and it actually works on my hair. I apply it on my dry hair and then straighten it. It is so simple. At first it may seem that it just makes your hair look wet and matted, but after a few brushes through it, it eventually makes my hair super shiny and sleek looking.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like how this product makes my hair feel. Makes my hair gummy. Won&#x27;t buy it again and would not recommend it</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and GREAT price:):)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Matrix Sleek products for years - the shampoo, conditioner, and this iron smoother spray.  I&#x27;m a huge fan of the products... love them!  Since I&#x27;m low on the iron smoother spray, I came to Amazon knowing I&#x27;d find a good price and have it shipped right to my door.  That happened... but when I opened the box, I could tell that the bottle leaked in shipping.  It was in a plastic bag, but the inside was all wet and sticky.  I took the bottle out and rinsed it off.  I think the cap became loose in shipping.  The liquid in the bottle is about an inch and a half from the top now, so I lost some of the product in transit - which is disappointing.  I appreciate the competitive price and fast shipping, but clearly the packaging left something to be desired.  The thing is - I&#x27;ve even ordered this same product online in the past and didn&#x27;t have this leak issue then.  Love the product and I don&#x27;t think I lost enough to fuss with returning it, I but don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be ordering from here again because of the leak issue.</li>
            <li> I like this product, but others do the same for cheaper</li>
            <li> I use it on my bangs every day when I blow dry them, and it keeps them straight and protected. I&#x27;ve been using this for years and I&#x27;m glad I found a product I like.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this product, because he doesn&#x27;t like hairspray. He needs something for his thin, flyaway hair and he really likes this product. I use it before I walk out the door, if I see a patch of frizz beginning. The fragrance is wonderful.</li>
            <li> The spray  doesnot work properly.. I like the product but the package is poor quality</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product! It protects my hair while straightening, adds shine, and smells fantastic. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff to replace the bottle I had had for like 4 years.  Of course I didnt use it daily but it seemed to last forever and I knew I needed to get more.  When I got it, it was opened and had weird debris in it.  The cap was faded.  I couldnt help but wonder if it had been diluted.  The smell of this is amazing.  It didnt smell as much as my original bottle either, furthur indication it had probably been diluted.  I will continue to use it but I feel kind of jipped.</li>
            <li> Love this product for my fine hair. Been using it for a while now.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for anyone living in high humidity areas like Florida!  Love this product!  My hair is so smooth!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this product</li>
            <li> Better price than in a salon, helps straighten curly/wavy hair and also gives a nice sheen.  Fast service right before Christmas was a bonus.</li>
