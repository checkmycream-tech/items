            <li>This is one of the most masculine scents I have ever smelled.</li>
            <li>After wearing it a while it really starts to smell great, the scent seems to change a little</li>

            <li>overall pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>faintly, for a long time or until you wash your clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have bought this product many times and it always has a strong&lt;br /&gt;smell, but not too strong, not too weak, that is pleasant, manly&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>we&#x27;ll maybe his old stuff</li>

            <li> This is a fav scent of mine for the hubby, so if your partial to:&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance Notes:Nutmeg, Amber, Bergamot, Moss, Aged Wisky, Sandalwood,</li>
            <li> This one is whiskey-sweet, faintly smelling of fresh tobacco and amber.</li>
            <li> &quot; too bad they stopped making those...not a real big Tim McGraw fan but not bad...</li>
            <li> Figures Stopped getting the small bottle, got the big one.</li>
            <li> Is there any other way to determine whether a cologne works ?</li>
            <li> It was described as box slightly bent</li>
            <li> My husband tried this in the past and like it, so was given this as a gift.</li>
            <li> Most men&#x27;s colognes have sharp pine notes, or weird musk tones that I find boring or offensive.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;so hard to find i belive</li>
            <li> I put it on in the morning and by noon the smell is gone, and i mean gone.</li>
            <li> This was either fake or it is just plain weak.</li>

            <li> A good cologne! Price is good. It smells very masculine!!</li>
            <li> Great scent! I bought for my husband last year with the McGraw Southern Blend. We both agreed that they both smell really nice. He liked the Southern Blend better, but I liked this one more.</li>
            <li> Whenever people are around, I get a ton of great compliments.  I can only describe the smell as &#x27;Manly it is a woody and spicy scent&#x27;. After wearing it a while it really starts to smell great, the scent seems to change a little and I like it even more.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different colognes and this is one of the few my wife enjoys.  Most seem to have too much alcohol in them but not McGraw.</li>

            <li> very nice and on time!! nice work</li>
            <li> It smells good. However, it does not keep its fragrane for long. I put it on in the morning and by noon the smell is gone, and i mean gone. Save your money and by something with better quality.</li>
            <li> Gift for someone else.</li>
            <li> It is hard to fine this.  This is really nice men&#x27;s cologn.  I only wear it on special occcasions.  Goood</li>
            <li> I got this cologne for my father after smelling it in stores. This product gave .7 more ounces for the same prices I was finding in stores. Smells wonderful and it was a big hit with my father and everyone at Christmas!</li>
            <li> real steal Lower than  Target&#x27;s price</li>
            <li> This is one of the most masculine scents I have ever smelled. Most men&#x27;s colognes have sharp pine notes, or weird musk tones that I find boring or offensive. This one is whiskey-sweet, faintly smelling of fresh tobacco and amber. But the best thing is that it it blends with my natural scent wonderfully. What would normally be light body odor simply merges with the cologne into something pleasant, manly, and head-turning attractive. Deeply recomment. Best cologne I&#x27;ve ever used or smelled.</li>
            <li> This was either fake or it is just plain weak. My guess is that it&#x27;s a knock off fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t prove it.</li>
            <li> this is my second favorite Cologne my number one being \\&quot;Kenneth Cole RSVP\\&quot; too bad they stopped making those...not a real big Tim McGraw fan but not bad...this cologne smells very nice</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, my.Husband and I both love it great size as well!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband as he had been looking for it and I found it at amazon.com.  It was described as box slightly bent so I was a little worried, but when delivered everything was perfect. I would definitely order from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Tim McGraw&#x27;s cologne is a very average to good men&#x27;s cologne&lt;br /&gt;that smells pretty average to good and manly, will last for&lt;br /&gt;around a half hour or more if sprayed on directly on your skin&lt;br /&gt;and if sprayed on your clothing the smell will linger around,&lt;br /&gt;however faintly, for a long time or until you wash your clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have bought this product many times and it always has a strong&lt;br /&gt;smell, but not too strong, not too weak, that is pleasant, manly&lt;br /&gt;and overall pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to all guys.</li>
            <li> My husband loves his cologne it arrived fast to</li>
            <li> Great fragrance not to overpowering.</li>
            <li> I think it does not have much hang time,but i love the smell of it.</li>
