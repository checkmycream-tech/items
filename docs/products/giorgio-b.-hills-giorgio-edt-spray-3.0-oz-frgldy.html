            <li>I have many fond memories of Giorgio from the 80&#x27;s as it was the signature scent of my best friend&#x27;s mom.</li>

            <li>Good value for the money and size.  </li>
            <li>My wife loves it, and the price is as good as it gets.</li>
            <li>It was a good value and came in good time.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with how it arrived.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>I love this perfume!</li>
            <li>This was a gift and the receiving party really liked it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice, but seem like it did not smell like I remembered.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume - I love it!</li>
            <li>It seems to be a perfect combination to her natural body odor.</li>
            <li>Lovely fragrance.</li>
            <li>It must have been okay because she has asked me if I can get some more.</li>
            <li>It arrived in an appropriate amount of time.</li>
            <li>People always ask what brand,&lt;br /&gt;and say they love it.&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
            <li>/Wearing it for  years and get the most compliments on it.</li>
            <li>Shopping in malls at Christmas is not one of my favorite things to do.</li>
            <li>Good old times, even better now with the perfume I love üòç</li>
            <li>I checked around and Amazon had the best price around,and I signed up for a Amazon credit card and got credit points towards other purchases.  </li>
            <li>It is a new favorite for sure!  </li>
            <li>It also came with free shipping which is always a plus..,</li>
            <li>I started wearing this fragrance in 1992, and it still remains my primary fragrance.  </li>
            <li>but they just don&#x27;t stand up to this light fragrance.  </li>
            <li>In the absence of the original Giorgio Beverly Hills, I make do with this excellent imitation, which does not have much staying power, but reminds me pleasantly of the original.</li>
            <li>What a lovely fragrance &amp; very feminine too.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the smell very much.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that one spray in the morning allows me to enjoy this beauty for the entire day - and my day is made happier with Giorgio in it!  </li>
            <li>I know a lot of reviews that I have read have indicated some people&#x27;s dislike for tuberose in general and for such strong florals, but I just can&#x27;t get enough of this rich and gorgeous scent!  </li>
            <li>I do think you need a certain amount of boldness to wear Giorgio, and while I am bold enough to wear it confidently, I would definitely recommend that the wearer use a light hand when spritzing on this beauty because it would be easy to overdo it.  </li>
            <li>I have been wearing Giorgio since it first came out.  </li>
            <li>and it has a kind of peppery smell to it.  </li>
            <li>This has been my favorite scent since 1983 when I put it on while still in the hospital after having my second son, Liam.  </li>
            <li>My first time ordering this perfume through Amazon.</li>
            <li>The latest price in Denver was $72 for a 3.0 fluid ounces of Giorgio Beverly Hills for Women.  </li>
            <li>Product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>This is a very hard to get perfume any more, but it is my wife&#x27;s favorite.</li>
            <li>I was very glad to find my favorite cologne available on line when local stores stopped carrying it, and it was less than half the price.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks for helping me find it again.</li>
            <li>Thanks, would probably order fromm them again.</li>
            <li>My wife says its the real deal so I have to take her word on it.  </li>
            <li>Ordered two bottles and sure enough it is exactly the same</li>
            <li>I would never buy from this particular company again.  </li>
            <li>I must be the biggest fan of tuberose ever - and I must love a sickening amount of rich floral notes - because I LOVE this perfume!  </li>
            <li>Recently I decided it was high time</li>
            <li>I was once told, that a cheap fragrance overwhelms the air around the wearer, but the expensive perfume, softly floats on the person, so that when they walk by you and you catch the soft fragrance for a moment, out just have to follow them to find out what it is.  </li>

            <li> My wife loves this cologne and I buy it for her for her birthday every year.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Giorgio since it first came out.  I have also bought Giorgio from Amazon as well.  BUT...this time as one customer pointed out, it did not smell like Giorgio and it does not wear like Giorgio.  The smell is gone almost as soon as u put it on and it has a kind of peppery smell to it.  I did send a email to the company, but since I had not kept the box ( I didn&#x27;t expect I would have to send it back) there was NOTHING they could do for me.  I would never buy from this particular company again.  A total waste of hard earned money.</li>
            <li> I was sorry i ordered it.  The smell is terrible.  I will not use it.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite scent since 1983 when I put it on while still in the hospital after having my second son, Liam.  Now when I wear it I remember that happy time.  It&#x27;s less expensive than purchasing it from a retail store.  It&#x27;s long lasting and other people seem to find it pleasing.  They can take away my ability to walk and such but I will have my perfume!</li>
            <li> My purchase arrived on time.  My first time ordering this perfume through Amazon. LOVE IT!  Good old times, even better now with the perfume I love üòç</li>
            <li> Good quality and price.Thanks</li>
            <li> A gift for my Mother.  She loves it.</li>
            <li> Very good deal.  Lovely fragrance.</li>
            <li> I decided I didn&#x27;t like the after smell on me. I&#x27;ll try it again and use just a tiny bit</li>
            <li> purchased this for my wife because she loves this perfume.  It must have been okay because she has asked me if I can get some more.</li>
            <li> I have many fond memories of Giorgio from the 80&#x27;s as it was the signature scent of my best friend&#x27;s mom. I never tried any on myself back then, but I was always curious about it. Recently I decided it was high time I bought a bottle for myself.  I must be the biggest fan of tuberose ever - and I must love a sickening amount of rich floral notes - because I LOVE this perfume!  It is a new favorite for sure!  I know a lot of reviews that I have read have indicated some people&#x27;s dislike for tuberose in general and for such strong florals, but I just can&#x27;t get enough of this rich and gorgeous scent!  I do think you need a certain amount of boldness to wear Giorgio, and while I am bold enough to wear it confidently, I would definitely recommend that the wearer use a light hand when spritzing on this beauty because it would be easy to overdo it.  I love the fact that one spray in the morning allows me to enjoy this beauty for the entire day - and my day is made happier with Giorgio in it!  I am never going to allow my perfume collection to be without a bottle of this in it ever again!</li>
            <li> The latest price in Denver was $72 for a 3.0 fluid ounces of Giorgio Beverly Hills for Women.  Checked the price was $24.00 on Amazon for same size bottle.  What!!  Ordered two bottles and sure enough it is exactly the same product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  FO</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Giogio Beverly Hills for several years.  Takes only a wee bit, but I like it and so does my family and friends.  Thanks for helping me find it again. Alva</li>
            <li> Giogio Beverly Hills is great, so happy to be able to purchase this item.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with how it arrived. This was a gift and the receiving party really liked it. It arrived in an appropriate amount of time.</li>
            <li> My old faithful stand by, one of the few colognes that lingers on me.  People always ask what brand,&lt;br /&gt;and say they love it.&lt;br /&gt;Been buying this since it appeared on the market.  Good stuff.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a very hard to get perfume any more, but it is my wife&#x27;s favorite. The product and the service was great</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as described. Best price on line. The wife loved it. She smells beautiful. I would recommend this item for anyone who like Giorgio.</li>
            <li> Good value for the money and size.  It also came with free shipping which is always a plus..,</li>
            <li> I started wearing this fragrance in 1992, and it still remains my primary fragrance.  I have purchased other varieties of Giorgio but they just don&#x27;t stand up to this light fragrance.  I&#x27;ve received compliments on this perfume.  I was once told, that a cheap fragrance overwhelms the air around the wearer, but the expensive perfume, softly floats on the person, so that when they walk by you and you catch the soft fragrance for a moment, out just have to follow them to find out what it is.  This is the character of Giorgio of Beverly Hills for Women on me.  It has become my signature fragrance.  Thank-you Amazon!</li>
            <li> In the absence of the original Giorgio Beverly Hills, I make do with this excellent imitation, which does not have much staying power, but reminds me pleasantly of the original.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice, but seem like it did not smell like I remembered. Like maybe on shelf or where ever to long. Like maybe an oldlike smell.&lt;br /&gt;I still like it and will wear it. Delivery time was prompt. Had no prolems there. I do appreciate it anyway. I had looked for a long time. Thanks, would probably order fromm them again.</li>
            <li> As another reviewer pointed out, described as perfume, but in fact Eau De Toilette.&lt;br /&gt;The price was typical for the Eau De Toilette, but will avoid this seller in the future</li>
            <li> What a lovely fragrance &amp; very feminine too. My wife loves this !!</li>
            <li> My wife has been using it for the past 15 yrs, or so, and she is still getting compliments about it all the time. It seems to be a perfect combination to her natural body odor.</li>
            <li> Great perfume!! My mother loves the stuff!!</li>
            <li> /Wearing it for  years and get the most compliments on it. Stays on all day . Different body chemistries and mine works with Giorgio</li>
            <li> My wife loves it, and the price is as good as it gets.</li>
            <li> The first purchase of this product was a failure. I paid a perfume and received a body lotion. I was cheated. Even so I bought again, and finally got what I paid.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! Great to see that it is as easy to click and ship this wonderful product. Shopping in malls at Christmas is not one of my favorite things to do.</li>
            <li> Description says &amp;#34;perfume for women&amp;#34;, EDT. I found that EDT is not perfume, Eau de Toilette which is not perfume.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume - I love it!</li>
            <li> I enjoy the smell very much. great fragrence. Its something I would recommend to some family and friends. Great product.</li>
            <li> It was a good value and came in good time.  I made the order on my tablet days before the holidays and it came as expected and made me look like a hero.  My wife says its the real deal so I have to take her word on it.  I checked around and Amazon had the best price around,and I signed up for a Amazon credit card and got credit points towards other purchases.  I couldn&#x27;t beat it and will continue to use this method of getting the best price for my wife&#x27;s perfume.</li>
            <li> Lovely-thanks a million!</li>
            <li> I was very glad to find my favorite cologne available on line when local stores stopped carrying it, and it was less than half the price.</li>
