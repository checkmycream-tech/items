            <li>I even use it on top of my hands.</li>
            <li>They looks way better.</li>
            <li>This is my third product review for TruSkin Naturals, which I am writing because I am still so impressed by the quality of their products.</li>
            <li>The products are making my skin have more glow.</li>
            <li>Most moisturizer brands don&#x27;t work on me.  </li>
            <li>Love this Retinol from TrueSkin  </li>
            <li>I do love the non-greasy feel and how supple and moisturized it leaves my face looking.</li>
            <li>Still need to use longer for results but so far so good!</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>Great product thus far.</li>
            <li>I started applying this retinol moisturizer on top of the vitamin C serum, and together they make my skin look bright and feel soft all day.</li>
            <li>I cannot be more thrilled with the results so far!</li>
            <li>I have only been using it for about 5 days, but it feels great and makes my face feel so smooth.  </li>
            <li>I had also been researching the benefits of Retinol, so when this product was introduced I was excited to try it.</li>
            <li>Been asked for a rating several times but Frankly I have not had the opportunity to give this product a fair shot.  </li>
            <li>I returned the product for full refund, thank god for Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li>And  I like their other  products, so this should be a win, too.</li>
            <li>Great moisturizer to use with other TruSkin products.</li>
            <li>: Love the new squeeze tubes!</li>
            <li>I have experienced no dryness, redness, or flakiness and my skin feels smooth and firm.</li>
            <li>Received this free thanks Erica!</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing not as strong as I thought it was going to be on my skin</li>
            <li>The texture is better and feels soft.</li>
            <li>It gets absorbed into the skin so well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it in the evenings over my TruSkin C Serum and love how smooth my face has been looking and feeling in the morning, and how even my skin tone has been -- all without the usual redness and flaking experienced with other retinol</li>
            <li>/&gt; 2nd week my face cleared and feels very smooth.  </li>
            <li>Like their vitimin C serum very gentle on the skin</li>
            <li>I will most definitely be purchasing from TruSkin again.</li>
            <li>First time with this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with this company.</li>
            <li>First week my face broke out</li>
            <li>I contacted the seller because there was a problem with the pump of the first bottle I received.  </li>
            <li>love the texture and the smell, will definitely buy again</li>
            <li>Only after a couple applications I am seeing a difference in the texture of my skin as well as in the softening of fine lines.</li>
            <li>I have only been using this product (along with the BEST ORGANIC Vitamin C Serum) for about a week now and have noticed significant improvements in everything I hate about my skin; fine lines, texture &amp; tone, large pores, breakouts, etc.</li>
            <li>I did not think much of it</li>
            <li>Thanks....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks and really like it.  </li>
            <li>There is no harsh scent to the product, and I appreciate the pump feature as I don&#x27;t need to struggle with the bottle to dispense the right amount.</li>
            <li>There are high quality ingredients in this retinol moisturizer.</li>
            <li>All in all a really high quality product.</li>
            <li>I have really like this products so far.</li>
            <li>Also have to comment on the great service and people who are behind TruSkin.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li>so I continued to use it for a few more days.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over one month now, and I am pleased with the results thus far.</li>
            <li>The Retinol Moisturizer has become one of the staples of my routine, and the new tube makes it easier to use.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is a new product.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s not usual for me when I try new creams.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Because I have had such positive results with the Vitamin C Serum</li>
            <li>like I&#x27;ve experienced with some retinol products in the past, but I have only been using it every other day at this point, so will have to update this review once I start using every day.</li>
            <li>I received an e-mail prior to getting the product with an outline on how and when the product should be applied which I found very helpful.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to get these e-mails as I have never had a company reachout to me before to inquire about how I like their products.</li>
            <li>It is smoother and my adult acne has diminished.</li>
            <li>So far I like the way my skin feels.</li>
            <li>that, with natural and organic ingredients, and without testing on animals...</li>
            <li>I am 48 years old and a registered nurse.</li>
            <li>So far, I haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable changes, but I&#x27;ll keep using it.  </li>
            <li>I like it so far.</li>
            <li>As I am knocking on the door to the BIG 4-0, I have really started to notice that the fine lines around my eyes &amp; mouth went from a small gathering to an all-out rager overnight.</li>
            <li>Within a few hours, the seller replied and offered to send not just a pump, but another full bottle.  </li>
            <li>As a regular TruSkin Naturals customer and a seasoned Retin-A user, I am excited to finally find a natural and organic moisturizer that has a sufficient percentage of Retinol without all the other harsh and toxic chemicals.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a general moisturizer for my combination skin;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several other face creams but this one seem to really work.  </li>
            <li>With the pump, I can get the exact amount I need, so nothing is wasted.</li>

            <li> one that doesn&#x27;t make me too oily or too dry.</li>

            <li> Thick, too thick for my preference.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t have that weird smell that you get from other brands.</li>
            <li> My skin feels tight and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed - this is not the right moisturizer for over-50 skin.</li>
            <li> Either something was wrong with it or there should have been directions for how to get it started.</li>

            <li> Very disappointed - this is not the right moisturizer for over-50 skin. I have to apply it at least twice, and even then it doesn&#x27;t last all day. My skin feels tight and uncomfortable. I still like the vitamin C serum, but I&#x27;m not getting any additional benefit with this product.</li>
            <li> Good cream effective moisturizer</li>
            <li> Just started to use it.</li>
            <li> I have really like this products so far. I received an e-mail prior to getting the product with an outline on how and when the product should be applied which I found very helpful. Since then I have received another e-mail asking if I like the product and how it is working for me. I was surprised to get these e-mails as I have never had a company reachout to me before to inquire about how I like their products. I will most definitely be purchasing from TruSkin again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE how lightweight this feels on my skin! Itâ€™s so nice to find a retinol moisturizer that doesnâ€™t feel greasy or break me out</li>
            <li> I have already noticed a difference in my skin after only 2 weeks! It is smoother and my adult acne has diminished. My pores also appear to be smaller. This moisturizer is wonderful as it works on my oily/dry places both!  Being able to use the product around my eyes is also a plus. Will update you later on those results! I will reorder...</li>
            <li> First time with this moisturizer. So far I like the way my skin feels. And  I like their other  products, so this should be a win, too.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer to use with other TruSkin products. My skin is looking better and I will purchase it again.</li>

I&#x27;m sold!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Love the new squeeze tubes!</li>
            <li> Been asked for a rating several times but Frankly I have not had the opportunity to give this product a fair shot.  I will return and update my review once I see how it performs.  My review is neutral.  Not good, not bad, waiting to see the effects.</li>
            <li> Thick, too thick for my preference. Felt like my skin was oily and clogged pores almost immediately.</li>
            <li> I have never written a bad review before.  I feel in this case I must.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased TruSDkin Best Organic Retinol Face Cream Moisturizer and received it as promised.

I just hope it does not scare my face.  I returned the product for full refund, thank god for Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> I love them both....vitamin C and Retinol moisturizer.. My skin looks and feels amazing!! I even use it on top of my hands. They looks way better. I told some of my friends .They could not believe how great it works. I am 48 years old and a registered nurse. I get compliments from my patients.. Thank you for this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I love all the TruSkin Naturals products I&#x27;m using! I started applying this retinol moisturizer on top of the vitamin C serum, and together they make my skin look bright and feel soft all day. With the pump, I can get the exact amount I need, so nothing is wasted. It&#x27;s great under my Clinique makeup, and I&#x27;m happy that it is fragrance-free!  Update: How nice to have something I like get even better! The Retinol Moisturizer has become one of the staples of my routine, and the new tube makes it easier to use. Thank you, TruSkin!</li>
            <li> The best Retinol Cream I.ve ever used.  Good value for the money, cause it works&#x27; really good on me.  I tried different retinol cream before but it is not good as this one. So I&#x27;ll continue to use this one.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with this company. There are high quality ingredients in this retinol moisturizer. This product doesn&#x27;t have that weird smell that you get from other brands. It feels soothing when being applied. So far, I haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable changes, but I&#x27;ll keep using it.  ** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
            <li> This is my third product review for TruSkin Naturals, which I am writing because I am still so impressed by the quality of their products. I have been looking for a general moisturizer for my combination skin; one that doesn&#x27;t make me too oily or too dry. I had also been researching the benefits of Retinol, so when this product was introduced I was excited to try it. I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over one month now, and I am pleased with the results thus far. I have experienced no dryness, redness, or flakiness and my skin feels smooth and firm. There is no harsh scent to the product, and I appreciate the pump feature as I don&#x27;t need to struggle with the bottle to dispense the right amount. All in all a really high quality product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed.  I&#x27;ve been using other products of TruSkin and I can see results. When I added this Retinol I can feel my face tingle slightly so I know it&#x27;s working. Even tho it&#x27;s a moisturizer my face doesn&#x27;t feel or look greasy and I have oily skin.  Thanks....Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks and really like it.  First week my face broke out but that&#x27;s not usual for me when I try new creams.&lt;br /&gt; 2nd week my face cleared and feels very smooth.  I&#x27;ve tried several other face creams but this one seem to really work.  I&#x27;ve used it at night and during the day.  Works well under my makeup.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing not as strong as I thought it was going to be on my skin but I&#x27;m still having breakouts and its been 2 weeks using this product!</li>
            <li> Anything by TruSkin is GREAT quality. Very happy with this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Received this free thanks Erica! The products are making my skin have more glow. Still need to use longer for results but so far so good! Organic too, amazing.</li>
            <li> Its been almost a few weeks and I have noticed smoother skin on my neck and chest. The texture is better and feels soft. I have red sun damaged skin and I am hoping this will start to improve it with further use.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for about 5 days, but it feels great and makes my face feel so smooth.  I like it so far.</li>
            <li> I contacted the seller because there was a problem with the pump of the first bottle I received.  I asked for a replacement pump if possible.  That was a Sunday afternoon.  Within a few hours, the seller replied and offered to send not just a pump, but another full bottle.  I was astonished at her generosity and the level of customer service.  Now about the product. I have oily skin.  Most moisturizer brands don&#x27;t work on me.  This one from TruSkin Naturals, however, works flawlessly.  No greasy residue.  It gets absorbed into the skin so well. My pores are visibly smaller after only a few days of use.  Great product. Great service. Great prices.  This is a company that deserves the recognition.</li>
            <li> Great product thus far.</li>
            <li> I switched to this from Estee Lauder. love the texture and the smell, will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> Love this product, I use it twice a day!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is a new product.  Because I have had such positive results with the Vitamin C Serum I decided to try it.  I am so happy that I did.  Only after a couple applications I am seeing a difference in the texture of my skin as well as in the softening of fine lines. This product has my vote!&lt;br /&gt;I am anxiously waiting for the arrival of the new daily moisturizer.  Also have to comment on the great service and people who are behind TruSkin.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> As I am knocking on the door to the BIG 4-0, I have really started to notice that the fine lines around my eyes &amp; mouth went from a small gathering to an all-out rager overnight. This moisturizer is nothing short of a miracle, y&#x27;all... I have only been using this product (along with the BEST ORGANIC Vitamin C Serum) for about a week now and have noticed significant improvements in everything I hate about my skin; fine lines, texture &amp; tone, large pores, breakouts, etc. I cannot be more thrilled with the results so far!</li>
            <li> Love this Retinol from TrueSkin  Like their vitimin C serum very gentle on the skin BUT EFFECTIVE!,  seen great looking skin within daysðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> So far so good! No break outs and no redness like I&#x27;ve experienced with some retinol products in the past, but I have only been using it every other day at this point, so will have to update this review once I start using every day. I do love the non-greasy feel and how supple and moisturized it leaves my face looking.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get the spray to work. Either something was wrong with it or there should have been directions for how to get it started.</li>
