            <li>Happy with other things I&#x27;ve been able to purchase on Amazon, thought I would do a search for this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not 100% sure how exactly to rate this.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more very soon!</li>
            <li>Works great for my dry skin and eczema.</li>
            <li>Great moisturizer for very dry skin.  </li>
            <li>The scent wasn&#x27;t what I expected, but the quality is great.</li>
            <li>Big tub for a good price.</li>
            <li>Full and creamy.</li>
            <li>The smell dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>Love this product, especially because it is not over-priced, and it is still available which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend this seller.. love the consistency of the product, spreads easily.</li>
            <li>I am just getting into the essential oils and making my own products.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s Worth it.</li>
            <li>I love stuff that makes me soft.</li>
            <li>AND THE AMOUNT IS WORTH THE PRICE</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It smells pretty good and works wonders on dry skin and seemed to help heal my acne.</li>
            <li>It was just as good as other shea</li>
            <li>I did not like the color, and the owner is to my nose less than pleasant.</li>
            <li>Always get great results as usual.</li>
            <li>Its amazing wish I wouldve bought this a long time ago.</li>
            <li>It is so fresh and golden yellow, I&#x27;m sure it will be all I expect, as it&#x27;s too close to call, yet.</li>
            <li>Love this shea butter for my troubled skin; great delivery time.</li>
            <li>but if you can get over that then this is amazing for dry skin!</li>
            <li>Very thankful to this seller!</li>
            <li>Looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I love this african shea butter.</li>
            <li>so i will most likely purchase another from this seller.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s exactly how it&#x27;s</li>
            <li>exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not generally put off by smells, but this one is pushing me more than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>If you want pure shea butter, then this is not the product you want to order.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the items I absolutely have to have in my house.</li>
            <li>but it works really just as well.</li>
            <li>As I said it was smooth and mixed well.</li>
            <li>THIS IS REALLY</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that once I combined it with some other products, the odor will be gone.</li>
            <li>I rub a small amount in my hands and it very quickly becomes soft and easy to spread</li>
            <li>my area, the weather has been unseasonally hot and nearly unbearable.</li>
            <li>In the liquid state it&#x27;s currently in, it smells mostly like the essential oils I just added, but the undertone of the shea butter is still there, lurking just beneath the surface.</li>
            <li>The Shea Butter smells really nice and Earthy, thick and works really well on my skin.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with the African Shea Butter Pure Raw Unrefined.  </li>
            <li>love that it is natural and when put on rash/ eczema, it does not hurt and burn as other lotions do</li>
            <li>And if your looking for a natural lotion source that really does work this is it.</li>
            <li>I gave four stars because I was still able to use it before it dried.</li>
            <li>I attempted to melt some down and add some essential oils to mask the smell, and it still lingers strongly even over lemon and tea tree oils which are pretty pungent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Same Shea butter I&#x27;ve bought previously at a higher cost.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have a \\&quot;bad\\&quot; smell &amp; is very smooth to rub in unlike some shea butters that can be gritty &amp; stiff...</li>
            <li>I believe that this is really shea butter and not African butter.  </li>
            <li>Soft and creamy.</li>
            <li>and I feel so soft.</li>
            <li>It works well on both natural hair, scalp, and skin.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>The color was dark egg-yolk yellow, and it smells strongly of wood smoke and latex.  </li>
            <li>Its so soft, you can barely smell it like others.</li>
            <li>Used to buy this same 100% pure shea butter at the local flea market</li>
            <li>but i use it everyday so its bound to run out quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little creamier and softer than other raw shea butters, which could be either a good or bad thing, but I love the product, more specifically the texture and price.</li>
            <li>because when I opened it, it was very hard on top</li>
            <li>(wear hair naturally with no chemical relaxer) due to it making my hair very</li>
            <li>The large size leads me to believe it will last a long while.</li>
            <li>and it was not rough.  </li>
            <li>I had to find a second container for it to make certain it doesn&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li>This has made my skin very dry and flaky and this has been like a balm and my skin looks like normal again, even with sunburn.</li>
            <li>but it closed down recently, and I didn&#x27;t make it there to buy more before they closed.</li>
            <li>&amp; I had to pretty much scrape the hard part off &amp; throw it away but other</li>
            <li>I thought since she only had eczema a little bit this would be very helpful.</li>

            <li> THIS IS REALLY</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that once I combined it with some other products, the odor will be gone.</li>
            <li> I rub a small amount in my hands and it very quickly becomes soft and easy to spread</li>
            <li> my area, the weather has been unseasonally hot and nearly unbearable.</li>
            <li> In the liquid state it&#x27;s currently in, it smells mostly like the essential oils I just added, but the undertone of the shea butter is still there, lurking just beneath the surface.</li>
            <li> The Shea Butter smells really nice and Earthy, thick and works really well on my skin.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the African Shea Butter Pure Raw Unrefined.  </li>
            <li> love that it is natural and when put on rash/ eczema, it does not hurt and burn as other lotions do</li>
            <li> And if your looking for a natural lotion source that really does work this is it.</li>
            <li> I gave four stars because I was still able to use it before it dried.</li>
            <li> I attempted to melt some down and add some essential oils to mask the smell, and it still lingers strongly even over lemon and tea tree oils which are pretty pungent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Same Shea butter I&#x27;ve bought previously at a higher cost.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a \\&quot;bad\\&quot; smell &amp; is very smooth to rub in unlike some shea butters that can be gritty &amp; stiff...</li>
            <li> I believe that this is really shea butter and not African butter.  </li>
            <li> Soft and creamy.</li>
            <li> and I feel so soft.</li>
            <li> It works well on both natural hair, scalp, and skin.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> The color was dark egg-yolk yellow, and it smells strongly of wood smoke and latex.  </li>
            <li> Its so soft, you can barely smell it like others.</li>
            <li> Used to buy this same 100% pure shea butter at the local flea market</li>
            <li> but i use it everyday so its bound to run out quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little creamier and softer than other raw shea butters, which could be either a good or bad thing, but I love the product, more specifically the texture and price.</li>
            <li> because when I opened it, it was very hard on top</li>
            <li> (wear hair naturally with no chemical relaxer) due to it making my hair very</li>
            <li> The large size leads me to believe it will last a long while.</li>
            <li> and it was not rough.  </li>
            <li> I had to find a second container for it to make certain it doesn&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li> This has made my skin very dry and flaky and this has been like a balm and my skin looks like normal again, even with sunburn.</li>
            <li> but it closed down recently, and I didn&#x27;t make it there to buy more before they closed.</li>
            <li> &amp; I had to pretty much scrape the hard part off &amp; throw it away but other</li>
            <li> I thought since she only had eczema a little bit this would be very helpful.</li>
            <li> Reviews of multiple vendors show it is a common complaint across many vendors.</li>
            <li> and it last a long time</li>
            <li> I purchased the shea to make some body products and when I mixed it with other things I had a left over gritty feeling</li>
            <li> It lasts me about 2 months which may or may not seem long to some people</li>
            <li> Any Shea that smells good is probably crap.</li>
            <li> As a protectant against the elements and prevention of the &#x27;dry ashiness&#x27; it will suffice.</li>
            <li> Does the job, but it seems after using shea butter on my hands for some months now, when my hands do get dry they now look drier than ever.</li>
            <li> it was old, not sure.</li>
            <li> The product is as advertised, fragrant and nutty, but the weight was a little short.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not really holding my breath on it.</li>
            <li> Not gonna lie, this one is rough.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really working for me, but my sister says it&#x27;s helping her eczema.</li>
            <li> I prefer the ivory shea butter this one no thanks clumps and look</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be extremely greasy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It melts well, and rubs into the skin well, but the ash and smoke odor lingers until you wash it off and people could smell me from the other side of the room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was not as advertised, it came in a food like container and had a label, presentation was below average</li>
            <li> , also it is not full of chemicals as steroids, or other medications used on skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Dry skin is a thing of the past with this product.</li>
            <li> I had a previous jar that I brought from the mall</li>
            <li> This was not pure, raw Shea butter.</li>
            <li> After allowing the melted butter mixture to cool, it still smelled bad.</li>
            <li> am african but this shea not good to me.</li>
            <li> Also eases razor burns, scrapes and little cuts like paper cuts.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to manipulate for daily use.</li>
            <li> However, I hadn&#x27;t anticipated that the product would be so firm.</li>
            <li> The product arrived within a few days of placing the order.</li>
            <li> at least I know the base smell is okay.</li>
            <li> Not a huge thing, just an irritant.</li>
            <li> Plain as that.</li>
            <li> I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> and I was so disappointed because it was gritty, it had a gritty feel to it</li>
            <li> Shipping was a bit slow due to bad weather but it finally arrived.  </li>
            <li> His hands get just horrible, they are hard and cracking,  and his skin condition means his skin lacks a huge amount of moisture and flakes like fish scales, hence the name if you know any Latin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not as thick at cocabutter</li>
            <li> This smells a little weird if you&#x27;ve never used something like this before</li>
            <li> For some reason, this was not good for my baby eczema.</li>
            <li> My hands dry out really bad during the winter to the point they crack and bleed,I was looking for something that would help heal them</li>
            <li> The butter does leave a bad smell on your skin but it dissipates after a little bit.</li>
            <li> but it has weird smell which i don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> My son has horrible eczema and I purchased this to help moisturize his skin.</li>
            <li> The smell was awful and the consistency was disgusting.</li>
            <li> just horrible</li>

            <li> My husband has a skin condition called icthyosis and in addition works outside all day attaching tractors to their trailers and putting them in their loading bays with an Ottawa. His hands get just horrible, they are hard and cracking,  and his skin condition means his skin lacks a huge amount of moisture and flakes like fish scales, hence the name if you know any Latin. He is using this everywhere with great relief. He likes the solid texture, and the feel of it, and is using it all the time as he sits and relaxes at the end of the day, not forgetting like you know men do with skincare, because this is actually giving him lasting relief. We will be buying more when he uses it up.</li>
            <li> its good product but the price is high</li>
            <li> I am just getting into the essential oils and making my own products. This is perfect!</li>
            <li> My son has horrible eczema and I purchased this to help moisturize his skin. It works really well, and keeps his son from drying out and is a good alternative to his presciption lotion..will be buying again.</li>
            <li> Dry skin is a thing of the past with this product. Love it!</li>
            <li> I purchased the shea to make some body products and when I mixed it with other things I had a left over gritty feeling so I tried it alone and there was still a left over gritty feeling. Plus I the shea scent is to strong for me. Not a fan of this product.</li>
            <li> This worked great for the lotion bars we made.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the African Shea Butter Pure Raw Unrefined.  I hope to continue ordering it.</li>
            <li> I love shea butter. Used to buy this same 100% pure shea butter at the local flea market but it closed down recently, and I didn&#x27;t make it there to buy more before they closed. Happy with other things I&#x27;ve been able to purchase on Amazon, thought I would do a search for this product. Very glad I did! Shea butter is amazing! I use it on my back, neck, and any sore achy muscles instead of greasy topical sore muscle ointments. Shea butter relieves my spinal arthritis better, and has skin benefits. It smells pretty good and works wonders on dry skin and seemed to help heal my acne. Also eases razor burns, scrapes and little cuts like paper cuts. Works on hangnails by relieving pain and encouraging healing. At this price, I suggest order a tub and give it a try! It&#x27;s one of the items I absolutely have to have in my house. Very thankful to this seller!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell too good but it leaves your skin feeling really soft. The smell dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> You cannot get another product that is as good as Shea Butter it is great in my soaps, lotions, etc</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend this seller.. love the consistency of the product, spreads easily. It smells nutty but not over powering. It feels great on the skin.</li>
            <li> I liked the package and up to now I&#x27;m very pleased with the product. I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and awesome product. Big tub for a good price. No complaints here :)</li>
            <li> I found this product to be extremely greasy. WhileI realize it&#x27;s in unrefined product I did not like the color, and the owner is to my nose less than pleasant. In the future I will find alternative butters to make my soap and lotion products with.</li>
            <li> I received the product item as described. However, I hadn&#x27;t anticipated that the product would be so firm. The consistency of the product is rock solid and is not a comparable product as a daily moisturizer would be. It is not a cream or a lotion texture. It is very hard to manipulate for daily use. As a protectant against the elements and prevention of the &#x27;dry ashiness&#x27; it will suffice. The beneficial properties of this product are yet to be realized.</li>
            <li> Is it supposed to be solid? I had the impression that it would be more of a creme. Good amount for the cost, though.</li>
            <li> Always get great results as usual. I use this for homemade hair and skin products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not 100% sure how exactly to rate this. It works well...you have to melt it to get it spreadable, but it&#x27;s great at healing skin. But...The smell. Oh, the smell. It smells rancid. Plain as that. I&#x27;m not generally put off by smells, but this one is pushing me more than I&#x27;d like. I&#x27;m adding essential oils to it, as well as coconut oil. In the liquid state it&#x27;s currently in, it smells mostly like the essential oils I just added, but the undertone of the shea butter is still there, lurking just beneath the surface. We&#x27;ll see what happens when it firms up enough for me to whip it into a spreadable cream. But I&#x27;m not really holding my breath on it. Honestly, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy this again. I&#x27;d go with cocoa butter instead---at least I know the base smell is okay. Not gonna lie, this one is rough.  UPDATE: After allowing the melted butter mixture to cool, it still smelled bad. I had to throw it out. Essential oils did not mask the smell at all.</li>
            <li> I believe that this is really shea butter and not African butter.  Regardless it works for me and I like it.</li>
            <li> I received my Shea butter it&#x27;s perfect. Looks exactly like the picture. Full and creamy. Shea butter isn&#x27;t for smelling good.. it&#x27;s for healing and conditioning....Any Shea that smells good is probably crap. The smell is the only draw back...but it&#x27;s Worth it. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Container was cracked</li>
            <li> I have very much enjoyed this product! It has served multiple purposes, from an ingredient in home made deodorant to treating the inflammations of acne. I will be ordering more very soon!</li>
            <li> For some reason, this was not good for my baby eczema. It didn&#x27;t smooth her skin and it was not rough.  I thought since she only had eczema a little bit this would be very helpful.</li>
            <li> Came like what I ordered before.  Very satisfied. Love this product, especially because it is not over-priced, and it is still available which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> The product arrived within a few days of placing the order. The texture is very smooth and leaves my skin feeling moisturized. The butter does leave a bad smell on your skin but it dissipates after a little bit. I&#x27;m sure that once I combined it with some other products, the odor will be gone.</li>
            <li> Skin softer, helping with eczema.</li>
            <li> Soft and creamy. Enjoy this product</li>
            <li> So I ordered this. And got it today. Oh my God! I love stuff that makes me soft. And if your looking for a natural lotion source that really does work this is it. I used it one time and I feel so soft. I like that it&#x27;s not as thick at cocabutter but it works really just as well.</li>
            <li> african shea butter is may all time fav love&lt;br /&gt;love this product wonderful amazing my hair is so sofe an mangaiable my go to staple product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really working for me, but my sister says it&#x27;s helping her eczema.</li>
            <li> Love this shea butter for my troubled skin; great delivery time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little creamier and softer than other raw shea butters, which could be either a good or bad thing, but I love the product, more specifically the texture and price. I&#x27;m excited to know that I can get this in such good quality from Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love this african shea butter. Its so soft, you can barely smell it like others. Its amazing wish I wouldve bought this a long time ago. It does leaves my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> What I received was not Shea Butter.  I had already purchased shea butter from a local beauty supply store and this stuff is completely different.  It has a different texture and smell to it.  It works really good for dry/sensitive skin, but I prefer shea butter for my hair.  This is actually African Butter, with is from a completely different tree.  If you want pure shea butter, then this is not the product you want to order.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this.  Good quality.</li>
            <li> I used this to make my own lotion (see Pinteret for ideas and recipes).  Did well for me, making my second batch soon.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It has definite started to reduce spots on my nick and chest a d also keeps the wrinkles at bay. It feels great! I rub a small amount in my hands and it very quickly becomes soft and easy to spread</li>
            <li> Shi received a strong smell of burning cushy .... and filled with white spots</li>
            <li> The Shea arrived in a cracked container. I guess this happened during shipping. I gave four stars because I was still able to use it before it dried. It was just as good as other shea I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> This came to me in the package as described and pictured on the site. The Shea Butter smells really nice and Earthy, thick and works really well on my skin. I attempted to put it in my hair but that did not work out well (wear hair naturally with no chemical relaxer) due to it making my hair very hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my area, the weather has been unseasonally hot and nearly unbearable. This has made my skin very dry and flaky and this has been like a balm and my skin looks like normal again, even with sunburn. I put it on in the morning after my shower and it kept me moisturized all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again! The large size leads me to believe it will last a long while.</li>
            <li> The scent wasn&#x27;t what I expected, but the quality is great. It works well on both natural hair, scalp, and skin.</li>
            <li> Great texture of this Shea butter, but I use white Shea butter.  I have used all of this by mixing it with the White. As I said it was smooth and mixed well.</li>
            <li> The product was what I thought, but it did not dissolve the way it should have.maybe it was old, not sure.</li>
            <li> I used it couple of times. The value of it was good but it has weird smell which i don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> great stuff for arthritis, helps alot with stiffness.  Great moisturizer for very dry skin.  Softens wrinkles, great for under eyes.  No allergies when wearing it!</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of Shea butter for years.  The quality was great just as described. Great price for the size tub. This is the best stuff for your skin and it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> Same Shea butter I&#x27;ve bought previously at a higher cost.</li>
            <li> First off the price is pretty good. The product is great i use this stuff as a skin moisturizer. It lasts me about 2 months which may or may not seem long to some people but i use it everyday so its bound to run out quickly. I&#x27;m running out so i will most likely purchase another from this seller. Overall, i would recommend!</li>
            <li> This was not pure, raw Shea butter. The smell was awful and the consistency was disgusting. I will never purchase this item again!</li>
            <li> Great product and good price, I will order again.</li>
            <li> THIS IS REALLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR, AND THE AMOUNT IS WORTH THE PRICE</li>
            <li> A lot bigger in person than it looks in the picture. Works and feels great! I love it!!!</li>
            <li> My hands dry out really bad during the winter to the point they crack and bleed,I was looking for something that would help heal them and this did it! This smells a little weird if you&#x27;ve never used something like this before but if you can get over that then this is amazing for dry skin!</li>
            <li> Love it works for everything you can imagine love it ðŸ’˜</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product... Hair, Skin, Nails love this it softens the skin like you would not believe. Worked wonders when visiting in the east coast during winter at keeping my skin moist....I always recommend this product to friends</li>
            <li> Everyone should have this,works for so many things</li>
            <li> I love this this product!! I use it every night on my arms and feet. I will definately buy again!!</li>
            <li> This shea butter is really nice, smells good and is easy to apply. A tiny bit grainy but that melts with body temp.  Shipping was a bit slow due to bad weather but it finally arrived.  Very pleased with product.  Will buy again.  AA++</li>
            <li> The packaging I got was different and unlabeled.  The color was dark egg-yolk yellow, and it smells strongly of wood smoke and latex.  I attempted to melt some down and add some essential oils to mask the smell, and it still lingers strongly even over lemon and tea tree oils which are pretty pungent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It melts well, and rubs into the skin well, but the ash and smoke odor lingers until you wash it off and people could smell me from the other side of the room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sending the rest back since I can&#x27;t mask the odor.</li>
            <li> Good price want it very soon</li>
            <li> Does the job, but it seems after using shea butter on my hands for some months now, when my hands do get dry they now look drier than ever. I&#x27;ll see white cracky looking hands unlike ever before.  My lotioned hands would never get to that. I don&#x27;t know. I do like using it in my hair though.</li>
            <li> Really good Shea butter... Doesn&#x27;t have a \\&quot;bad\\&quot; smell &amp; is very smooth to rub in unlike some shea butters that can be gritty &amp; stiff... I will definitely buy again...</li>
            <li> Works great for my dry skin and eczema.</li>
            <li> I make my own whipped shea butter mix &amp; this is a good quality ingredient.</li>
            <li> Rec&#x27;d item on time. Giving it a 4 because when I opened it, it was very hard on top &amp; I had to pretty much scrape the hard part off &amp; throw it away but other than that it&#x27;s as described.</li>
            <li> I prefer the ivory shea butter this one no thanks clumps and look Sooo yellow looks the put dye to it am african but this shea not good to me.</li>
            <li> I like it, It seems to be of good quality</li>
            <li> Perfect better than most moisturizers</li>
            <li> This is better than any lotion.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Will order again. It is wonderful for sore knees and great on the skin. I accidentally placed 2 orders but I kept it all it was so good.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the holy grail for skin.</li>
            <li> It was not as advertised, it came in a food like container and had a label, presentation was below average but it was shea butter and it works but it does NOT come in this tub thats advertised.</li>
            <li> arrived on time, the size of the container is even bigger than the pic</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product I use it for everything like my hair and body it and it last a long time</li>
            <li> Great shea butter I received it on time... it&#x27;s exactly how it&#x27;s should be..... great product great price</li>
            <li> The product is excellent. Exactly as expected. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> It is so fresh and golden yellow, I&#x27;m sure it will be all I expect, as it&#x27;s too close to call, yet.</li>
            <li> The product is as advertised, fragrant and nutty, but the weight was a little short. It is like they didn&#x27;t tare the scale. Just popped the container on and weighed out 16 oz. Not a huge thing, just an irritant. Reviews of multiple vendors show it is a common complaint across many vendors.</li>
            <li> The Shea butter is great. The only reason for a 4 rating instead of a 5 is the packaging. The jar is flimsy and breaks off in my hand. I had to find a second container for it to make certain it doesn&#x27;t dry out. But the butter on my skin keeps it moist and smooth. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Met my expectations. Rusty Sivley.</li>
            <li> I like this product but would like better containers...they seem to fall apart so are not durable.</li>
            <li> Excellent item ,, thank you</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;It is the only moisturizer I can use on my hands in the winter, which break out in eczema all season!&lt;br /&gt;I bought it to use in another recipe, but when I learned of its usefulness for skin, I couldn&#x27;t get enough!&lt;br /&gt;I love that it is natural and when put on rash/ eczema, it does not hurt and burn as other lotions do, also it is not full of chemicals as steroids, or other medications used on skin.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this again, no questions asked!</li>
            <li> exactly what I needed. I had a previous jar that I brought from the mall and I was so disappointed because it was gritty, it had a gritty feel to it just horrible this is authentic brand of shea butter</li>
            <li> Works great!  Feels good on skin&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping</li>
