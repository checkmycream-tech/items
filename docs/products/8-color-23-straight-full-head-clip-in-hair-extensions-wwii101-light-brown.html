            <li>pretty sure I&#x27;m going to go ahead and grab a second one to layer with since I was so happy with the price and quality &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>Came in clean packaging and no knots.</li>
            <li>other than that its beautiful</li>
            <li>My order of the one full head extension came in today</li>
            <li>i love it so much.</li>
            <li>the color was perfect for my hair and the length was amazing but the bad thing about this was the hair falls out very quickly</li>
            <li>I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting much for how much I paid for this piece</li>
            <li>but it just adds extra length that I love!</li>
            <li>so I will need 2 tracks to get more of a natural effect.</li>
            <li>Other then that it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and long and adds moderate body and awesome length to my already long hair (which goes right under my boobs).&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was extremely fast</li>
            <li>Definitely will be buying more</li>
            <li>i gave two stars because of the price - it is cheap (but apparently, you get what you pay for).</li>
            <li>expect that I love the long</li>
            <li>I was really nervous if it would blend</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll really blend with a brunettes hair.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;It is really shine</li>
            <li>Looks and feels like my real hair.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>they look Soo real</li>
            <li>and I received the product much faster than I thought I would as well, considering it was shipped from China.</li>
            <li>Not at all what was described its not 100%  real hair</li>
            <li>Other than that i love them</li>
            <li>They do get tangled easily but what long hair doesn&#x27;t?!</li>
            <li>I wanted them to be able to curl reading reviews saying they curling great was disappointed</li>
            <li>Love the texture and length, but the &amp;#34;light brown&amp;#34; came as a very dark maroon brown.</li>
            <li>They blended with my hair very well and color was exactly the same.</li>
            <li>They are so soft!</li>
            <li>This color is the exact same color as my hair!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overly shiny, blends well with my natural hair.</li>
            <li>it was super dark like the s</li>
            <li>/&gt;this tangled right out of the bag after i put my fingers through it a few times...</li>

            <li> Would recommend, not bad quality but a little too long for my style</li>
            <li> (although the color has no bearing on my rating).&lt;br /&gt;the piece is super long, but not all too thick.</li>
            <li> Try to curl or straight them they just got ruined, should specified they were fake hair, you pay what you get right, but if you don&#x27;t mind wearing fake hair instead of human hair guess they can work just fine.</li>
            <li> The hair looks real but adding it to your hair would never work; the clips are small and flimsy</li>
            <li> They work well with my flat iron and curling iron</li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> Only one six or seven inches wide.</li>
            <li> Other reviews left the product Mis leading</li>
            <li> They sent me red hair extensions not worth what I payed at all.</li>
            <li> the ends are split-looking (like you are in need of a haircut), and the hair itself just LOOKS extremely fake (SUPER plastic and shiny</li>
            <li> The color does come darker than expected but not a lot.</li>
            <li> but thats do to needing a haircut and the ends of my hair being brownish pink.</li>
            <li> I chose to give them 5 stars because my extensions got here sooner than I expected</li>
            <li> but then it weighs down my head</li>
            <li> , they are really long and really thick.</li>
            <li> abou a few weeks</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t ever waste money on synthetic hair.</li>
            <li> waste of my time and my money</li>
            <li> and it was not light brown</li>
            <li> the color is not accurate</li>
            <li> its very black</li>
            <li> received it but wrong color also would two or three of these to actually make it work for my hair</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying them but they got here way earlier then</li>
            <li> I cut the long line of extensions up into separate pieces, but the one bad thing about this is the clamps, they fall off the extensions and you have to resew them on but not a lot.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> It sucks.i was so disappointed</li>
            <li> worst product</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The hair looks real but adding it to your hair would never work; the clips are small and flimsy</li>
            <li> I love my extensions! I ordered them August 26 and they came in September 15. They are so soft! I have very thick hair so I will need 2 tracks to get more of a natural effect. My order of the one full head extension came in today and I just placed my order for a second one! Love this product and the price!</li>
            <li> This color is the exact same color as my hair! I was really nervous if it would blend but it&#x27;s perfect. I love the length. I have long hair but it just adds extra length that I love! I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> The color does come darker than expected but not a lot. It&#x27;ll really blend with a brunettes hair. I cut the long line of extensions up into separate pieces, but the one bad thing about this is the clamps, they fall off the extensions and you have to resew them on but not a lot.</li>
            <li> Love the texture and length, but the &amp;#34;light brown&amp;#34; came as a very dark maroon brown.</li>
            <li> Try to curl or straight them they just got ruined, should specified they were fake hair, you pay what you get right, but if you don&#x27;t mind wearing fake hair instead of human hair guess they can work just fine.</li>
            <li> I ordered these about 2 weeks ago. They weren&#x27;t do for another 2 weeks or so but to my surprise they came today. I immediately put them in and they match my hair perfectly. They feel so silky and smooth. The only problems i have are that my hair doesn&#x27;t match at the ends and it doesn&#x27;t blend but thats do to needing a haircut and the ends of my hair being brownish pink. Other than that i love them</li>
            <li> hair splits, falls apart, looks frayed. the color is not accurate (although the color has no bearing on my rating).&lt;br /&gt;the piece is super long, but not all too thick. the ends are split-looking (like you are in need of a haircut), and the hair itself just LOOKS extremely fake (SUPER plastic and shiny looking)!!&lt;br /&gt;this tangled right out of the bag after i put my fingers through it a few times...??&lt;br /&gt;i would NOT recommend this! i gave two stars because of the price - it is cheap (but apparently, you get what you pay for).</li>
            <li> Other reviews left the product Mis leading I wanted them to be able to curl reading reviews saying they curling great was disappointed</li>
            <li> the color was perfect for my hair and the length was amazing but the bad thing about this was the hair falls out very quickly and i only have it for about 3 weeks and i have to throw it away cause there was so much hair missing.</li>
            <li> beautiful hair. i love it so much. but then it weighs down my head and i need to keep fixing it. other than that its beautiful</li>
            <li> It only came with like five clips. Only one six or seven inches wide. I thought it said eight pieces when I orderd it. Other then that it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> received it but wrong color also would two or three of these to actually make it work for my hair its very black</li>
            <li> I love this product I dint expect that I love the long and I love the color love it.&lt;br /&gt;It is really shine but I don&#x27;t care that cuz is a grate product just for 9 dollars and I recive the precut before the estimate time</li>
            <li> I chose to give them 5 stars because my extensions got here sooner than I expected and I love them! They are awesome! They are super soft and they curl really good! They do get tangled easily but what long hair doesn&#x27;t?! I love this! A very good product and worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Would recommend, not bad quality but a little too long for my style</li>
            <li> Came in clean packaging and no knots. Looks and feels like my real hair. I defiantly would recommend to friends and family.</li>
            <li> i only got one of the extensoins but there quality was ok not the best i have had . dont buy</li>
            <li> worst product haha i take that back it was slightly good. I had it for abou a few weeks then it turned in to s***. use water an conditioner to bring it back to life :D looks good as new.</li>
            <li> They work well with my flat iron and curling iron and I wash them every month and the color is awesome and just for what I paid for them they have worked amazing</li>
            <li> Loved the hair. Easy to brush. Make sure you get the right color</li>
            <li> Synthetic synthetic synthetic. Don&#x27;t ever waste money on synthetic hair. It sucks.i was so disappointed</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot it is extremely easy to put on and comfortable. the only thing is the bottom of it looks like it was dipped in a redish auburn color so its like brown except the bottom its red.... other than that the product is awesome:)!!!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying them but they got here way earlier then the estimated delivery and they look Soo real, they are really long and really thick. They blended with my hair very well and color was exactly the same. Definitely will be buying more</li>
            <li> I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting much for how much I paid for this piece but it&#x27;s quality is surprising! It&#x27;s not overly shiny, blends well with my natural hair. I got the light brown, I had to kind of guess with the color because the swatch photo was kind of crappy, but it matches my hair almost perfectly. It&#x27;s nice and long and adds moderate body and awesome length to my already long hair (which goes right under my boobs).&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was extremely fast and I received the product much faster than I thought I would as well, considering it was shipped from China. I got it on Jan. 12 and it shipped out the day after Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m going to go ahead and grab a second one to layer with since I was so happy with the price and quality &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> They sent me red hair extensions not worth what I payed at all. waste of my time and my money</li>
            <li> Not at all what was described its not 100%  real hair it was 100% Barbies friend&#x27;s hair and it was not light brown it was super dark like the s*** you take after you take pepto bismol and it made my room smell like it too....</li>
            <li> These break off my hair</li>
