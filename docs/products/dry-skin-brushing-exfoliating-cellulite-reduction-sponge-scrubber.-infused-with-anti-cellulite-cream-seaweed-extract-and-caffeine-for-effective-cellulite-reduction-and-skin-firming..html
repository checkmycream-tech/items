            <li>Love this stuff, I have bought 2 now, one for me and one for a friend.</li>
            <li>One of the most helpful products I have purchased on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soothing, and lathers up great.</li>
            <li>Love the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>Its ok.</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance of this (grapefruit)</li>
            <li>Your better off just exfoliating and massaging the skin than using this.</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>but I love how it feels after my shower.</li>
            <li>but I love how it feels on my skin</li>
            <li>Thats why 4 stars.:)</li>
            <li>I like the soap love the smell</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if it&#x27;s working at this point</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s the main reason I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
            <li>And I am really becoming fond of this sponge and its nicest smell, I now cannot even imagine to have a shower without this anti cellulite sponge.</li>
            <li>: It&#x27;s easy and ongoing.</li>
            <li>Not just me, but even my sisters and my mother use this sponge regularly and we all are really happy and satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>This product makes it easy by incorporating it into something we all do every day shower.</li>
            <li>It was very quick and easy to apply without any problems.</li>
            <li>The sponge lathers pretty nicely, so I don&#x27;t feel like they skimped out on the amount of cream which is good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Company is quick shipper too :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast, it&#x27;s easy, and it&#x27;s effective.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, using this product hasn&#x27;t changed my lifestyle at all.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth after every shower though.</li>
            <li>However, with this shower sponge, I feel like the ingredients are… well really and effective, because I’ve seen results from this ever since I tried it out.</li>
            <li>Thought I had found something to fit the bill in this &amp;#34;anti-cellulite&amp;#34; sponge</li>
            <li>It keeps up a great lather and doesn&#x27;t rip like other sponges after many uses.</li>
            <li>I think I might even get her into a two piece swimsuit this summer thanks to this easy to use product.  :-)</li>
            <li>It smells great and lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, the results are just fantastic: my skin became so smooth and soft after using this sponge.</li>
            <li>I have tried everything for my cellulite- creams, skin rollers, special massages...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a real money saver that you can get more than 20 washes out of these sponges.</li>
            <li>BUT, it&#x27;s also full of chemicals.</li>
            <li>Only plus is that it does smell good.</li>
            <li>let&#x27;s be real folks, exercise and eat healthy and that will work bette.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve constantly tried different anti-cellulite products and without a doubt this is the best product I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a mild exfoliator.</li>
            <li>First of all, I wanna say THANK YOU to the creators of this product for creating such an amazing Anti-Cellulite Cream and Sponge!</li>
            <li>and i could see results quickly.</li>
            <li>Saying she looks 10 years younger, and feels better as a result of looking better.  </li>
            <li>Smells lovely, is exfoliating and refreshing and actually does what is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I have an otherwise pretty fit body</li>
            <li>Using it every time I take a shower was easy and the product really worked for me.</li>
            <li>The only thing that was nice about this sponge is that the soap stays for a very long time and smells good.</li>
            <li>Still a great little massage in the morning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied, and I think I&#x27;ll be buying this product as long as it&#x27;s around.</li>
            <li>I will keep buying this stuff and definitely worth $19.00.</li>
            <li>I really do enjoy the Vanilla Orchid Black Tea scent and it is really nice and relaxing as a massage with the sponge.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, even over long periods of time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I simply just use this as I would any other sponge, enjoy the grapefruit scent, enjoy a nice relaxing massage with the sponge, and watch my cellulite disappear and stay away.</li>
            <li>It worked exactly as it is intended too.</li>
            <li>I’ve been using this product regularly, which is more like twice a week, and used a cellulite sponge to lather it up.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent and decided to make a second purchase and now trying the Grapefruit sponge.</li>
            <li>sure enough those pockets of fleshy bumps – still there.</li>
            <li>but now I can finally say I love the skin I&#x27;m in</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this faithfully for 11 weeks and it is the first product I have found that does reduce the appearance of cellulite</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>so you will want to alternate and rub the areas most desired in a circular motion.</li>
            <li>, i recommend them for any buyer who seeking good quality results while not making a load of extra work for there selves, i mean you have knock off cremes, but there nothing compared to the real deal here love it</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it on a daily basis as the results can only get better!</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Very relaxing fragrance.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to show that off; no matter how much work I put into my body those spots just wouldn&#x27;t budge.</li>
            <li>Bring it on bikini season; I&#x27;m ready and raring to go now.</li>
            <li>This seems to be working very well.</li>
            <li>Grapefruit scent is very pleasing, and it does give an aromatherapy effect.</li>
            <li>This is very reassuring to me.</li>
            <li>The delivery was really fast.</li>
            <li>and it sounded promising.  </li>
            <li>Highly reccomended!</li>
            <li>I am a pretty big skeptic and I do dry brushing a lot on my own</li>
            <li>I had originally got this cellulite sponge for its scent because I am such a fan of vanilla and tea</li>
            <li>I wanted to see whether it was effective, so the first three weeks I thoroughly massaged one side (leg, upper leg...) and not the other.</li>
            <li>After a little over a month the cellulite has almost all disappeared and the skin is so soft and looks amazing.</li>
            <li>After a little over a 2 weeks the cellulite has almost all disappeared and the skin is so soft and looks amazing.</li>
            <li>I guess I just have to live with it!</li>
            <li>The sponge itself feels nice against the skin, and the textured side doesn&#x27;t &#x27;go soft&#x27; after a few uses.</li>
            <li>But not only that, the ingredients are very powerful because this product has worked so well for me so far.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend using this.</li>
            <li>There is a rough side and a smooth side</li>
            <li>and I absolutely adore the way the scrub brush side makes my skin feel alive.  </li>
            <li>Just keep it clean and dry after each time</li>
            <li>My skin feels a lot more firm.</li>
            <li>Please try this anti-cellulite product before considering more expensive treatments, because the results are just fantastic.</li>
            <li>This product makes it easy by incorporating it into something we all do everyday- shower.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty normally sized, too, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to have the impacts of some major obese to twig transformation, just to get rid of the bumpy cellulite area above the knee.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a smart solution.</li>
            <li>After only a couple weeks, I&#x27;ve noticed some of my more troubling areas have cleared up a little.</li>
            <li>I live an active life, work out regularly and eat as healthy as possible, but my thighs/buttocks have been increasingly plagued with cellulite.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Results: In about 9 weeks the cellulite on my thighs has nearly disappeared.</li>
            <li>-- I found something identical at ULTA for nearly $10 less.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product really works, you have to use it daily.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first but after reading the reviews i had to try it, and im glad i did.</li>
            <li>It smells good, and the results I’ve seen over the past few weeks I’ve been using it has been swell.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and applying it daily does result in toner legs</li>
            <li>Before I started using the cellulite cream in this sponge I loathed any sort of tight form fitting clothes or revealing clothes that would highlight the saggy dimpled skin on my hips and other areas.</li>
            <li>I was pretty skeptical about this product, mostly because of its low cost.</li>
            <li>It last along time and is not messy after each use.</li>
            <li>I really like this product a lot -- and you definitely see a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I had was the price</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t tell you how frustrating it was to feel like I wasn&#x27;t enjoying the fruits of all the work I put into it.</li>
            <li>Performing the &#x27;Lipo-Massage&#x27; with the textured side feels really relaxing, and you can actually rub pretty hard without damaging the sponge.</li>
            <li>Maybe it does for other people, but absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li>I have very soft skin, maybe other people&#x27;s skin is not so sensitive, but it actually hurts mine.  </li>
            <li>Smell is great, no improvement in cellulite though :(</li>
            <li>I had previously purchased another product that said it would get rid of my cellulite that didn&#x27;t work and was really just a fancy soap.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it my inner thighs bled a little!  </li>

            <li> Thanks for a great product....</li>
            <li> oh yes, definetly love this .</li>
            <li> I have purchased the twin set, this sponge is outstanding</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, I have bought 2 now, one for me and one for a friend.</li>
            <li> One of the most helpful products I have purchased on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soothing, and lathers up great.</li>
            <li> Love the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> Its ok.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance of this (grapefruit)</li>
            <li> Your better off just exfoliating and massaging the skin than using this.</li>
            <li> but I love it.</li>
            <li> but I love how it feels after my shower.</li>
            <li> but I love how it feels on my skin</li>
            <li> Thats why 4 stars.:)</li>
            <li> I like the soap love the smell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure if it&#x27;s working at this point</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s the main reason I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
            <li> And I am really becoming fond of this sponge and its nicest smell, I now cannot even imagine to have a shower without this anti cellulite sponge.</li>
            <li> : It&#x27;s easy and ongoing.</li>
            <li> Not just me, but even my sisters and my mother use this sponge regularly and we all are really happy and satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> This product makes it easy by incorporating it into something we all do every day shower.</li>
            <li> It was very quick and easy to apply without any problems.</li>
            <li> The sponge lathers pretty nicely, so I don&#x27;t feel like they skimped out on the amount of cream which is good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Company is quick shipper too :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast, it&#x27;s easy, and it&#x27;s effective.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, using this product hasn&#x27;t changed my lifestyle at all.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth after every shower though.</li>
            <li> However, with this shower sponge, I feel like the ingredients are… well really and effective, because I’ve seen results from this ever since I tried it out.</li>
            <li> Thought I had found something to fit the bill in this &amp;#34;anti-cellulite&amp;#34; sponge</li>
            <li> It keeps up a great lather and doesn&#x27;t rip like other sponges after many uses.</li>
            <li> I think I might even get her into a two piece swimsuit this summer thanks to this easy to use product.  :-)</li>
            <li> It smells great and lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, the results are just fantastic: my skin became so smooth and soft after using this sponge.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything for my cellulite- creams, skin rollers, special massages...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a real money saver that you can get more than 20 washes out of these sponges.</li>
            <li> BUT, it&#x27;s also full of chemicals.</li>
            <li> Only plus is that it does smell good.</li>
            <li> let&#x27;s be real folks, exercise and eat healthy and that will work bette.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve constantly tried different anti-cellulite products and without a doubt this is the best product I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a mild exfoliator.</li>
            <li> First of all, I wanna say THANK YOU to the creators of this product for creating such an amazing Anti-Cellulite Cream and Sponge!</li>
            <li> and i could see results quickly.</li>
            <li> Saying she looks 10 years younger, and feels better as a result of looking better.  </li>
            <li> Smells lovely, is exfoliating and refreshing and actually does what is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I have an otherwise pretty fit body</li>
            <li> Using it every time I take a shower was easy and the product really worked for me.</li>
            <li> The only thing that was nice about this sponge is that the soap stays for a very long time and smells good.</li>
            <li> Still a great little massage in the morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied, and I think I&#x27;ll be buying this product as long as it&#x27;s around.</li>
            <li> I will keep buying this stuff and definitely worth $19.00.</li>
            <li> I really do enjoy the Vanilla Orchid Black Tea scent and it is really nice and relaxing as a massage with the sponge.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, even over long periods of time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I simply just use this as I would any other sponge, enjoy the grapefruit scent, enjoy a nice relaxing massage with the sponge, and watch my cellulite disappear and stay away.</li>
            <li> It worked exactly as it is intended too.</li>
            <li> I’ve been using this product regularly, which is more like twice a week, and used a cellulite sponge to lather it up.  </li>
            <li> I love the scent and decided to make a second purchase and now trying the Grapefruit sponge.</li>
            <li> sure enough those pockets of fleshy bumps – still there.</li>
            <li> but now I can finally say I love the skin I&#x27;m in</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this faithfully for 11 weeks and it is the first product I have found that does reduce the appearance of cellulite</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> so you will want to alternate and rub the areas most desired in a circular motion.</li>
            <li> , i recommend them for any buyer who seeking good quality results while not making a load of extra work for there selves, i mean you have knock off cremes, but there nothing compared to the real deal here love it</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it on a daily basis as the results can only get better!</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Very relaxing fragrance.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to show that off; no matter how much work I put into my body those spots just wouldn&#x27;t budge.</li>
            <li> Bring it on bikini season; I&#x27;m ready and raring to go now.</li>
            <li> This seems to be working very well.</li>
            <li> Grapefruit scent is very pleasing, and it does give an aromatherapy effect.</li>
            <li> This is very reassuring to me.</li>
            <li> The delivery was really fast.</li>
            <li> and it sounded promising.  </li>
            <li> Highly reccomended!</li>
            <li> I am a pretty big skeptic and I do dry brushing a lot on my own</li>
            <li> I had originally got this cellulite sponge for its scent because I am such a fan of vanilla and tea</li>
            <li> I wanted to see whether it was effective, so the first three weeks I thoroughly massaged one side (leg, upper leg...) and not the other.</li>
            <li> After a little over a month the cellulite has almost all disappeared and the skin is so soft and looks amazing.</li>
            <li> After a little over a 2 weeks the cellulite has almost all disappeared and the skin is so soft and looks amazing.</li>
            <li> I guess I just have to live with it!</li>
            <li> The sponge itself feels nice against the skin, and the textured side doesn&#x27;t &#x27;go soft&#x27; after a few uses.</li>
            <li> But not only that, the ingredients are very powerful because this product has worked so well for me so far.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend using this.</li>
            <li> There is a rough side and a smooth side</li>
            <li> and I absolutely adore the way the scrub brush side makes my skin feel alive.  </li>
            <li> Just keep it clean and dry after each time</li>
            <li> My skin feels a lot more firm.</li>
            <li> Please try this anti-cellulite product before considering more expensive treatments, because the results are just fantastic.</li>
            <li> This product makes it easy by incorporating it into something we all do everyday- shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty normally sized, too, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to have the impacts of some major obese to twig transformation, just to get rid of the bumpy cellulite area above the knee.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a smart solution.</li>
            <li> After only a couple weeks, I&#x27;ve noticed some of my more troubling areas have cleared up a little.</li>
            <li> I live an active life, work out regularly and eat as healthy as possible, but my thighs/buttocks have been increasingly plagued with cellulite.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Results: In about 9 weeks the cellulite on my thighs has nearly disappeared.</li>
            <li> -- I found something identical at ULTA for nearly $10 less.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product really works, you have to use it daily.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but after reading the reviews i had to try it, and im glad i did.</li>
            <li> It smells good, and the results I’ve seen over the past few weeks I’ve been using it has been swell.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and applying it daily does result in toner legs</li>
            <li> Before I started using the cellulite cream in this sponge I loathed any sort of tight form fitting clothes or revealing clothes that would highlight the saggy dimpled skin on my hips and other areas.</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical about this product, mostly because of its low cost.</li>
            <li> It last along time and is not messy after each use.</li>
            <li> I really like this product a lot -- and you definitely see a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I had was the price</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t tell you how frustrating it was to feel like I wasn&#x27;t enjoying the fruits of all the work I put into it.</li>
            <li> Performing the &#x27;Lipo-Massage&#x27; with the textured side feels really relaxing, and you can actually rub pretty hard without damaging the sponge.</li>
            <li> Maybe it does for other people, but absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li> I have very soft skin, maybe other people&#x27;s skin is not so sensitive, but it actually hurts mine.  </li>
            <li> Smell is great, no improvement in cellulite though :(</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased another product that said it would get rid of my cellulite that didn&#x27;t work and was really just a fancy soap.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it my inner thighs bled a little!  </li>
            <li> Pretty much just an expensive loofah.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> and it will last quite long.</li>
            <li> Didnt last for as long as I thought in terms of foaming</li>
            <li> the soap and lather last a long time.</li>
            <li> Should have never listened to the positive reviews vs the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> After a month of daily use, I saw no real difference.</li>
            <li> They let you know that you&#x27;re suppose to commit to using the Anti-Cellulite Cream Sponge for as long as you want to keep cellulite under control.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t too long after I started using it that I noticed results!</li>
            <li> I did pilates three times a week and yoga every other day for over a year trying to get them to tighten up and was constantly wearing baggy clothes.</li>
            <li> I am a medical esthetician and I believe on the power of lymphatic drainage and active ingredients.</li>
            <li> Also not sure if there is any result as to cellulite so far I don&#x27;t see it.</li>
            <li> I just massage the cream into my skin for a few minutes during my daily shower.</li>
            <li> The sponge is actually so rough</li>
            <li> Bought the grapefruit-scented anti-cellulite sponge a few months back.</li>
            <li> Some ppl find the sponge too rough</li>
            <li> which is why I ordered it in the Grapefruit Zest Pink Pepper scent.</li>
            <li> Another total waste of money.</li>
            <li> The other side of the sponge is not so rough, so I can use it that way.  </li>
            <li> No difference from one leg to the other, and no difference over time.</li>
            <li> Other creams and products I&#x27;ve used are advertised as permanent solutions that miraculously defeat your cellulite forever.</li>
            <li> At first, she didn&#x27;t think this was going to help, but she was proven wrong by the results.</li>
            <li> Its just a sponge that you can get at any other store with soap in it.</li>
            <li> I still have it but much less.</li>
            <li> The cellulite on my legs are smoothing out and way less.</li>
            <li> , I noticed that my cellulite is a lot less noticeable</li>
            <li> My skin is tighter and noticeably less cellulite-y..</li>
            <li> Does it work for celcullite, it probably does over time like say 9 months, but it&#x27;s no quick fix for cellculite...</li>
            <li> For the record, I also paired with exercise and a decent (not perfect diet).</li>
            <li> I have a bad case of cellulite on my &#x27;back side&#x27; and the back of my upper thighs, have since I can remember.</li>
            <li> Try to use this ritually as intended and it has helped a little but nothing drastic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d lose a little bit of weight but</li>
            <li> No more smelly, ineffective creams, no more skin suction devices that pinch, and no more cellulite coming back after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Both caffeine and seaweed have been shown to firm up skin and reduce thigh measurements.</li>
            <li> The ingredients in this product are scientifically proven to help firm your skin.</li>
            <li> Petrolatum to name a few.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been just a few weeks since using this product and I can already see the results.</li>
            <li> and I read a few of the reviews</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant about trying another cellulite product that claimed it would help improve my ugly cellulite, buy</li>
            <li> Yeah....this was a positively ridiculous waste of money.</li>
            <li> Well, it is NOT effective.</li>
            <li> With the minimal amount of cellulite I carry, I&#x27;m sad to say this product did not work for me when used as directed.</li>
            <li> This stuff actually made the cellulite and soft skin worst.</li>
            <li> The negative - IT DIDN&#x27;T WORK.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t work like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can actually feel the soap work into my skin and feel it work away all the nasty fat.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when purchasing this product, but when a friend recommended it to me I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have not seen any difference.  </li>
            <li> I hate to leave negative feedback but</li>
            <li> Worst waste of money ever.</li>
            <li> my cellulite is not even that bad.</li>
            <li> Too bad.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Horrible product and does not work at all.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Well, it is NOT effective. After a month of daily use, I saw no real difference. I wanted to see whether it was effective, so the first three weeks I thoroughly massaged one side (leg, upper leg...) and not the other. No difference from one leg to the other, and no difference over time. It does smell really nice, and in terms of the product--it didn&#x27;t break or fall apart. It just doesn&#x27;t have an impact on cellulite. For the record, I also paired with exercise and a decent (not perfect diet). I&#x27;m pretty normally sized, too, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to have the impacts of some major obese to twig transformation, just to get rid of the bumpy cellulite area above the knee. Sigh. Oh well. I guess I just have to live with it!</li>
            <li> 1 bought 3 it was a waste of money. I am a medical esthetician and I believe on the power of lymphatic drainage and active ingredients. I used these faithfully until all 3 were gone and they did not work. I am 5&#x27; 8 and 150 pounds my cellulite is not even that bad.</li>
            <li> I think it got rid of some cellulite, but not the most drastic thing I have ever seen. BUT it was a great scrubber and hassle free with the soap inside already.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see no results!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all about the caffeine, and that&#x27;s why I bought this product. I have tried everything for my cellulite- creams, skin rollers, special massages...none of these things worked for me long-term. I started looking into why and realized it was probably two things- the ingredients of the products I used, and that I only used these treatments for the short-term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: The Anti-Cellulite Cream in the Sponge contains caffeine and seaweed. If you want to find out if a product works, you have to research studies with its ingredients. Both caffeine and seaweed have been shown to firm up skin and reduce thigh measurements. Since this product contains both in good amounts, there&#x27;s no reason it shouldn&#x27;t work to some degree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Method of Use: It&#x27;s easy and ongoing. You have to keep using it to keep the results. This is the only way to battle cellulite. Fortunately, using this product hasn&#x27;t changed my lifestyle at all. I just massage the cream into my skin for a few minutes during my daily shower. Massaging helps increase circulation to the skin, so this method of delivery makes sense. Very easy to use, even over long periods of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results: In about 9 weeks the cellulite on my thighs has nearly disappeared. I still have it but much less. I will be using this sponge to maintain my results.</li>
            <li> Good as an exfoliating sponge but too soon to say if it&#x27;s working regarding the cellulite. My skin feels smooth after every shower though.</li>
            <li> smoother, no cellulite difference tho</li>
            <li> I ordered this and I was hoping it would work for me. The results have been amazing! One of the greatest purchases I have made I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t order it sooner.  Also the cream smells really good and I enjoyed using it. After a little over a month the cellulite has almost all disappeared and the skin is so soft and looks amazing. The results have been great and it was incredibly easy to use.</li>
            <li> i saw great results of this product on my gf. help to your gf to have the best body ever!</li>
            <li> Try to use this ritually as intended and it has helped a little but nothing drastic. Is still a good exfoliater that smells good and is generous with product. Would keep buying.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and I was hoping it would work for me since I have a lot of cellulite.  One of the greatest purchases I have made I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t order it sooner. Also the cream smells really good and I really enjoyed using it. After a little over a 2 weeks the cellulite has almost all disappeared and the skin is so soft and looks amazing. The results have been great and it was incredibly easy to use. The results have been amazing! I recommend it for all women.</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical about this product, mostly because of its low cost. Products like this are often just strong-smelling soaps disguised at wondrous solutions to our beauty problems. This one is different, though, and I think it shows in the way the product is presented. They let you know that you&#x27;re suppose to commit to using the Anti-Cellulite Cream Sponge for as long as you want to keep cellulite under control. Other creams and products I&#x27;ve used are advertised as permanent solutions that miraculously defeat your cellulite forever. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t work like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is actually the perfect solution to the problem. As stated, clinical trials have shown which ingredients work and that they work only when used regularly. This product makes it easy by incorporating it into something we all do everyday- shower. I simply just use this as I would any other sponge, enjoy the grapefruit scent, enjoy a nice relaxing massage with the sponge, and watch my cellulite disappear and stay away. It&#x27;s such a smart solution. No more smelly, ineffective creams, no more skin suction devices that pinch, and no more cellulite coming back after a few weeks. I&#x27;m very satisfied, and I think I&#x27;ll be buying this product as long as it&#x27;s around.</li>
            <li> I love this sponge. It feels great and smells so good on the skin. It last along time and is not messy after each use. Will be buying this product  going forward. Company is quick shipper too :) Thanks</li>
            <li> With the minimal amount of cellulite I carry, I&#x27;m sad to say this product did not work for me when used as directed.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend and she has loved it. She told me how amazing it is and that&#x27;s enough for me. She would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Totally in love with the scent of this sponge!! Very relaxing fragrance. For me it is a perfect anti-cellulite fighter. Not just me, but even my sisters and my mother use this sponge regularly and we all are really happy and satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream daily for a couple weeks now and have noticed that my thigh&#x27;s been reducing! This product is nothing but amazing! I use it every time while I shower and it feels extremely great!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend was looking for something to reduce her cellulite. At first, she didn&#x27;t think this was going to help, but she was proven wrong by the results. She feels better about the way she looks now.</li>
            <li> i tested these out for my gf there nice, i recommend them for any buyer who seeking good quality results while not making a load of extra work for there selves, i mean you have knock off cremes, but there nothing compared to the real deal here love it</li>
            <li> Did not work for me. Very disappointing. No noticeable changes at all.</li>
            <li> I am using the product every day....I have noticed no change in the cellulite on my anterior and posterior thighs.&lt;br /&gt;After reading the reviews I thought it would be a good product....The soap and lather it produces is wonderful but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. It worked exactly as it is intended too. I was blown away by the results I got from this product. I would definitely recommend everyone to give this product I try, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I am a pretty big skeptic and I do dry brushing a lot on my own but I find whatever combo of ingredients is included in this sponge it has actually helped to lighten up the puckers in my leg. The scent is nice and my skin feels nice and tone after use.  I am definitely going to reorder.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s working. I haven&#x27;t seen  any changes but I will continue using it. It could be sold for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> This is a great eye opener in the morning.  I love the smell.  It does not seem to do anything for my cellulite though.  Too bad.  Still a great little massage in the morning.</li>
            <li> Many of the cellulite soaps I’ve tried have just been disguised through fake advertising and misread ingredients. However, with this shower sponge, I feel like the ingredients are… well really and effective, because I’ve seen results from this ever since I tried it out. I like the fact that it requires you to use an Anti-Cellulite Sponge to help keep cellulite away. I’ve been using this product regularly, which is more like twice a week, and used a cellulite sponge to lather it up.  This product makes it easy by incorporating it into something we all do every day shower. I really do enjoy the Vanilla Orchid Black Tea scent and it is really nice and relaxing as a massage with the sponge. I have tried the massage on my thighs where my cellulite is located. I can actually feel the soap work into my skin and feel it work away all the nasty fat. The textured side smooths out my skin and it makes me feel great. I’ve been able to get the cellulite off me and keep it away.  I’m really satisfied with the results and the product itself.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Vanilla Orchid and noticed a difference within 4 days. I love the scent and decided to make a second purchase and now trying the Grapefruit sponge. My skin feels a lot more firm. I will continue to use it on a daily basis as the results can only get better!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to get rid of some unwanted cellulite I have. I had previously purchased another product that said it would get rid of my cellulite that didn&#x27;t work and was really just a fancy soap. I was skeptical when purchasing this product, but when a friend recommended it to me I decided to try it. The decision is one that I don&#x27;t regret. The ingredients in this product are scientifically proven to help firm your skin. Using it every time I take a shower was easy and the product really worked for me. It wasn&#x27;t too long after I started using it that I noticed results!</li>
            <li> Before I started using the cellulite cream in this sponge I loathed any sort of tight form fitting clothes or revealing clothes that would highlight the saggy dimpled skin on my hips and other areas. Are you kidding me? I didn&#x27;t want to show that off; no matter how much work I put into my body those spots just wouldn&#x27;t budge. I did pilates three times a week and yoga every other day for over a year trying to get them to tighten up and was constantly wearing baggy clothes. I have an otherwise pretty fit body and I can&#x27;t tell you how frustrating it was to feel like I wasn&#x27;t enjoying the fruits of all the work I put into it. If there was a fad diet out there, I tried it. I did the juice cleanses and fasts, and paleo and I&#x27;d lose a little bit of weight but sure enough those pockets of fleshy bumps – still there. If I hadn&#x27;t found this cream I&#x27;d have probably resorted to getting lipo but now I can finally say I love the skin I&#x27;m in and you can&#x27;t get me into baggy jeans now. Bring it on bikini season; I&#x27;m ready and raring to go now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve constantly tried different anti-cellulite products and without a doubt this is the best product I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking of buying some more. They are making some of my lumps disappear.  I love the feel and smell of the sponge.  Such a simplier way to rid cellulite..Thanks for a great product....</li>
            <li> oh yes, definetly love this .</li>
            <li> I really like this product a lot -- and you definitely see a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I had was the price -- I found something identical at ULTA for nearly $10 less.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy again -- but not for the price listed.</li>
            <li> I got this for my friend who has had three children and she loves the results.  It is making her cellulite disappear and boosting her confidence.  I think I might even get her into a two piece swimsuit this summer thanks to this easy to use product.  :-)</li>
            <li> This product really works, you have to use it daily. I message the sponge in a circular motion vigorously on my legs and after a week I started noticing my legs looked contoured. The cellulite on my legs are smoothing out and way less. This is a keeper and will definitely purchase again when I run out. Great product does exactly what it advertise to do. I highly recommend this product and applying it daily does result in toner legs additionally the fat deposits start disappearing. I alternate with a seeweed scrub that you can make at home. Great stuff.  Update I have purchased the twin set, this sponge is outstanding I can&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> I like this product but it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I hate to leave negative feedback but no improve ments</li>
            <li> I have a bad case of cellulite on my &#x27;back side&#x27; and the back of my upper thighs, have since I can remember. I&#x27;m 46 and a size 6, work out 5 days a week. I&#x27;ve been using this faithfully for 11 weeks and it is the first product I have found that does reduce the appearance of cellulite, however, I would not say 90%. I&#x27;ll continue to use this because any reduction in my case is good.</li>
            <li> I love this bath sponge!  It smells great and lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant about trying another cellulite product that claimed it would help improve my ugly cellulite, buy I have to say I am truly impressed with this sponge. I started using it the day I received it and that was almost 9 weeks ago!!! I have to say there is a definite improvement in the appearance of my cellulite and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I will never be without this product for the rest of my life!!!</li>
            <li> This seems to be working very well. I am very satisfied with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have not seen any difference.  The sponge is actually so rough it hurts my skin to rub it in like they suggest.  The first time I used it my inner thighs bled a little!  I have very soft skin, maybe other people&#x27;s skin is not so sensitive, but it actually hurts mine.  The fragrance of grapefruit is okay, but nothing spectacular by any means.  I still have some soap left in the sponge and I will continue to use it until it&#x27;s gone just because I paid for it, not because it works.  The other side of the sponge is not so rough, so I can use it that way.  It&#x27;s like a mild exfoliator.</li>
            <li> I had originally got this cellulite sponge for its scent because I am such a fan of vanilla and tea it is like the perfect combo. But not only that, the ingredients are very powerful because this product has worked so well for me so far. It smells good, and the results I’ve seen over the past few weeks I’ve been using it has been swell. Please try this anti-cellulite product before considering more expensive treatments, because the results are just fantastic.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, I have bought 2 now, one for me and one for a friend. It works so well for me and my friend loves it too! I will keep buying this stuff and definitely worth $19.00.</li>
            <li> This product does nothing to cellulite. Its just a sponge that you can get at any other store with soap in it. The only thing that was nice about this sponge is that the soap stays for a very long time and smells good.</li>
            <li> This... doesn&#x27;t do anything. Maybe it does for other people, but absolutely nothing for me. Pretty much just an expensive loofah.</li>
            <li> I tried as instructions, it doesn&#x27;t remove or improve cellulite, but smell good, I took pictures before and after to compare, no difference at all</li>
            <li> As a working mother, I can&#x27;t appreciate products like this enough. It&#x27;s fast, it&#x27;s easy, and it&#x27;s effective. It&#x27;s also a great value. It&#x27;s a real money saver that you can get more than 20 washes out of these sponges. Even without the cellulite-diminishing benefits, this sponge packs a lot of power. It keeps up a great lather and doesn&#x27;t rip like other sponges after many uses. I&#x27;m about to pass 15 washes with my sponge and it works as great as the first time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Grapefruit scent is very pleasing, and it does give an aromatherapy effect. The sponge lathers pretty nicely, so I don&#x27;t feel like they skimped out on the amount of cream which is good.&lt;br /&gt;Durability is great, as I described before. The sponge itself feels nice against the skin, and the textured side doesn&#x27;t &#x27;go soft&#x27; after a few uses. Performing the &#x27;Lipo-Massage&#x27; with the textured side feels really relaxing, and you can actually rub pretty hard without damaging the sponge. After only a couple weeks, I&#x27;ve noticed some of my more troubling areas have cleared up a little. This is very reassuring to me. I plan to use the sponge through week 8 and see what happens.</li>
            <li> I dont see any changement...</li>
            <li> Yeah....this was a positively ridiculous waste of money. I used it each morning in the shower and it did nothing to reduce the appearance of cellulite in my thighs.</li>
            <li> Scent is over powering. I was looking for a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; solution with seaweed extract and caffeine. Thought I had found something to fit the bill in this &amp;#34;anti-cellulite&amp;#34; sponge BUT, it&#x27;s also full of chemicals. Propylene Glycol, Sodium Stearate, sodium Laurel Sulfate, Sodium Laurate, Sodium Chloride, Petrolatum to name a few.</li>
            <li> Horrible product and does not work at all. Worst waste of money ever. Buyer beware. Should have never listened to the positive reviews vs the negative reviews. Only plus is that it does smell good.</li>
            <li> One of the most helpful products I have purchased on Amazon. It really works! I would recommend this product to anyone. It smells really good and is very nice to use. Will definitely purchase this product again in the future.</li>
            <li> Bought the grapefruit-scented anti-cellulite sponge a few months back. The delivery was really fast. Most importantly, the results are just fantastic: my skin became so smooth and soft after using this sponge. It&#x27;s a must have product for all the women out there especially during dryer times of the year.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I noticed that my cellulite is a lot less noticeable and that&#x27;s the main reason I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
            <li> First of all, I wanna say THANK YOU to the creators of this product for creating such an amazing Anti-Cellulite Cream and Sponge! It&#x27;s been just a few weeks since using this product and I can already see the results. And I am really becoming fond of this sponge and its nicest smell, I now cannot even imagine to have a shower without this anti cellulite sponge. Totally obsessed with it:)</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these sponges. I gave one to my daughter. The smell is amazing. It&#x27;s very soothing, and lathers up great. There is a rough side and a smooth side so you will want to alternate and rub the areas most desired in a circular motion.</li>
            <li> After doing tons of research on the best treatments for reducing cellulite and skin firming, i found this. I was skeptical at first but after reading the reviews i had to try it, and im glad i did. It works great and i could see results quickly. It was very quick and easy to apply without any problems. i highly recommend using this.</li>
            <li> Just started using a couple of weeks ago. Seems to be helping with cellulite. Love the way it feels on my skin. Very refreshing. I am placing another order! I am a fan!</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my mother-in-law as she is always complaining about various cellulite issues.  For under $20 I couldn&#x27;t pass this up and I read a few of the reviews and it sounded promising.  I got it, gave it to her as a gift and she has just been raving about it non-stop.  Saying she looks 10 years younger, and feels better as a result of looking better.  Based on her results and her feedback I&#x27;d say this is a great deal!</li>
            <li> Its ok. Smell is great, no improvement in cellulite though :( so in that case, i dont see myself buying it again.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance of this (grapefruit) and I absolutely adore the way the scrub brush side makes my skin feel alive.  I am going to continue using it, as I have seen changes and am looking forward to getting rid of these unwanted potholes...</li>
            <li> This stuff actually made the cellulite and soft skin worst. Your better off just exfoliating and massaging the skin than using this. Smells great though and has a rich creamy lather.</li>
            <li> So I have experimented with countless products, but this one beats them all! Smells lovely, is exfoliating and refreshing and actually does what is supposed to do. My skin is tighter and noticeably less cellulite-y.. I live an active life, work out regularly and eat as healthy as possible, but my thighs/buttocks have been increasingly plagued with cellulite. After 1 week of use, I already started to see the changes. This will be my 2nd purchase. Some ppl find the sponge too rough but I love it. It also softens after some use. Just keep it clean and dry after each time and it will last quite long. Highly reccomended!</li>
            <li> Two weeks using it, I didn&#x27;t see any improvements in my skin but I love how it feels after my shower. I will update later if I see changes.</li>
            <li> I like this Sponge, very effective. Didnt last for as long as I thought in terms of foaming but I love how it feels on my skin so I am ordering another one! Also not sure if there is any result as to cellulite so far I don&#x27;t see it. Thats why 4 stars.:)</li>
            <li> This product claims to &amp;#34;Visibly reduces the appearance of cellulite (orange peel skin), helps decrease fat deposits and water retention on the affected area of the skin and decreases in appearance of cellulite of up to 90% in 8-weeks&amp;#34; which is why I ordered it in the Grapefruit Zest Pink Pepper scent. The pros are - it had fast delivery, a pleasant scent, the rougher surface of the sponge feels good and the soap and lather last a long time. The negative - IT DIDN&#x27;T WORK. Another total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I like the soap love the smell I&#x27;m sure if it&#x27;s working at this point</li>
            <li> I liked this sponge alot. Would probably order again. Does it work for celcullite, it probably does over time like say 9 months, but it&#x27;s no quick fix for cellculite...let&#x27;s be real folks, exercise and eat healthy and that will work bette.</li>
