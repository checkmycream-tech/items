            <li>The packaging was perfect to keep this from happening.</li>
            <li>but it was not in excellent shape or even great shape,</li>
            <li>Great color</li>
            <li>Was delighted to find it on Amazon since it isn&#x27;t in stores anymore.</li>
            <li>Always loved CoverGirl enhancers.</li>
            <li>It is a nice neutral color and good for highlighting.  </li>
            <li>Mine came with three for some reason, the color and coverage is nice, and its a good deal</li>
            <li>Love this eye shadow!</li>
            <li>Love this eyeshadow!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>The color though is really nice.</li>
            <li>Accurate description!</li>
            <li>PLEASED WITH THE PURCHASED, FULLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li>Color is magnificent and a daily choice I go to!  </li>
            <li>My favorite eye shadow EVER.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love the color</li>
            <li>I love the CoverGirl Eye Enhancers shadows, but this color isn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love the consistency, staying power and ease of application, though.</li>
            <li>the color was true to shade as well; the perfect champagne shimmer for a pop in the inner eye or a neutral look</li>
            <li>Perfect when blended well with other shadows.</li>
            <li>Contacted Amazon for a replacement, got a very quick response and</li>
            <li>The color in the case looks darker than it is (more like a light tan,) but goes on way too light for my liking.</li>
            <li>It blends in beautifully and doesn&#x27;t look too white and shiny.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice color, goes on nicely, very shimmery!</li>
            <li>I was nervous ordering this shade because of previous reviews saying it was to shimmery or too light, but I found it perfect!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait until my wife gets these fantastic pens.</li>
            <li>It can also be worn on the lid for a light,</li>
            <li>I had a coupon for this, so I ended up getting it for free.</li>
            <li>A great purchase if you use the same color and stockpile.</li>
            <li>I enjoy it.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of different light shadows on the brow bone and this has to be the best one so far.  </li>
            <li>, it really could&#x27;ve happened anywhere, and for a free product I can&#x27;t really complain, I just added some rubbing alcohol to it and let it dry, and now it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li>good color, little sheen but its defnitely more &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; as oppossed to &amp;#34;champagne&amp;#34; like the name suggests</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super glimmer-y,</li>
            <li>Super staying power</li>
            <li>A quality product, good price, perfect for a basic or professional make up, and you can mix it with dark shadows for day and night</li>
            <li>Pretty shade!</li>
            <li>but the price is right</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all right product.</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of highlight.</li>
            <li>You can also wear it in the inner corners of your eyes to make you look more awake.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and looks natural.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first eye enhancer, but the price is a steal.</li>
            <li>I like the color a lot, really shiny!</li>
            <li>Love this color of highlight and have used it for a long time.  </li>
            <li>but it is much</li>
            <li>Packaged very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent highlight shade, but could be a little more on the &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; side.</li>
            <li>Love the neutral and the shimmer  can wear it everyday and look glowing but not all done up.</li>
            <li>It looks natural enough with just a hint of shimmer to bring out your eyes.  </li>
            <li>I received broken eye shadow, replacement I got for it was not broken like the first one</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I received broken eye shadow, replacement I got for it was not broken like the first one</li>
            <li> Wasnt shipped very carefully, the entire eye shadow was broken up and all over the inside of the case, but since it still works, i didnt bother returning it, love the color.</li>
            <li> I bought with a coupon and paid significantly less than I would have normally.  </li>
            <li> I am very pale so this color basically shows up just shimmery, which is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Had a small hick up, the first one that can was a broken, wasn&#x27;t much packaging in the box to protect it from getting tossed around.</li>
            <li> Goes on even, good neutral base color.</li>
            <li> Expected it to be a shade darker.</li>
            <li> The color, pigment and application are as expected.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the product came damaged.</li>
            <li> I would not buy this again, not worth saving the dollar.</li>
            <li> Wish it lasted a little longer but doesn&#x27;t crease.</li>
            <li> but it can wash you out if you have a lighter skin tone, or look a little too harsh with a darker skin tone.  </li>
            <li> This item showed up broken to my house and besides that was very chalky and dusty...</li>
            <li> and I really do not like the look of it unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Usually I am worried that these will come to me broken, but this wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Item was poorly wrapped so when I received the eye shadow it had been shattered from just bouncing around in the box.</li>
            <li> Not a happy girl receiving this purchase.:</li>
            <li> It showed up broken, but I don&#x27;t blame cover girl</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t used this product your crazy.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed getting this product.....broken upon receipt....</li>
            <li> I got this to be a base shadow and to no have eyeliner creases</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is terrible...</li>
            <li> it creases horribly, doesn&#x27;t stay on,</li>

            <li> PLEASED WITH THE PURCHASED, FULLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> Love this color of highlight and have used it for a long time.  Was delighted to find it on Amazon since it isn&#x27;t in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> Color is magnificent and a daily choice I go to!  Only problem is it does crease by the end of the day, every day...but the price is right</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all right product. Expected it to be a shade darker. Too much white undertone.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for!! Accurate description! Great product! Will do business with again!! Can&#x27;t wait until my wife gets these fantastic pens.</li>
            <li> This shadow is the perfect shade to wear under the brow bone.  It blends in beautifully and doesn&#x27;t look too white and shiny.  It looks natural enough with just a hint of shimmer to bring out your eyes.  You can also wear it in the inner corners of your eyes to make you look more awake.  I have tried a lot of different light shadows on the brow bone and this has to be the best one so far.  It can also be worn on the lid for a light, shimmery effect but it can wash you out if you have a lighter skin tone, or look a little too harsh with a darker skin tone.  Perfect when blended well with other shadows.</li>
            <li> I had a coupon for this, so I ended up getting it for free. I didn&#x27;t realize it, but this product actually came with three. A great purchase if you use the same color and stockpile.</li>
            <li> Item was poorly wrapped so when I received the eye shadow it had been shattered from just bouncing around in the box. The color though is really nice.</li>
            <li> A quality product, good price, perfect for a basic or professional make up, and you can mix it with dark shadows for day and night</li>
            <li> Love this eye shadow! The only complaint I have is that the product came damaged.</li>
            <li> Pretty shade! Wish it lasted a little longer but doesn&#x27;t crease.</li>
            <li> This is terrible...it&#x27;s going in the trash.  It&#x27;s super glimmer-y, it creases horribly, doesn&#x27;t stay on, flakes, powdery...just overall not what you will want.  I got this to be a base shadow and to no have eyeliner creases and it does not work....</li>
            <li> I specifically got this eye shadow because I thought it was matte and had not shine to it but it is much shinier,(not shimmery) than I thought it would be and I really do not like the look of it unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and looks natural. Packaged very well.</li>
            <li> I use to highlight my browbone.  The color, pigment and application are as expected.  I bought with a coupon and paid significantly less than I would have normally.  It is a nice neutral color and good for highlighting.  I will likely continue to buy.</li>
            <li> I think this eye enhancer does just what it says. I enjoy it. It&#x27;s my first eye enhancer, but the price is a steal.</li>
            <li> perfectly packaged! shadow wasn&#x27;t damaged at all in shipment. the color was true to shade as well; the perfect champagne shimmer for a pop in the inner eye or a neutral look</li>
            <li> Mine came with three for some reason, the color and coverage is nice, and its a good deal</li>
            <li> Love this eyeshadow! didnt flack or come off and made my eyes look brighter!</li>
            <li> My favorite eye shadow EVER. Love the neutral and the shimmer  can wear it everyday and look glowing but not all done up. Had a small hick up, the first one that can was a broken, wasn&#x27;t much packaging in the box to protect it from getting tossed around. Contacted Amazon for a replacement, got a very quick response and they where helpful as always.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Super staying power</li>
            <li> I received broken eye shadow, replacement I got for it was not broken like the first one but it was not in excellent shape or even great shape, like it would have been had I just bought it at the store. I would not buy this again, not worth saving the dollar.</li>
            <li> I like the color a lot, really shiny!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed getting this product.....broken upon receipt....just powder. I had to throw out! Not a happy girl receiving this purchase.:(</li>
            <li> Always loved CoverGirl enhancers. If you haven&#x27;t used this product your crazy. Buy it. Use it. Love it. It does miracles like you will never understand!</li>
            <li> Goes on even, good neutral base color. Does have some shimmer.</li>
            <li> Great color but I use it as a highlighter color.</li>
            <li> Love the color but it was delivered to my in pieces.  Can&#x27;t even open.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice color, goes on nicely, very shimmery! It showed up broken, but I don&#x27;t blame cover girl, it really could&#x27;ve happened anywhere, and for a free product I can&#x27;t really complain, I just added some rubbing alcohol to it and let it dry, and now it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> This is a great color to use below your brow line and blend! I was nervous ordering this shade because of previous reviews saying it was to shimmery or too light, but I found it perfect!</li>
            <li> Works as it&#x27;s intended. Just the right amount of highlight.</li>
            <li> Perfect enhancement color</li>
            <li> I love the CoverGirl Eye Enhancers shadows, but this color isn&#x27;t my favorite. The color in the case looks darker than it is (more like a light tan,) but goes on way too light for my liking. It&#x27;s a decent highlight shade, but could be a little more on the &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; side. I love the consistency, staying power and ease of application, though. I just won&#x27;t buy this shade again..</li>
            <li> Usually I am worried that these will come to me broken, but this wasn&#x27;t. The packaging was perfect to keep this from happening. Now, on to the color. I ordered the Champagne which is a shimmery ivory. I use it on the upper brow bone. I am very pale so this color basically shows up just shimmery, which is exactly what I wanted. It lasts all day, even without eye primer too. Can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li> This item showed up broken to my house and besides that was very chalky and dusty... Don&#x27;t recommend you buy it.</li>
            <li> Wasnt shipped very carefully, the entire eye shadow was broken up and all over the inside of the case, but since it still works, i didnt bother returning it, love the color.</li>
            <li> Product came shattered.</li>
            <li> good color, little sheen but its defnitely more &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; as oppossed to &amp;#34;champagne&amp;#34; like the name suggests</li>
