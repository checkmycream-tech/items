            <li>I buy this product locally, I really like it.  </li>
            <li>Formula Fast Absorbing Hand Cream.    </li>

            <li>This REALLY worked out for her.</li>
            <li>It worked very well, unlike anything else on the market.  </li>
            <li>I have severe skin issues on the palms of my hands and even though I am a rep for a certain unnamed home-based business which sells natural skin care products, I buy this Neutrogena Fast Absorbing Hand Cream in bulk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Product arrived with small shipping error.  I contacted the shipper and they resolved the error immediately.  Great service</li>
            <li> This is great lotion for your hands.  It&#x27;s not greasy and it absorbs quickly and leaves your hands feeling soft.  I get dry hands in the winter working in an office and I use this lotion several times a day to keep my hands from hurting.  It lasts for hours with one use.  This multi-pack is great to keep one at work, one at home, etc.</li>
            <li> It absorbs well, no sticky leftover feeling.</li>
            <li> This formula is great, but when I ordered it online, I received the original Norwegian tube, which is too greasy for me.&lt;br /&gt;When I buy this product locally, I really like it.  I wish it came in jars or other container.</li>

            <li> http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E96OBU/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_title    Love this fast drying hand cream. Only product i&#x27;ve ever found to really help my hands. Not sticky and really does dry quickly. I recommend it highly.  Neutorgena Norwegian Formula Fast Absorbing Hand Cream.    I couldnt find it in stores anymore. Tk God for Amazon</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers -- this is a great product for dry skin. I live in northern climes where it&#x27;s cold and dry, and after trying many different moisturizing products, I&#x27;ve found this one to be the best by far.</li>
            <li> Does what it promises: moisturizes dry hands, without leaving them greasy or sticky. Excellent product, have been using it for over 6 months without complaints.</li>
            <li> My only problem was that even though  I purchased two items from Amazon simultaneously, they did not qualify for the advertised free shipping. That seemed somewhat like \\&quot;bait &amp; switch\\&quot; since I could not control which Amazon vendor sold the products. This was not a vendor problem, it is an Amazon problem.</li>
            <li> I got this for my girlfriend who works with her hands on chemicals all day long. This REALLY worked out for her. After using it for just a month, her hands no longer look old and dry. I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding product.  Once applied   it is absorbed rapidly which is very important.   I find this much more useful than the regular  Neutrogena handcream.</li>
            <li> I chalk my hands for climbing so I have really dry hands.  I also wash my hands a lot.  This is by far the best hand lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.  Not greasy.  Absorbs well.</li>
            <li> We found this as a suitable replacement for the apparently discontinued Pacquins. Then, our Walgreens stopped carrying it. I found it at drugstore.com. This is our second four-tube order. We look forward continued smooth hands.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used Neutrogena hand cream for years, finding it to be an excellent and unique product.  It worked very well, unlike anything else on the market.  This new fast absorbing version does not work nearly as well. Besides it has an ordor something like cold cream.  We are very disappointed.</li>

            <li> I love the neutrogena regular hand cream and I use it every night with cotton gloves.  BUT... I wanted something for daytime that was a bit quicker to absorb and not as thick.  This did the trick!  Works just great, lightweight but powerful.</li>
            <li> Wonderful hand cream. Perfectly moisturizes and softens the skin. Only the most pleasant experience. I recommend to all customers, be sure to try it!</li>
            <li> I have begun buying this in quantity and tuck it into traveling bags, pocketbooks and totes. Great product with non-greasy feel and no strong, overpowering fragrance. A real life-saver for dry skin , especially in cold weather.</li>
