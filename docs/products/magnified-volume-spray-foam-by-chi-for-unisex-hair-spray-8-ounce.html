            <li>This product worked great for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>They were great and sent me another one free of charge, but</li>
            <li>Can effectively use to scrunch hair.</li>
            <li>This is kind of pineappley and tropically..</li>
            <li>Works great, worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I love chi products, most of them smell amazing.</li>
            <li>So glad I gave this one a try.</li>
            <li>Thank you Amazon for providing a top notch product that is affordable when ordered through you.</li>
            <li>, it is awesome and actually dispenses!</li>
            <li>Probably not as &amp;#34;foam-like&amp;#34; as it should have been, but mostly usable.</li>
            <li>Love, love this product.  </li>
            <li>The can was basically full, but I couldn&#x27;t get the product out!</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>When I dispensed, it came out kind of liquidy, but I just dealt with it and finished the whole thing.</li>
            <li>First 2 times it sprayed ok.</li>
            <li>I tried running under hot water and using a needle to clean the spray hole, NOTHING!  </li>
            <li>Love this product and all the CHI products so much</li>
            <li>now I have 2 bottles that are full but will not foam.</li>
            <li>I like the Hairspray better ,I really didnt order the right product,</li>
            <li>Makes styling easier and fun.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this volume spray foam product from other sellers on Amazon and have been very pleased.  </li>
            <li>The product is very effective but too much makes hair heavy.</li>
            <li>I love this mousse and this was the second time I&#x27;ve purchased on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for nothing!  </li>
            <li>I have since started using Big Sexy Hair Root Pump Volumizing Spray Mousse http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003X4MQM0/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_3</li>
            <li>but this will give you so much that you have to turn sideways to get out of the door.</li>
            <li>The product itself works really really well.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>So now I have a full can, that has barely been used</li>
            <li>i have ordered twice, the product works perfectly for about a week then the bottle fails and nothing will come out!  </li>
            <li>Volume is good, but the hold is a bit weak.</li>
            <li>This is a very light hairspray but holds your hair in place without looking stiff.  </li>
            <li>but WOW it works!</li>
            <li>Since it just sputtered out as a liquid it was not possible to distribute in hair without leaving it gooey and rather straight.</li>
            <li>The first time, it barely foamed enough for me to use.</li>
            <li>I have tried countless products to add volume and hold to my ultra fine hair without being stiff.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m certain everyone who uses this product feels the same, has had the same experience, and is doing the same thing.</li>
            <li>This problem needs to be fixed immediately because I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for similar products for some time now</li>
            <li>all the other hairsprays seem to be really sticky feeling.  </li>
            <li>I love this product but the last one I ordered and received had a broken sprayer mechanism and is unusable.</li>

            <li> Some do the job for an hour or so, then back to flat.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use this for a long time.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed and very upset that I can&#x27;t exchange because of how it was classified being a hazardous material.  </li>
            <li> Spray all over root, blow dry and BAM!</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair without the sticky and hard as hay feeling for those of us with naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> Such a waste of time.</li>
            <li> Not hair like I expected</li>
            <li> so I am extremely dissatisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will go back to getting it from my hair dresser to avoid the wasted money!  </li>
            <li> I have tried other volumizing products that don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and could only find it at a salon for a ridiculous price.</li>
            <li> I tried using it and it leaves my hair dull and lifeless.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon does not allow returns for this product</li>
            <li> This product is expensive as it is so to only get 2-3 uses per bottle makes it insanely expensive!</li>
            <li> and eventually I will find an equivilant and stop buying this poorly manufactured product.</li>
            <li> do we send this crap back too&amp;#62;&amp;#62;?</li>
            <li> My hair is really thin.  </li>
            <li> Definitely NOT happy with this product!</li>

            <li> While this is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used, my hair is literally horrible without it, the manufacturer needs to fix the issue with the spray spout! 9 out of 10 bottles that I&#x27;ve purchased quit working after the second or third time I&#x27;ve use it. This product is expensive as it is so to only get 2-3 uses per bottle makes it insanely expensive! This problem needs to be fixed immediately because I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for similar products for some time now and eventually I will find an equivilant and stop buying this poorly manufactured product. I&#x27;m certain everyone who uses this product feels the same, has had the same experience, and is doing the same thing. One day we will find that equivilant product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has anyone found a replacement yet? Please-please do tell...</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness - what volume!  Love this product and all the CHI products so much but this will give you so much that you have to turn sideways to get out of the door.</li>
            <li> Works great, worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this volume spray foam product from other sellers on Amazon and have been very pleased.  The item I received this time did not foam at all and seems to be defective. I tried using it and it leaves my hair dull and lifeless.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon does not allow returns for this product so I am extremely dissatisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After posting this review and the Amazon packaging review, Amazon customer service contacted me within hours to remedy the issue. They asked if I wanted a replacement or refund and then promptly handled my request.  I am very satisfied with Amazon&#x27;s Customer service.</li>
            <li> I also received a defective spray can which did not foam. Since it just sputtered out as a liquid it was not possible to distribute in hair without leaving it gooey and rather straight. Spray cans can not be returned, but Amazon gave me a refund, so I am happy with their service.</li>
            <li> I have fine,thin hair this product works perfectly for my hair.  It gives me just enough body to style the hair the way I want it to look.</li>
            <li> Volume is good, but the hold is a bit weak. I always follow up with another spray for the hold.</li>
            <li> For whatever reason, this mousse product does NOT foam. And it cannot be returned because it is classified as &amp;#34;hazardous&amp;#34; so that is a crummy deal!</li>
            <li> I just love this product and the smell agrees with me also it gives my hair great volume and manageability</li>
            <li> I love this mousse and this was the second time I&#x27;ve purchased on Amazon.  However, this second order the can doesn&#x27;t spray AT ALL!  I tried running under hot water and using a needle to clean the spray hole, NOTHING!  I was very disappointed and very upset that I can&#x27;t exchange because of how it was classified being a hazardous material.  I will go back to getting it from my hair dresser to avoid the wasted money!  Thanks for nothing!  Hope you enjoyed my cash!</li>
            <li> Use sparingly. The product is very effective but too much makes hair heavy. Can effectively use to scrunch hair. Holds curl well.</li>
            <li> The very best for volume - love it!</li>
            <li> Great product - great price!</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim. I have tried other volumizing products that don&#x27;t work. I wasn&#x27;t expecting a lot in purchasing this but WOW it works! Spray all over root, blow dry and BAM! Volume!!</li>
            <li> i have ordered twice, the product works perfectly for about a week then the bottle fails and nothing will come out!  now I have 2 bottles that are full but will not foam. WHo do we send this crap back too&amp;#62;&amp;#62;?</li>
            <li> I have tried countless products to add volume and hold to my ultra fine hair without being stiff.  Some do the job for an hour or so, then back to flat.  This CHI product is amazing!!  Tons of volume that lasts!!  So glad I gave this one a try.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and could only find it at a salon for a ridiculous price. Thank you Amazon for providing a top notch product that is affordable when ordered through you. Leaves your hair without the sticky and hard as hay feeling for those of us with naturally curly hair. Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> ordered spray and got foam,</li>
            <li> I love this product but the last one I ordered and received had a broken sprayer mechanism and is unusable.</li>
            <li> I like the Hairspray better ,I really didnt order the right product,My Bad as I have to thin my Hair every 2 weeks..lol it Has plenty of Volume:)</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product 3 separate times from Amazon. The first time, it barely foamed enough for me to use. When I dispensed, it came out kind of liquidy, but I just dealt with it and finished the whole thing. The product itself works really really well. I have the thinnest hair imaginable... and it worked to give me lots of volume. But the second time I ordered it, after only 2 weeks the can locked up and stopped dispensing foam at all!!! The can was basically full, but I couldn&#x27;t get the product out! I contacted Amazon and asked for a replacement. They were great and sent me another one free of charge, but AGAIN after 2 weeks of use the can stopped dispensing entirely! I contacted Amazon again and just asked for a refund. Again Amazon was great and refunded my money. I am never trying this again. Such a waste of time. I have since started using Big Sexy Hair Root Pump Volumizing Spray Mousse http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003X4MQM0/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_3, it is awesome and actually dispenses!</li>
            <li> This product worked great for my fine hair. Adds lots of volume without stickiness. Makes styling easier and fun. Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I love chi products, most of them smell amazing. This is kind of pineappley and tropically.. but still works great for volume!</li>
            <li> First 2 times it sprayed ok. Probably not as &amp;#34;foam-like&amp;#34; as it should have been, but mostly usable. Now, since then, it does not spray at all. Definitely NOT happy with this product! So now I have a full can, that has barely been used, that is no longer functional.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair spray!</li>
            <li> this is the only hairspray I use now.  My hair is really thin.  all the other hairsprays seem to be really sticky feeling.  This is a very light hairspray but holds your hair in place without looking stiff.  Love, love this product.  I will continue to use this for a long time.</li>
            <li> Not hair like I expected</li>
