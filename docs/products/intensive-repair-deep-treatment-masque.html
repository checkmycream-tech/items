            <li>Overall this is a great moisturizer</li>

            <li>Okay I love Cantu&#x27;s products and all, but why are they charging $12 for a product that&#x27;s normally $5 in stores?</li>
            <li>This product works pretty good on natural hair.</li>
            <li>Love it so much that I&#x27;m ordering another jar.</li>

            <li>Today was my first time ever using this conditioner.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, after rinsing out my hair felt SO soft and strong, but also looked healthy and really dark</li>
            <li>Plus, it wasn&#x27;t easy finding a local store for purchase.</li>
            <li>When I rinsed it off, my hair was super soft.</li>
            <li>Works great for my niece that has very dry hair, so dry that it breaks off.  </li>

            <li>If you&#x27;re going to use it as a leave-in DO NOT PUT TOO MUCH.</li>
            <li>No lie, this product is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It really helped with that.</li>
            <li>The Cantu brand never disappoints and is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>I hope this product never gets dicontinued, because I really don&#x27;t know what I will do without it.</li>
            <li>the best part is that it&#x27;s super thick for my super big head with super thick hair</li>
            <li>It is a decent DC, though, but just a tad too much for my hair.</li>
            <li>I first used this on freshly washed hair and left it on for around 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Love how this does not weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li>This is one of my main products for every time I wash my hair.</li>
            <li>This mask has every single oil whipped into a fabulous butter.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>My hair felt soft with it on but as soon as I rinsed it felt very stripped.</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s very creamy and super thick and my hair  loves it.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve gone natural (4 years ago), I&#x27;ve been searching for a deep conditioner that leaves my hair soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s been a challenge finding deep treatments for my natural hair that doesn&#x27;t cause tangling.</li>
            <li>It left my hair soft.  </li>
            <li>It left it moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>first thing I liked about it is that, though it was thick, I was able to walk around and run errands all day without looking like I had some nasty gunk in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says--moisturizes and strengthens, and a little bit goes a long way.  </li>

            <li> I used the Cantu Deep Treatment Masque on my dry hair after pulling out cornrows.</li>
            <li> but it left my hair feeling dry.</li>
            <li> It left my hair dry and gave me some immediate breakage!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The next day my hair was so DRY</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about 8 weeks since my last relaxer and after letting this masque sit in my hair for only about 30 mins my hair was a lot easier to manage while wet</li>
            <li> Definitely money well spent!!</li>
            <li> This product left my hair a DRY &amp; tangly mess.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very thick and kinky and dries out fast.</li>
            <li> I usually try to give myself some time with a product before I write a review, but THIS deep conditioner was</li>
            <li> I threw it away because it was actually damaging my hair by making it hard to brush.</li>
            <li> I have very dry thick hair and this product is very thick and has all the oils I normally put on my hair everyday..</li>
            <li> like I had just dyed it jet black (and I haven&#x27;t dyed in four</li>
            <li> It did not leave my hair hard or dry.  </li>
            <li> However, it is a bit oily/greasy on the hands and takes a little effort to wash off.</li>
            <li> This stuff is loaded with heavy oils.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably leave it in for a few hours if not overnight and</li>
            <li> , with this I don&#x27;t have to use everyday</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Shoot, I&#x27;m not sure how I managed before it.</li>
            <li> Very heavy with oils.</li>
            <li> WILL get hard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also really thick and hard to rinse out of your hair</li>
            <li> Well at least for me.</li>
            <li> I have thick coily 3/4 AA hair.</li>
            <li> It is thick and that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> Seriously?</li>
            <li> /&gt;This product sucked the moisture out of my hair so bad that I had to wash my hair with shampoo the next day!</li>
            <li> have 4C hair, it&#x27;s REALLY tough</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unbelievable!!</li>
            <li> It retails about $8 and is difficult to find in person.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about purchasing this conditioner after reading some bad reviews.</li>
            <li> otherwise it gets cold and hardens...</li>
            <li> which always made me hate wash day.</li>
            <li> Sick!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It made my hair horrible to de tangle.</li>
            <li> My ends felt horrible and started to knot together.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My favorite masque in this price range</li>
            <li> Quality product!! Great job on my natural 4C hair!!! Definitely money well spent!!</li>
            <li> Excellent Product and Service</li>
            <li> after keep Cantu Shea Butter Deep Treatment Masque in my hair for 1 hour. My hair was felt soft and easy to style. Great for natural curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick coily 3/4 AA hair. This stuff is loaded with heavy oils. It is a decent DC, though, but just a tad too much for my hair. I like my hair to feel soft, clean, and moisturized, not weighed down with tons of oil. It smells very loud as well. The scent will stay on you for days. It retails about $8 and is difficult to find in person. I gave it away and will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> Works great for my niece that has very dry hair, so dry that it breaks off.  This treatment helps keep the moisture in her hair.  Ordered more of this product.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about purchasing this conditioner after reading some bad reviews. Plus, it wasn&#x27;t easy finding a local store for purchase. Eventually, I was able to find it after calling a few local beauty supply stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a challenge finding deep treatments for my natural hair that doesn&#x27;t cause tangling. I used the Cantu Deep Treatment Masque on my dry hair after pulling out cornrows. It felt very soft and smooth during application. And it smells soooo good. However, it is a bit oily/greasy on the hands and takes a little effort to wash off. Then, I put on a shower cap and slept with it overnight. My hair wasn&#x27;t tangled and I was able to easily finger comb it. The treatment rinsed out of my hair with no problem. In the end, my hair felt soft and moisturized. I will definitely add this to my Cantu products collection.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I decided to buy this masque. I&#x27;ve been looking around forever trying to find a deep conditioning masque that makes my hair actually feel like it&#x27;s been deep conditioned. It&#x27;s been about 8 weeks since my last relaxer and after letting this masque sit in my hair for only about 30 mins my hair was a lot easier to manage while wet and it was noticeably shinier after straightening. Unbelievably, it was straight from the root as if I had a touch up and others seemed to notice as well. Next time I use this I&#x27;ll probably leave it in for a few hours if not overnight and the best part is that it&#x27;s super thick for my super big head with super thick hair and it smells GREAT!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my natural hair regimen I love cantu products. they provide a lot of moisture to my hair</li>
            <li> Love it thank you for your business</li>
            <li> made my hair feel great!!</li>
            <li> Love this product it leaves my hair feeling soft, and, smelling good.</li>
            <li> I deep condition my hair every two weeks. This product is great.. I either leave it on for 30min minimum or overnight. I have very dry thick hair and this product is very thick and has all the oils I normally put on my hair everyday.. Love it.</li>
            <li> This product works pretty good on natural hair. It softens the strands just how I like it and makes it easier to finger detangle after i&#x27;ve washed my hair. Great and will purchase again..</li>
            <li> Today was my first time ever using this conditioner. I usually try to give myself some time with a product before I write a review, but THIS deep conditioner was amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on in the morning about 9 a.m. And rinsed out about 7 p.m.  Honestly, I didn&#x27;t even read the directions re: length of time to leave on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I liked about it is that, though it was thick, I was able to walk around and run errands all day without looking like I had some nasty gunk in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, of course, the signature Cantu smell. Yum. Like most naturals, I smell like a tropical fruit. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, after rinsing out my hair felt SO soft and strong, but also looked healthy and really dark like I had just dyed it jet black (and I haven&#x27;t dyed in four months).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall my rating is amazeballs! Will use as my deep conditioning staple and recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I use this after I wash my hair and I do not rinse it out. This is one of my main products for every time I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> OMG! This deep condish is AMAZING!!! This is my new fave!!! It leaves my hair moisturized and my curls POP! p.s. It&#x27;s way cheaper at Wal Mart!</li>
            <li> Love how this does not weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> I like it! It&#x27;s an awesome conditioner. If you&#x27;re going to use it as a leave-in DO NOT PUT TOO MUCH. You&#x27;re hair WILL get hard. But when you rinse, your hair will feel awesome! Well at least for me. My hair feels great.</li>
            <li> Love it!  I purchased this product at Walmart yesterday and used it.  It left my hair soft.  I will recommend this to anyone.  It also smells so good.  It did not leave my hair hard or dry.  It left it moisturized and soft. This is a great product for a great price.</li>
            <li> Okay I love Cantu&#x27;s products and all, but why are they charging $12 for a product that&#x27;s normally $5 in stores? Seriously? Sick!</li>
            <li> Another Cantu product that my hair loves. I use it as a leave in conditioner at times and my hair just drinks it up, leaving my hair feeling ever so hydrated.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair very soft and shiny plus its all natural ingredients. Also you can use it as a leave in conditioner, I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> No lie, this product is very moisturizing. I kept it in for about 6 hours. When I rinsed it off, my hair was super soft. It smells great by the way. I have natural hair that is kind of tangly and very dry. It really helped with that. I would buy this again</li>
            <li> I will repurchase this deep conditioner!  It&#x27;s very thick and a little goes a long way. Actually I love this whole natural hair line!  It&#x27;s my staple product line.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It works wonders for my natural hair.</li>
            <li> works better if you use heat....otherwise it gets cold and hardens...It&#x27;s also really thick and hard to rinse out of your hair</li>
            <li> love the way it makes me hair smell</li>
            <li> This smells absolutely amazing. It has a very thick texture which is good if you have 4b hair such as myself. This mask has every single oil whipped into a fabulous butter. Leaves my hair good. Its not miraculous but the smell is!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says--moisturizes and strengthens, and a little bit goes a long way.  Also can be used as a leave-in.  Pair it with a deep heating cap or steamer and you have the perfect recipe for healthy hair growth and excellent length retention.  The Cantu brand never disappoints and is reasonably priced.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I use it for my daughter&#x27;s hair as well. She had very dry hair and a lot of breakage, but now her hair is healthy and growing.</li>
            <li> It is thick and that&#x27;s all. Doesn&#x27;t  change my  4c  at all .</li>
            <li> Hands down the best deep conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used!! Since I&#x27;ve gone natural (4 years ago), I&#x27;ve been searching for a deep conditioner that leaves my hair soft and moisturized. I have used SO many, and since I&#x27;ve found this product my search for the perfect deep conditioner is over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have 4C hair, it&#x27;s REALLY tough which always made me hate wash day. This product literally melts my tangles away. It&#x27;s unbelievable!! I hope this product never gets dicontinued, because I really don&#x27;t know what I will do without it. Shoot, I&#x27;m not sure how I managed before it.</li>
            <li> It smells great but it left my hair feeling dry. It made my hair horrible to de tangle. Never again 👎🏾</li>
            <li> I have to say it takes time and money to find something that works and I think I did. I  love this product it&#x27;s very creamy and super thick and my hair  loves it. I have 4c hair and it&#x27;s very thick and kinky and dries out fast., with this I don&#x27;t have to use everyday and that&#x27;s a plus for me. Overall this is a great moisturizer and I will use this for now with oils. I put this on overnight to give it time to settle and do a twistout the next day.</li>
            <li> I like how this deep conditioner makes my hair feel. I use it about twice week as part of my hair regime. I looked into the ingredients and didn&#x27;t notice any red flags especially NO SULFATES! The fragrance is not over bearing which makes it worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for natural hair. Love it so much that I&#x27;m ordering another jar. Hair is so soft!</li>
            <li> I tried this product because the price was really cheap, at under 7 dollars, however I would NOT recommend it! It left my hair dry and gave me some immediate breakage!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is very, very thick and the smell is really nice. It smells like coconut, and strawberry, which I really liked. BUT that is all I like about it! This product left my hair a DRY &amp; tangly mess. I first used this on freshly washed hair and left it on for around 30 minutes. My hair felt soft with it on but as soon as I rinsed it felt very stripped. But I continued with my routine and styled my hair. The next day my hair was so DRY, it started to tangle and knot. My ends felt horrible and started to knot together. I had to cut some of the knots out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product sucked the moisture out of my hair so bad that I had to wash my hair with shampoo the next day! I had to get it out of my hair! I DO NOT recommend this AT ALL! Honestly, this was a waste, now I have this nearly full jar sitting in my cabinet, collecting dust!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS ITEM&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s well priced, lasts forever and leaves my hair feeling soft and hydrated. I feel that it works best when used overnight, to allow more time to penetrate the hair shaft but if you&#x27;re low on time, it&#x27;s a great substitute for a regular/leave in conditioner. Especially when you&#x27;re low on time and in need of extra hydration.</li>
            <li> Very heavy with oils. Made my hair tangly and super dry. I need to use a clarifying shampoo to get this product off. It blocks moisture from getting into my hair. I used it twice with different shampoos to see if that made a difference. I threw it away because it was actually damaging my hair by making it hard to brush. If you like the Shea Moisture masque you&#x27;ll love this because it&#x27;s slightly better. Very disappointed.</li>
