            <li>Smells so clean.</li>
            <li>My nieces say it is my &amp;#34;signature scent&amp;#34;  &amp;#34;clean, refreshing and really interesting!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Not bad...</li>
            <li>That is just a mild version of SLS.</li>
            <li>It smells good, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how I felt about it at first, but I really came to like it.</li>

            <li>Pricey for the size I&#x27;d say though since the rest isn&#x27;t so overwhelmingly positive for me.  </li>
            <li>exactly what we wanted at a reasonable price</li>
            <li>The product is ok, but the smell is not really Eucalyptus.  </li>
            <li>It seems gentle enough on the skin and leaves you feeling clean.</li>
            <li>My skin feels clean but not necessarily softened.</li>
            <li>It suds nicely and one bottle will last for a long time in the shower.  </li>
            <li>The aroma is not pure eucalyptus but smells so clean and luxurious (if a smell can be luxurious!)</li>
            <li>I love it, especially with the lotion in the same scent.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>

            <li>This stuff smells and feels natural</li>
            <li>Rinses without residue ... leaving a nice body fragrance behind.</li>
            <li>Love it...reorder as soon as the bottle is half gone...been using for a long time</li>
            <li>Scent is clean, green yet earthy.</li>
            <li>So, Im sending this back, as its not as natural as I was hoping it would be.</li>
            <li>The scent reminds me of a bar soap I once smelled while staying with a friend in Southern California in the early 2000&#x27;s.</li>

            <li> It lasts a lot longer than other body washes I have used.  </li>
            <li> It can be a little expensive, but if you shop around can make it worth it.</li>
            <li> The lotion is good too, just don&#x27;t get the cologne, it&#x27;s terrible.</li>
            <li> Wasted my money 😡</li>
            <li> Before used it life was hard and I was always depressed</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who suffers from dry winter skin.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this body wash! I was out in the Hamptons at the Hampton Maid and they have the mini ones in the rooms. I fell in love with the fresh smell and it wakes me up (also reminds me that beautiful motel out there every time I take a shower). I use the body lotion to make the smell last longer. they work nice together. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The product is ok, but the smell is not really Eucalyptus.  It migth be in there somewhere but it is mixed with other fragrances.</li>
            <li> Gift but I know she loves this.</li>
            <li> All I smell is bathroom cleaner/disinfectant&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m putting this on my skin again. I had to look at the bottle to verify it was a body wash. Wasted my money 😡</li>
            <li> Love it...reorder as soon as the bottle is half gone...been using for a long time</li>
            <li> My very favorite for many years.  Enjoyed by others - so they say!!  My nieces say it is my &amp;#34;signature scent&amp;#34;  &amp;#34;clean, refreshing and really interesting!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my mother. She just loves Thymes Eucalyptus. The price was great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 10 years now, after I visited a friend for a weekend and she encouraged me to try it. It&#x27;s an invigorating scent, not too feminine and not too masculine. It really wakes me up in the morning! And because of the addition of lemon, lime and petitgrain, you don&#x27;t smell like a cough drop. Try it!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who suffers from dry winter skin. I am 70 years old and after using this product my skin is smoother than a baby. I have been using this product for 14 years and make sure that I never run out of it.</li>
            <li> exactly what we wanted at a reasonable price</li>
            <li> This is an old favorite that smells unbelievable. I rarely buy anything that is not on sale and for me to buy this says a lot.  Amazon&#x27;s price was pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;I just wish they still made the oil. This was the best!</li>
            <li> It smells fresh and clean like super nice soap. I love it, especially with the lotion in the same scent.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really great...you are left with a heat smell that last and last.  It can be a little expensive, but if you shop around can make it worth it.</li>
            <li> The body wash did not have the fragrance or consistency that I expected.  It&#x27;s just o.k., and I probably would not order it again.</li>
            <li> I found this product life changing for me. Before used it life was hard and I was always depressed but since I started using this I sing and skip every where I go and life is great.</li>
            <li> I got this product because I was trying to avoid products with sodium lauryl sulfate in them. Once I read the ingredients in this product, I saw sodium coco sulfate?! That is just a mild version of SLS. So, Im sending this back, as its not as natural as I was hoping it would be. Seems like a great product, but beware of the SLS component in the ingredient!</li>
            <li> Refreshing, gentle, with a lovely scent.</li>
            <li> This is my family&#x27;s go-to bath soap.  Leaves you smelling wonderful whether you are a man or woman.  All the Thymes products are fantastic!</li>
            <li> Satisfied with the product as well as the shipping time frame</li>
            <li> Love the way it feels on my skin and the after scent it leaves.  Will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Refreshing and soothing aroma.  The aroma last a long time.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and feel of the body wash. It make your skin feel silky. Rinses off from the body well</li>
            <li> I enjoyed it. I forgot to purchase Eucalyptus SPEARMINT, so instead I just got Eucalyptus. That said, it was pretty good stuff and I liked using it. Smelled pleasant and natural.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  Does not really smell like eucalyptus. Good body wash as far as body washes go.  Moderate purchase.  ok.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product for the clean feeling of both myself and shower.mit has a wonderful scent, clean and fresh.m I also buy the body lotion in this scent.  It&#x27;s a very nice moisturizer, you only need just a little.yummy  stuff.</li>
            <li> This is the best body wash ever. I love it, smells great, feels great. The lotion is good too, just don&#x27;t get the cologne, it&#x27;s terrible.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice body wash.  It smells good, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> love my eucalyptus body wash</li>
            <li> Love this unique fresh scent and had not been able to find the product in stores.</li>
            <li> The texture of this product is nice. My skin feels clean but not necessarily softened. Ultimately I love the scent and the way it fills my shower. Together with the lotion it is a lovely way to pamper yourself. The scent reminds me of a bar soap I once smelled while staying with a friend in Southern California in the early 2000&#x27;s. NOSTALGIAAAAA.</li>
            <li> I use this and I also have one in the guest  bathroom shower. Every guest has commentied on how much they love it and they all smell so good too!</li>
            <li> Thymes eucalyptus anything is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I first tried Thymes Eucalyptus at a beautiful bed and breakfast.  The aroma is not pure eucalyptus but smells so clean and luxurious (if a smell can be luxurious!) I am transported to that lovely B&amp;B each time I use it!  The body lotion is just as great and may have a longer lasting scent.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash, the scent is invigorating. Just wish it would go on sale once in a while</li>
            <li> I like the Tymes line of Body Wash a lot. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out. It smells great. And I feel clean! What can I say other than this is a quality line of soaps?</li>
            <li> Wonderful smell!  It suds nicely and one bottle will last for a long time in the shower.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Good foam.  Smells ok, though I would have liked a more overpowering Eucalyptus scent.  Felt clean afterwards, and that&#x27;s all that matters I guess.  Pricey for the size I&#x27;d say though since the rest isn&#x27;t so overwhelmingly positive for me.  Not bad...just eh.  Probably worth a shot to try if you were thinking about it to make up your own mind.  Wasn&#x27;t for me in the end though.</li>
            <li> This has a really natural herbal scent. I wasn&#x27;t sure how I felt about it at first, but I really came to like it. It seems gentle enough on the skin and leaves you feeling clean. A nice body wash.</li>
            <li> I think they forgot to put any eucalyptus in it. it smells just  like lemon Lysol bathroom cleaner. there is not even a hint of anything else but lemon.</li>
            <li> The aroma of this wash is so refreshing and I have used it for years. The store I use to buy  this wash from, I am not near the store. I will continue to order anduse this wash.</li>
            <li> Liked it very much.  I started using it because I liked the scent and then because I have migraine headaches, it seemed to help breathing in the scent with hot water.</li>
            <li> Have used the Thymes Eucalyptus products for years. Love the refreshing scent.  Get compliments on the scent all the time after using it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this scent for over 10 years- absolutely love it! It makes a great gift as well.</li>
            <li> Product does not look like the illustration and for the price why isn&#x27;t it in a box instead of a plastic bag</li>
            <li> love this product - have for years - glad i could get it on amazon</li>
            <li> Love the scent! Only a small amount is needed, so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> It has a very nice fragrance without being too strong.  It lasts a lot longer than other body washes I have used.  It is a truly quality product.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Smells so clean. I have the air freshener too</li>
            <li> Great product. Smell is amazing!</li>
            <li> Eucalyptus is my most favorite scent</li>
            <li> Excellent all over body wash with a clean scent. Rinses without residue ... leaving a nice body fragrance behind. Good for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> This is best of both worlds- it wakes me up in the morning but I also will use it in the evening after a long workout to relax. Scent is clean, green yet earthy. This isn&#x27;t for folks who like vanilla cupcake body wash! This stuff smells and feels natural</li>
            <li> Got my husband hooked on this shower soap and he cannot live without it.  It is a great fragrance and washes off clean.  I have been tempted to buy it in stores but it is a better deal on amazon.  The package arrived super fast.  Thanks!</li>
