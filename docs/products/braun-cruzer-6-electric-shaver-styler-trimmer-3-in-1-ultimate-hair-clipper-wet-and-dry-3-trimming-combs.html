            <li>I believe it going to be great.</li>
            <li>Love you Braun!!</li>
            <li>This groomer is really amazing!</li>
            <li>Great for &amp;#34;nether region&amp;#34; grooming as well - my wife loves this thing and she has fairly course hair.</li>
            <li>This shaver has a great battery and charging it is amazing</li>
            <li>Well, it was a good thought, but off-base.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got it as a gift for someone this time around and he loved it.</li>
            <li>If you like to keep tidy between haircuts, this is great for trimming hair off your neck, and conveniently keeping everything trimmed and neat.</li>
            <li>it good and water proof</li>
            <li>I think it is a really good product.</li>
            <li>product has good battery life and charging is a breeze with the charging dock.  </li>
            <li>got this shaver hair trimmer for a good price.</li>
            <li>I think the Cruzer 6 looks good, but the blade doesn&#x27;t seem to work as good as foil shaver.</li>
            <li>For the money I paid, it is a good buy.</li>
            <li>What is good about it ?  </li>
            <li>im pressed me on how good it was.</li>
            <li>I am shaved smooth and it is awesome.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li>Except that it&#x27;s all good</li>
            <li>it clean me up real good.</li>
            <li>Build quality is solid, running time is excellent, closeness of trim is impressive.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m very satisfied with the device except for the expense of the Fusion blades.  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>But with practice I have been able to successfully use this shaver to trim my sideburns, trim my mustache and goatee.</li>
            <li>I reckon that the Braun is worthwhile if you want to keep your body hair trimmed, or even your head of hair shaved (incidentally, I had a friend who was bald but had a luxuriant beard - some kid came up to him and said, \\&quot;Hey Mister!</li>
            <li>Convenient, easy to use and great battery life when fully recharged.</li>
            <li>Smooth, easy to use and the best part?</li>
            <li>The best I&#x27;ve found so far is Norelco&#x27;s product which isn&#x27;t great, but it does the job much more effectively than this one.</li>
            <li>The Braun Cruzer 6 works amazingly.  </li>
            <li>I was thinking that it would be handy to have both a razor and trimmer in one contraption</li>
            <li>Nice design</li>
            <li>It shaves nice and close without any worry of nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li>B004WIUNBW Cruzer 6]] has been lovingly re-gifted to my wife...</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the design  or just the over all intended function that I can&#x27;t get on board with.</li>
            <li>charging stand is nice</li>
            <li>A nice thing to mention about the charger</li>
            <li>really impressed with how easy it is to clean too.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to any guy looking to tidy up.</li>
            <li>The carrying case/holster is a nice touch, I keep it rested on a ledge in my shower.</li>
            <li>I own both the Braun cruzer and the Philips bodygroom pro.</li>
            <li>electric trimmer cuts hairs fairly closely and without too many passes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that it can be used in the shower and uses easy-to-find razor cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice product for the price</li>
            <li>Just make sure to stretch the skin your shaving or it&#x27;ll cut you and it doesn&#x27;t feel to good...</li>
            <li>It works very smoothly and I am really glad I splurged on it!</li>
            <li>i am a very hairy man and it work very good)</li>
            <li>but if you want a nice one, I&#x27;d shop around a bit more.</li>
            <li>this is a great product, make shaving easy and stress free.</li>
            <li>Love, love, LOVE this thing!</li>
            <li>- Seems pretty rugged  - Works great in the shower  </li>
            <li>The Body Cruzer works fine!</li>
            <li>Love the grip of the handle, trimmer and shaver feel very smooth.</li>
            <li>It is good in your travel kit for quick and convenient use but would not be the best alternative for a regular use.</li>
            <li>the cruzer 6 from braun is very good in performance and is comfortable to use.the shaver is very reliable .once</li>
            <li>Hair clippers work much better.</li>
            <li>The attached razor ends up getting in the way more often than not.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off using a separate trimmer and razor than this hybrid monstrosity.</li>
            <li>Also so many attachments</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more of a trimmer than a shaver, so the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>While I keep most of my face clean-shaven, I do have a goatee that I like to keep well-groomed.</li>
            <li>So I use the Fusion razor part of this tool to give most of my face a close shave, but then I use the electronic trimmer to address my goatee.</li>
            <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>Ive used much better electic trimmers at a lower price.</li>
            <li>Separate clippers and a disposable razor would probably be better for most people.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t trim or shave more than you intended to.</li>
            <li>It seems that, in some circles, body hair is no longer sexy or desirable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure others out there on the market are better than this once.</li>
            <li>This shaver is ok.</li>
            <li>ok product,</li>
            <li>Love em, would by again in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li>That being said the shave with the fusion is ok, but</li>
            <li>This is an outstanding shaver/trimmer that couples with the Gillette fusion blades.  </li>
            <li>My car was stolen and my boyfriend was able to use at all ..</li>
            <li>You will love this razor.</li>
            <li>I love that you can soften the hair with ths trimmer and than shave it all out with the blade, this</li>
            <li>device itself is very well engineered, manual is great, and it comes with a carrying</li>
            <li>It is safe to use in shower.  </li>
            <li>I like it, but don&#x27;t LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Better than expected!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I was really pleased with it</li>

            <li>Has a smooth glide and cuts nice.</li>
            <li>This product is safe to use on your body in or out of the shower.</li>
            <li>Be sure to use the guards</li>
            <li>This is a great product that is easy to use and works exactly as it should.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had about 5 different body trimmers over the years and this is easily the best.</li>
            <li>Man-caves are all very well if you can keep the bugs out and be warm in the winter, but I&#x27;ll just have to make do with my house.to him and said, \\&quot;Hey Mister!</li>
            <li>The medium attachment has a much more noticeable impact, and easily takes off lots of hair.</li>
            <li>The concept of the item is very cool and everything works as it should.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an essential that every man should have and it looks very good too.</li>
            <li>Well written and clear suggestions for a great trim and shave</li>
            <li>the purchase was fulfilled by 100%, everything turned out as expected and as always happens in this website, all perfect forever.</li>
            <li>I guess if you are really hairy that would be good advice.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very cool product and easy to use.</li>
            <li>A true winner!</li>
            <li>This trimmer is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Cleans up easily.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and charge</li>
            <li>Quicker than many to recharge, and so easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>keeps its charge well, easy manipulation to adjust to preferred length of trim you desire.</li>
            <li>The shaver itself is lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li>to the longer-hair trimming, I haven&#x27;t tried that, but it looks like it removes longer body hair fairly easily.</li>
            <li>It runs quietly, holds a charge fairly well and has a nice hanger attachment to use if you would like to keep it hung in the shower.</li>
            <li>The best for sure, value for money, come with different trimmers for different uses, with nice kit and practical to use guide.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this thing three stars instead of two because the razor is fine, the trimmer works fine too.  </li>
            <li>It was a fine investment for all my trimming needs.</li>
            <li>The Bruan Shaver really is waterproof so shower use is easy and effective and it can be humg up easily by the handle.  </li>
            <li>Not super awesome, but it gets the job done.&lt;br</li>
            <li>does just fine for what it was made, greetings</li>
            <li>WISH THE CHARGE LIGHT WOULD CHANGED COLOR WHEN RAZOR IS FULLY CHARGED.</li>
            <li>On the contrary, the Body Cruzer 6 is primarily a trimmer.  </li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t sound like a chainsaw when you turn it on, which is also a relief.</li>
            <li>The Fussion razor on the back is great too.</li>
            <li>If you are getting by with your razor and/or trimmer and haven&#x27;t thought about upgrading you might enjoy this even if you don&#x27;t need it</li>
            <li>one pass and hair is gone, smooth finish.</li>
            <li>Trimmer works great, removing the dreaded \\&quot;back of neck hair\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Man-caves are all very well if you can keep the bugs out and be warm in the winter, but I&#x27;ll just have to make do with my house.</li>
            <li>This is a nice trimmer/body shaver with a few great features and one or two</li>
            <li>This is especially true in sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for something like this product for a while now so far so good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am sure it will work well for other manscaping ventures, however I am not the kind of fella who requires that kind of TLC.</li>
            <li>The embedded 5 blade razor allows to have trim and shave in one step leaving a clean smooth skin</li>
            <li>- Well-designed, great grip, nice looking  - Suprising amount of power out of a small package  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had other Braun clippers/shavers before and they&#x27;ve all been pretty damn awesome.</li>
            <li>Was excited to get a rechargeable battery operated body shaver that could be used in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Why not just use the razor and get a better result instead of doing what is recommended in the instructions of using the Braun shaver first then use the razor for increased closeness.  </li>
            <li>ORIGINAL REVIEW</li>
            <li>The concept of this product is pretty interesting.</li>
            <li>Superb German quality, light, washable, good looking, small charging dock.</li>
            <li>If you like that clean shaven look from head to toe, then the Braun Cruzer 6 Body Cruzer, 6 Body Shaver will get you there looking clean and hairless.</li>
            <li>It does not pull on longer hair, and leaves a clean shave.  </li>
            <li>first thing i already try the trimmer alone with the combs and without them ,to trim Under the armpit and the sensitive areas and its very good , also i try the Gillette Fusion alone to shave my beard and it work very well</li>
            <li>nothing special.</li>
            <li>amazingly good clean shaving product for back of man&#x27;s neck</li>
            <li>/&gt;amazingly good clean shaving product for back of man&#x27;s neck</li>
            <li>/&gt;amazingly good clean shaving product for back of man&#x27;s neck</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s cool you can use it in the shower.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a strange hybrid that does not know what it wants to be, and to be honest I&#x27;m not so sure how I will use it, it could have been better in both aspects.</li>
            <li>The Cruzer shaves quickly and cleanly and removes \\&quot;tougher\\&quot;</li>
            <li>The different size attachments are good for different hair lengths, good for chest and underarms.</li>
            <li>hey.. just the fact that I don&#x27;t have to pack both is good enough for me.</li>
            <li>So it is only fair that I edit my review and bump up the rating to do justice to the product.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad for trimming up the odds and ends.</li>
            <li>Overall I would recommend this since a huge part is being able to use it in the shower!</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m not going for the bald overall body look, this shaver/trimmer actually was perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>The Braun Shaver works quickly so you need to pay attention when you are using it</li>
            <li>You have to hold it at a certain angle for the trimmer to trim correctly but also make sure the razor is hitting your skin right.</li>
            <li>It works very well and is extremely easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>Removes back hair leaving a nice smooth shaved look.</li>
            <li>Build is super.</li>
            <li>it missed lot of hairs, so you better expect to spend more time running it couple of times on the same spot.</li>
            <li>Using no attachments, the system glides smoothly over your skin and takes off pretty much all hairs it attacks for a very clean look.</li>
            <li>All in all a very capable and comfortable device.</li>
            <li>Super sharp and very nice against the skin.</li>
            <li>Works better than my old one!</li>
            <li>I used medium and large and noticed the large is great for just &#x60;taking a little off the top,&#x27; so you don&#x27;t feel bald if you use it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very effective at removing hair although that may be due to soaking in the shower first.</li>
            <li>Combs for different trim and cut lengths are included, as well as a really nice storage bag, which allows the razor and the combs to be stored in the shower.  </li>
            <li>It does a good job with the privates which can be difficult to access and get a good close shave.</li>
            <li>It is powerful and waterproof.</li>
            <li>If nothing else the trimmer is worth the price</li>
            <li>Probably at around $25 to $30 it is well worth the money.would</li>
            <li>i would buy it again, worth every dollar, this is what you need for body shaving.</li>
            <li>First off, this is not a bad product.</li>
            <li>other wise it pulls hair...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still looking for a truly high quality trimmer for the male body - if anyone has any good suggestions, please let me know.  </li>
            <li>The hair just doesn&#x27;t trim right or go through the comb</li>
            <li>This razor worked great at first, but after a few months it got weaker and weaker and just died.  </li>
            <li>The attachments snap on somewhat easily, but take a little more focus to detach from the razor--trying to pull them off quickly could result in breaking them because they have plastic tabs that really click securely into place around the shaft of the unit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The battery is better, the trimmer is better (doesn&#x27;t tug and needs less passes), the clips are better designed, comes with an extra set of shaving blades,</li>
            <li>Charging is very fast too.</li>
            <li>First time using Braun.</li>
            <li>Overall I just love.</li>
            <li>Like many men, I have facial hair.</li>
            <li>I have had mine for over 3 years and it works like the first day.</li>
            <li>I used it with no guard for the first time using it at all and didn&#x27;t get one cut or close call.</li>
            <li>Once I figured that out (and I like electric shavers more than bladed shavers, mostly because I&#x27;m too lazy for creams and replacing blades), I tried the powered trimmer side, to see if it met my needs.  </li>
            <li>Fast, simple, easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>More so if you actually used the bladed portion!</li>
            <li>(and he&#x27;s pretty picky about his products).</li>
            <li>Already have a better shaver than this, It is same brand, The razor on this 1 is just in the way.</li>
            <li>The only thing I find better with the Philips device is its adjustable comb.</li>
            <li>When I first bought a Gillette</li>
            <li>No cuts and clean save in sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>The good:    - nice design --- it just looks good, including the charger base  - easy to use  - can be used in the shower  - comes with different extensions so you can decide how short you want to trim whatever area (ahem)</li>
            <li>Kind of pricey, but worth the investment (your significant other will thank you later).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few different trimmers and this is by far the best!</li>
            <li>so I was happy to see this is one step above everything other razor I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>The shaver is easy to use and smooth, and the Gillette fusion razor is very sharp.</li>
            <li>you like to look smooth and have a more than average need to shave and trim and have considered a new product - this is the product for you.  </li>
            <li>Pretty nice little tool for manscaping.</li>
            <li>I love that it can be used dry or in the shower.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to shave the body in a short time in the shower.</li>
            <li>While easy to find, that brand of razor cartridge is not necessarily cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you are a guy that shaves a large portion of you</li>
            <li>a body shaver that works great on both wet and dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I lucked out and found zilostore dot com who sells &amp;#34;compatible&amp;#34; blades that are of the EXACT SAME QUALITY as the Gillette original.  </li>
            <li>It easily exceeded my expectations, and I am not generally a \\&quot;gadget\\&quot; guy.</li>
            <li>, it takes the gillette fusion heads, much more reasonably priced and easy to find than other replacements for different razors.  </li>
            <li>Boyfriend says it doesn&#x27;t shave very close....</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>How much space is it really going to save on your counter anyways?</li>
            <li>Back and chest hair comes off smoothly by just running the razor across your skin.</li>
            <li>Too much hair?</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>It really is a body shaver.</li>
            <li>So, in a nutshell, I&#x27;d recommend this product if you&#x27;re in the market for a body shaver, but I wouldn&#x27;t expect too much from the attached Fusion razor.     </li>
            <li>I think the device costs so much because it is truly waterproof.  </li>
            <li>It does the job and does it reasonably well.</li>
            <li>He really likes it and would buy it again if anything were to happen to it.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s get the negatives out of the way: yes, if you have too much hair and plow into it like a sharecropper, something will catch in the blade and you&#x27;ll get nicked.</li>
            <li>so unusual for me, i read the manual..</li>
            <li>Recommendable for the modern man who wants to be grommed for himself and cares about his image.</li>
            <li>I really like this device,</li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t as comfortable to use as a regular razor, but</li>
            <li>recharged it lasts very well and is waterproof .</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It is a must have razor for any man who wants to be well kept and groomed.</li>
            <li>I chose the powered version, and I thought it was better than the manual razor and only a few dollars more.</li>
            <li>I would much rather use a corded shaver.</li>
            <li>haha.  </li>
            <li>In quantity I think you can get the blades for about a buck a piece making this a very affordable alternative.  </li>
            <li>Zilostore made this a very viable product for me.</li>
            <li>The combined electric and blade razor make the job much quicker.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cut, and is gentle.</li>
            <li>I really like the 3 sizes of guards, and the 3 options of trimming, trimming and shaving, or just shaving.</li>
            <li>It does what it says for real.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how much information I really should share here...</li>
            <li>Holds a charge well and is very ergonomic.</li>
            <li>This razor is a nice enough product, but was not as powerful as expected.  </li>
            <li>How many other body shavers are capable of giving you a close shave for your face?</li>
            <li>Just shave in the shower, rinse out and its clean and ready to be placed back in its charging stand.</li>
            <li>Great for trimming or actual shaving, it makes fast work of a repetitive and unending job.  </li>
            <li>I love this trimmer and somewhat disturbed by other reviews.  </li>
            <li>exchangeable heads work great for different body parts:&lt;br /&gt;- Sensitive for \\&quot;down there\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned a few Braun products in the past and have always been impressed with them</li>
            <li>If you are a triathlete it might make sense but if you are the average Joe that just wants to avoid looking like Sasquatch there are better</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t add to all the other reviews which are pretty accurate.  </li>
            <li>I have long been a fan of Braun and their products, and this shaver is so cheaply made that it doesn&#x27;t deserve the name &amp;#34;Braun&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>here I am, but to be honest I&#x27;m not sure what I can do here.</li>
            <li>Overall, It is not a bad product but not something that gives you the feeling of &amp;#34;well groomed&amp;#34; .</li>
            <li>Once again, not a horrible product... just slightly disapointed.</li>
            <li>After several uses by each, I personally like the BodyGroom Pro better.</li>
            <li>Only used once for my husband&#x27;s back and WOW sooo very easy to use, piece of cake.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it can be used in the shower, washing the mess away instead of finding it in the sink.  </li>
            <li>If that is also your intended use, I would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I bought it anyway with high hopes.</li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is thin, so it&#x27;s comfortable and easy to grip in the hand, and also very lightweight, so</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this as a primary shaver or trimmer though due to a lack of real power and the fact that trying to trim too much at once the hair tends to get frequently stuck in the plastic trimming attachment.  </li>
            <li>In other words, there&#x27;s nothing special or electronic involved with the shaving function, and I would be far better off with a disposable razor to meet my limited ladyscaping needs.</li>
            <li>The incorporated Gillette blade is very usefull for complete hair removal, using the Cruzer without any of the adjustable blades</li>
            <li>, I just u buy a normal shaver to shave that hair.</li>
            <li>Coming from someone who had the Bodygr00m, this thing is way better in every single aspect possible.  </li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s nothing new.</li>
            <li>I never changed / sharpened blades but still works like a new blade.</li>
            <li>The slide out razor blade seems a little flimsy and it is easy to engage or retract the blade when the user does not mean to do so.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>Of course, for more delicate areas, you absolutely must pull the skin taut as explained in the manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Body hair builds below the blades and drops away when it is long, however if you are re-trimming previously trimmed hair, a collection of fine hair will interfere if it isn&#x27;t cleared with a puff of breath or quick shake.</li>
            <li>In the end, the trimmer simply doesn&#x27;t do as good of a job on thick hair has my [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I have shavers that are wet/dry, but not one where they recommend you to use directly IN the shower, so I had to ask for one!  </li>
            <li>If you are a man reading this and are with a significant other, chances are the amount of body hair you possess is probably always an issue.</li>
            <li>It looks pretty but is not built to last.  </li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m back to powered shaving and although I still prefer the manual Schick, the Braun is pretty close to</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve personally found the only smooth shave comes from a professional barber</li>
            <li>Braun has equipped the razor with a shower caddy enabling the user to quickly hang the product, which can be very convenient if the shower being used has little or no shelf space.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so i was a little heistant to buy it, but everything yurnt out fine.</li>
            <li>But if you keep up with the maintenance (I go about every other week just so the hairs don&#x27;t get too long on my underarms and chest, and pelvic area) and use gentle strokes, you should be fine.</li>
            <li>It has three plastic attachments: sensitive, medium, and large, to buzz your hair at different lengths.</li>
            <li>Sensitive areas are best served with one of the included guards, if the skin is thin and fine enough to fold or present a smaller than .5 fold, it may possibly fit into the cutting stroke of the unguarded blades.</li>
            <li>(Also, on a completely separate note, if you do decide to use this in the shower, and depending on how hairy you are, make sure to pick a bottle or two of Drano at the same time, because all that hair going down your shower drain may lead to clogged drains!)</li>
            <li>When I was offered a chance to review the Braun Body Cruzer 6, it was clear the appliance was being marketed towards men.  </li>
            <li>However, Braun is clear in its warning that this shaver not be used on the face, so I have avoiding using it there.  </li>
            <li>it claims it does sensitive trimming, but no matter the setting i was in all it did was pull.</li>
            <li>Shaving my legs is one of my least favorite activities.  </li>
            <li>only thing I really don&#x27;t like about the unit is the manual razor attachment.</li>
            <li>It gets that fuzz that grows on the back of my neck between haircuts, as well as my sideburns when they start growing too fast.</li>
            <li>I lost a couple heads to my old trimmer, so I decided to buy this one.</li>
            <li>Most of the clippers and razors that claim they can be used wet are only waterproof in the cutting area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun makes good quality, well-designed items</li>
            <li>And for folks who run in those circles, Braun offers its Braun Cruzer 6 Body Cruzer, 6 Body Shaver.  </li>
            <li>The Braun model seems to be doing the trick so far.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use the razor attached, only the buzzer, but I suppose that can get the tricky hairs you couldn&#x27;t take off with just the clipper.</li>
            <li>The battery lasts &amp;#34;weeks&amp;#34; (*I don&#x27;t use it on a daily basis but have travelled for a whole week and have not need to recharge it).</li>
            <li>This trimmer is very week and does not trim the hair properly...</li>
            <li>Even on sensitive setting</li>
            <li>No nicks in sensitive areas....</li>
            <li>someone with long body hair who wants to remove all of it down to smooth skin, this device may be ideal but for someone looking to shave OR trim on a regular basis, this hybrid seems overcomplicated and awkward.  </li>
            <li>The plastic feels very cheap, battery life is short, and the size of the trimmer is ridiculously small.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, the trimmer is far inferior to every other trimmer I&#x27;ve used, and even considerably cheaper ones are much more versatile.</li>
            <li>Would recommend starting dry and only doing fine trimming in the water.</li>
            <li>This one is really good but a little bit small.</li>
            <li>But the product seems fine since you can use it wet or dry.</li>
            <li>Rechargeable battery with a decent back up 4.</li>
            <li>Overall, highly recommended for this type of use.  </li>
            <li>Fits well in the charger and doesn&#x27;t take up much space on the counter as long as you have space to begin with.</li>
            <li>plastic on it feels a little cheap, but the build feels solid.</li>
            <li>Other then that the Braun unit has pretty much replaced all other units for my shaving and grooming needs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 44 years old and tried alot of body trimmers and beard trimmers over the years - this is the one I settled on and the one I keep coming back to.</li>
            <li>Especially if you are looking for a trimmer for sensitive areas, nothing beats this trimmer.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a personal groomer for the sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>Personally, I use this mainly to trim my beard because I&#x27;m not into the whole manscaping thing, but if you are, I think you&#x27;ll like this device, with a few caveats.    </li>
            <li>but it seems that since Gillette took over they are emphasizing disposable parts and supplies even for things like clippers and shavers that did not previously require an ongoing supply of cleaning fluid or blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You want stubble - it gives you stubble, real stubble, not the 3mm stuff other trimmers call &amp;#34;stubble.&amp;#34; You want a longer &amp;#34;Winter&amp;#34; beard</li>
            <li>The head is small which is good for some areas of your body but slow larger areas such as the chest and abdomen.  </li>
            <li>It has two real advantages: 1) it can be used in the shower, as other folks have mentioned; and 2) it uses the Gillette Fusion blades so if you have that already, you don&#x27;t have to buy into a whole other product.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>but you know what all ready so take the time and slow down, clean off hair clogging them from time to time as well.  </li>
            <li>you may experience a small cut, but even this is extremely rare.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this (and any other Braun product) to anyone.</li>
            <li>(I am very hairy) to keep hair presence, but shorter and less dense&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re used to being disappointed by the latest 5-blade razors and electronic shavers that claim to leave you hairless with no effort, it might be worth taking a look at the Cruzer.</li>
            <li>Gentle enough to go down town and leave no nics or cuts.</li>
            <li>This goes without saying really, any trimmer is subject to such limitations.</li>
            <li>My prior Bodygroom died after too much water exposure (I actually bought two previously), and I wanted something that would hold up.</li>
            <li>The Braun Cruzer is a really nifty little shaver.  </li>

            <li> It is a great investment.</li>
            <li> Works well, have not tried the shaving aspect, just the trim and have been happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I believe it going to be great.</li>
            <li> Love you Braun!!</li>
            <li> This groomer is really amazing!</li>
            <li> Great for &amp;#34;nether region&amp;#34; grooming as well - my wife loves this thing and she has fairly course hair.</li>
            <li> This shaver has a great battery and charging it is amazing</li>
            <li> Well, it was a good thought, but off-base.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got it as a gift for someone this time around and he loved it.</li>
            <li> If you like to keep tidy between haircuts, this is great for trimming hair off your neck, and conveniently keeping everything trimmed and neat.</li>
            <li> it good and water proof</li>
            <li> I think it is a really good product.</li>
            <li> product has good battery life and charging is a breeze with the charging dock.  </li>
            <li> got this shaver hair trimmer for a good price.</li>
            <li> I think the Cruzer 6 looks good, but the blade doesn&#x27;t seem to work as good as foil shaver.</li>
            <li> For the money I paid, it is a good buy.</li>
            <li> What is good about it ?  </li>
            <li> im pressed me on how good it was.</li>
            <li> I am shaved smooth and it is awesome.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li> Except that it&#x27;s all good</li>
            <li> it clean me up real good.</li>
            <li> Build quality is solid, running time is excellent, closeness of trim is impressive.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m very satisfied with the device except for the expense of the Fusion blades.  </li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> But with practice I have been able to successfully use this shaver to trim my sideburns, trim my mustache and goatee.</li>
            <li> I reckon that the Braun is worthwhile if you want to keep your body hair trimmed, or even your head of hair shaved (incidentally, I had a friend who was bald but had a luxuriant beard - some kid came up to him and said, \\&quot;Hey Mister!</li>
            <li> Convenient, easy to use and great battery life when fully recharged.</li>
            <li> Smooth, easy to use and the best part?</li>
            <li> The best I&#x27;ve found so far is Norelco&#x27;s product which isn&#x27;t great, but it does the job much more effectively than this one.</li>
            <li> The Braun Cruzer 6 works amazingly.  </li>
            <li> I was thinking that it would be handy to have both a razor and trimmer in one contraption</li>
            <li> Nice design</li>
            <li> It shaves nice and close without any worry of nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li> B004WIUNBW Cruzer 6]] has been lovingly re-gifted to my wife...</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the design  or just the over all intended function that I can&#x27;t get on board with.</li>
            <li> charging stand is nice</li>
            <li> A nice thing to mention about the charger</li>
            <li> really impressed with how easy it is to clean too.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to any guy looking to tidy up.</li>
            <li> The carrying case/holster is a nice touch, I keep it rested on a ledge in my shower.</li>
            <li> I own both the Braun cruzer and the Philips bodygroom pro.</li>
            <li> electric trimmer cuts hairs fairly closely and without too many passes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that it can be used in the shower and uses easy-to-find razor cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice product for the price</li>
            <li> Just make sure to stretch the skin your shaving or it&#x27;ll cut you and it doesn&#x27;t feel to good...</li>
            <li> It works very smoothly and I am really glad I splurged on it!</li>
            <li> i am a very hairy man and it work very good)</li>
            <li> but if you want a nice one, I&#x27;d shop around a bit more.</li>
            <li> this is a great product, make shaving easy and stress free.</li>
            <li> Love, love, LOVE this thing!</li>
            <li> - Seems pretty rugged  - Works great in the shower  </li>
            <li> The Body Cruzer works fine!</li>
            <li> Love the grip of the handle, trimmer and shaver feel very smooth.</li>
            <li> It is good in your travel kit for quick and convenient use but would not be the best alternative for a regular use.</li>
            <li> the cruzer 6 from braun is very good in performance and is comfortable to use.the shaver is very reliable .once</li>
            <li> Hair clippers work much better.</li>
            <li> The attached razor ends up getting in the way more often than not.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off using a separate trimmer and razor than this hybrid monstrosity.</li>
            <li> Also so many attachments</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more of a trimmer than a shaver, so the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> While I keep most of my face clean-shaven, I do have a goatee that I like to keep well-groomed.</li>
            <li> So I use the Fusion razor part of this tool to give most of my face a close shave, but then I use the electronic trimmer to address my goatee.</li>
            <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> Ive used much better electic trimmers at a lower price.</li>
            <li> Separate clippers and a disposable razor would probably be better for most people.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t trim or shave more than you intended to.</li>
            <li> It seems that, in some circles, body hair is no longer sexy or desirable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure others out there on the market are better than this once.</li>
            <li> This shaver is ok.</li>
            <li> ok product,</li>
            <li> Love em, would by again in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> That being said the shave with the fusion is ok, but</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding shaver/trimmer that couples with the Gillette fusion blades.  </li>
            <li> My car was stolen and my boyfriend was able to use at all ..</li>
            <li> You will love this razor.</li>
            <li> I love that you can soften the hair with ths trimmer and than shave it all out with the blade, this</li>
            <li> device itself is very well engineered, manual is great, and it comes with a carrying</li>
            <li> It is safe to use in shower.  </li>

            <li> Be sure to use the guards</li>
            <li> This is a great product that is easy to use and works exactly as it should.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had about 5 different body trimmers over the years and this is easily the best.</li>
            <li> Man-caves are all very well if you can keep the bugs out and be warm in the winter, but I&#x27;ll just have to make do with my house.to him and said, \\&quot;Hey Mister!</li>
            <li> The medium attachment has a much more noticeable impact, and easily takes off lots of hair.</li>
            <li> The concept of the item is very cool and everything works as it should.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an essential that every man should have and it looks very good too.</li>
            <li> Well written and clear suggestions for a great trim and shave</li>
            <li> the purchase was fulfilled by 100%, everything turned out as expected and as always happens in this website, all perfect forever.</li>
            <li> I guess if you are really hairy that would be good advice.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very cool product and easy to use.</li>
            <li> A true winner!</li>
            <li> This trimmer is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Cleans up easily.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and charge</li>
            <li> Quicker than many to recharge, and so easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> keeps its charge well, easy manipulation to adjust to preferred length of trim you desire.</li>
            <li> The shaver itself is lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li> to the longer-hair trimming, I haven&#x27;t tried that, but it looks like it removes longer body hair fairly easily.</li>
            <li> It runs quietly, holds a charge fairly well and has a nice hanger attachment to use if you would like to keep it hung in the shower.</li>
            <li> The best for sure, value for money, come with different trimmers for different uses, with nice kit and practical to use guide.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this thing three stars instead of two because the razor is fine, the trimmer works fine too.  </li>
            <li> It was a fine investment for all my trimming needs.</li>
            <li> The Bruan Shaver really is waterproof so shower use is easy and effective and it can be humg up easily by the handle.  </li>
            <li> Not super awesome, but it gets the job done.&lt;br</li>
            <li> does just fine for what it was made, greetings</li>
            <li> WISH THE CHARGE LIGHT WOULD CHANGED COLOR WHEN RAZOR IS FULLY CHARGED.</li>
            <li> On the contrary, the Body Cruzer 6 is primarily a trimmer.  </li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t sound like a chainsaw when you turn it on, which is also a relief.</li>
            <li> The Fussion razor on the back is great too.</li>
            <li> If you are getting by with your razor and/or trimmer and haven&#x27;t thought about upgrading you might enjoy this even if you don&#x27;t need it</li>
            <li> one pass and hair is gone, smooth finish.</li>
            <li> Trimmer works great, removing the dreaded \\&quot;back of neck hair\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Man-caves are all very well if you can keep the bugs out and be warm in the winter, but I&#x27;ll just have to make do with my house.</li>
            <li> This is a nice trimmer/body shaver with a few great features and one or two</li>
            <li> This is especially true in sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something like this product for a while now so far so good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am sure it will work well for other manscaping ventures, however I am not the kind of fella who requires that kind of TLC.</li>
            <li> The embedded 5 blade razor allows to have trim and shave in one step leaving a clean smooth skin</li>
            <li> - Well-designed, great grip, nice looking  - Suprising amount of power out of a small package  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other Braun clippers/shavers before and they&#x27;ve all been pretty damn awesome.</li>
            <li> Was excited to get a rechargeable battery operated body shaver that could be used in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Why not just use the razor and get a better result instead of doing what is recommended in the instructions of using the Braun shaver first then use the razor for increased closeness.  </li>
            <li> ORIGINAL REVIEW</li>
            <li> The concept of this product is pretty interesting.</li>
            <li> Superb German quality, light, washable, good looking, small charging dock.</li>
            <li> If you like that clean shaven look from head to toe, then the Braun Cruzer 6 Body Cruzer, 6 Body Shaver will get you there looking clean and hairless.</li>
            <li> It does not pull on longer hair, and leaves a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> first thing i already try the trimmer alone with the combs and without them ,to trim Under the armpit and the sensitive areas and its very good , also i try the Gillette Fusion alone to shave my beard and it work very well</li>
            <li> nothing special.</li>
            <li> amazingly good clean shaving product for back of man&#x27;s neck</li>
            <li> /&gt;amazingly good clean shaving product for back of man&#x27;s neck</li>
            <li> /&gt;amazingly good clean shaving product for back of man&#x27;s neck</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s cool you can use it in the shower.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a strange hybrid that does not know what it wants to be, and to be honest I&#x27;m not so sure how I will use it, it could have been better in both aspects.</li>
            <li> The Cruzer shaves quickly and cleanly and removes \\&quot;tougher\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The different size attachments are good for different hair lengths, good for chest and underarms.</li>
            <li> hey.. just the fact that I don&#x27;t have to pack both is good enough for me.</li>
            <li> So it is only fair that I edit my review and bump up the rating to do justice to the product.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad for trimming up the odds and ends.</li>
            <li> Overall I would recommend this since a huge part is being able to use it in the shower!</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m not going for the bald overall body look, this shaver/trimmer actually was perfect for me.  </li>
            <li> The Braun Shaver works quickly so you need to pay attention when you are using it</li>
            <li> You have to hold it at a certain angle for the trimmer to trim correctly but also make sure the razor is hitting your skin right.</li>
            <li> It works very well and is extremely easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> Removes back hair leaving a nice smooth shaved look.</li>
            <li> Build is super.</li>
            <li> it missed lot of hairs, so you better expect to spend more time running it couple of times on the same spot.</li>
            <li> Using no attachments, the system glides smoothly over your skin and takes off pretty much all hairs it attacks for a very clean look.</li>
            <li> All in all a very capable and comfortable device.</li>
            <li> Super sharp and very nice against the skin.</li>
            <li> Works better than my old one!</li>
            <li> I used medium and large and noticed the large is great for just &#x60;taking a little off the top,&#x27; so you don&#x27;t feel bald if you use it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very effective at removing hair although that may be due to soaking in the shower first.</li>
            <li> Combs for different trim and cut lengths are included, as well as a really nice storage bag, which allows the razor and the combs to be stored in the shower.  </li>
            <li> It does a good job with the privates which can be difficult to access and get a good close shave.</li>
            <li> It is powerful and waterproof.</li>
            <li> If nothing else the trimmer is worth the price</li>
            <li> Probably at around $25 to $30 it is well worth the money.would</li>
            <li> i would buy it again, worth every dollar, this is what you need for body shaving.</li>
            <li> First off, this is not a bad product.</li>
            <li> other wise it pulls hair...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still looking for a truly high quality trimmer for the male body - if anyone has any good suggestions, please let me know.  </li>
            <li> The hair just doesn&#x27;t trim right or go through the comb</li>
            <li> This razor worked great at first, but after a few months it got weaker and weaker and just died.  </li>
            <li> The attachments snap on somewhat easily, but take a little more focus to detach from the razor--trying to pull them off quickly could result in breaking them because they have plastic tabs that really click securely into place around the shaft of the unit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The battery is better, the trimmer is better (doesn&#x27;t tug and needs less passes), the clips are better designed, comes with an extra set of shaving blades,</li>
            <li> Charging is very fast too.</li>
            <li> First time using Braun.</li>
            <li> Overall I just love.</li>
            <li> Like many men, I have facial hair.</li>
            <li> I have had mine for over 3 years and it works like the first day.</li>
            <li> I used it with no guard for the first time using it at all and didn&#x27;t get one cut or close call.</li>
            <li> Once I figured that out (and I like electric shavers more than bladed shavers, mostly because I&#x27;m too lazy for creams and replacing blades), I tried the powered trimmer side, to see if it met my needs.  </li>
            <li> Fast, simple, easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> More so if you actually used the bladed portion!</li>
            <li> (and he&#x27;s pretty picky about his products).</li>
            <li> Already have a better shaver than this, It is same brand, The razor on this 1 is just in the way.</li>
            <li> The only thing I find better with the Philips device is its adjustable comb.</li>
            <li> When I first bought a Gillette</li>
            <li> No cuts and clean save in sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> The good:    - nice design --- it just looks good, including the charger base  - easy to use  - can be used in the shower  - comes with different extensions so you can decide how short you want to trim whatever area (ahem)</li>
            <li> Kind of pricey, but worth the investment (your significant other will thank you later).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different trimmers and this is by far the best!</li>
            <li> so I was happy to see this is one step above everything other razor I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> The shaver is easy to use and smooth, and the Gillette fusion razor is very sharp.</li>
            <li> you like to look smooth and have a more than average need to shave and trim and have considered a new product - this is the product for you.  </li>
            <li> Pretty nice little tool for manscaping.</li>
            <li> I love that it can be used dry or in the shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to shave the body in a short time in the shower.</li>
            <li> While easy to find, that brand of razor cartridge is not necessarily cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you are a guy that shaves a large portion of you</li>
            <li> a body shaver that works great on both wet and dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I lucked out and found zilostore dot com who sells &amp;#34;compatible&amp;#34; blades that are of the EXACT SAME QUALITY as the Gillette original.  </li>
            <li> It easily exceeded my expectations, and I am not generally a \\&quot;gadget\\&quot; guy.</li>
            <li> , it takes the gillette fusion heads, much more reasonably priced and easy to find than other replacements for different razors.  </li>
            <li> Boyfriend says it doesn&#x27;t shave very close....</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> How much space is it really going to save on your counter anyways?</li>
            <li> Back and chest hair comes off smoothly by just running the razor across your skin.</li>
            <li> Too much hair?</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> It really is a body shaver.</li>
            <li> So, in a nutshell, I&#x27;d recommend this product if you&#x27;re in the market for a body shaver, but I wouldn&#x27;t expect too much from the attached Fusion razor.     </li>
            <li> I think the device costs so much because it is truly waterproof.  </li>
            <li> It does the job and does it reasonably well.</li>
            <li> He really likes it and would buy it again if anything were to happen to it.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s get the negatives out of the way: yes, if you have too much hair and plow into it like a sharecropper, something will catch in the blade and you&#x27;ll get nicked.</li>
            <li> so unusual for me, i read the manual..</li>
            <li> Recommendable for the modern man who wants to be grommed for himself and cares about his image.</li>
            <li> I really like this device,</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t as comfortable to use as a regular razor, but</li>
            <li> recharged it lasts very well and is waterproof .</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It is a must have razor for any man who wants to be well kept and groomed.</li>
            <li> I chose the powered version, and I thought it was better than the manual razor and only a few dollars more.</li>
            <li> I would much rather use a corded shaver.</li>
            <li> haha.  </li>
            <li> In quantity I think you can get the blades for about a buck a piece making this a very affordable alternative.  </li>
            <li> Zilostore made this a very viable product for me.</li>
            <li> The combined electric and blade razor make the job much quicker.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut, and is gentle.</li>
            <li> I really like the 3 sizes of guards, and the 3 options of trimming, trimming and shaving, or just shaving.</li>
            <li> It does what it says for real.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how much information I really should share here...</li>
            <li> Holds a charge well and is very ergonomic.</li>
            <li> This razor is a nice enough product, but was not as powerful as expected.  </li>
            <li> How many other body shavers are capable of giving you a close shave for your face?</li>
            <li> Just shave in the shower, rinse out and its clean and ready to be placed back in its charging stand.</li>
            <li> Great for trimming or actual shaving, it makes fast work of a repetitive and unending job.  </li>
            <li> I love this trimmer and somewhat disturbed by other reviews.  </li>
            <li> exchangeable heads work great for different body parts:&lt;br /&gt;- Sensitive for \\&quot;down there\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a few Braun products in the past and have always been impressed with them</li>
            <li> If you are a triathlete it might make sense but if you are the average Joe that just wants to avoid looking like Sasquatch there are better</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t add to all the other reviews which are pretty accurate.  </li>
            <li> I have long been a fan of Braun and their products, and this shaver is so cheaply made that it doesn&#x27;t deserve the name &amp;#34;Braun&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> here I am, but to be honest I&#x27;m not sure what I can do here.</li>
            <li> Overall, It is not a bad product but not something that gives you the feeling of &amp;#34;well groomed&amp;#34; .</li>
            <li> Once again, not a horrible product... just slightly disapointed.</li>
            <li> After several uses by each, I personally like the BodyGroom Pro better.</li>
            <li> Only used once for my husband&#x27;s back and WOW sooo very easy to use, piece of cake.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it can be used in the shower, washing the mess away instead of finding it in the sink.  </li>
            <li> If that is also your intended use, I would highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought it anyway with high hopes.</li>
            <li> highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is thin, so it&#x27;s comfortable and easy to grip in the hand, and also very lightweight, so</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this as a primary shaver or trimmer though due to a lack of real power and the fact that trying to trim too much at once the hair tends to get frequently stuck in the plastic trimming attachment.  </li>
            <li> In other words, there&#x27;s nothing special or electronic involved with the shaving function, and I would be far better off with a disposable razor to meet my limited ladyscaping needs.</li>
            <li> The incorporated Gillette blade is very usefull for complete hair removal, using the Cruzer without any of the adjustable blades</li>
            <li> , I just u buy a normal shaver to shave that hair.</li>
            <li> Coming from someone who had the Bodygr00m, this thing is way better in every single aspect possible.  </li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s nothing new.</li>
            <li> I never changed / sharpened blades but still works like a new blade.</li>
            <li> The slide out razor blade seems a little flimsy and it is easy to engage or retract the blade when the user does not mean to do so.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> Of course, for more delicate areas, you absolutely must pull the skin taut as explained in the manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Body hair builds below the blades and drops away when it is long, however if you are re-trimming previously trimmed hair, a collection of fine hair will interfere if it isn&#x27;t cleared with a puff of breath or quick shake.</li>
            <li> In the end, the trimmer simply doesn&#x27;t do as good of a job on thick hair has my [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I have shavers that are wet/dry, but not one where they recommend you to use directly IN the shower, so I had to ask for one!  </li>
            <li> If you are a man reading this and are with a significant other, chances are the amount of body hair you possess is probably always an issue.</li>
            <li> It looks pretty but is not built to last.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m back to powered shaving and although I still prefer the manual Schick, the Braun is pretty close to</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve personally found the only smooth shave comes from a professional barber</li>
            <li> Braun has equipped the razor with a shower caddy enabling the user to quickly hang the product, which can be very convenient if the shower being used has little or no shelf space.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so i was a little heistant to buy it, but everything yurnt out fine.</li>
            <li> But if you keep up with the maintenance (I go about every other week just so the hairs don&#x27;t get too long on my underarms and chest, and pelvic area) and use gentle strokes, you should be fine.</li>
            <li> It has three plastic attachments: sensitive, medium, and large, to buzz your hair at different lengths.</li>
            <li> Sensitive areas are best served with one of the included guards, if the skin is thin and fine enough to fold or present a smaller than .5 fold, it may possibly fit into the cutting stroke of the unguarded blades.</li>
            <li> (Also, on a completely separate note, if you do decide to use this in the shower, and depending on how hairy you are, make sure to pick a bottle or two of Drano at the same time, because all that hair going down your shower drain may lead to clogged drains!)</li>
            <li> When I was offered a chance to review the Braun Body Cruzer 6, it was clear the appliance was being marketed towards men.  </li>
            <li> However, Braun is clear in its warning that this shaver not be used on the face, so I have avoiding using it there.  </li>
            <li> it claims it does sensitive trimming, but no matter the setting i was in all it did was pull.</li>
            <li> Shaving my legs is one of my least favorite activities.  </li>
            <li> only thing I really don&#x27;t like about the unit is the manual razor attachment.</li>
            <li> It gets that fuzz that grows on the back of my neck between haircuts, as well as my sideburns when they start growing too fast.</li>
            <li> I lost a couple heads to my old trimmer, so I decided to buy this one.</li>
            <li> Most of the clippers and razors that claim they can be used wet are only waterproof in the cutting area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun makes good quality, well-designed items</li>
            <li> And for folks who run in those circles, Braun offers its Braun Cruzer 6 Body Cruzer, 6 Body Shaver.  </li>
            <li> The Braun model seems to be doing the trick so far.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use the razor attached, only the buzzer, but I suppose that can get the tricky hairs you couldn&#x27;t take off with just the clipper.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts &amp;#34;weeks&amp;#34; (*I don&#x27;t use it on a daily basis but have travelled for a whole week and have not need to recharge it).</li>
            <li> This trimmer is very week and does not trim the hair properly...</li>
            <li> Even on sensitive setting</li>
            <li> No nicks in sensitive areas....</li>
            <li> someone with long body hair who wants to remove all of it down to smooth skin, this device may be ideal but for someone looking to shave OR trim on a regular basis, this hybrid seems overcomplicated and awkward.  </li>
            <li> The plastic feels very cheap, battery life is short, and the size of the trimmer is ridiculously small.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, the trimmer is far inferior to every other trimmer I&#x27;ve used, and even considerably cheaper ones are much more versatile.</li>
            <li> Would recommend starting dry and only doing fine trimming in the water.</li>
            <li> This one is really good but a little bit small.</li>
            <li> But the product seems fine since you can use it wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Rechargeable battery with a decent back up 4.</li>
            <li> Overall, highly recommended for this type of use.  </li>
            <li> Fits well in the charger and doesn&#x27;t take up much space on the counter as long as you have space to begin with.</li>
            <li> plastic on it feels a little cheap, but the build feels solid.</li>
            <li> Other then that the Braun unit has pretty much replaced all other units for my shaving and grooming needs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 44 years old and tried alot of body trimmers and beard trimmers over the years - this is the one I settled on and the one I keep coming back to.</li>
            <li> Especially if you are looking for a trimmer for sensitive areas, nothing beats this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a personal groomer for the sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> Personally, I use this mainly to trim my beard because I&#x27;m not into the whole manscaping thing, but if you are, I think you&#x27;ll like this device, with a few caveats.    </li>
            <li> but it seems that since Gillette took over they are emphasizing disposable parts and supplies even for things like clippers and shavers that did not previously require an ongoing supply of cleaning fluid or blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You want stubble - it gives you stubble, real stubble, not the 3mm stuff other trimmers call &amp;#34;stubble.&amp;#34; You want a longer &amp;#34;Winter&amp;#34; beard</li>
            <li> The head is small which is good for some areas of your body but slow larger areas such as the chest and abdomen.  </li>
            <li> It has two real advantages: 1) it can be used in the shower, as other folks have mentioned; and 2) it uses the Gillette Fusion blades so if you have that already, you don&#x27;t have to buy into a whole other product.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> but you know what all ready so take the time and slow down, clean off hair clogging them from time to time as well.  </li>
            <li> you may experience a small cut, but even this is extremely rare.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this (and any other Braun product) to anyone.</li>
            <li> (I am very hairy) to keep hair presence, but shorter and less dense&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re used to being disappointed by the latest 5-blade razors and electronic shavers that claim to leave you hairless with no effort, it might be worth taking a look at the Cruzer.</li>
            <li> Gentle enough to go down town and leave no nics or cuts.</li>
            <li> This goes without saying really, any trimmer is subject to such limitations.</li>
            <li> My prior Bodygroom died after too much water exposure (I actually bought two previously), and I wanted something that would hold up.</li>
            <li> The Braun Cruzer is a really nifty little shaver.  </li>
            <li> Be extremely cautious on loose skin especially on sensitive setting or expect to have some nicks.</li>
            <li> The main problem I have with it, it&#x27;s not really and electric razor and not really manual one</li>
            <li> I use to shave my chest and stomach with a normal shaver and this little guy makes it faster smoother and easier.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and my hair grows very fast.</li>
            <li> Both work very well, but not sure i like them together.</li>
            <li> And if so, wouldn&#x27;t you prefer to use the standard Fusion razor handle, rather than this much bulkier trimmer that makes using the razor a bit clumsy?</li>
            <li> When it comes to the razor side of things, using it is akward and far less nimble than just using a seperate razer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has six settings, but I would only use it fully closed or fully open with the trimmer.</li>
            <li> Long battery life</li>
            <li> The trimmer it constantly pulling my hair as it tries to cut...</li>
            <li> Which us about 1-2mm long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a hairy guy at all, but it takes me a long time to trim with this and the trimmer clogs up a lot.  </li>
            <li> This is a strange hybrid of a razor and an electric clipper that reminds me of a langoustine.  </li>
            <li> I had spent lot of time reading reviews on this item and researching similar items online before buying this one.</li>
            <li> Long for chest</li>
            <li> battery lasts long.</li>
            <li> Remember to clean and oil after every use or often to maintain blade sharpness as this will long delay excessive wear which would dull the blades requiring premature replacement.</li>
            <li> try as I might, I am uncomfortable putting clippers with a five-blade razor duct taped to them near certain areas of my body.</li>
            <li> The additional guards that come with the trimmer completely eliminate any chance of a nick, but are for trimming hair less extremely.</li>
            <li> My husband had been wanting one of these for a very long time.</li>
            <li> but it might be more product than you actually need day to day, which isn&#x27;t always bad - just something to consider.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really sit securely in the charging base though.</li>
            <li> I like this because you can use it in the shower or on dry land.</li>
            <li> Limited to the travel kit.</li>
            <li> It is simple - just a few attachments to cut your hair different lengths, not 14 attachments like some other trimmers.</li>
            <li> You can use it wet or dry, so no hair all over the bathroom.</li>
            <li> I Like the shaving results, not used to using a razor for body hair,  however you get used to it and lasts as long as other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> But I can&#x27;t hold my skin tight and use the shaver at the same time.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t appear as sturdy as some of the other Braun shavers that I have used, such as [[ASIN:B003YJAZZE Braun Series 7-760cc Pulsonic Shaver System, Black and Silver]].</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the other half of our two-car garage (we only have one car).</li>
            <li> this is mighty dangerous.  </li>
            <li> The blade and guard geometry allow you to go over moles or rough surfaces with no issues.</li>
            <li> I have not used it in the shower as a wet shave, so cannot attest to it&#x27;s performance there.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s what allows the fully wet shaving aspect.  </li>
            <li> The biggest downside is the cost of the unit and the replacement hardware so minus a star.</li>
            <li> The only things I don&#x27;t like is its slow charge, and it only holds that charge for 50 min.</li>
            <li> Because of its size it can be difficult to get the right angle.</li>
            <li> Its not very good at shaving/trimming in general.</li>
            <li> and I will certainly never EVER buy any other brand.</li>
            <li> But it was for trimming and/or shaving any part of the body, other than the face.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see any other reason to buy it but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for two years and it stayed sharp and won&#x27;t tug hairs despite my wife and I sharing it and using weekly.</li>
            <li> trimmer doesn&#x27;t cut sharp and well.</li>
            <li> Not a consistent shave.</li>
            <li> and it has been extremely annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look</li>
            <li> Why this shaver was ducky on my chest rug but be careful down under.</li>
            <li> Sure, you can use this trimmer in the shower, but with wet hair, it&#x27;s almost worthless.</li>
            <li> I only wish that I could use it to remove some of those stubborn white stubble hairs that the 760cc leaves behind.</li>
            <li> I said to my wife, \\&quot;What do you think we should do with the other half of the garage?</li>
            <li> I imagined the Braun Cruzer 6 would irritate my skin just as bad, if not worse, but I was wrong; totally comfortable.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ve always thought the five-blade situation was really overkill, an expensive gimmick.  </li>
            <li> shaving system is so sleek and compact that just the look alone is less intimidating.</li>
            <li> This shaver has already lasted longer than previous trimmers so that is a plus.</li>
            <li> Sad to say when i open it and read the manual, it is only upto 120V.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m half shaved and have to go buy another trimmer.</li>
            <li> Operation is quite compared to the previous unit I had 6.</li>
            <li> To do my testicles you have to hold the skin tight and shave.</li>
            <li> Not sure about the other 4 settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes the guards are a little flimsy</li>
            <li> But the photo is a little misleading as it doesn&#x27;t show both sides.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge well, and it get the job done with little effort.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m having trouble useing it.</li>
            <li> and it is not easy to bend to shave my legs.</li>
            <li> Cleaning is not easy unless you use a compressed air duster.  </li>
            <li> This thing unfortunately does not complete it&#x27;s duty, it&#x27;s gets stuck and jammed</li>
            <li> Just a very small segment of the bottom of the unit is cradled in the base, so you can easily knock it over if you bump into it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> who like the look of this shaver will not be disappointed: it is well made, water resistant, quick to charge and slow to discharge, and if nothing else something of a conversation piece for your bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> This little sucker will help.</li>
            <li> My problem is the shower which is small</li>
            <li> too expensive, both the initial cost and replacement blades</li>
            <li> At this price range the cost to Value ratio is not very good.</li>
            <li> The blades didn&#x27;t seem sharp enough to cut my hair without some painful \\&quot;tugging\\&quot; on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Without the added guards, the trim length is (approximately) .5mm or less.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it does feel a little odd going across your man parts, but it cuts quite a bit close.</li>
            <li> Two of these Gillette razor heads were included in the package at least.    </li>
            <li> And it didn&#x27;t save me any time to have both the razor and trimmer in one place because when using the trimmer side I had to remove the razor head on the back anyways because I was afraid I&#x27;d slice myself accidentally while getting in the nooks and crannies.      </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit confusing.</li>
            <li> I know they included this to make it an all-in-one type thing, but I found it uncomfortable to use and unnecessary because anyone will have a regular razor already.  </li>
            <li> I thought of trimming love-messages into my chest hair, but of course if I&#x27;m rejected I&#x27;d have to wait at least a couple of months to try again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I had save the receipt and the box, I&#x27;d return this for a refund - I hate it that much.  </li>
            <li> my hair isnt even thick either,,,, i say dont buy it..</li>
            <li> The little clipper works well and the razor works well if it is a little awkward to handle.  </li>
            <li> The dock consumes a very small amount of space on a bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No super expensive refills, either</li>
            <li> If you are planning to use the trimmer and blade on one stroke, It takes little of practice to do it ; However it is not perfect but does the job if you are in a hurry.</li>
            <li> Buzzing your chest or back isn&#x27;t so bad.</li>
            <li> This is not a good invention.  </li>
            <li> Trying to use them at the same is beyond awkward into difficult territory</li>
            <li> seriously dont waste your money... pulls my hair instead of cutting it...  </li>
            <li> Also, for guys like me who only want to trim (not shave) their body, having the shaver blade attached to the trimmer is very inconvenient.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little awkward trying to shave with the trimmer and the razor.</li>
            <li> but if your doing it a lightening spend you will end of with poor results.  </li>
            <li> , guys you should seriously give it a shot!</li>
            <li> The razor is placed a little awkwardly and the replacement blades are expensive.</li>
            <li> Taking an industrial-type electric buzzer to your body can be a scary proposition.</li>
            <li> Those big nasty metal teeth...</li>
            <li> What was not impressive  1.</li>
            <li> it uses some weird touch charger so all I have to do is place the razor in the charger</li>
            <li> In addition to the trimmer/shaver and the recharging base, the kit comes with a small carrying bag in which to hold the machine and the three attachable plastic combs that help trim hair to the desired length.  </li>
            <li> But the razor placement is in a rather dangerous place, one slip and its all over lads.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> EM recharging system which means no jacks or pins , just drop the unit on to base that is connected to the wall outlet.</li>
            <li> ouch, the blade shaver is worthless and I cant imagine why they even designed it this way</li>
            <li> problem was that it was painful to use!</li>
            <li> hated it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>
            <li> And the worst thing, it will kinck/cut you.</li>
            <li> They are downright outrageous and NEVER on sale.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Boyfriend says it doesn&#x27;t shave very close....</li>
            <li> First time using Braun. Love the grip of the handle, trimmer and shaver feel very smooth. Charged once since I got it and used it twice without any loss of power.</li>
            <li> NO COMPAINTS. WORKS WELL. WISH THE CHARGE LIGHT WOULD CHANGED COLOR WHEN RAZOR IS FULLY CHARGED. CAN NOT HAVE EVERYTHING</li>
            <li> Great product. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> hated it. it claims it does sensitive trimming, but no matter the setting i was in all it did was pull. returned and bought the gillete one instead</li>
            <li> I love this product! It comes with a convenient charging doc. The trimmer and razor are both great. I love that it can be used dry or in the shower. This is a great product that is easy to use and works exactly as it should. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a razor/trimmer combo.</li>
            <li> Shaving my legs is one of my least favorite activities.  When I was offered a chance to review the Braun Body Cruzer 6, it was clear the appliance was being marketed towards men.  But it was for trimming and/or shaving any part of the body, other than the face.  How different can \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot; your chest be from \\&quot;ladyscaping\\&quot; my legs, I thought.  Well, it was a good thought, but off-base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was envisioning a machine that was both an electronic razor and a trimmer.  On the contrary, the Body Cruzer 6 is primarily a trimmer.  In addition to the trimmer/shaver and the recharging base, the kit comes with a small carrying bag in which to hold the machine and the three attachable plastic combs that help trim hair to the desired length.  The bag will also hold extra disposable razor heads, because that&#x27;s the extent of the \\&quot;shaving system.\\&quot;  It&#x27;s a manual razor that&#x27;s attached to the trimmer that can be slid into position as needed.  In other words, there&#x27;s nothing special or electronic involved with the shaving function, and I would be far better off with a disposable razor to meet my limited ladyscaping needs.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is easy to use.  It holds it charge well.  There is no pulling or tugging.  Cleans up easily.  Works great as a beard trimmer too.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my sin for Christmas.  He is very impressed with the way it works and the quality of the products.</li>
            <li> Why this shaver was ducky on my chest rug but be careful down under. I slipped and waked my second head was like Popeyes on wak. It did great mowing my chest which took a while but it  was groovey. Overall I just love. It but watch the head.</li>
            <li> Hair clippers work much better.</li>
            <li> I have my balls all shve and no cuts!.</li>
            <li> I have not gotten any cuts with this body shaver.</li>
            <li> This is not a good invention.  I was thinking that it would be handy to have both a razor and trimmer in one contraption but that isn&#x27;t so.  Because the trimmer is larger and wider than a regular razor I found the grip wasn&#x27;t as stable when shaving.  It slipped around in my hand and with a five bladed razor this is mighty dangerous.  Also, I&#x27;ve always thought the five-blade situation was really overkill, an expensive gimmick.  Two of these Gillette razor heads were included in the package at least.    And it didn&#x27;t save me any time to have both the razor and trimmer in one place because when using the trimmer side I had to remove the razor head on the back anyways because I was afraid I&#x27;d slice myself accidentally while getting in the nooks and crannies.      I&#x27;m giving this thing three stars instead of two because the razor is fine, the trimmer works fine too.  Plus it&#x27;s cool you can use it in the shower.  So by all means I can suggest you buy a Gillette razor or a Braun trimmer, just do yourself a favor and buy both independently.  How much space is it really going to save on your counter anyways?</li>
            <li> Taking an industrial-type electric buzzer to your body can be a scary proposition. Those big nasty metal teeth...EEK and OUCH! Buzzing your chest or back isn&#x27;t so bad. It&#x27;s the nooks and crannies that cower in fear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaving system is so sleek and compact that just the look alone is less intimidating. And it doesn&#x27;t sound like a chainsaw when you turn it on, which is also a relief. It has three plastic attachments: sensitive, medium, and large, to buzz your hair at different lengths. I used medium and large and noticed the large is great for just &#x60;taking a little off the top,&#x27; so you don&#x27;t feel bald if you use it, you just cleaned up some of the scruffiness. The medium attachment has a much more noticeable impact, and easily takes off lots of hair. Using no attachments, the system glides smoothly over your skin and takes off pretty much all hairs it attacks for a very clean look. Back and chest hair comes off smoothly by just running the razor across your skin. Of course, for more delicate areas, you absolutely must pull the skin taut as explained in the manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is designed so that you hold it totally vertical when moving across the skin--no angling like with a regular razor. The attachments snap on somewhat easily, but take a little more focus to detach from the razor--trying to pull them off quickly could result in breaking them because they have plastic tabs that really click securely into place around the shaft of the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is thin, so it&#x27;s comfortable and easy to grip in the hand, and also very lightweight, so it&#x27;s perfect for use in the shower. It doesn&#x27;t really sit securely in the charging base though. Just a very small segment of the bottom of the unit is cradled in the base, so you can easily knock it over if you bump into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I really don&#x27;t like about the unit is the manual razor attachment. On the back of the unit is a sliding lever that holds a standard handheld razor blade, I guess for extra-close finishing touches after bulk shaving, or for the convenience of having a razor to shave your face. But this manual razor actually moves ABOVE the level of the electric blades, so just imagine if that manual razor should accidentally move into place for use while you&#x27;re taking care of body hair with the electric part and don&#x27;t notice it. Yeah--I took that razor blade off the unit and never intend to have it on there....ing touches after bulk shaving, or for the convenience of having a razor to shave your face.

            <li> I&#x27;ve had other Braun clippers/shavers before and they&#x27;ve all been pretty damn awesome. This one as well...  - Well-designed, great grip, nice looking  - Suprising amount of power out of a small package  - Designed to actually work on an actual body!  - Seems pretty rugged  - Works great in the shower  So replacement blades will cost you. But that&#x27;s nothing new.</li>
            <li> This razor is a nice enough product, but was not as powerful as expected.  It runs quietly, holds a charge fairly well and has a nice hanger attachment to use if you would like to keep it hung in the shower. It does need several hours of charging time for about 15 minutes of use, but using it 5 minutes at a time weekly, the battery has maintained it&#x27;s charge for several weeks. Nice for a trim if you&#x27;re not looking for perfectly even results.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this as a primary shaver or trimmer though due to a lack of real power and the fact that trying to trim too much at once the hair tends to get frequently stuck in the plastic trimming attachment.  I&#x27;d look elsewhere or wait for a revised version of this product.</li>
            <li> K. Franklin&#x27;s earlier review was spot on. The best thing I can say about this product is that it&#x27;s waterproof. Other than that, the trimmer is far inferior to every other trimmer I&#x27;ve used, and even considerably cheaper ones are much more versatile. Sure, you can use this trimmer in the shower, but with wet hair, it&#x27;s almost worthless. The attached razor ends up getting in the way more often than not. You&#x27;re better off using a separate trimmer and razor than this hybrid monstrosity.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to shave the body in a short time in the shower. My problem is the shower which is small and it is not easy to bend to shave my legs.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful body shaver.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad for trimming up the odds and ends. But the razor placement is in a rather dangerous place, one slip and its all over lads. Also so many attachments it&#x27;s a bit confusing. What I have done is basically remove the razor, its just too close for comfort and I use the trimmer which works well. I do like that it is water proofed and you use it in the shower. The main problem I have with it, it&#x27;s not really and electric razor and not really manual one it&#x27;s a strange hybrid that does not know what it wants to be, and to be honest I&#x27;m not so sure how I will use it, it could have been better in both aspects.</li>
            <li> My husband is so hairy I often refer to him as my ape...so shavers are a regular in our household.&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;+ Nice design&lt;br /&gt;+ Easy to use and charge&lt;br /&gt;+ Comes with travel case&lt;br /&gt;+ Long battery life&lt;br /&gt;+ Can use in shower&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-Currently too expensive, both the initial cost and replacement blades</li>
            <li> The Braun Cruzer is a really nifty little shaver.  It has two real advantages: 1) it can be used in the shower, as other folks have mentioned; and 2) it uses the Gillette Fusion blades so if you have that already, you don&#x27;t have to buy into a whole other product.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I use it all the time to get to the nose hair after shaving. Great for men over fifty that are sprouting out hairs all over like in your ears. Too much hair? This little sucker will help. I really like it.</li>
            <li> This groomer is excellent. Build quality is solid, running time is excellent, closeness of trim is impressive. I do not utilize the shave section, but it looks well engineered to operate with the trimmer. If that is also your intended use, I would highly recommend this item. Body hair builds below the blades and drops away when it is long, however if you are re-trimming previously trimmed hair, a collection of fine hair will interfere if it isn&#x27;t cleared with a puff of breath or quick shake. All in all a very capable and comfortable device. If you have a skin aberration of some sort, and it fits within the blade profile you may experience a small cut, but even this is extremely rare. Has never pulled a hair. The blade and guard geometry allow you to go over moles or rough surfaces with no issues. When I say guard, I&#x27;m only speaking to the two perimeter raised areas on either side of the trimming blade. The additional guards that come with the trimmer completely eliminate any chance of a nick, but are for trimming hair less extremely. Without the added guards, the trim length is (approximately) .5mm or less. Sensitive areas are best served with one of the included guards, if the skin is thin and fine enough to fold or present a smaller than .5 fold, it may possibly fit into the cutting stroke of the unguarded blades. This goes without saying really, any trimmer is subject to such limitations. Remember to clean and oil after every use or often to maintain blade sharpness as this will long delay excessive wear which would dull the blades requiring premature replacement.</li>
            <li> The trimmer it constantly pulling my hair as it tries to cut...regardless of which guard I use</li>
            <li> My boyfriend is very happy with this body trimmer. It shaves nice and close without any worry of nicks and cuts. There was zero learning curve to use this, which made us both very happy!</li>
            <li> A disgrace for Braun to put their name to this item. It pinches and pulls facial hair. I tried to use it to trim my head hair... Which us about 1-2mm long. It works then blocks then pulls hair then doesn&#x27;t work at all. Very disappointed</li>
            <li> Finally!  a body shaver that works great on both wet and dry skin.  I love the fact that it can be used in the shower, washing the mess away instead of finding it in the sink.  What a time saver.  I have always found Braun products to be excellent, and this one is no exception.  Well written and clear suggestions for a great trim and shave, this product works all over the body.  No super expensive refills, either, it takes the gillette fusion heads, much more reasonably priced and easy to find than other replacements for different razors.  Great for trimming or actual shaving, it makes fast work of a repetitive and unending job.  Combs for different trim and cut lengths are included, as well as a really nice storage bag, which allows the razor and the combs to be stored in the shower.  Quicker than many to recharge, and so easy to clean.  A true winner!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more of a trimmer than a shaver, so the [[ASIN:B004WIUNBW Cruzer 6]] has been lovingly re-gifted to my wife... try as I might, I am uncomfortable putting clippers with a five-blade razor duct taped to them near certain areas of my body. Braver gentlemen (and ladies - why not?) who like the look of this shaver will not be disappointed: it is well made, water resistant, quick to charge and slow to discharge, and if nothing else something of a conversation piece for your bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> Like many men, I have facial hair. While I keep most of my face clean-shaven, I do have a goatee that I like to keep well-groomed. This tool lets me use the same razor for both. So I use the Fusion razor part of this tool to give most of my face a close shave, but then I use the electronic trimmer to address my goatee. This way I don&#x27;t need a razor and then a beard trimmer (which have never worked for my purposes as well as this does).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cruzer also works well for touch ups with stray hairs on the rest of my body. It gets that fuzz that grows on the back of my neck between haircuts, as well as my sideburns when they start growing too fast. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure it will work well for other manscaping ventures, however I am not the kind of fella who requires that kind of TLC. You may be, and I would check this versitile, well-thought out tool for those ventures as well.</li>
            <li> first thing i already try the trimmer alone with the combs and without them ,to trim Under the armpit and the sensitive areas and its very good , also i try the Gillette Fusion alone to shave my beard and it work very well .&lt;br /&gt;second thing i didn&#x27;t try the trimmer with the gillette fusion together and i will not try it because i don&#x27;t like this combination.(notice: i am a very hairy man and it work very good)</li>
            <li> I have never reviewed a product on Amazon before, but I felt the need to do so this time to save another guy from wasting his money on this product.  I have long been a fan of Braun and their products, and this shaver is so cheaply made that it doesn&#x27;t deserve the name &amp;#34;Braun&amp;#34;.  The plastic feels very cheap, battery life is short, and the size of the trimmer is ridiculously small.  I&#x27;m not a hairy guy at all, but it takes me a long time to trim with this and the trimmer clogs up a lot.  Also, for guys like me who only want to trim (not shave) their body, having the shaver blade attached to the trimmer is very inconvenient.  If I had save the receipt and the box, I&#x27;d return this for a refund - I hate it that much.  I&#x27;m still looking for a truly high quality trimmer for the male body - if anyone has any good suggestions, please let me know.  The best I&#x27;ve found so far is Norelco&#x27;s product which isn&#x27;t great, but it does the job much more effectively than this one.</li>
            <li> Awesome, it works wonderfully, it is the best thing ever and I will certainly never EVER buy any other brand. I got it as a gift for someone this time around and he loved it. I have had mine for over 3 years and it works like the first day. NO COMPLAINTS</li>
            <li> keeps its charge well, easy manipulation to adjust to preferred length of trim you desire. The embedded 5 blade razor allows to have trim and shave in one step leaving a clean smooth skin it its wake and the adjustable length of the 5 blade razor portion also provides a lot of flexibility in adjusting to various areas of the body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a few Braun products in the past and have always been impressed with them however, this is not one of those products. It really is a body shaver. I honestly don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the design  or just the over all intended function that I can&#x27;t get on board with. The unit is a combination trimmer and shaver. If you are a triathlete it might make sense but if you are the average Joe that just wants to avoid looking like Sasquatch there are better alternatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;-If you are a guy that shaves a large portion of you body this could work for you. It has both a trimmer and a shaver in the unit&lt;br /&gt;-Comes with three trimmer guards&lt;br /&gt;-Good battery life&lt;br /&gt;-Works well with water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;-Razor - Every time I head to the stores and see the price of razors I can&#x27;t believe the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In essence if you are looking for a trimmer get a different product. If you need a body shaver this works well.</li>
            <li> I love this thing. I lost a couple heads to my old trimmer, so I decided to buy this one. It was a fine investment for all my trimming needs. I used it with no guard for the first time using it at all and didn&#x27;t get one cut or close call. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it does feel a little odd going across your man parts, but it cuts quite a bit close. Overall I would recommend this since a huge part is being able to use it in the shower!</li>
            <li> First off, this is not a bad product. The concept of the item is very cool and everything works as it should. The Fussion razor on the back is great too. It just all around doesnt work as well as it should. Its not very good at shaving/trimming in general. And the worst thing, it will kinck/cut you. Ive used much better electic trimmers at a lower price. Once again, not a horrible product... just slightly disapointed.</li>
            <li> I guess this clipper works but I&#x27;m having trouble useing it. I can&#x27;t see and use it on myself at the same time. To do my testicles you have to hold the skin tight and shave. But I can&#x27;t hold my skin tight and use the shaver at the same time. They should have told me that I need someone else to use it.</li>
            <li> Great product , works as described</li>
            <li> I am itialian and this thing shaves through any body hair.  A recommended  buy to anyone.  Gentle enough to go down town and leave no nics or cuts.</li>
            <li> the purchase was fulfilled by 100%, everything turned out as expected and as always happens in this website, all perfect forever.</li>
            <li> Great product for the value. I use to every time I need to trim. I have not used it in the shower as a wet shave, so cannot attest to it&#x27;s performance there.</li>
            <li> This is a nice trimmer/body shaver with a few great features and one or two I didn&#x27;t care for. Personally, I use this mainly to trim my beard because I&#x27;m not into the whole manscaping thing, but if you are, I think you&#x27;ll like this device, with a few caveats.    The good:    - nice design --- it just looks good, including the charger base  - easy to use  - can be used in the shower  - comes with different extensions so you can decide how short you want to trim whatever area (ahem) you&#x27;re trimming  - good price point!    The not-so-good    - I frankly didn&#x27;t care for the attached Fusion razor. I don&#x27;t see the point. If you&#x27;re going to want to use a standard razor in addition to the trimmer, wouldn&#x27;t you have one already? And if so, wouldn&#x27;t you prefer to use the standard Fusion razor handle, rather than this much bulkier trimmer that makes using the razor a bit clumsy? I tried shaving with the attached Fusion razor and felt like I was shaving wearing gloves, because the Cruzer&#x27;s body is so much bigger. I know they included this to make it an all-in-one type thing, but I found it uncomfortable to use and unnecessary because anyone will have a regular razor already.  - In addition, the razor itself isn&#x27;t powered. I don&#x27;t use Fusion razors myself (I&#x27;m old-fashioned and still like my Sensor Excel razors!), but I understand from people who do use Fusions that the handle can vibrate, giving you a closer shave. The one that&#x27;s attached to the Cruzer doesn&#x27;t do this.     So, in a nutshell, I&#x27;d recommend this product if you&#x27;re in the market for a body shaver, but I wouldn&#x27;t expect too much from the attached Fusion razor.     (Also, on a completely separate note, if you do decide to use this in the shower, and depending on how hairy you are, make sure to pick a bottle or two of Drano at the same time, because all that hair going down your shower drain may lead to clogged drains!)</li>
            <li> This is a strange hybrid of a razor and an electric clipper that reminds me of a langoustine.  The little clipper works well and the razor works well if it is a little awkward to handle.  Trying to use them at the same is beyond awkward into difficult territory and I just don&#x27;t see the point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The disposable razor head actually has five blades and replacements cost between $2 and $4--that&#x27;s for each head, not per pack!  I think the device costs so much because it is truly waterproof.  Most of the clippers and razors that claim they can be used wet are only waterproof in the cutting area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun makes good quality, well-designed items but it seems that since Gillette took over they are emphasizing disposable parts and supplies even for things like clippers and shavers that did not previously require an ongoing supply of cleaning fluid or blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging stand is nice--most clippers have a useless wall-wart instead.  The holster is also a great idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For someone with long body hair who wants to remove all of it down to smooth skin, this device may be ideal but for someone looking to shave OR trim on a regular basis, this hybrid seems overcomplicated and awkward.  Separate clippers and a disposable razor would probably be better for most people.</li>
            <li> I have shavers that are wet/dry, but not one where they recommend you to use directly IN the shower, so I had to ask for one!  Well, what I found out was that the shaver part is with a blade, and the trimmer part is the electrically powered version.  Not like your standard Braun electric shaver, which comes with the screen technology like the [[ASIN:B0020MMCB6 Braun Series 3 370 Men&#x27;s Shaver]], which I also have.  Once I figured that out (and I like electric shavers more than bladed shavers, mostly because I&#x27;m too lazy for creams and replacing blades), I tried the powered trimmer side, to see if it met my needs.  Since I&#x27;m not going for the bald overall body look, this shaver/trimmer actually was perfect for me.  Fast, simple, easy to clean.  A nice thing to mention about the charger, it uses induction charging, so that means no exposed electrodes!  Big bonus, and that&#x27;s what allows the fully wet shaving aspect.  Overall, highly recommended for this type of use.  More so if you actually used the bladed portion!</li>
            <li> This thing works great on all areas. really impressed with how easy it is to clean too. I would recommend this to any guy looking to tidy up.</li>
            <li> The Braun Cruzer - 6 Body Cruzer and 6 Body Shaver lives up to the advertising - so why 4 stars instead of 5? - Because you may not need this level of shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros - The Bruan Shaver really is waterproof so shower use is easy and effective and it can be humg up easily by the handle.  It also has a neat plastic case.  The Cruzer shaves quickly and cleanly and removes \\&quot;tougher\\&quot; hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what are the cons/considerations?  The Braun Shaver works quickly so you need to pay attention when you are using it so you don&#x27;t trim or shave more than you intended to. The attachments take a bit of time to learn and the blades cost a couple of dollars on sale (but in fairness blades are going to cost for any shaver).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like to look smooth and have a more than average need to shave and trim and have considered a new product - this is the product for you.  If you are getting by with your razor and/or trimmer and haven&#x27;t thought about upgrading you might enjoy this even if you don&#x27;t need it but it might be more product than you actually need day to day, which isn&#x27;t always bad - just something to consider.</li>
            <li> It seems that, in some circles, body hair is no longer sexy or desirable. And for folks who run in those circles, Braun offers its Braun Cruzer 6 Body Cruzer, 6 Body Shaver.  The shaver itself is lightweight and easy to use. It comes with a carry case, several combs and, of course, a charger.  It doesn&#x27;t appear as sturdy as some of the other Braun shavers that I have used, such as [[ASIN:B003YJAZZE Braun Series 7-760cc Pulsonic Shaver System, Black and Silver]]. But only time will tell how well it holds up.  It does the job and does it reasonably well. I only wish that I could use it to remove some of those stubborn white stubble hairs that the 760cc leaves behind. However, Braun is clear in its warning that this shaver not be used on the face, so I have avoiding using it there.  If you like that clean shaven look from head to toe, then the Braun Cruzer 6 Body Cruzer, 6 Body Shaver will get you there looking clean and hairless.</li>
            <li> Was excited to get a rechargeable battery operated body shaver that could be used in the shower.  I considered several models but decided on this one from Braun.  It&#x27;s not that great but it does the job.  The head is small which is good for some areas of your body but slow larger areas such as the chest and abdomen.  The attached Gillette Fusion razor dominates the device.  It also defeats the purpose of the product.  Why not just use the razor and get a better result instead of doing what is recommended in the instructions of using the Braun shaver first then use the razor for increased closeness.  I guess if you are really hairy that would be good advice.  I&#x27;m sure others out there on the market are better than this once.</li>
            <li> My husband had been wanting one of these for a very long time. He had done a lot of research and landed on this one. He really likes it and would buy it again if anything were to happen to it. 5 stars all the way (and he&#x27;s pretty picky about his products).</li>
            <li> If you like to keep tidy between haircuts, this is great for trimming hair off your neck, and conveniently keeping everything trimmed and neat.</li>
            <li> Great shaver for the coin purse in the shower. You can use it wet or dry, so no hair all over the bathroom.</li>
            <li> In the end, the trimmer simply doesn&#x27;t do as good of a job on thick hair has my [[ASIN:B001GQ3GEY Wahl Lithium Ion All In One Trimmer]]. When it comes to the razor side of things, using it is akward and far less nimble than just using a seperate razer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get the Wahl and use a dedicated Mach 3.</li>
            <li> Worked just like I wanted it too. I use to shave my chest and stomach with a normal shaver and this little guy makes it faster smoother and easier. Defiantly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This shaver is ok. Not super awesome, but it gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic on it feels a little cheap, but the build feels solid. I don&#x27;t understand the razor attached. It has six settings, but I would only use it fully closed or fully open with the trimmer. Not sure about the other 4 settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a little awkward trying to shave with the trimmer and the razor. You have to hold it at a certain angle for the trimmer to trim correctly but also make sure the razor is hitting your skin right. It uses gillette style blades, so mix and match at you please.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer clip-ons work great. I like this because you can use it in the shower or on dry land. More difficult to do longer hair in the shower. Would recommend starting dry and only doing fine trimming in the water. The hair just doesn&#x27;t trim right or go through the comb well while wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An ok product, but if you want a nice one, I&#x27;d shop around a bit more.</li>
            <li> I thought it would save your face like electric. Saver but you have to buy the blades like a disposable but it good and water proof</li>
            <li> This thing is GREAT! I&#x27;ve tried a few different trimmers and this is by far the best! No hair pulling!</li>
            <li> This shaver has already lasted longer than previous trimmers so that is a plus. The different size attachments are good for different hair lengths, good for chest and underarms. It does a good job with the privates which can be difficult to access and get a good close shave.</li>
            <li> Already have a better shaver than this, It is same brand, The razor on this 1 is just in the way.</li>
            <li> this is a great product, make shaving easy and stress free. one pass and hair is gone, smooth finish. thumbs up</li>
            <li> Trimmer works great, removing the dreaded \\&quot;back of neck hair\\&quot;.  Razor works well.  I have not used it in \\&quot;dual mode\\&quot; yet. I think it is a really good product.</li>
            <li> If you are a man reading this and are with a significant other, chances are the amount of body hair you possess is probably always an issue. You&#x27;ve tried shaving, trimming, or, gasp, waxing, but still leave unsatisfied. Look no further, as this body shaver should be the answer to your problems. Let&#x27;s get the negatives out of the way: yes, if you have too much hair and plow into it like a sharecropper, something will catch in the blade and you&#x27;ll get nicked. Fact of life. But if you keep up with the maintenance (I go about every other week just so the hairs don&#x27;t get too long on my underarms and chest, and pelvic area) and use gentle strokes, you should be fine. My prior Bodygroom died after too much water exposure (I actually bought two previously), and I wanted something that would hold up. The Braun model seems to be doing the trick so far. I feel the finish isn&#x27;t as close as the Bodygroomer, but the fact that the battery seems to last forever and that it holds up in the shower makes up for its shortcomings. I don&#x27;t really use the razor attached, only the buzzer, but I suppose that can get the tricky hairs you couldn&#x27;t take off with just the clipper. Kind of pricey, but worth the investment (your significant other will thank you later). The carrying case/holster is a nice touch, I keep it rested on a ledge in my shower.</li>
            <li> It works very well and is extremely easy to use and clean. I like that it incorporates both an electric shaver and a razor into one sall unit.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer and somewhat disturbed by other reviews.  As with all trimmers, patience is a virtue - If you don&#x27;t take the time you&#x27;re not going to get the desired results.  Yes the guards are a little flimsy but you know what all ready so take the time and slow down, clean off hair clogging them from time to time as well.  You can trim the same spot a million ways to Sunday but if your doing it a lightening spend you will end of with poor results.  This is not for this you require instant gratification.  Love em, would by again in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> so unusual for me, i read the manual..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s not for facial hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;maybe i can give it to rufus for xmas</li>
            <li> ^^That&#x27;s what she said.^^&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for manscaping. Don&#x27;t see any other reason to buy it but that. Do her a favor and manscape.</li>
            <li> Great device. I own both the Braun cruzer and the Philips bodygroom pro. The only thing I find better with the Philips device is its adjustable comb. Other then that the Braun unit has pretty much replaced all other units for my shaving and grooming needs. Definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very cool product and easy to use. Recommendable for the modern man who wants to be grommed for himself and cares about his image.</li>
            <li> I really like this device, does just fine for what it was made, greetings</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had about 5 different body trimmers over the years and this is easily the best.</li>
            <li> The Body Cruzer comes with 3 different hair length guards, a charger dock, 3 Gillette Fusion razor blades, and a drawstring nylon bag to hold the product&#x27;s components.  Some pros about the device:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The device can be used in the shower, which keeps hair off your sink and bathroom floor.  This reduces clean-up time.&lt;br /&gt;2) Braun has equipped the razor with a shower caddy enabling the user to quickly hang the product, which can be very convenient if the shower being used has little or no shelf space.&lt;br /&gt;3)The product has an ergonomic design, which assists with product maneuverability.&lt;br /&gt;4)The electric trimmer cuts hairs fairly closely and without too many passes.&lt;br /&gt;5)The product uses Gillette Fusion brand cartridges, which provide a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;6)The product has good battery life and charging is a breeze with the charging dock.  The dock consumes a very small amount of space on a bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) The slide out razor blade seems a little flimsy and it is easy to engage or retract the blade when the user does not mean to do so.&lt;br /&gt;2) As noted, the product uses Gillette Fusion blades.  While easy to find, that brand of razor cartridge is not necessarily cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it gets the job done, but I have some concerns about build quality (especially with the slide out razor mechanism).  It&#x27;s nice that it can be used in the shower and uses easy-to-find razor cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is made in China.</li>
            <li> Only used once for my husband&#x27;s back and WOW sooo very easy to use, piece of cake. Would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> Simply put, 1mm blades. This thing cuts close but won&#x27;t hurt you. It is powerful and waterproof. Just shave in the shower, rinse out and its clean and ready to be placed back in its charging stand. It is simple - just a few attachments to cut your hair different lengths, not 14 attachments like some other trimmers. You want stubble - it gives you stubble, real stubble, not the 3mm stuff other trimmers call &amp;#34;stubble.&amp;#34; You want a longer &amp;#34;Winter&amp;#34; beard - it does that too. Great for &amp;#34;nether region&amp;#34; grooming as well - my wife loves this thing and she has fairly course hair. I&#x27;ve had mine for two years and it stayed sharp and won&#x27;t tug hairs despite my wife and I sharing it and using weekly. Only after two years did we feel the need to replace it as it seems to be getting weaker. I&#x27;m 44 years old and tried alot of body trimmers and beard trimmers over the years - this is the one I settled on and the one I keep coming back to.</li>
            <li> Superb German quality, light, washable, good looking, small charging dock. I&#x27;ve had this trimmer/shaver for almost a year and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. The battery lasts &amp;#34;weeks&amp;#34; (*I don&#x27;t use it on a daily basis but have travelled for a whole week and have not need to recharge it). Perfect travel tool, you got trimmer and razor all in one... it isn&#x27;t as comfortable to use as a regular razor, but hey.. just the fact that I don&#x27;t have to pack both is good enough for me. I would highly recommend this (and any other Braun product) to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have owned this trimmer now for over 3 years and I have nothing but praise for it. I have tried all sort of body trimmer and this one beats them all. Especially if you are looking for a trimmer for sensitive areas, nothing beats this trimmer. I highly recommend it. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was searching in the description and was trying to look for electrical specification and there was none. Because im in asia and have different voltage supply of 220V, and was hoping that the product is autovolt. I bought it anyway with high hopes. Sad to say when i open it and read the manual, it is only upto 120V. So i have to use a transformer. But the product seems fine since you can use it wet or dry. Im not using the shaver because its easier to use a separate one.</li>
            <li> Convenient, easy to use and great battery life when fully recharged.</li>
            <li> got this shaver hair trimmer for a good price. Once I got used to the trimmer it works great. It comes with 2 fusion blades.That being said the shave with the fusion is ok, but nothing special. Plus the replacement fusion blades are costly. If nothing else the trimmer is worth the price</li>
            <li> the cruzer 6 from braun is very good in performance and is comfortable to use.the shaver is very reliable .once recharged it lasts very well and is waterproof .</li>
            <li> trimmer doesn&#x27;t cut sharp and well.</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding shaver/trimmer that couples with the Gillette fusion blades.  It is quiet, especially compared to traditional trimmers and can be used inside the shower which is a definite plus for getting a close shave and reducing mess/cleanup at the bathroom sink. Highly recommended! A+</li>
            <li> My car was stolen and my boyfriend was able to use at all ..</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my boyfriend. He likes it</li>
            <li> I like to use this device to shave and trim my mustache. Because of its size it can be difficult to get the right angle. But with practice I have been able to successfully use this shaver to trim my sideburns, trim my mustache and goatee.</li>
            <li> This razor worked great at first, but after a few months it got weaker and weaker and just died.  It looks pretty but is not built to last.  Now I&#x27;m half shaved and have to go buy another trimmer.</li>
            <li> Works better than my old one!</li>
            <li> It is a must have razor for any man who wants to be well kept and groomed. You will love this razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this book from my Man-Cave. It&#x27;s the other half of our two-car garage (we only have one car). I said to my wife, \\&quot;What do you think we should do with the other half of the garage? I was thinking about turning it into a Man-Cave.\\&quot; \\&quot;No way,\\&quot; she replied. \\&quot;Oh, then I&#x27;ll have to go to plan B,\\&quot; I said. \\&quot;Plan B?\\&quot; she asked. \\&quot;Yeah,\\&quot; I said, \\&quot;I&#x27;ll have to choose between a rap disco or a meth lab.\\&quot; \\&quot;You can have your Man-Cave,\\&quot; she growled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here I am, but to be honest I&#x27;m not sure what I can do here. My neighbor says that I should have a pool table and a big-screen TV. I don&#x27;t like pool or TV. The only thing I can do is admire my Braun Cruzer 6 Body Cruzer, so named because it comes with a Gillette five-element blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have already reviewed the Schick Hydro here and decided then to use that in place of my Gillette Fusion. When I first bought a Gillette I chose the powered version, and I thought it was better than the manual razor and only a few dollars more. Eventually that was lost and I ended up with a manual Gillette, which wasn&#x27;t the equal of the Schick. Now I&#x27;m back to powered shaving and although I still prefer the manual Schick, the Braun is pretty close to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The drop-in battery charger on the Braun works wonderfully, though the Gillette idea of a 1.5 volt battery in the handle is just as good until you need to replace it. The Braun is waterproof, so you can take it in the shower, but I use it in my bedroom and have the re-assurance that if drops into the water it won&#x27;t break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the longer-hair trimming, I haven&#x27;t tried that, but it looks like it removes longer body hair fairly easily. I thought of trimming love-messages into my chest hair, but of course if I&#x27;m rejected I&#x27;d have to wait at least a couple of months to try again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I reckon that the Braun is worthwhile if you want to keep your body hair trimmed, or even your head of hair shaved (incidentally, I had a friend who was bald but had a luxuriant beard - some kid came up to him and said, \\&quot;Hey Mister! Your hair&#x27;s on upside down!\\&quot;). But if just want to shave I would stick with the under-twenty dollar methods, like the Fusion or Hydro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I&#x27;m going back inside. Man-caves are all very well if you can keep the bugs out and be warm in the winter, but I&#x27;ll just have to make do with my house.to him and said, \\&quot;Hey Mister!

            <li> If you&#x27;re used to being disappointed by the latest 5-blade razors and electronic shavers that claim to leave you hairless with no effort, it might be worth taking a look at the Cruzer. I&#x27;ve personally found the only smooth shave comes from a professional barber so I was happy to see this is one step above everything other razor I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s very effective at removing hair although that may be due to soaking in the shower first. The biggest downside is the cost of the unit and the replacement hardware so minus a star.</li>
            <li> Not a consistent shave. I would not recommend this product at all. I would much rather use a corded shaver. The only plus is that you can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> great shaver!  I love that you can soften the hair with ths trimmer and than shave it all out with the blade, this I sa brilliant product, guys you should seriously give it a shot!</li>
            <li> Bought this along with Philips Norelco BG2040/34 BodyGroom Pro. After several uses by each, I personally like the BodyGroom Pro better. I think the Cruzer 6 looks good, but the blade doesn&#x27;t seem to work as good as foil shaver. This is especially true in sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t add to all the other reviews which are pretty accurate.  i&#x27;m very satisfied with the device except for the expense of the Fusion blades.  They are downright outrageous and NEVER on sale.  haha.  I lucked out and found zilostore dot com who sells &amp;#34;compatible&amp;#34; blades that are of the EXACT SAME QUALITY as the Gillette original.  In quantity I think you can get the blades for about a buck a piece making this a very affordable alternative.  Zilostore made this a very viable product for me.</li>
            <li> The Braun Cruzer 6 works amazingly.  I use it in the shower and it keeps its charge for several days.  The combined electric and blade razor make the job much quicker.</li>
            <li> Garbage....  seriously dont waste your money... pulls my hair instead of cutting it...  my hair isnt even thick either,,,, i say dont buy it..</li>
            <li> This trimmer is very week and does not trim the hair properly...I don&#x27;t know where are all the 5 star review coming from for this but I have been trying to use this for 4 months now and it has been extremely annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look for something else!!!</li>
            <li> Removes back hair leaving a nice smooth shaved look. Definite buy if you are hairy. Nice product for the price</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this shaver. I have thick hair and my hair grows very fast. I used regular clippers to shave my body prior to purchasing this shaver and I would always have scratches from the clippers. I do not have that issue with this shaver. It shaves me close and it works great in the shower. I also recommend that you use the shaving cream with the shaver. This is an excellent tool to body shave with.</li>
            <li> it works, but the blades are not something I will try</li>
            <li> This one is really good but a little bit small.</li>
            <li> Super sharp and very nice against the skin. Wont cause any irritation. Battery life is solid. Build is super.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an essential that every man should have and it looks very good too. I would recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a personal groomer for the sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> This product works great.  It does not pull on longer hair, and leaves a clean shave.  It doesn&#x27;t cut, and is gentle.</li>
            <li> I bought this strictly for trimming and have no use for the shaver.  Coming from someone who had the Bodygr00m, this thing is way better in every single aspect possible.  The battery is better, the trimmer is better (doesn&#x27;t tug and needs less passes), the clips are better designed, comes with an extra set of shaving blades, device itself is very well engineered, manual is great, and it comes with a carrying case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Added 12/04/2016 This thing works great even after 2 years of continued usage. I never changed / sharpened blades but still works like a new blade. I have been using this product almost every week. For the money I paid, it is a good buy. I changed my rating and review because, even after 2 years it works well without any issues. So it is only fair that I edit my review and bump up the rating to do justice to the product.  ORIGINAL REVIEW I had spent lot of time reading reviews on this item and researching similar items online before buying this one. Received in time neatly packed with lot of protection. Since there are already several reviews here I am listing out only the pros and flaws.  What is good about it ?  1. Well made. A quality product appearance with solid feel. 2. Has a safety razor built in which pops up when required 3. Rechargeable battery with a decent back up 4. EM recharging system which means no jacks or pins , just drop the unit on to base that is connected to the wall outlet. 5. Operation is quite compared to the previous unit I had 6. Has a shower sleeve / stand  to use it in the shower. It is safe to use in shower.  What was not impressive  1. Even on sensitive setting it missed lot of hairs, so you better expect to spend more time running it couple of times on the same spot. 2. Be extremely cautious on loose skin especially on sensitive setting or expect to have some nicks. 3. If you are planning to use the trimmer and blade on one stroke, It takes little of practice to do it ; However it is not perfect but does the job if you are in a hurry. 4. Cleaning is not easy unless you use a compressed air duster.  Overall, It is not a bad product but not something that gives you the feeling of &amp;#34;well groomed&amp;#34; . It is good in your travel kit for quick and convenient use but would not be the best alternative for a regular use. At this price range the cost to Value ratio is not very good. Probably at around $25 to $30 it is well worth the money.would I recommend this product ?  Limited to the travel kit.</li>
            <li> Quality not up to standards.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something like this product for a while now so far so good. It is a great investment.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I must not have read the description close enough. That&#x27;s my fault. But the photo is a little misleading as it doesn&#x27;t show both sides. I wasn&#x27;t expecting the razor that is attached...just the trimmer. Both work very well, but not sure i like them together. The razor is placed a little awkwardly and the replacement blades are expensive. Fits well in the charger and doesn&#x27;t take up much space on the counter as long as you have space to begin with. We have electric toothbrushes and a smaller countertop so it can get crowded. I like it, but don&#x27;t LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Hello&lt;br /&gt; Item you receive a warranty card, but its not there&lt;br /&gt; And the package was open .. And this thing I did not expect you to</li>
            <li> The Body Cruzer works fine! Better than expected!&lt;br /&gt;The exchangeable heads work great for different body parts:&lt;br /&gt;- Sensitive for \\&quot;down there\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;- Short for under arms&lt;br /&gt;- Long for chest (I am very hairy) to keep hair presence, but shorter and less dense&lt;br /&gt;- The incorporated Gillette blade is very usefull for complete hair removal, using the Cruzer without any of the adjustable blades&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this piece!</li>
            <li> Works well, have not tried the shaving aspect, just the trim and have been happy with the results.</li>
            <li> How many other body shavers are capable of giving you a close shave for your face? I used to have the Philips Body groomer, and although it got my grooming needs done it always managed to irritate my skin. I imagined the Braun Cruzer 6 would irritate my skin just as bad, if not worse, but I was wrong; totally comfortable. The only things I don&#x27;t like is its slow charge, and it only holds that charge for 50 min. It admittedly, gets the job done quicker though. The Braun Cruzer 6 definitely exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this product as an &amp;#34;All Purpose&amp;#34; Body Shaver. I was really pleased with it and I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Srsly... it&#x27;s true. But that&#x27;s what I bought it for. Smooth, easy to use and the best part? No cuts!</li>
            <li> it clean me up real good. i love it thank!!! i think your lady will love you more!try it you see.</li>
            <li> I DIDN&#x27;T EVEN OPEN PACKAGE BECAUSE MY SON DIDN&#x27;T WANT THIS ONE HE WANTED ONE WITH AN EXTENSION POLE</li>
            <li> i received it on time. it im pressed me on how good it was. ive never shaven before so i was a little heistant to buy it, but everything yurnt out fine. its got an okay charge time, and no snagging or ripping of the hair.</li>
            <li> Very good use it twice I believe it going to be great.</li>
            <li> The best for sure, value for money, come with different trimmers for different uses, with nice kit and practical to use guide. highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the job. Do not ask for 20 or more words, please.&lt;br /&gt;What is it with the pre-occupation with length ?</li>
            <li> I found the Braun Cruzer 6 to be quite adaptive to all areas with ease. It is safe, comfortable, and effective. It easily exceeded my expectations, and I am not generally a \\&quot;gadget\\&quot; guy.</li>
            <li> Yes!!! it is the best body razor to buy and affordable too.</li>
            <li> Pretty nice little tool for manscaping. Just make sure to stretch the skin your shaving or it&#x27;ll cut you and it doesn&#x27;t feel to good...</li>
            <li> I am shaved smooth and it is awesome.  This shaver has a great battery and charging it is amazing it uses some weird touch charger so all I have to do is place the razor in the charger and it starts.  I took off the razor blade and just use it to manscape.</li>
            <li> i would buy it again, worth every dollar, this is what you need for body shaving. Charging is very fast too.</li>
            <li> No cuts and clean save in sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> I have used it for couple times .I like the product.Its best for grooming&lt;br /&gt;I can suggest this for others also.</li>
            <li> Comes with three different combs, its waterproof, and it works well. Keeps your jungle in check... haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it holds a charge well. Would buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS don&#x27;t leave the razor attached, that&#x27;s just asking for a mistake to happen</li>
            <li> Love, love, LOVE this thing! It&#x27;s everything you need for any potential trimming or shaving. I really like the 3 sizes of guards, and the 3 options of trimming, trimming and shaving, or just shaving. It works very smoothly and I am really glad I splurged on it!</li>
            <li> It is the best body shaver I have ever had. battery lasts long. Has a smooth glide and cuts nice. I would suggest it to anyone who shaves their body.</li>
            <li> This groomer is really amazing! The shaver is easy to use and smooth, and the Gillette fusion razor is very sharp. It does what it says for real. Gonna recommended this. Love you Braun!!</li>
            <li> This thing unfortunately does not complete it&#x27;s duty, it&#x27;s gets stuck and jammed, I just u buy a normal shaver to shave that hair.</li>
            <li> Great product!  No nicks in sensitive areas....that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li> This product is safe to use on your body in or out of the shower. It holds a charge well, and it get the job done with little effort. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> amazingly good clean shaving product for back of man&#x27;s neck&lt;br /&gt;amazingly good clean shaving product for back of man&#x27;s neck&lt;br /&gt;amazingly good clean shaving product for back of man&#x27;s neck</li>
            <li> The concept of this product is pretty interesting. Aside from shaving body hair, I was hoping to use this to as a trimmer/clean shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem was that it was painful to use! The blades didn&#x27;t seem sharp enough to cut my hair without some painful \\&quot;tugging\\&quot; on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how much information I really should share here...so...I&#x27;ll just say...works great - you won&#x27;t get bitten! Holds a charge well and is very ergonomic.</li>
            <li> I Like the shaving results, not used to using a razor for body hair,  however you get used to it and lasts as long as other brands I have tried. I don&#x27;t regret the purchase at all.</li>
            <li> The blades are just a lil&#x27; bit too close to the trimmer. Except that it&#x27;s all good</li>
            <li> Be sure to use the guards other wise it pulls hair... ouch, the blade shaver is worthless and I cant imagine why they even designed it this way</li>
