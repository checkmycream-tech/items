            <li>love it so buying this mascara more often !!!</li>
            <li>I can find nothing good to say about it at all.  </li>
            <li>Good product - goes on well and stays.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Even my peers notice and comment on how good my lashes look.</li>
            <li>This may be better than most but the lower lashes just cannot seem perfect.</li>
            <li>Love the brush/applicator!  </li>
            <li>and oh my god, I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>great mascara, quick shipping, fair price</li>
            <li>Buy it at your own risk....</li>
            <li>i HAVE To be honest.</li>
            <li>Very easy interaction</li>
            <li>what I like the most about this mascara is my lashes felt amazing - no clumps,</li>
            <li>Applies easily, stays on &amp; is waterproof!</li>
            <li>By very lightly rubbing, I can take it off with a makeup remover towelette.</li>
            <li>True, i was in a hurry, but how much time should it take to figure out how to best use a mascara wand?  </li>
            <li>I love the look but the container keeps coming apart.  </li>
            <li>I have no idea why there are so many raves about this product.  </li>
            <li>, it seems to work better.</li>
            <li>It took awhile to find a mascara that I enjoyed with out</li>
            <li>It takes a lot more time to get the lashes covered.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>no drying out, no  mascara on top of my lids or under my eyes &amp;#60;you</li>
            <li>It does not clump and it dries fast which is great.</li>
            <li>More time than I have.  </li>
            <li>Before Voluminous Butterfly, I had tried many different mascaras mostly under the brand Maybelline &amp; Loreal, because I find that these brands make the best quality makeup.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>I love the wand to it.</li>
            <li>OK PRODUCT BUT</li>
            <li>It worked ok but not as lengthening as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>love it and still doesn&#x27;t have that drying up feeling.</li>
            <li>As if you couldnt already tell from my ranting on and on, i love it.</li>
            <li>The brush is a very unique design, and i think thats what i like about it most.</li>
            <li>w/out flaking so,if you really are ready for a change for the better go for this one!!!!!</li>
            <li>Still, most will love the beautiful upper lashes when using this product.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like it at first, but now that I&#x27;ve used it many times, I am applying it better and it feels easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had to work with this mascara because of the shape of the brush and it works just fine.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly and your eye lashes end up looking like spider legs.</li>
            <li>Intenza is far superior to this Butterfly disaster.  </li>
            <li>so far so good...</li>
            <li>This is definitely my new favorite!</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>I did like that the wand acted as a little lash comb, yet, incredibly</li>
            <li>Clumpy mascara- brush is hard to use, even for me who is very experienced with makeup.</li>
            <li>The only good thing I can say is that it is truly waterproof and it did keep my lashes curled.  </li>
            <li>The unique brush gets in between every lash perfectly and distributes enough product to coat every lash, even those tiny lashes on the bottom.</li>
            <li>Super smudgy and clomping.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought this stuff at Ulta because I was able to return it and get my money back!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s humid where I live and this product stays put pretty nicely.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a great mascara that doesn&#x27;t clump or make my eyes look like 2 black holes on my face.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and very buildable.</li>
            <li>Good mascara, I got a lot of compliments on how it accentuated my long eyelashes but after a week the mascara inside got very clumpy and I had to throw it away.</li>
            <li>and plus it&#x27;s long lasting  and looks bold n sexy with it on !!</li>
            <li>I really like this mascara!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a cosmetic junkie, so I rarely use up a whole tube of anything, let alone repurchase a product.</li>
            <li>I always wear waterproof makeup if possible, mostly because of my contacts.</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying that I love the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Voluminous Mascara so much that I actually had to quit because it just encourages my OCD</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stand it, but I love my long lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>(I touch my lashes so much that I think it hurts them.</li>
            <li>However, for 8$ or so, you really must try.</li>
            <li>Very fine..does not plump or lengthen lashes..</li>
            <li>I do really like this mascara, however.</li>
            <li>I have used quite a few mascaras in my days and this is one of the rare times when I am totally satisfied with a product.</li>
            <li>It lasts all day long for me and comes off with makeup remover wipes or oil fairly easily.  </li>
            <li>This is a cheap brush and it&#x27;s very clumpy and wet.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more in the future</li>
            <li>This is really great mascara-at least for upper lashes.</li>
            <li>I have never quite fell in love with any other mascara other than the original Voluminous.</li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s only kind of waterproof, I still gave the product 5 stars because the good out-weighs the bad....</li>
            <li>These really are better than the usual.</li>
            <li>Makes my lashes long and full.  </li>
            <li>I gave it two stars, because I discovered that if I use regular cheaper mascara first then use this to pull the length out</li>
            <li>I had no trouble getting ALL of my lashes coated!</li>
            <li>I really like the Loreal Intenza mascara wand, which really does build volume and length and covers all my lashes with a single swipe of the wand.  </li>
            <li>Only one side of the brush is useable and I kept having to dip the wand back into the tube to pick up more because I couldn&#x27;t even get one coat on my lashes with a single swipe.  </li>
            <li>Happily surprised with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I have tried sooo many different mascaras, cheap and expensive brands.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased a mascara for which I paid $20 for and received five star reviews from Amazon, that did absolutely nothing to lengthen OR thicken my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>As a 17 year old, i do not like to wear a lot of eye makeup as i feel it closes in my eyes.</li>
            <li>I will likely buy the Intenza waterproof formula because the wand is better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried lately.  </li>
            <li>so much so that I have to use a prescription eyelash cleaner every single day - and this mascara did not irritate my eyes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried expensive waterproof mascaras but most rub off..but not this one!  </li>
            <li>but always came back to old trusty with the teddy bear brush.</li>
            <li>Mascara is the only thing i wear on my eyes, and i would ALMOST go so far as to say this gives my eyes an almost eyeliner look.</li>
            <li>I like the brush pretty well and only have minimal issues with clumping.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I like the brush pretty well and only have minimal issues with clumping.</li>
            <li> and I usually end up holding the applicator straight up to my lashes, where I always poke my eye.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My other mascara leaves my lashes sort of dry feeling, but not this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;II have extremely sensitive eyes,</li>
            <li> I have extremely long eyelashes, so long in fact that when I wear glasses &amp;#60;RX or Sun&amp;#62; - my lashes constantly touch the lens whenever I blink.</li>
            <li> It truly lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it for a long time....</li>
            <li> I have been useing the same loreal voluminous mascara fo 22+years and have tried all sorts of other ones here and there</li>
            <li> No &amp;#34;Spidey&amp;#34; lashes, just very long and thick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (It makes your lashes so long!!)</li>
            <li> Lasts very long!</li>
            <li> so be aware that waterproof is serious with this mascara!</li>
            <li> I can turn it slightly and have the next part of the wand covered in product, no need to dip the wand again.  </li>
            <li> I only used it a few times before throwing it out.</li>
            <li> Beats out Mac and other highend brands.</li>
            <li> However, it dried really quickly which meant that a second coat was impossible (</li>
            <li> My lashes were coated evenly, which hasn&#x27;t been the norm, and my outside lashes were SO LONG I almost looked like I had false lashes on.</li>
            <li> I am a redhead with green eyes, so my makeup is minimal.</li>
            <li> Some of the bristles are so little that i use one side specifically for my bottom lashes if i feel like going out on a limb.</li>
            <li> My outside lashes are so and it&#x27;s sometimes very hard to get mascara on all of them</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really awkward to use and certainly doesn&#x27;t build any volume at all.  </li>
            <li> My eyelashes are short and thin.  </li>
            <li> that shedding some mascara leave once it&#x27;s on your eyes a few hours&amp;#62;.</li>
            <li> I did have a little flaking late in the day sometimes.</li>
            <li> My only issue is that it&#x27;s not entirely &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; :(</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> for me at least.</li>
            <li> Too thick.</li>
            <li> I am tired of the flakeing and the said no flaking or clumping, so I tried it even though it was a plastic brush</li>
            <li> Terrible mascara, clumpy going on and starts to flakes off only a couple of hours after application.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Like it, especially the applicator.</li>
            <li> Great product. I recommend this to all.</li>
            <li> Clumpy mascara- brush is hard to use, even for me who is very experienced with makeup. I only used it a few times before throwing it out.</li>
            <li> Product and shipping as stated. Very easy interaction</li>
            <li> I love the look but the container keeps coming apart.  When I pull the wand out an insert in the tube comes out as well.  I have to use the wand to shove it back in.  Otherwise the wand is just coated with globbed up mascara.</li>
            <li> Super smudgy and clomping.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are short and thin.  This mascara makes it look like they are fuller and longer.</li>
            <li> Terrible mascara, clumpy going on and starts to flakes off only a couple of hours after application.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and excellent seller</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara! It truly lasts all day long. I like the brush pretty well and only have minimal issues with clumping. You do have to use a makeup remover of some sort at night (I use coconut oil) so be aware that waterproof is serious with this mascara!</li>
            <li> This has got to be the WORST mascara wand ever invented!  It&#x27;s absolutely awful!  I can find nothing good to say about it at all.  It&#x27;s really awkward to use and certainly doesn&#x27;t build any volume at all.  Only one side of the brush is useable and I kept having to dip the wand back into the tube to pick up more because I couldn&#x27;t even get one coat on my lashes with a single swipe.  I have no idea why there are so many raves about this product.  It totally baffles me.  I really like the Loreal Intenza mascara wand, which really does build volume and length and covers all my lashes with a single swipe of the wand.  I can turn it slightly and have the next part of the wand covered in product, no need to dip the wand again.  Intenza is far superior to this Butterfly disaster.  The only good thing I can say is that it is truly waterproof and it did keep my lashes curled.  However, it dried really quickly which meant that a second coat was impossible (or else risk clumpy, spidery lashes that is).  I&#x27;m glad I bought this stuff at Ulta because I was able to return it and get my money back!  I&#x27;m still searching for my HG mascara.  I will likely buy the Intenza waterproof formula because the wand is better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried lately.  But it&#x27;s ridiculous how bad this Butterfly mascara is....truly terrible! Buy it at your own risk....you&#x27;ve been warned!</li>
            <li> Best product since they took marathon mascara away!!  Love the brush/applicator!  Lasts very long!</li>
            <li> I did not like this at all, clumps very badly.  I gave it two stars, because I discovered that if I use regular cheaper mascara first then use this to pull the length out, it seems to work better.</li>
            <li> Good product - goes on well and stays. No irritation for me.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have used quite a few mascaras in my days and this is one of the rare times when I am totally satisfied with a product.</li>
            <li> It took awhile to find a mascara that I enjoyed with out it causing my eye lashes to look all weird. Thanks</li>
            <li> Happily surprised with this purchase. The shape of the wand does require a bit of a learning curve when applying. I didn&#x27;t like it at first, but now that I&#x27;ve used it many times, I am applying it better and it feels easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not the mascara of my dreams, but it&#x27;s a good mascara for me to use while I&#x27;m waiting to discover that perfect one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lashes do look longer/fuller with the help of this L&#x27;Oreal Paris Voluminous Butterfly Waterproof Mascara. I like it and think i will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the application brush at all, it&#x27;s a weird shape and it does nothing for my lashes. But it is definitely water proof!</li>
            <li> This is my go to. I have tried LOTS of mascaras &amp; I absolutely Love this one!! Applies easily, stays on &amp; is waterproof!</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I love the L&#x27;Oreal Paris Voluminous Mascara so much that I actually had to quit because it just encourages my OCD (I touch my lashes so much that I think it hurts them. (It makes your lashes so long!!) But, this waterproof version does not work as well.  It takes a lot more time to get the lashes covered.</li>
            <li> If you liked the non waterproof version of this stuff... and require a waterproof variety, this is your the mascara for you!</li>
            <li> I have extremely long eyelashes, so long in fact that when I wear glasses &amp;#60;RX or Sun&amp;#62; - my lashes constantly touch the lens whenever I blink. I can&#x27;t stand it, but I love my long lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the same mascara for years and years and I love it. I saw this mascara and wanted to give it a try since the brush is so different. My outside lashes are so and it&#x27;s sometimes very hard to get mascara on all of them and I usually end up holding the applicator straight up to my lashes, where I always poke my eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush applicator in this mascara is AWESOME! I had no trouble getting ALL of my lashes coated! My lashes looked so great even my husband noticed! My lashes were coated evenly, which hasn&#x27;t been the norm, and my outside lashes were SO LONG I almost looked like I had false lashes on. No &amp;#34;Spidey&amp;#34; lashes, just very long and thick!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what I like the most about this mascara is my lashes felt amazing - no clumps, no drying out, no  mascara on top of my lids or under my eyes &amp;#60;you know - that shedding some mascara leave once it&#x27;s on your eyes a few hours&amp;#62;. My other mascara leaves my lashes sort of dry feeling, but not this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;II have extremely sensitive eyes, so much so that I have to use a prescription eyelash cleaner every single day - and this mascara did not irritate my eyes whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am SO happy I decided to try this! I will definitely be buying more in the future as it is now has a permanent place in my makeup regime.</li>
            <li> I have tried sooo many different mascaras, cheap and expensive brands. I have never quite fell in love with any other mascara other than the original Voluminous. This is definitely my new favorite! The unique brush gets in between every lash perfectly and distributes enough product to coat every lash, even those tiny lashes on the bottom. It does not clump and it dries fast which is great. I have oily eyelids and the majority of mascara brands will transfer at the end of the day onto my eyelids where my lashes touch below my eyebrows. This product does not! My only issue is that it&#x27;s not entirely &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; :( By very lightly rubbing, I can take it off with a makeup remover towelette. It&#x27;s humid where I live and this product stays put pretty nicely. Even though it&#x27;s only kind of waterproof, I still gave the product 5 stars because the good out-weighs the bad.... for me at least.</li>
            <li> Received as planned. Good product.</li>
            <li> Goes on great, just wish that Loreal would include the lash conditioner as before!</li>
            <li> This is really great mascara-at least for upper lashes. I have very thin lower lashes so almost any mascara tends to smear a bit. This may be better than most but the lower lashes just cannot seem perfect. Still, most will love the beautiful upper lashes when using this product.</li>
            <li> Too globby and smears.  Also goes on in clumps and flakes on lashes and eyes.&lt;br /&gt;As everyone is different, maybe others would like it.&lt;br /&gt;I do NOT!</li>
            <li> True, i was in a hurry, but how much time should it take to figure out how to best use a mascara wand?  More time than I have.  I did like that the wand acted as a little lash comb, yet, incredibly, I was left with a couple of clumps.  Yeah - there&#x27;s not enough time.</li>
            <li> I bought this mascara at Walmart. It is the ONLY mascara to lengthen my eyelashes. Before Voluminous Butterfly, I had tried many different mascaras mostly under the brand Maybelline &amp; Loreal, because I find that these brands make the best quality makeup. Period. Even brand name mascaras do not compare to this mascara. I recently purchased a mascara for which I paid $20 for and received five star reviews from Amazon, that did absolutely nothing to lengthen OR thicken my eyelashes.I&#x27;m a cosmetic junkie, so I rarely use up a whole tube of anything, let alone repurchase a product. But this stuff is awesome. Even my peers notice and comment on how good my lashes look. People always ask me what mascara I use. I can&#x27;t say enough about this mascara. I do know that different products work for different people, and individual needs vary. However, for 8$ or so, you really must try.</li>
            <li> The brush on the end of the wand takes a bit getting used to. It&#x27;s very different and doesn&#x27;t necessarily produce the results I desire on my lashes.</li>
            <li> Goes on and keeps my lashes separated without clumping.  It lasts all day long for me and comes off with makeup remover wipes or oil fairly easily.  I did have a little flaking late in the day sometimes.</li>
            <li> Fav mascara. Beats out Mac and other highend brands. Best price is off Amazon</li>
            <li> I have been useing the same loreal voluminous mascara fo 22+years and have tried all sorts of other ones here and there but always came back to old trusty with the teddy bear brush. I always wear waterproof makeup if possible, mostly because of my contacts. I am tired of the flakeing and the said no flaking or clumping, so I tried it even though it was a plastic brush and oh my god, I LOVE IT! It catches even the smallest lashes w/out flaking so,if you really are ready for a change for the better go for this one!!!!!</li>
            <li> These really are better than the usual.</li>
            <li> I am using my husbands account. I love this mascara. It is easy to apply and very buildable. I love the wand to it. It clings to the lashes and applies the mascara without clumping. It has become one of my favorites!</li>
            <li> OK PRODUCT BUT WASN&#x27;T TOO IMPRESSED</li>
            <li> great mascara, quick shipping, fair price</li>
            <li> Good mascara, I got a lot of compliments on how it accentuated my long eyelashes but after a week the mascara inside got very clumpy and I had to throw it away.</li>
            <li> It worked ok but not as lengthening as I had hoped.  I also learned from using this that waterproof mascara makes my eyes itch.</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all. Too thick.</li>
            <li> Very fine..does not plump or lengthen lashes..don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a great mascara that doesn&#x27;t clump or make my eyes look like 2 black holes on my face. I am a redhead with green eyes, so my makeup is minimal. I had to work with this mascara because of the shape of the brush and it works just fine.</li>
            <li> so very awesome . love it so buying this mascara more often !!! and plus it&#x27;s long lasting  and looks bold n sexy with it on !!</li>
            <li> This is a cheap brush and it&#x27;s very clumpy and wet. It doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly and your eye lashes end up looking like spider legs. I am very disappointed and I will never purchase this stuff again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried expensive waterproof mascaras but most rub off..but not this one!  It comes off with Boscia&#x27;s Make up Break up cleanser in a flash!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Makes my lashes long and full.  Will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> i HAVE To be honest.I do really like this mascara, however.I haven&#x27;t used it for a long time....so far so good...love it and still doesn&#x27;t have that drying up feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;v tried it all when it comes to drugstore mascaras. Maybelline, Covergirl, Revlon, you name it. And i will whole-heartedly say that this is the best mascara i have ever used. The brush is a very unique design, and i think thats what i like about it most. Some of the bristles are so little that i use one side specifically for my bottom lashes if i feel like going out on a limb. As a 17 year old, i do not like to wear a lot of eye makeup as i feel it closes in my eyes. Mascara is the only thing i wear on my eyes, and i would ALMOST go so far as to say this gives my eyes an almost eyeliner look. As if you couldnt already tell from my ranting on and on, i love it. Worth the money!</li>
            <li> Holy grail of drugstore mascaras ! Great waterproof formula and you get tons of volume!!</li>
