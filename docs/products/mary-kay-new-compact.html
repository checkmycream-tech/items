            <li> Compact pretty, contains mirror, and place for sponge,it is a little difficult to open the first few times</li>
            <li> I think there is supposed to be a magnet to keep it closed</li>
            <li> Thick on red areas,thin everywhere else.</li>
            <li> The ? is due to the fact that the other 2 compartments are too small for the eyeshadow or blush inserts; so not sure what would work.</li>
            <li> The test for me is how it travels everyday in my handbag that gets knocked about, jostled about, thrown all over the place.</li>
            <li> Not a good format.</li>
