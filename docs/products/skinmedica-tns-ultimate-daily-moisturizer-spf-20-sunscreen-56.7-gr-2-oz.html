            <li>and I have been so impressed with the quality of this product that I have now switched from my traditional moistruizer that I used for 15+ years to this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok for some sun protection.</li>

            <li>Love</li>
            <li>Love the TNS line.</li>
            <li>thanks, great product</li>
            <li>This is my favorite daily moisturizer, I don&#x27;t leave home without it, non-greasy, light, SPF, doctor recommended, this is the best</li>
            <li>so far its been a great moisturizer</li>
            <li>your face quite easily.</li>
            <li>and it doesnt even smell strongly of sunscreen which is often an issue with these moisturizers.</li>
            <li>Light, creamy moisturizer</li>
            <li>My skin stays protected from the sun, my foundation goes on smooth and my skin stays hydrated.</li>
            <li>This cream worth every penny you spend on!</li>
            <li>Now I just use this and almost get very close to the same great result in a fraction of the time.</li>
            <li>When my doctor told me about the SkinMedica Products I really wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be worth the money.</li>
            <li>Love the fact it has the SPF 20 along with the antioxidant protection and hydration, yet light enough to wear under my make-up.</li>
            <li>The products are worth the money.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for your excellent customer care, I will defintely come back for all of my future SkinMedica purchases.</li>
            <li>In this particular order there was a mishap, but this seller not only immediately corrected it but also was very generous and sent me a full size SkinMedica (my favorite beauty product) TNS Lip Plump System!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The SPF is just right.</li>
            <li>Light sunscreen feel but high spf1</li>
            <li>I like this product very much.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer and I am ordering my second tube.  </li>
            <li>I tried many facial moisturizers.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>This was my first purchase of SkinMedica products.  </li>
            <li>At first it made me brake out a bit</li>
            <li>Recommended by a plastic surgeon and have been pleased with this facial moisturizer for over 3 yrs.</li>
            <li>Just wish the sunscreen was higher, maybe SPF 30.I have to put a higher level on.</li>
            <li>Love this brand been using it daily for years</li>
            <li>I love SkinMedica products, I have been using them for a long time and altough it is an expensive product, it truly does deliver excellent results.</li>
            <li>My face felt really smooth after the first application and it is beginning to show very positive signs of an overall improvement.  </li>
            <li>I love SkinMedica products but found the Daily Moisturizer not to be very moisturizing</li>
            <li>but if you are out in the sun for long periods of time be sure to reapply.  </li>
            <li>Unlike many other moisturizers with SPF, this one goes on smooth and blends completely into the skin.  </li>
            <li>It was to much time.</li>
            <li>Use it all the time, very peased with results for aging skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many brands of non-greasy, daily facial moisturizers with SPF and this ranks as top-5 for me.  </li>
            <li>would highly recommend it if you need to keep your skin moist and protect your skin from the sun.</li>
            <li>My doctor has highly recommended the products of SkinMedica</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this Seller and will buy again.</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant because of the price; however, I&#x27;m glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks new and is helping with pore size.</li>
            <li>First, I have only used this moisturizer for a couple of weeks, hence the rating of 4 stars!  </li>
            <li>I ordered more thinking that the first bottle was getting a little empty and would need more in a few days time, turns out I got another 3 weeks out of it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hydration is clear without increasing breakouts or clogging pores.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and my pores tend to get clogged.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin soft and protects it from the sun.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I started to break out as an adult.</li>
            <li>This does the job for my couple, makes her skin soft and hydrate, she also got the recommendation from a dermatologist.</li>
            <li>I must say it is worth every penny spent.</li>
            <li>It smooths wrinkles out a bit and gives your face UV protection at the same time along with adding the same color tone to your whole face.</li>
            <li>Maybe it just isn&#x27;t the right cream for my face, but it feels different than other SkinMedica products</li>
            <li>Have been using this for years and for people with dry sensitive skin</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Have been using this for years and for people with dry sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight yet moisturizers my face really well; a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Work for this old skin along with some of their other products.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work as well as TNS Essential Serum or Recovery Complex for getting rid of wrinkles, but pretty close.</li>
            <li> You only need a very small amount because it is so thick, rich, and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> My face no longer gets that oily look later in the day as it did with the other moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> When I tried the product it made my skin feel STICKY, dry and ITCHY.  </li>
            <li> Before this I found it hard to find a moisturizer for my sensitive skin with SPF in it.</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> I used to use TNS essential serum, TNS Recovery Complex, TNS Dermal Repai, and TNS Retinol.</li>
            <li> I had previously used Estee Lauder&#x27;s moisturizer, but after using this product for a month, I am sold.  </li>
            <li> I usually purchase at the dermatologist office, but so much easier and less expensive at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday and night.  </li>
            <li> Skin Medica is one of the few products that does not clog my pores and cause me to get acne.</li>
            <li> I use this moisturizer everyday.</li>
            <li> Some lotions w/sunscreen feel greasy, oily or heavy - this one does not.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so thankful that Amazon has reliable Sellers such as SkySkinCare that stand behind the products they sell.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave your skin with a pale, other-worldly look.</li>
            <li> This is not authentic Skin Medica product.  </li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve ever been disappointed with an order from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Sunscreen usually makes my skin feel slimy but this doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> They are very expensive, which is the only down side.</li>
            <li> I use this SPF moisturizer every day without fail.  </li>
            <li> Remember ladies SPF every single day!!!!!!!!!  </li>
            <li> and he&#x27;s never pointed me in the wrong direction!</li>
            <li> Additionally it doesn&#x27;t have a bad odor and doesn&#x27;t sting the areas around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Now... not too oily base, providing an even skin  pH balance to my face.</li>

            <li> I use this SPF moisturizer every day without fail.  I combine it with TNS Essential Serum and it does wonders for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;The SPF is just right.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday and night.  It is light and effective.  Now my kids use it too.&lt;br /&gt;It is a great stocking stuffer.</li>

            <li> Great product. Love the 20 protection from the sun. It does not feel like zinc oxide.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped quickly and arrived in excellent shape</li>
            <li> Use it daily.  Light sunscreen feel but high spf1</li>
            <li> Reacted when outside in the sun and broke out my face.</li>
            <li> I use this moisturizer everyday. Love the fact it has the SPF 20 along with the antioxidant protection and hydration, yet light enough to wear under my make-up.</li>
            <li> First, I have only used this moisturizer for a couple of weeks, hence the rating of 4 stars!

My doctor has highly recommended the products of SkinMedica and he&#x27;s never pointed me in the wrong direction!</li>
            <li> This is not authentic Skin Medica product.  When I received the bottle it had not tamper resistant cap on - and it was leaking.  When I tried the product it made my skin feel STICKY, dry and ITCHY.  I actually called SKIN MEDICA because I bought 3 different products and found out these were not authorized dealers.</li>
            <li> I tried many facial moisturizers. This one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> The item was already opened. I believe it was opened  There was lotion all around the top ridges of the tube. First time I&#x27;ve ever been disappointed with an order from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I wanted a day time moisturize that hydrated and included a suncreen. The perfect combination.&lt;br /&gt;I love skinmedica products. The products are worth the money. My skin stays protected from the sun, my foundation goes on smooth and my skin stays hydrated. What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> I was recommended to use the TNS moisturizer by the woman who does my facials and I have been so impressed with the quality of this product that I have now switched from my traditional moistruizer that I used for 15+ years to this product.  You only need a very small amount because it is so thick, rich, and long lasting.  Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok for some sun protection. It&#x27;s not leaving my skin moisturized though. I thought I would be able to feel a difference</li>
            <li> I love it!!!!!  The SkinMedica line of products work beautifully together.  My skin looks new and is helping with pore size.</li>
            <li> My skin look smoother</li>
            <li> This is my favorite daily moisturizer, I don&#x27;t leave home without it, non-greasy, light, SPF, doctor recommended, this is the best</li>
            <li> Have been using this for years and for people with dry sensitive skin this is the answer. Sunscreen is a plus for us Florida gals too.</li>
            <li> I have used almost everything on the market. When my doctor told me about the SkinMedica Products I really wasn&#x27;t sure if it would be worth the money. I must say it is worth every penny spent. I used it before I go walking. And after must shower and I wash my face the skinMedica daily moisturizer + SPF20 is a staple in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I had previously used Estee Lauder&#x27;s moisturizer, but after using this product for a month, I am sold.  My face no longer gets that oily look later in the day as it did with the other moisturizer.  It&#x27;s lightweight yet moisturizers my face really well; a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I started to break out as an adult. I could not find a mosturizer and spf cream that worked well with my skin.&lt;br /&gt;This is a perfect combination.&lt;br /&gt;Hydration is clear without increasing breakouts or clogging pores. Love it.[[ASIN:B0016A18YU SkinMedica TNS Ultimate Daily Moisturizer + SPF 20]]</li>
            <li> Use it all the time, very peased with results for aging skin</li>
            <li> I have used SkinMedica products for years and have been very satisfied with everyone I have used.  They are very expensive, which is the only down side.</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase of SkinMedica products.  I was a little hesitant because of the price; however, I&#x27;m glad I bought it.  Sunscreen usually makes my skin feel slimy but this doesn&#x27;t.  It doesn&#x27;t have that sunscreen fragrance to it either which is a BIG advantage!  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the price.</li>
            <li> At first it made me brake out a bit but after a week of continuous use its a great cream</li>
            <li> Unlike many other moisturizers with SPF, this one goes on smooth and blends completely into the skin.  Doesn&#x27;t leave your skin with a pale, other-worldly look.</li>
            <li> Recommended by a plastic surgeon and have been pleased with this facial moisturizer for over 3 yrs. Now... not too oily base, providing an even skin  pH balance to my face.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much. Have only used it for a month &amp;plan to continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Love the TNS line. Just wish the sunscreen was higher, maybe SPF 30.I have to put a higher level on. Otherwise it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> Perfect moisture! Love this moisturizer! It lasts forever! I ordered more thinking that the first bottle was getting a little empty and would need more in a few days time, turns out I got another 3 weeks out of it! Face feels great. Most things break me out but this is perfect!</li>
            <li> Did not care for this product.</li>
            <li> Great moisture cream!I use it every day for hydration of my face.&lt;br /&gt;It does not go on greasy. Use it sparingly as it is creamy and spreads&lt;br /&gt;on your face quite easily. I have noticed that I have minimized my wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;by using this Skin Medica product every day. The prices are also&lt;br /&gt;great through amazon versus buying them at a Dermatology office.</li>
            <li> This does the job for my couple, makes her skin soft and hydrate, she also got the recommendation from a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> so far its been a great moisturizer and it doesnt even smell strongly of sunscreen which is often an issue with these moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many brands of non-greasy, daily facial moisturizers with SPF and this ranks as top-5 for me.  Disappears into the skin, doesn&#x27;t leave residue or shine on face.</li>
            <li> Some lotions w/sunscreen feel greasy, oily or heavy - this one does not.  It provides great protection but if you are out in the sun for long periods of time be sure to reapply.  Love Love this item!</li>
            <li> thanks, great product</li>
            <li> Love this brand been using it daily for years</li>
            <li> Maybe it just isn&#x27;t the right cream for my face, but it feels different than other SkinMedica products</li>
            <li> I love SkinMedica products, I have been using them for a long time and altough it is an expensive product, it truly does deliver excellent results. I&#x27;m so thankful that Amazon has reliable Sellers such as SkySkinCare that stand behind the products they sell. In this particular order there was a mishap, but this seller not only immediately corrected it but also was very generous and sent me a full size SkinMedica (my favorite beauty product) TNS Lip Plump System!! Thank you so much for your excellent customer care, I will defintely come back for all of my future SkinMedica purchases. I highly recommend this Seller and will buy again.Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Amazing.  Work for this old skin along with some of their other products.  My collagen is back and my skin looks 20 years younger along with a treatment of chemical peels.  Remember ladies SPF every single day!!!!!!!!!  A little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> Love skin Medica products, they really do deliver great outcomes for the skin!</li>
