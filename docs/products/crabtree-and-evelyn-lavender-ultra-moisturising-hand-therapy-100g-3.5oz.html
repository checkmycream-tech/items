            <li> Leaves soft hands without feeling greasy like other product.</li>
            <li> but if you need serious help for your dry skin......it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> My hand is extra dry</li>
            <li> : after 2 or 3 months of use, the tube developed a long crack down the side, so lotion oozed out with the slightest squeeze.</li>
            <li> It is not too oily or too dry.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hands</li>
            <li> Plus a little goes a long way with this moisturizer and the size of the moisturizer</li>
            <li> so you have to shake it down to the opening when you get to the bottom of the tube.  </li>
            <li> The cream seems slightly thinner in texture.  </li>
            <li> Crabtree and Evelyn is a little pricey but thats all over</li>
            <li> It does not leave a heavy greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> It is a little expensive</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle but noticeable and doesn&#x27;t have an artificial scent.  </li>
            <li> The tube itself is disappointing.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this! The scent is nice and mild, not overwhelming and it really works on dry hands!</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous lotions to use on my hands and feet and have not found anything that even comes close to this.  It does not leave a heavy greasy feeling.  It will soften even the most hard callouses and if used regularly, I am sure it would help those with psoriasis.  It is a little expensive but if you need serious help for your dry skin......it is worth it.  :o)</li>
            <li> THIS IS GOOD FOR MY SKIN LOVE THE SMELL</li>
            <li> just what my daughter in law wanted.</li>
            <li> I just ordered the hand cream for the first time. I had never used it before, and I am so very glad I decided to try it. It is also an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I love the scent. I got it quicky with absoutely no problem. It works well. Crabtree and Evelyn is a little pricey but thats all over and it is very nice.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this lotion. It is not too oily or too dry. The size is perfect to carry around</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years, and am still in love with it! If you like the aroma of Lavender, and a quality moisturising hand creme, get it!</li>
            <li> The tube is plastic, not metal. The cream seems slightly thinner in texture.  The tube doesn&#x27;t collapse like the old metal one so you have to shake it down to the opening when you get to the bottom of the tube.  Still it&#x27;s very nice. Arrived on time, which was very important to me.  Update: after 2 or 3 months of use, the tube developed a long crack down the side, so lotion oozed out with the slightest squeeze. Ended up throwing it out. What a waste of perfectly good lotion.</li>
            <li> Wonderful💘 I will always buy more.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Works well and smells nice</li>
            <li> The cream is delightful, the scent a perfect lavender. The tube itself is disappointing. It has a tendency to crack.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.  Would buy it again.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> This product is on the pricey side but I think it is well worth it. My mom works a lot with her hands in the water and with it being winter and all her hand get super dry and scratchy. The ulta-moisturising hand therapy true was a life saver and has help my mom in a huge way that it is something I would purchase again and again. Plus a little goes a long way with this moisturizer and the size of the moisturizer is ok maybe it could be a tad bigger.</li>
            <li> I take this to work with me and use throughout the day to relax from the scent and keep my hands hydrated.  I have very dry hands and this really helps without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> My hand is extra dry and I don&#x27;t like the sticky feeling with strong scent of some hand creams. This product just smooth, easy apply and smell just right amount.</li>
            <li> I love this hand lotion. The lavender scent is so relaxing and sitting. It absorbs beautifully and makes your so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> A review a product is essential for other s who are interested is buying it. It does help with the process.But there is a limit. this is an item that I trust anyone who would purchase it knows what it does. Is an in-depth review necessary. Come on Amazon filter it so that reviews apply to a product that could actually benefit from one!!!!</li>
            <li> love this lotion. great for my hands, especially in winter</li>
            <li> CREAM SMELLS SO GOOD AND MAKES YOUR HANDS FEEL LIKE SILK  I WILL DEFINITELY BUY IT AGAIN  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I love this brand and buy the tins whenever I run out so I can have a variety of scents while upping my supply.  This is probably the best lavender scent of any lotion out there.  It&#x27;s subtle but noticeable and doesn&#x27;t have an artificial scent.  The lotion, like all of the Crabtrees, is silky and not oily.  LOVE!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s was ok but not as &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; as I was hoping for. Not scented enough for my liking. Arrived quickly</li>
            <li> I just love this lotion!  It feels soft and thick when applying and easily absorbs so that you are left with soft hands!!</li>
            <li> Leaves soft hands without feeling greasy like other product. Love it</li>
            <li> This not only has the best fragrance, It makes your hands feel so silky and soft. I plan to purchase this in the future, its worth it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product forever.  I have purchased this as gifts as well.  The scent is very pleasant and the lotion keeps your hands soft and moisturized which is especially nice, especially with the winter weather.</li>
            <li> Very good lotion  My fav</li>
