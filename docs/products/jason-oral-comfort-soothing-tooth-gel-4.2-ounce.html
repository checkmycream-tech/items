    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It has a delicious flavor as well.</li>
            <li>Awesome toothpaste!</li>
            <li>The Jason Oral was as good as advertised, and provides excellent, soothing comfort for my dentures.</li>
            <li>Great product and would order again.</li>
            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>Great taste.  </li>
            <li>Great , clean , perfect amount of polish!</li>
            <li>but I feel good about the quality of the JASON products.</li>
            <li>Fluoride free and a great taste all in one!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month now and am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>I have loved Jason products and am thrilled with this one as well.  </li>
            <li>is that it has a very light and pleasant flavor.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a satisfied customer!</li>
            <li>I really love this product!</li>
            <li>The flavor is a nice berry flavor</li>
            <li>Foams up nicely.  </li>
            <li>The Berry Mint flavor is quite nice as well.</li>
            <li>I did not notice my teeth becoming yellower, but I don&#x27;t think they became any whiter after using this!</li>
            <li>That and the fact that the taste is pleasant enough to actually enjoy brushing makes it the best product for me because most toothpastes turn me off from brushing regularity between how they irritate my teeth and gums or the foul aftertastes they leave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Whitening the teeth is not its forte, but as my first and foremost concern is health, I am happy with it.</li>
            <li>I plan to buy more.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the taste but am so glad to find something WITHOUT mint.</li>
            <li>And my gums appear to be as healthy as before, so this will be my paste of choice from now on.  </li>
            <li>I truly love about this toothpaste</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to get fluoride in my system anymore and needed something more for my gums.  </li>
            <li>Most of the toothpastes out there have a strong mint flavor.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s been great for sensitive teeth and gums, which I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The flavor is very mild and comforting.</li>
            <li>Almost done with my first tube and have already bought two more to make sure I don&#x27;t run out.  </li>
            <li>Thank you Jason&#x27;s for making something mint free that works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had good checkups since using it and my dentist is surprised at how well it does without any fluoride.</li>
            <li>The Berry Mint flavor is pleasant and not extremely minty.  </li>
            <li>and when I&#x27;m done my teeth and mouth feels so clean and</li>
            <li>it stays feeling clean for 12-24 hours.</li>
            <li>I love that the toothpaste has a gentle taste.  </li>
            <li>Its a nice alternative to Sensodyne and all natural</li>
            <li>It has just enough mint to feel refreshing, but the aftertaste is more berry without being too sweet.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, with the advent of this cosmetically foul experience and how to get rid of this problem, this stuff isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate Jason&#x27;s Oral Comfort because it doesn&#x27;t blast my mouth with a hot, strong flavor.  </li>
            <li>It cleans effectively and is gentle enough to not irritate even after I&#x27;ve had dental work done and my teeth are at their most sensitive.  </li>
            <li>Nice, all natural alternative for people with sensitive teeth-</li>
            <li>A very gentle and soothing gel.  </li>
            <li>--- Recently started trying to integrate more natural/organic products into my life.  </li>
            <li>It actually has me looking forward to brushing because I love the taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most toothpastes have a very strong mint flavor that stays in your mouth for far too long after brushing and actually act as deterrents to brushing</li>
            <li>The extra creamy texture seems to help my toothbrush bristles slide easily between my teeth and under my gums.</li>
            <li>I find I can brush longer due to the smooth creamy texture and mild flavor.</li>
            <li>hope it really does work.</li>
            <li>Works really well with an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>opposite is true of this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>so I will use this particular paste for awhile..</li>
            <li>it is very natural.</li>
            <li>; like typical grocery store/corporate brands -- but seems to work fine.  </li>
            <li>I bought this toothpaste at a local grocery store first, but will be buying from Amazon from now on since my grocery store no longer carries this flavor and variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In fact it actually helped relieve some pain that I had when my gums were healing from recent dental work, like my more recent wisdom tooth removal.  </li>
            <li>I feel that this product improved the health of my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I started using this toothpaste for my sensitive teeth and my sensitivity disappeared.</li>
            <li>For the first time in a LONG time, after I visited my dentist&#x27;s, he said that I had no cavities or peridontitis issues!</li>
            <li>This is better than regular tooth paste, though I am not sure I&#x27;d call it soothing.</li>
            <li>When I write a review, I&#x27;m super careful that my results or satisfaction level is congregant with the actual product.</li>
            <li>I have used some other toothpaste from this company and they are all pretty nice,,especially powersmile.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a long expensive journey trying so many new toothpastes in my quest to get rid of fluoride and mint.  </li>

            <li> It was a shock to me, considering that I usually have periodontitis-type problems.</li>
            <li> Madina Neem made my eyes swell nearly shut, Closys caused dangerous heart arrythmia.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am not sure how well this works but I feel good about the quality of the JASON products. I have used some other toothpaste from this company and they are all pretty nice,,especially powersmile.  I am trying to make my teeth healthier so I will use this particular paste for awhile..hope it really does work.</li>
            <li> I have been using Oral Comfort for several years now. It saved my teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whitening the teeth is not its forte, but as my first and foremost concern is health, I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> After long term use this stuff does not protect your teeth from staining or from browning. I&#x27;ve used it for about a month now and I noticed that my teeth have turned a horrible \\&quot;beige\\&quot; color. My teeth have never been this color and it has occurred with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m not sure what the staining is from. It could be from black tea or coffee or it could be from the tooth paste. I guess I&#x27;ll figure it out because I&#x27;ll try to use it in conjunction with other toothpaste (that I know  keeps teeth white.) My coffee and black tea use has not increased and I assume that I could stop drinking staining beverages. Nope, won&#x27;t be doing that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been great for sensitive teeth and gums, which I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, with the advent of this cosmetically foul experience and how to get rid of this problem, this stuff isn&#x27;t worth it. When I write a review, I&#x27;m super careful that my results or satisfaction level is congregant with the actual product. No doubt this stuff either stains or does not protect against stains.</li>
            <li> This is better than regular tooth paste, though I am not sure I&#x27;d call it soothing.</li>
            <li> A very gentle and soothing gel.  The extra creamy texture seems to help my toothbrush bristles slide easily between my teeth and under my gums. The flavor is very mild and comforting. The color is like topaz, a transparent gold color, which I like. I find I can brush longer due to the smooth creamy texture and mild flavor.</li>
            <li> I love that the toothpaste has a gentle taste.  Most of the toothpastes out there have a strong mint flavor.  This burns my mouth and makes my sensitivities worse.  Sometimes I&#x27;ve even bought children&#x27;s toothpaste (strawberry, banana, etc.) to get away from the heavy mint toothpastes!  I really appreciate Jason&#x27;s Oral Comfort because it doesn&#x27;t blast my mouth with a hot, strong flavor.  It seems to work well for my sensitivities.  I&#x27;m a satisfied customer!</li>
            <li> The non-minty flavor and non-flouride toothpaste was just as I had hoped it would be.  Great product and would order again.</li>
            <li> Nice, all natural alternative for people with sensitive teeth- and it works! It has a delicious flavor as well. Great product</li>
            <li> The Jason Oral was as good as advertised, and provides excellent, soothing comfort for my dentures. I plan to buy more.</li>
            <li> I feel that this product improved the health of my sensitive teeth. I like that it is very natural. I alternate with using this and a regular anticavity toothpaste. For the first time in a LONG time, after I visited my dentist&#x27;s, he said that I had no cavities or peridontitis issues! It was a shock to me, considering that I usually have periodontitis-type problems. (It also helps that I floss every day). HOWEVER, I do not think it improved the whiteness of my teeth. The gel itself is a pale brownish-beige color... I did not notice my teeth becoming yellower, but I don&#x27;t think they became any whiter after using this!</li>
            <li> For years I used Sensodyne but it never worked. Since I started using Jason&#x27;s Oral Comfort (10 years ago) I have no issues with tooth pain. I recently tried another of Jason&#x27;s products (for whitening) but after about 1 month my teeth started to hurt again. After 2 days back on Oral Comfort the pain is gone. I&#x27;m not switching ever again!</li>
            <li> Great , clean , perfect amount of polish! I haven&#x27;t gone wrong with Jason products. Fluoride free and a great taste all in one!</li>
            <li> Awesome toothpaste! I switched to this toothpaste because I wanted to try a toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t contain fluoride or carrageenan. I brush with this toothpaste for 2 minutes and when I&#x27;m done my teeth and mouth feels so clean and it stays feeling clean for 12-24 hours. The flavor is a nice berry flavor but it&#x27;s not sweet. I still use Toms of Maine once a week just to get a little fluoride on my teeth.</li>
            <li> I have loved Jason products and am thrilled with this one as well.  I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days and haven&#x27;t noticed it helping with my sensitivity issues.  I hope that will improve over time.  This is an expensive toothpaste (relatively speaking), but I think it is worth it.</li>
            <li> It helped the sensitivity within a few brushings. I don&#x27;t love the taste but am so glad to find something WITHOUT mint. Mint just makes me sick, the taste , the small, all of it. Thank you Jason&#x27;s for making something mint free that works.</li>
            <li> Almost done with my first tube and have already bought two more to make sure I don&#x27;t run out.  It&#x27;s been a long expensive journey trying so many new toothpastes in my quest to get rid of fluoride and mint.  At least a half dozen have ended up in the trash for one reason or another.  I was afraid of developing sensitivity after using Sensodyne for countless years, but there hasn&#x27;t been any problem at all since starting Jason.  And my gums appear to be as healthy as before, so this will be my paste of choice from now on.  Madina Neem made my eyes swell nearly shut, Closys caused dangerous heart arrythmia.  All the rest I tried and trashed were various standard brands from the local pharmacy - Arm &amp; Hammer, Crest, Colgate, etc.etc.etc.</li>
            <li> --- Recently started trying to integrate more natural/organic products into my life.  Have used this product and like it.  It does not leave my teeth feeling &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; like typical grocery store/corporate brands -- but seems to work fine.  Would purchase again, and will try other brands/types of tooth paste in this category as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this toothpaste at a local grocery store first, but will be buying from Amazon from now on since my grocery store no longer carries this flavor and variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I truly love about this toothpaste is that it has a very light and pleasant flavor.  Most toothpastes have a very strong mint flavor that stays in your mouth for far too long after brushing and actually act as deterrents to brushing and that is definitely not something we want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The opposite is true of this toothpaste.  The Berry Mint flavor is pleasant and not extremely minty.  It has just enough mint to feel refreshing, but the aftertaste is more berry without being too sweet.  It actually has me looking forward to brushing because I love the taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind though, this isn&#x27;t a whitening toothpaste.  My teeth definitely have plenty of issues including staining  I haven&#x27;t seen additional staining, but not getting any whiter.  It cleans effectively and is gentle enough to not irritate even after I&#x27;ve had dental work done and my teeth are at their most sensitive.  In fact it actually helped relieve some pain that I had when my gums were healing from recent dental work, like my more recent wisdom tooth removal.  That and the fact that the taste is pleasant enough to actually enjoy brushing makes it the best product for me because most toothpastes turn me off from brushing regularity between how they irritate my teeth and gums or the foul aftertastes they leave.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to get fluoride in my system anymore and needed something more for my gums.  This toothpaste does it.  I&#x27;ve had good checkups since using it and my dentist is surprised at how well it does without any fluoride.</li>
            <li> Foams up nicely.  Works really well with an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I started using this toothpaste for my sensitive teeth and my sensitivity disappeared. I have used it for years. I tried another toothpaste recently and found that after only a few days the sensitivity was coming back.  I switched back and have been doing well ever since. Great taste.  I really love this product!</li>
            <li> This is TOOTHPASTE not tooth gel, although it is in a gel form. Its a nice alternative to Sensodyne and all natural</li>
            <li> This is the only toothpaste for sensitive teeth that actually works for me other than Sensodyne.  I switched because I wanted to only buy from a cruelty-free companies.  I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t work but I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month now and am very pleased.  The Berry Mint flavor is quite nice as well.</li>
            <li> Service and product were both terrific.</li>
