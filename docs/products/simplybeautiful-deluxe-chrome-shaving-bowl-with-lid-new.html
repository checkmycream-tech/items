            <li>I can see it would be good for many varied uses, but I have my shaving soap in in.</li>
            <li>While it does look nice, it had a couple flaws.</li>
            <li>My husband likes it to keep his shaving soap between shaves, so it is great to put the lid on and it looks like a pretty decoration for the bathroom!  </li>
            <li>It keeps the heat for a considerable amount of time, which is great for shaving!</li>
            <li>It is very nicely made (in Taiwan) and pretty durable.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s made in Taiwan, which is better than China, but I would rather have a US product.</li>
            <li>I was given this product free, for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>husband loves using this and says it makes shaving much more simpler.</li>
            <li>I got to try this free for honest review</li>
            <li>I received this free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li>If you use shaving cream, go ahead and buy it, it is one of the best purchases you will make, if you use soap, I would consider something else, it&#x27;s fine with soap, but there are many other bowls and mugs that would do a better job, overall, it&#x27;s excellent.</li>
            <li>Good product, good price, Very FAST and REASONABLE SHIPPING.</li>
            <li>A classic, nice looking bowl!</li>
            <li>It makes lathering and application easy.  </li>
            <li>Very well made, no sharp edges or impurities in the design, It preserves heat very well, I would like you to notice that this bowl would not make a very good soap bowl, but it is perfect for creams, very high quality and it is not made in China, it is made in Taiwan,</li>
            <li>It looks exactly like the picture, and is a nice weight.  </li>
            <li>This bowl wasn&#x27;t quite big enough to use for building a good lather, but it&#x27;s excellent for storing a soap puck or the like.</li>
            <li>I will be using it for now until I find a better shaving bowl....or an nice old ceramic mug.</li>
            <li>i use it all the time i received this for free for my opinion</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very functional and looks nice on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>It is solid and looks very nice.</li>
            <li>It was very wide and I was able to whip up a great lather, but after leaving it to close to the edge, my son knocked it over a broke it.</li>
            <li>It had lots of positive reviews, but most seemed to be regarding the appearance.</li>
            <li>It is very pretty and does not look cheap, so</li>
            <li>Now, I just need a company to send me a shaving brush to make the full set.</li>
            <li>This item would make a nice gift for that someone that has nearly everything.</li>
            <li>This shaving bowl arrived quickly, and was packaged well.  </li>
            <li>Nice finish and elegant appearance, but not quite large enough for my taste to be useful for shaving.</li>
            <li>Smaller than expected but after using found that the size is perfect for using with my brush.</li>
            <li>I used to have a nice big ceramic cup, until I had a boy.....</li>
            <li>The second is the bottom traps air, so if you set it into warm water</li>
            <li>It looks elegant sitting on my counter top and does not need to be hidden</li>
            <li>Be aware you can not return the item.</li>
            <li>it is super high quality and classy look for any home or bathroom!</li>
            <li>The first is that the bowl is not wide enough to be able to really work the shaving soap (or cream).</li>
            <li>High quality covered dish for those looking for a stainless shaving bowl.  </li>
            <li>I love this little shaving bowl with lid</li>
            <li>Too small to be used as a shaving bowl for many soap pucks.</li>
            <li>Adds old world class to my shaving routine!</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money buying this item.  </li>

            <li> I love this little shaving bowl with lid it works great for me i use it all the time i received this for free for my opinion</li>
            <li> The Deluxe Chrome Shaving Bowl With Lid by SimplyBeautiful comes shipped securely. I saw one review on Amazon, where the person said the top was stuck on. This is odd, considering the top and base are shipped in plastic and sealed separately. I had another company send me shaving soap which fits into this shaving bowl perfectly. The chrome shaving bowl looks much better than the plastic bowl I have been keeping my shaving soap in. Now, I just need a company to send me a shaving brush to make the full set.

            <li> This Deluxe Chrome Shaving Bowl with a lid is a great add to my bathroom for my husband. It looks elegant sitting on my counter top and does not need to be hidden away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband loves using this and says it makes shaving much more simpler. He asked why I never bought one or reviewed one sooner, lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I for one prior to this did not even know there was a such thing as shaving bowl! I think anyone with a man in the house should get one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even a woman for shaving her legs would probably get use out of this!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item in exchange of my honest unbiased review. All reviews are 100% my own!</li>
            <li> This is a great shaving bowl.</li>
            <li> I received this along with a badger shaving brush from SimplyBeautiful. While I was not in love with the brush and fallout, the chrome shaving bowl gets the thumbs up from me! It is very nicely made (in Taiwan) and pretty durable. It keeps the heat for a considerable amount of time, which is great for shaving! When leg shaving starts again in a few weeks, I might start regularly using this myself! It&#x27;s currently being used to hold cotton balls on my vanity since Dave actually already owns a shaving bowl and having two is so not necessary…especially when he doesn&#x27;t use the one he has! I was very impressed at the quality of this bowl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product in exchange for my personal, unbiased review. All thoughts and opinions expressed are 100% my own*</li>
            <li> High quality covered dish for those looking for a stainless shaving bowl.  Would buy again</li>
            <li> Very nice!  Have to see it to appreciate it.</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected but after using found that the size is perfect for using with my brush.</li>

            <li> My fiance likes this bowl. It&#x27;s very functional and looks nice on the bathroom counter. I also got him the 3 piece premium shaving set from BossRazors and it all blends well together.</li>
            <li> A classic, nice looking bowl! I can see it would be good for many varied uses, but I have my shaving soap in in. The lid fits very well and tight.</li>
            <li> Good product, good price, Very FAST and REASONABLE SHIPPING.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money buying this item.  When I received the order and unpack it the cover would not come off.  This made the item useless.  I feel like I was robbed.  Be aware you can not return the item.</li>
            <li> I got to try this free for honest review it is super high quality and classy look for any home or bathroom!</li>

            <li> Was going to return, as it was intended for a lathering bowl, but turned out to be the perfect Col Conk soap holder. Starting in the den</li>
            <li> Too small to be used as a shaving bowl for many soap pucks. But it does look great and is well made.</li>
            <li> I used to have a nice big ceramic cup, until I had a boy.....a tornado. It was very wide and I was able to whip up a great lather, but after leaving it to close to the edge, my son knocked it over a broke it. I searched and searched for a shaving bowl on Amazon and eventually found this one. It had lots of positive reviews, but most seemed to be regarding the appearance. While it does look nice, it had a couple flaws. The first is that the bowl is not wide enough to be able to really work the shaving soap (or cream). The second is the bottom traps air, so if you set it into warm water it tips over and spoils the lather that was so frustrating to make. I have to move it in little circles to get the air out so it won&#x27;t capsize. I will be using it for now until I find a better shaving bowl....or an nice old ceramic mug.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this bowl.  Made well and the chrome is great.</li>
            <li> Adds old world class to my shaving routine!</li>
