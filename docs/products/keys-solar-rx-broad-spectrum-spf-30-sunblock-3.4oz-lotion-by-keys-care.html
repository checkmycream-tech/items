            <li>I especially love that I can literally get it in my eyes and it does not hurt at all!  </li>

            <li>A Great Product and great service.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen/moisturizer is great</li>
            <li>This has a great rating on EWG&#x27;s website too.  </li>
            <li>Great for my rosacea</li>
            <li>I bought this item for use on my face but it is great as a body cram/block as well.</li>
            <li>This product works great.  </li>
            <li>The popular B and B&#x27;s don&#x27;t make the list at all--convenient but not the best for sun protection.  </li>
            <li>They have a great information on sunscreen products and the regulation by the FDA.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!!  </li>
            <li>smell is very nice for a sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It applies as though it&#x27;s going to be too zinc-y, but if you let it sit for 30 seconds, it absorbs very nicely.  </li>
            <li>The smell of it is not the best that is for sure</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m very happy with the purchase and plan to buy more.</li>
            <li>This brand is the very best of many I have tried.</li>
            <li>Some people say it smells like pine, but I thought it had a metallic smell that wasn&#x27;t pleasant.    </li>
            <li>The smell is not so good</li>
            <li>I researched this product after a good friend got melanoma</li>
            <li>So if you can get over that, it&#x27;s a good product otherwise.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not greasy, it doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out, seems to soothe my eczema, looks good under make up or alone, doesn&#x27;t have that ghostly look that sometimes this sort of sunscreen can leave.    </li>
            <li>Seems to provide good sun protection.</li>
            <li>To be fair, I have not tried this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Feels good on skin.</li>
            <li>I have been scouring the web and EWG for a good sunscreen with packaging that appeals to men (e.g., my husband).</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>It it great sunscreen, non greasy but provides a great light moisturizer</li>
            <li>Feels a bit greasy (but it&#x27;s better than tacky!)  </li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>It has a nice texture</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It absorbs nicely into the skin.</li>
            <li>I have honestly tried everything to take cover in the sun.  </li>
            <li>I liked it.</li>
            <li>When used as directed, it is effective; however, this is NOT a sunscreen you can put on in order to sun bathe.  </li>
            <li>sunblock now I use a mixture of zinc oxide powder + cocoa powder and it is just effective and doesn&#x27;t make my skin breakout.</li>
            <li>This is the best sunscreen as far as having no carcinogenic ingredients, unlike most brands you see everywhere else!</li>
            <li>Best natural moisturizer I have ever used...does not leave skin greasy and I have oily skin.</li>
            <li>I love this product because it is truly effective.</li>
            <li>Keys is a great company who really cares about its customers!</li>
            <li>While I am sure it is an extremely safe and effective sunblock, it might not be the best for me as it is relatively dry on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Also, it blocks the sun better.</li>
            <li>I personally love the smell of this stuff it reminds me of a spa.</li>
            <li>Have purchased this many times.  </li>
            <li>Goes on well (though I blend it with a drop of argan oil) and leaves skin feeling smooth and nice.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff, it does not bother my allergies.</li>
            <li>I am a wildlife volunteer ....and rescue everything from hummingbirds to elephant seals and more etc.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Finally a great moisturizer with high SPF without being toxic!  </li>
            <li>This one was better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all of the top 10 sunscreen rated by EWG and</li>
            <li>this one is my favorite.      </li>
            <li>(Sure, there are \\&quot;safer\\&quot; sunscreen than the Episencial brand, which has an EWG rating of 2...</li>
            <li>I love the texture of Keys Soap-</li>
            <li>-EWG rating of 1, which means it&#x27;s safe   -UVA 4 star rating and 30</li>
            <li>(but I am able to use a darker powder on top if needed)   </li>
            <li>I have tried too many sunscreens to count.  </li>
            <li>I do make sure that I wash my face well at the end of the day so that my pores don&#x27;t get clogged.</li>
            <li>Really nice feel, light no residue.  </li>
            <li>more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used this moisturizer/sunscreen on my face for several years now  with excellent results.  </li>
            <li>Want more information on sun protection products, see skincancer.org.  </li>
            <li>Love that this is a sunscreen moisturizer that I use under makeup for the day.  </li>
            <li>Love the fact it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of chemicals.</li>
            <li>It had been my favorite sunscreen</li>
            <li>This is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I use it every day and have for many years.  </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t make my face shiny like most sunscreen&#x27;s do.  </li>
            <li>Smells really nice and clean.  </li>
            <li>This is great non-toxic sunblock that is highly rated by the Environmental Working Group (EWG).  </li>
            <li>but as soon as you apply it and it drys the smell magically goes away ...and for a product this fantastic</li>
            <li>It offers a great finish this way with the protection I need.  </li>
            <li>it sure is worth it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for at least 5 years and I am happy with how it&#x27;s kept my face looking great.</li>
            <li>The smell did take some getting used to; but it fades very quickly.</li>
            <li>to apply and rubs in easily</li>
            <li>pump is easy to use.</li>
            <li>The medicinal scent of this is so strong</li>
            <li>I love that it is able to really moisturizer without being oily:)</li>
            <li>NOT accentuate flaws or fine lines   -NO shimmery or reflective look that some mineral-based makeups have   -Some ability to balance the look of my skin tone</li>
            <li>Very clean, nice smell that I have been complimented a couple of times, not excessively.</li>
            <li>sunscreen is great for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;-The</li>
            <li>It rubs in great and doesn&#x27;t leave any white residue.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic cream</li>
            <li>NO breakouts, spots, bumps, or pimples for me   -100% chemical free</li>
            <li>Goes on light and protects.</li>
            <li>Loved the all natural ingredients of Keys products.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that it does not feel greasy and after applying, it feels comfortable.</li>
            <li>Since I don&#x27;t need to buy a daytime moisturizer plus a sunblock, this is well worth the price!</li>
            <li>If I need more sun protection, I just layer more on top couple hours later...</li>
            <li>In addition, they said they would also take my original shipping fee out of my refund.  </li>
            <li>this sunblock lotion is easy to apply and it&#x27;s absorbed well.</li>
            <li>My favorite sunscreen (along with tinted Sunsi&#x27;belle) non-toxic, effective, no white residue, works under powder bleach or mineral foundation.</li>
            <li>You get full UV protection here.</li>
            <li>I have had good luck with it and will continue to use it as a facial sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Although I appreciate that Solar Keys used good quality ingredients in this sunblock and no preservatives or synthetic chemicals, all those oils and waxes are simply not going to work on clog-prone</li>
            <li>you are looking for other all-natural products, Keys has a great line of lotions and whatnot, too.</li>
            <li>the smell is “nature” like, but goes away quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that breaks out easily and also gets irritated easily.  </li>
            <li>It feels utterly smooth on my rosacea in the hot sun</li>
            <li>It feels light and very easy to blend in--just like a like face cream without that creamy, Greek-yogurt texture that just sits on your skin leaving a greasy white film.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is made with natural ingredients!</li>
            <li>Physical sunscreen  Rated 0 by Environmental Working Group   Doesn&#x27;t leave a tacky or chalky residue  Smooth and easy to apply  Sets fine under some mineral makeup  </li>
            <li>The shea butter is very moisturizing and helped with the fine lines around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product has been effective enough that sometimes I purposely DON&#x27;T wear it, just so my face gets a bit of color.  </li>
            <li>IT GETS BETTER: I have really sensitive skin (redhead)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m golden.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many natural sunscreen lotions.</li>
            <li>I feel it is worth it, but I do wish it cost less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then I contacted the seller, Fresh Bontanica, to return the item.  </li>
            <li>I had high expectations for this product after thoroughly reading so many positive reviews about it.</li>
            <li>--it&#x27;s rated very high against sun rays, it blends beautifully with a much lighter feel on the skin acting really like a primer.</li>
            <li>It adds a bit of moisture (not grease or oil or heavy-feeling) to the skin, so for me with my combination skin, I can use my normal lightly moisturizing serum and then follow with this</li>
            <li>Some say that it only gets absorbed into the top layer of skin and doesn&#x27;t really do any damage (and it is better than chemical sunscreens for sure because they go into the bloodstream), but there are other products</li>
            <li>-Cost is a bit high, but one container lasts six months   -SPF isn&#x27;t as high as I&#x27;d like, but from the studies I&#x27;ve read, higher doesn&#x27;t protect better</li>
            <li>this works great and is healthier to use than most sunscreens but it is too expensive.</li>
            <li>This one is only slightly white going on, which is a great improvement over some of the mineral sunscreens I have tried.  </li>
            <li>many of them just really don&#x27;t do the job blocking the rays and that&#x27;s the real point of it all, and this brand was highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I was pretty excited to find a sunblock to protect my new tattoo, and did a bunch of research on this one.</li>
            <li>Also, driven home in a converrtible w/ top down, and was fine.</li>
            <li>I have tried sooooo many products for sunscreen on my face and each one would just aggravate my rosacea or simply break out my face.  </li>
            <li>And the EWG gave this their independent  top of the line rating for sunblocks too that anyone can see for themselves .</li>
            <li>For many years Keys Solar Rx has served double duty as my daytime moisturizer and my sunblock.</li>
            <li>I love this facial cream.</li>
            <li>The only notable difference</li>
            <li>when I first apply it   -Looks</li>
            <li>No ill effects from the sun.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t like the smell initially but really love</li>
            <li>ok, i actually don&#x27;t know if it works yet</li>
            <li>This smells interesting and i will have to see if i burn or not later in summer.</li>
            <li>Since I ordered a 3rd, I was obviously satisfied with my first two bottles.  </li>
            <li>extremely sensitive skin loves this product!!!!</li>
            <li>My pediatrician recommended I look at ewg.org (the Environmental Working Group) which, every year, rates pretty much all sunscreens based on safety.  </li>
            <li>Last summer, I got serious about figuring out what the best sunscreen for my family would be.  </li>
            <li>For me though, with my dry skin, an oilier sunblock like Sunology or Soleo is better.</li>
            <li>My face feels nice and soft all day long until I wash it at night.  </li>
            <li>For me, it has the added benefit of evening out my skin tone (if you&#x27;re a person of color, it&#x27;s almost certainly going to look chalky on you).</li>
            <li>Certain antibiotics</li>
            <li>I use this everyday and love it!</li>
            <li>The other is a Chinese brand \\&quot;Jia Xue\\&quot; which feels just like normal milky lotion, cool and very refreshing, but is probably chemical.</li>
            <li>She really likes the ease of use...</li>
            <li>This stuff has not broken me out at all ever</li>
            <li>It still has a zinc oxide smell, and there isn&#x27;t much of a way around that.</li>
            <li>I really like this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s really 30 SPF.</li>
            <li>It smells very earthy, like dirt and rosemary.</li>
            <li>Price seems reasonable-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used both and haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference between the two in terms of performance or product quality.     </li>
            <li>it is very moisturizing but not greasy and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out.</li>
            <li>It really does blend in well with no chalkiness or skin color change noted.  </li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t give him too much of a &amp;#34;white face.&amp;#34; I hope that this sunscreen will make him use his sunscreen</li>
            <li>I discovered this product through the EWG Skin deep website which recommended it as being free of harmful chemicals.  </li>
            <li>, we haven&#x27;t had a really sunny day here yet.  </li>
            <li>You can no longer see how much product is remaining in the bottle.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and it&#x27;s not too thick like most of the healthier sunscreens I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>For all the high scoring sunscreens, I came to amazon, read consumer reviews (to see if people liked the texture, not greasy, didn&#x27;t leave a pale ghostly look) and checked out prices.  </li>
            <li>There is a film more or less after you apply it</li>
            <li>Being so highly rated in the (EMC) tests and here on Amazon, I bought this and have been using it for a week.</li>
            <li>Not waterproof  High price  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this sunblock since it is highly rated on EWG.org.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>The ingredient itself may not be bad, but I have read too many times to avoid nano particles because they get absorbed into the skin rather than just sitting on top of it.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a non-chemical sunscreen that is safe and effective, but doesn&#x27;t make my face look or feel weird, to use on a daily basis underneath makeup.</li>
            <li>Thus far it&#x27;s been working very well for sun protection.</li>
            <li>I expected it to feel light (like Obagi NuDerm SPF 35).</li>
            <li>Keys Solar is not only one of the safest sunscreens on the market per the Safer Cosmetics web site but it does not leave a white film on the skin as so many of the natural ones do</li>
            <li>I am 62, and used to have oily skin, but skin is normal now.  </li>
            <li>As an aging woman living in a dry southwestern climate, I am delighted with it, but it would be too heavy for, say, Austin, TX.  </li>
            <li>This product is new to me.</li>
            <li>In fact, this is the only sunscreen I&#x27;ve consistently worn under my makeup.</li>
            <li>But this time it came from a different Amazon seller than the first two bottles.  </li>
            <li>(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two weeks after stopping use and being really diligent with hot water compresses and a honey+rosemary concoction (comment for details if you are curious)</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that I wear this under my makeup everyday and it does require me to put powder on more a little often as it can be a tad shiney but MUCH better than most sunscreens.</li>
            <li>Feels smooth,  blends well, but smells a little funky.</li>
            <li>It has little smell, and what it does have just is like a light face cream, completely unoffensive.  </li>
            <li>A little sticky, but overall a great everyday cream.  </li>
            <li>Only real downfall for me is that it’s not water/sweat proof, so not usable for a pool day.</li>
            <li>make me extremely sensitive to the sun.</li>
            <li>This is the only one that I have found that really works.</li>
            <li>(I can go without moisturizer, which keeps my routine simple and fast)   -Therapeutic</li>
            <li>-Has a white cast if I apply too much</li>
            <li>It blends in well and has a natural fragrance that I find pleasing.</li>
            <li>I find it completely unusable.</li>
            <li>and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>purchased it for its purity of the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>many of them are too thick or don&#x27;t absorb well.</li>
            <li>The high zinc content calms my normally red and sensitive skin and it provides just the right amount of moisture to my dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have very pale, sensitive skin (prone to having hot redness with almost every product), and I&#x27;m also pretty vain, so</li>
            <li>Elta MD was originally recommend to me, but after doing some research, found Keys to have about double the active zinc oxide and is moisturizing vs Elta MD being drying (I don’t have acne/oily skin).  </li>
            <li>I live in Chicago, so it is not exactly tropical here nor do we have intense sun</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m constantly on the lookout for new \\&quot;safe\\&quot; sunscreens, but I&#x27;ve stuck to the combination of these two products for 2 years now.</li>
            <li>Keys carries two sunscreens: this \\&quot;Broad Spectrun Sunblock\\&quot; and a \\&quot;Moisturizer/Therapeutic Sunblock.\\&quot; The Broad Spectrum has a 5-star UVA rating, where as the Moisturizer one has a 4-star.  </li>
            <li>I in its ingredient list is that the Broad Spectrum has 18.8% Nano Zinc-Oxide and the Moisturizer has 20%.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not particularly oily, and you don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
            <li>This is one of the only two sunscreens I&#x27;ve known so far that are not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>I also looked different, unnaturally matte, as though the shine and natural color of my face had been covered up.</li>
            <li>And it seems to last nearly all day.</li>
            <li>A natural sunblock that does not make you all white and streaky.</li>
            <li>It is my new daily facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>My main &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; and this really is all about personal preference, is that the lotion is just too heavy.  </li>
            <li>I do have to check for white spots, but in every other way it is just what I was looking for - and it rates very well on the EWG list, too!</li>
            <li>Other reviewers who say it doesn&#x27;t probably put on too much.</li>
            <li>For the record, I have \\&quot;normal\\&quot; skin usually (not dry or oily).  </li>
            <li>this being said, I have not worn it for a long time in direct sunlight, so I don&#x27;t know how it would work for that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not cheap, at $26, but my first bottle lasted from May through October, using it every day.  </li>
            <li>Seems to work well as a sunblock on my face, the pump dispenses too much lotion, if you don&#x27;t press it down all the way it will still keep coming out...</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It is all natural, and scored a 0 for toxicity on EWG&#x27;s Cosmetics Database.&lt;br /&gt;-I can mix some loose mineral foundation powder in with it, and get my sunscreen and makeup applied in one step.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I especially love that I can literally get it in my eyes and it does not hurt at all!  </li>

            <li> A very good sun screen and skin conditioning product.  </li>
            <li> Wonderful protection and great sunblock.</li>
            <li> A Great Product and great service.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen/moisturizer is great</li>
            <li> This has a great rating on EWG&#x27;s website too.  </li>
            <li> Great for my rosacea</li>
            <li> I bought this item for use on my face but it is great as a body cram/block as well.</li>
            <li> This product works great.  </li>
            <li> The popular B and B&#x27;s don&#x27;t make the list at all--convenient but not the best for sun protection.  </li>
            <li> They have a great information on sunscreen products and the regulation by the FDA.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!  </li>
            <li> smell is very nice for a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It applies as though it&#x27;s going to be too zinc-y, but if you let it sit for 30 seconds, it absorbs very nicely.  </li>
            <li> The smell of it is not the best that is for sure</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m very happy with the purchase and plan to buy more.</li>
            <li> This brand is the very best of many I have tried.</li>
            <li> Some people say it smells like pine, but I thought it had a metallic smell that wasn&#x27;t pleasant.    </li>
            <li> The smell is not so good</li>
            <li> I researched this product after a good friend got melanoma</li>
            <li> So if you can get over that, it&#x27;s a good product otherwise.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not greasy, it doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out, seems to soothe my eczema, looks good under make up or alone, doesn&#x27;t have that ghostly look that sometimes this sort of sunscreen can leave.    </li>
            <li> Seems to provide good sun protection.</li>
            <li> To be fair, I have not tried this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Feels good on skin.</li>
            <li> I have been scouring the web and EWG for a good sunscreen with packaging that appeals to men (e.g., my husband).</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> It it great sunscreen, non greasy but provides a great light moisturizer</li>
            <li> Feels a bit greasy (but it&#x27;s better than tacky!)  </li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> It has a nice texture</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It absorbs nicely into the skin.</li>
            <li> I have honestly tried everything to take cover in the sun.  </li>
            <li> I liked it.</li>
            <li> When used as directed, it is effective; however, this is NOT a sunscreen you can put on in order to sun bathe.  </li>
            <li> sunblock now I use a mixture of zinc oxide powder + cocoa powder and it is just effective and doesn&#x27;t make my skin breakout.</li>
            <li> This is the best sunscreen as far as having no carcinogenic ingredients, unlike most brands you see everywhere else!</li>
            <li> Best natural moisturizer I have ever used...does not leave skin greasy and I have oily skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it is truly effective.</li>
            <li> Keys is a great company who really cares about its customers!</li>
            <li> While I am sure it is an extremely safe and effective sunblock, it might not be the best for me as it is relatively dry on the skin.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Also, it blocks the sun better.</li>
            <li> I personally love the smell of this stuff it reminds me of a spa.</li>
            <li> Have purchased this many times.  </li>
            <li> Goes on well (though I blend it with a drop of argan oil) and leaves skin feeling smooth and nice.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff, it does not bother my allergies.</li>
            <li> I am a wildlife volunteer ....and rescue everything from hummingbirds to elephant seals and more etc.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Finally a great moisturizer with high SPF without being toxic!  </li>
            <li> This one was better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all of the top 10 sunscreen rated by EWG and</li>
            <li> this one is my favorite.      </li>
            <li> (Sure, there are \\&quot;safer\\&quot; sunscreen than the Episencial brand, which has an EWG rating of 2...</li>
            <li> I love the texture of Keys Soap-</li>
            <li> -EWG rating of 1, which means it&#x27;s safe   -UVA 4 star rating and 30</li>
            <li> (but I am able to use a darker powder on top if needed)   </li>
            <li> I have tried too many sunscreens to count.  </li>
            <li> I do make sure that I wash my face well at the end of the day so that my pores don&#x27;t get clogged.</li>
            <li> Really nice feel, light no residue.  </li>
            <li> more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used this moisturizer/sunscreen on my face for several years now  with excellent results.  </li>
            <li> Want more information on sun protection products, see skincancer.org.  </li>
            <li> Love that this is a sunscreen moisturizer that I use under makeup for the day.  </li>
            <li> Love the fact it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of chemicals.</li>
            <li> It had been my favorite sunscreen</li>
            <li> This is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I use it every day and have for many years.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t make my face shiny like most sunscreen&#x27;s do.  </li>
            <li> Smells really nice and clean.  </li>
            <li> This is great non-toxic sunblock that is highly rated by the Environmental Working Group (EWG).  </li>
            <li> but as soon as you apply it and it drys the smell magically goes away ...and for a product this fantastic</li>
            <li> It offers a great finish this way with the protection I need.  </li>
            <li> it sure is worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for at least 5 years and I am happy with how it&#x27;s kept my face looking great.</li>
            <li> The smell did take some getting used to; but it fades very quickly.</li>
            <li> to apply and rubs in easily</li>
            <li> pump is easy to use.</li>
            <li> The medicinal scent of this is so strong</li>
            <li> I love that it is able to really moisturizer without being oily:)</li>
            <li> NOT accentuate flaws or fine lines   -NO shimmery or reflective look that some mineral-based makeups have   -Some ability to balance the look of my skin tone</li>
            <li> Very clean, nice smell that I have been complimented a couple of times, not excessively.</li>
            <li> sunscreen is great for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;-The</li>
            <li> It rubs in great and doesn&#x27;t leave any white residue.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic cream</li>
            <li> NO breakouts, spots, bumps, or pimples for me   -100% chemical free</li>
            <li> Goes on light and protects.</li>
            <li> Loved the all natural ingredients of Keys products.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that it does not feel greasy and after applying, it feels comfortable.</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t need to buy a daytime moisturizer plus a sunblock, this is well worth the price!</li>
            <li> If I need more sun protection, I just layer more on top couple hours later...</li>
            <li> In addition, they said they would also take my original shipping fee out of my refund.  </li>
            <li> this sunblock lotion is easy to apply and it&#x27;s absorbed well.</li>
            <li> My favorite sunscreen (along with tinted Sunsi&#x27;belle) non-toxic, effective, no white residue, works under powder bleach or mineral foundation.</li>
            <li> You get full UV protection here.</li>
            <li> I have had good luck with it and will continue to use it as a facial sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Although I appreciate that Solar Keys used good quality ingredients in this sunblock and no preservatives or synthetic chemicals, all those oils and waxes are simply not going to work on clog-prone</li>
            <li> you are looking for other all-natural products, Keys has a great line of lotions and whatnot, too.</li>
            <li> the smell is “nature” like, but goes away quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that breaks out easily and also gets irritated easily.  </li>
            <li> It feels utterly smooth on my rosacea in the hot sun</li>
            <li> It feels light and very easy to blend in--just like a like face cream without that creamy, Greek-yogurt texture that just sits on your skin leaving a greasy white film.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is made with natural ingredients!</li>
            <li> Physical sunscreen  Rated 0 by Environmental Working Group   Doesn&#x27;t leave a tacky or chalky residue  Smooth and easy to apply  Sets fine under some mineral makeup  </li>
            <li> The shea butter is very moisturizing and helped with the fine lines around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product has been effective enough that sometimes I purposely DON&#x27;T wear it, just so my face gets a bit of color.  </li>
            <li> IT GETS BETTER: I have really sensitive skin (redhead)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m golden.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many natural sunscreen lotions.</li>
            <li> I feel it is worth it, but I do wish it cost less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then I contacted the seller, Fresh Bontanica, to return the item.  </li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this product after thoroughly reading so many positive reviews about it.</li>
            <li> --it&#x27;s rated very high against sun rays, it blends beautifully with a much lighter feel on the skin acting really like a primer.</li>
            <li> It adds a bit of moisture (not grease or oil or heavy-feeling) to the skin, so for me with my combination skin, I can use my normal lightly moisturizing serum and then follow with this</li>
            <li> Some say that it only gets absorbed into the top layer of skin and doesn&#x27;t really do any damage (and it is better than chemical sunscreens for sure because they go into the bloodstream), but there are other products</li>
            <li> -Cost is a bit high, but one container lasts six months   -SPF isn&#x27;t as high as I&#x27;d like, but from the studies I&#x27;ve read, higher doesn&#x27;t protect better</li>
            <li> this works great and is healthier to use than most sunscreens but it is too expensive.</li>
            <li> This one is only slightly white going on, which is a great improvement over some of the mineral sunscreens I have tried.  </li>
            <li> many of them just really don&#x27;t do the job blocking the rays and that&#x27;s the real point of it all, and this brand was highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to find a sunblock to protect my new tattoo, and did a bunch of research on this one.</li>
            <li> Also, driven home in a converrtible w/ top down, and was fine.</li>
            <li> I have tried sooooo many products for sunscreen on my face and each one would just aggravate my rosacea or simply break out my face.  </li>
            <li> And the EWG gave this their independent  top of the line rating for sunblocks too that anyone can see for themselves .</li>
            <li> For many years Keys Solar Rx has served double duty as my daytime moisturizer and my sunblock.</li>
            <li> I love this facial cream.</li>
            <li> The only notable difference</li>
            <li> when I first apply it   -Looks</li>
            <li> No ill effects from the sun.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell initially but really love</li>
            <li> ok, i actually don&#x27;t know if it works yet</li>
            <li> This smells interesting and i will have to see if i burn or not later in summer.</li>
            <li> Since I ordered a 3rd, I was obviously satisfied with my first two bottles.  </li>
            <li> extremely sensitive skin loves this product!!!!</li>
            <li> My pediatrician recommended I look at ewg.org (the Environmental Working Group) which, every year, rates pretty much all sunscreens based on safety.  </li>
            <li> Last summer, I got serious about figuring out what the best sunscreen for my family would be.  </li>
            <li> For me though, with my dry skin, an oilier sunblock like Sunology or Soleo is better.</li>
            <li> My face feels nice and soft all day long until I wash it at night.  </li>
            <li> For me, it has the added benefit of evening out my skin tone (if you&#x27;re a person of color, it&#x27;s almost certainly going to look chalky on you).</li>
            <li> Certain antibiotics</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and love it!</li>
            <li> The other is a Chinese brand \\&quot;Jia Xue\\&quot; which feels just like normal milky lotion, cool and very refreshing, but is probably chemical.</li>
            <li> She really likes the ease of use...</li>
            <li> This stuff has not broken me out at all ever</li>
            <li> It still has a zinc oxide smell, and there isn&#x27;t much of a way around that.</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s really 30 SPF.</li>
            <li> It smells very earthy, like dirt and rosemary.</li>
            <li> Price seems reasonable-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used both and haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference between the two in terms of performance or product quality.     </li>
            <li> it is very moisturizing but not greasy and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out.</li>
            <li> It really does blend in well with no chalkiness or skin color change noted.  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t give him too much of a &amp;#34;white face.&amp;#34; I hope that this sunscreen will make him use his sunscreen</li>
            <li> I discovered this product through the EWG Skin deep website which recommended it as being free of harmful chemicals.  </li>
            <li> , we haven&#x27;t had a really sunny day here yet.  </li>
            <li> You can no longer see how much product is remaining in the bottle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and it&#x27;s not too thick like most of the healthier sunscreens I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> For all the high scoring sunscreens, I came to amazon, read consumer reviews (to see if people liked the texture, not greasy, didn&#x27;t leave a pale ghostly look) and checked out prices.  </li>
            <li> There is a film more or less after you apply it</li>
            <li> Being so highly rated in the (EMC) tests and here on Amazon, I bought this and have been using it for a week.</li>
            <li> Not waterproof  High price  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this sunblock since it is highly rated on EWG.org.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> The ingredient itself may not be bad, but I have read too many times to avoid nano particles because they get absorbed into the skin rather than just sitting on top of it.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a non-chemical sunscreen that is safe and effective, but doesn&#x27;t make my face look or feel weird, to use on a daily basis underneath makeup.</li>
            <li> Thus far it&#x27;s been working very well for sun protection.</li>
            <li> I expected it to feel light (like Obagi NuDerm SPF 35).</li>
            <li> Keys Solar is not only one of the safest sunscreens on the market per the Safer Cosmetics web site but it does not leave a white film on the skin as so many of the natural ones do</li>
            <li> I am 62, and used to have oily skin, but skin is normal now.  </li>
            <li> As an aging woman living in a dry southwestern climate, I am delighted with it, but it would be too heavy for, say, Austin, TX.  </li>
            <li> This product is new to me.</li>
            <li> In fact, this is the only sunscreen I&#x27;ve consistently worn under my makeup.</li>
            <li> But this time it came from a different Amazon seller than the first two bottles.  </li>
            <li> (&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two weeks after stopping use and being really diligent with hot water compresses and a honey+rosemary concoction (comment for details if you are curious)</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I wear this under my makeup everyday and it does require me to put powder on more a little often as it can be a tad shiney but MUCH better than most sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Feels smooth,  blends well, but smells a little funky.</li>
            <li> It has little smell, and what it does have just is like a light face cream, completely unoffensive.  </li>
            <li> A little sticky, but overall a great everyday cream.  </li>
            <li> Only real downfall for me is that it’s not water/sweat proof, so not usable for a pool day.</li>
            <li> make me extremely sensitive to the sun.</li>
            <li> This is the only one that I have found that really works.</li>
            <li> (I can go without moisturizer, which keeps my routine simple and fast)   -Therapeutic</li>
            <li> -Has a white cast if I apply too much</li>
            <li> It blends in well and has a natural fragrance that I find pleasing.</li>
            <li> I find it completely unusable.</li>
            <li> and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> purchased it for its purity of the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> many of them are too thick or don&#x27;t absorb well.</li>
            <li> The high zinc content calms my normally red and sensitive skin and it provides just the right amount of moisture to my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have very pale, sensitive skin (prone to having hot redness with almost every product), and I&#x27;m also pretty vain, so</li>
            <li> Elta MD was originally recommend to me, but after doing some research, found Keys to have about double the active zinc oxide and is moisturizing vs Elta MD being drying (I don’t have acne/oily skin).  </li>
            <li> I live in Chicago, so it is not exactly tropical here nor do we have intense sun</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m constantly on the lookout for new \\&quot;safe\\&quot; sunscreens, but I&#x27;ve stuck to the combination of these two products for 2 years now.</li>
            <li> Keys carries two sunscreens: this \\&quot;Broad Spectrun Sunblock\\&quot; and a \\&quot;Moisturizer/Therapeutic Sunblock.\\&quot; The Broad Spectrum has a 5-star UVA rating, where as the Moisturizer one has a 4-star.  </li>
            <li> I in its ingredient list is that the Broad Spectrum has 18.8% Nano Zinc-Oxide and the Moisturizer has 20%.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not particularly oily, and you don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
            <li> This is one of the only two sunscreens I&#x27;ve known so far that are not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I also looked different, unnaturally matte, as though the shine and natural color of my face had been covered up.</li>
            <li> And it seems to last nearly all day.</li>
            <li> A natural sunblock that does not make you all white and streaky.</li>
            <li> It is my new daily facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My main &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; and this really is all about personal preference, is that the lotion is just too heavy.  </li>
            <li> I do have to check for white spots, but in every other way it is just what I was looking for - and it rates very well on the EWG list, too!</li>
            <li> Other reviewers who say it doesn&#x27;t probably put on too much.</li>
            <li> For the record, I have \\&quot;normal\\&quot; skin usually (not dry or oily).  </li>
            <li> this being said, I have not worn it for a long time in direct sunlight, so I don&#x27;t know how it would work for that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap, at $26, but my first bottle lasted from May through October, using it every day.  </li>
            <li> Seems to work well as a sunblock on my face, the pump dispenses too much lotion, if you don&#x27;t press it down all the way it will still keep coming out...</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It is all natural, and scored a 0 for toxicity on EWG&#x27;s Cosmetics Database.&lt;br /&gt;-I can mix some loose mineral foundation powder in with it, and get my sunscreen and makeup applied in one step.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to live in North Carolina, and now live in Egypt, so I have exposure to serious sun conditions.  </li>
            <li> There are no broad spectrum sunscreens rated zero on EWG as of today.</li>
            <li> I &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; it all day long on my skin and to me, it makes my skin look greasy.  </li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s minor.  </li>
            <li> Other reviewers noted the scent: personally, I think it smells like citrus and pencil shavings!</li>
            <li> it lasts a very long time if you are just using it for your face.  </li>
            <li> My face never feels dry throughout the day.</li>
            <li> that said, it can still be slightly heavy, but it is the best I have found that is not loaded with terrible chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I know that I SHOULD wear sunblock every single day.  </li>
            <li> It dries well, but don&#x27;t try wearing any dark clothes or you&#x27;ll have white all over them.</li>
            <li> The first time I applied it, I was almost nauseated by the smell and immediately washed my face.  </li>
            <li> I should charge this company for my dry cleaning!    </li>
            <li> I prefer the slight stickiness to some of the facial sunscreens that I have tried that are dryer like Skintegrity.  </li>
            <li> nano zinc-oxide (20%), shea butter (10%), avocado oil, carrot seed oil, black cumin oil, essential oil blend, purified water, vegetable glycerin, vegetable wax, and rosemary extract.   </li>
            <li> Though in my review of other broad spectrum sun screen products, it has fewer ingredients and appears to be less harmful than other like products.</li>
            <li> It is moisturizing and does not leave a white residue, but it can be a little shiny if worn under foundation that is also moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This one is different in that its texture is denser and not smooth, not like lotion.</li>
            <li> I do know that the company does not recommend it for sunbathing or trips to the beach, and they recommend reapplying every few hours--but only if you&#x27;re outdoors.</li>
            <li> I did not burn while wearing it, even on days I spent a lot of time in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;-Easy</li>
            <li> I know, nothing artificial or complicated, just good simple ingredients.</li>
            <li> I will say that a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, I expect to get 6 or so months out of one container.</li>
            <li> Nothing--not the high-end, not the drugstore, not any of the other \\&quot;green\\&quot; sunscreens can compare.  </li>
            <li> Shelf life is ~2 years  Non-comedogenic: I&#x27;m extremely acne-prone but this product has not caused breakouts      Cons:  </li>
            <li> Other things to note:    </li>
            <li> Recommended over all other sunblock for the face including Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Most sunscreen packaging look ugly, medicinal, childish, or girlish.</li>
            <li> , I’d say the redness was cut down by</li>
            <li> Slightly airbrushed.  </li>
            <li> It was initially difficult to rub in, but then after about a half a minute my skin would suddenly absorb it, and it didn&#x27;t make my face ghostly white.</li>
            <li> Other natural sunscreens have been very difficult to rub in, and/or have left my face with a whitish pallor.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t get myself to use this product all over my body because of the high price.  </li>
            <li> A little goes along way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I almost can&#x27;t tell that I&#x27;m wearing it, except that it seems to give a little even-ness to my complexion, almost like wearing a little dusting of mineral make-up.  </li>
            <li> It’s a little on the greasy side.</li>
            <li> I would like to believe that it is all natural, given the scary price.</li>
            <li> I use this product year round during the day.</li>
            <li> Heavy sweating will cause the product to run.</li>
            <li> I have had sooo much trouble finding a sunscreen to use on my face</li>
            <li> I have been using this sunscreen for a few years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It feels heavy.</li>
            <li> ~80%- I no longer feel my face get red/hot when embarrassed, or any other of the common triggers.  </li>
            <li> However, it did leave my face feeling pasty and stiff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a strong smell either.</li>
            <li> Only thing is it has a weird smell.</li>
            <li> To top it all off, I started to worry about all the nasty things I was putting on my skin.  </li>
            <li> A bit thick to apply for everyday moisturizer</li>
            <li> The ingredients list is small and made of stuff</li>
            <li> I was skeptical non-sun worshiper, meaning low exposure, that is now having AK cells (precancerous) treated.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it DID ghost me (made me look like I was wearing white powder) and it caused me to break out in hives and itch.</li>
            <li> Sun exposure seemed to \\&quot;melt\\&quot; the sunblock to turn it excessively shiny.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seems a little less than that, but maybe I spread it thin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thick and hard to get out of the container.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, even in Egypt, my face stays very pale.  </li>
            <li> I gave it only 2 stars since I was disappointed in how heavy this lotion felt on my face and the odd herbal</li>
            <li> and I hope there would not be any negative effect after using.</li>
            <li> Total disappointment for these reasons:    </li>
            <li> To me, it&#x27;s important that the smell of the sunscreen isn&#x27;t overpowering and that the texture isn&#x27;t awfully tacky, chalky, or thick.  </li>
            <li> It is expensive, but given the fact that there is not much out there given my expectations</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and nourishing.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen goes on thick but soon blends into my skin and stays put for hours.  </li>
            <li> I tried putting makeup on over it, but it&#x27;s too thick.</li>
            <li> Other sunblocks were useless.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a subtle smell that dissipates after a while.     </li>
            <li> but that is because it is not made of of lots of harmful chemicals bad for you that mask the odor (that is why this is the only product you can get in your eyes without any problems!)</li>
            <li> For me, not a good product.</li>
            <li> (the zinc hides some discoloration)  - Shea butter base, which has a comedomicity rating of 0, and is natural  CONS:    </li>
            <li> What wasn&#x27;t minor was the terribly offensive odor in this third bottle.  </li>
            <li> For my kids, I buy California Baby, as it&#x27;s less expensive, and they&#x27;re not so vain!  </li>
            <li> how thinly you try to apply it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the common name brands from the drugstore, and they either didn&#x27;t work, or smelled horrible, or were so thick and gummy that I practically took my skin off trying to rub them in (and they still looked white).  </li>
            <li> And then there was the itchy feeling, or the \\&quot;hot\\&quot; feeling, or the gluey feeling as they sat there all day (or ran into my eyes).  </li>
            <li> The smell is also not great.</li>
            <li> They do not stand behind their product.</li>
            <li> So sad to have to give this report.  </li>
            <li> I was so wrong.</li>
            <li> When my face sweat, it felt like my skin was suffocating and</li>
            <li> Too bad it&#x27;s so expensive.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t mind earthy smells, this one made me feel dirty, like I needed to wash my face.</li>
            <li> it is very expensive.</li>
            <li> This smelled so bad, I immediately threw it out.</li>
            <li> I waited about a week and tried it again, but I still HATED the smell.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s given a 0 rating--meaning it doesn&#x27;t have all the nasty chemicals in it that we&#x27;re supposed to worry about.  </li>
            <li> The product smells so terrible, I had to return it.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The smell is not so good and I hope there would not be any negative effect after using.</li>
            <li> This is great non-toxic sunblock that is highly rated by the Environmental Working Group (EWG).  It is moisturizing and does not leave a white residue, but it can be a little shiny if worn under foundation that is also moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to find a sunblock to protect my new tattoo, and did a bunch of research on this one. Being so highly rated in the (EMC) tests and here on Amazon, I bought this and have been using it for a week. Total disappointment for these reasons:    1_ It&#x27;s chalky no matter how thinly you try to apply it. It dries well, but don&#x27;t try wearing any dark clothes or you&#x27;ll have white all over them. I should charge this company for my dry cleaning!    2_ Some people say it smells like pine, but I thought it had a metallic smell that wasn&#x27;t pleasant.    For me, not a good product.</li>
            <li> Keys Solar is not only one of the safest sunscreens on the market per the Safer Cosmetics web site but it does not leave a white film on the skin as so many of the natural ones do and you can use it under your make up if you wear make up. I researched this product after a good friend got melanoma and I bought it for myself and for her. She really likes the ease of use...A Great Product and great service.</li>
            <li> Works well and I like that it is non-toxic. Only thing is it has a weird smell. It smells like rotting apricots! So if you can get over that, it&#x27;s a good product otherwise.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  My second order.</li>
            <li> This is one of the only two sunscreens I&#x27;ve known so far that are not greasy at all. The other is a Chinese brand \\&quot;Jia Xue\\&quot; which feels just like normal milky lotion, cool and very refreshing, but is probably chemical. This one is different in that its texture is denser and not smooth, not like lotion. It&#x27;s true that it does not feel greasy and after applying, it feels comfortable. I would like to believe that it is all natural, given the scary price. I suggest patting it on instead of smearing.</li>
            <li> I used to live in North Carolina, and now live in Egypt, so I have exposure to serious sun conditions.  This product has been effective enough that sometimes I purposely DON&#x27;T wear it, just so my face gets a bit of color.  Otherwise, even in Egypt, my face stays very pale.  However, I have not tried this product under sports/sweaty conditions.  Last summer, I got serious about figuring out what the best sunscreen for my family would be.  My pediatrician recommended I look at ewg.org (the Environmental Working Group) which, every year, rates pretty much all sunscreens based on safety.  I found that the brand I was using (eucerin) as well as a lot of sunscreens marketed for children (Aveeno, for example) had low ratings for safety, because of concerns about the chemical sun barriers.  I looked at all the highest scoring ones, which score well because they block the sun&#x27;s rays using a physical barrier like zinc or titanium, rather than chemical barriers.  I worry about using the chemical ones every day, and especially for my babes.  For all the high scoring sunscreens, I came to amazon, read consumer reviews (to see if people liked the texture, not greasy, didn&#x27;t leave a pale ghostly look) and checked out prices.  Result: I bought Key&#x27;s Solar RX for my face.  It has a nice texture, it&#x27;s not greasy, it doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out, seems to soothe my eczema, looks good under make up or alone, doesn&#x27;t have that ghostly look that sometimes this sort of sunscreen can leave.    It&#x27;s not cheap, at $26, but my first bottle lasted from May through October, using it every day.  I am on my second bottle now.  For my kids, I buy California Baby, as it&#x27;s less expensive, and they&#x27;re not so vain!  I also use the Cali Baby on my shoulders, but it&#x27;s too greasy and leave the ghostly look on my face.</li>
            <li> This is the best sunscreen as far as having no carcinogenic ingredients, unlike most brands you see everywhere else! Also, it blocks the sun better. You get full UV protection here. There was a study done on the effectiveness of sunscreens and this ranked #1 out of hundreds of brands! I personally love the smell of this stuff it reminds me of a spa. Very clean, nice smell that I have been complimented a couple of times, not excessively. It&#x27;s not a strong smell either. My only complaint is that I wear this under my makeup everyday and it does require me to put powder on more a little often as it can be a tad shiney but MUCH better than most sunscreens. In fact, this is the only sunscreen I&#x27;ve consistently worn under my makeup. IT GETS BETTER: I have really sensitive skin (redhead) that is acne-prone if not plagued. This stuff has not broken me out at all ever and this is my third bottle. I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> Have purchased this many times.  Goes on well (though I blend it with a drop of argan oil) and leaves skin feeling smooth and nice.  A little sticky, but overall a great everyday cream.  Seems to provide good sun protection.</li>
            <li> To be fair, I have not tried this sunscreen. I have decided against it because it states that there are uncoated nano-sized zinc particles in it. The ingredient itself may not be bad, but I have read too many times to avoid nano particles because they get absorbed into the skin rather than just sitting on top of it. Some say that it only gets absorbed into the top layer of skin and doesn&#x27;t really do any damage (and it is better than chemical sunscreens for sure because they go into the bloodstream), but there are other products so why take the chance on a possible health risk?</li>
            <li> I have been using this sunscreen for a couple weeks now. I do not spend a lot of time out in the sun, but wanted something to put on my face for daily wear to protect it. I get melasma on my forehead if I don&#x27;t put on sunscreen. I live in Chicago, so it is not exactly tropical here nor do we have intense sun rays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sunscreen is great for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;-The smell is very nice for a sunscreen. It still has a zinc oxide smell, and there isn&#x27;t much of a way around that. But it has a citrusy sort of smell, too.&lt;br /&gt;-It is all natural, and scored a 0 for toxicity on EWG&#x27;s Cosmetics Database.&lt;br /&gt;-I can mix some loose mineral foundation powder in with it, and get my sunscreen and makeup applied in one step.&lt;br /&gt;-It absorbs nicely into the skin. Other reviewers who say it doesn&#x27;t probably put on too much. A little goes along way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All this being said, I have not worn it for a long time in direct sunlight, so I don&#x27;t know how it would work for that. I do know that the company does not recommend it for sunbathing or trips to the beach, and they recommend reapplying every few hours--but only if you&#x27;re outdoors. I just put it on once a day since I&#x27;m not out a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for other all-natural products, Keys has a great line of lotions and whatnot, too. They are pricey, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I have tried sooooo many products for sunscreen on my face and each one would just aggravate my rosacea or simply break out my face.  This one is different!  It feels utterly smooth on my rosacea in the hot sun AND it gives me to SPF I need to keep the rosacea from flaring up.  Finally, I have searched for years!!!!  If you have rosacea, try this!!!  You will be amazed!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, it does not bother my allergies.</li>
            <li> I am a wildlife volunteer ....and rescue everything from hummingbirds to elephant seals and more etc.&lt;br /&gt;I use Retin A on my face and this is the ONLY sunblock that actually protects my skin and does NOT leave me with a red face at the end of the day! I especially love that I can literally get it in my eyes and it does not hurt at all!  And the EWG gave this their independent  top of the line rating for sunblocks too that anyone can see for themselves . The smell of it is not the best that is for sure but that is because it is not made of of lots of harmful chemicals bad for you that mask the odor (that is why this is the only product you can get in your eyes without any problems!) but as soon as you apply it and it drys the smell magically goes away ...and for a product this fantastic it sure is worth it!</li>
            <li> Works greats but smells like medicine.</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer.  My face feels nice and soft all day long until I wash it at night.  It rubs in great and doesn&#x27;t leave any white residue.  My face is oily and this doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I have honestly tried everything to take cover in the sun.  I have very pale, sensitive skin (prone to having hot redness with almost every product), and I&#x27;m also pretty vain, so I know that I SHOULD wear sunblock every single day.  I&#x27;ve tried all the common name brands from the drugstore, and they either didn&#x27;t work, or smelled horrible, or were so thick and gummy that I practically took my skin off trying to rub them in (and they still looked white).  And then there was the itchy feeling, or the \\&quot;hot\\&quot; feeling, or the gluey feeling as they sat there all day (or ran into my eyes).  To top it all off, I started to worry about all the nasty things I was putting on my skin.  But now I&#x27;ve found Keys and there&#x27;s no going back!  It&#x27;s given a 0 rating--meaning it doesn&#x27;t have all the nasty chemicals in it that we&#x27;re supposed to worry about.  It has little smell, and what it does have just is like a light face cream, completely unoffensive.  Doesn&#x27;t make my face hot/red/itchy.  And it has the best texture.  It feels light and very easy to blend in--just like a like face cream without that creamy, Greek-yogurt texture that just sits on your skin leaving a greasy white film.  I almost can&#x27;t tell that I&#x27;m wearing it, except that it seems to give a little even-ness to my complexion, almost like wearing a little dusting of mineral make-up.  Slightly airbrushed.  But I don&#x27;t think that would turn off a guy from using it.  It adds a bit of moisture (not grease or oil or heavy-feeling) to the skin, so for me with my combination skin, I can use my normal lightly moisturizing serum and then follow with this and I&#x27;m golden.  And no feeling like you&#x27;ve layered a bunch of wax on your face either.  Nothing--not the high-end, not the drugstore, not any of the other \\&quot;green\\&quot; sunscreens can compare.  I am a life-long devotee.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many natural sunscreen lotions. many of them are too thick or don&#x27;t absorb well. this sunblock lotion is easy to apply and it&#x27;s absorbed well. i&#x27;m very happy with the purchase and plan to buy more.</li>
            <li> I have been using this suncream for 5 years</li>
            <li> This sunscreen/moisturizer is great</li>
            <li> Feels smooth,  blends well, but smells a little funky.</li>
            <li> I mix this sunblock with my foundation (Laura Mercier)  It offers a great finish this way with the protection I need.  Love it.</li>
            <li> For many years Keys Solar Rx has served double duty as my daytime moisturizer and my sunblock. My skin loves it and it works for me, my husband, daughter, my mom &amp; my brother and his children. Makeup goes on quite well over it too. I use this product year round during the day. The Luminous moisturizer in the product is wonderful. Since I don&#x27;t need to buy a daytime moisturizer plus a sunblock, this is well worth the price! I love the fact that it is made with natural ingredients! Keys is a great company who really cares about its customers!</li>
            <li> Finally a great moisturizer with high SPF without being toxic!  This has a great rating on EWG&#x27;s website too.  Bottle lasts a while but I wish you got a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> A bit thick to apply for everyday moisturizer but I do like the ingredients.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both use this on our faces. He loves it because it doesn&#x27;t burn his eyes. For me, it has the added benefit of evening out my skin tone (if you&#x27;re a person of color, it&#x27;s almost certainly going to look chalky on you). It&#x27;s not particularly oily, and you don&#x27;t need to use much. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s really 30 SPF. Seems a little less than that, but maybe I spread it thin.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a non-chemical sunscreen that is safe and effective, but doesn&#x27;t make my face look or feel weird, to use on a daily basis underneath makeup. This product unfortunately isn&#x27;t it, although it is better than others I have tried. Other natural sunscreens have been very difficult to rub in, and/or have left my face with a whitish pallor. This one was better. It was initially difficult to rub in, but then after about a half a minute my skin would suddenly absorb it, and it didn&#x27;t make my face ghostly white. However, it did leave my face feeling pasty and stiff. I also looked different, unnaturally matte, as though the shine and natural color of my face had been covered up. It wasn&#x27;t flattering, and layering makeup over it didn&#x27;t help.     The smell is also not great. It smells very earthy, like dirt and rosemary. While I don&#x27;t mind earthy smells, this one made me feel dirty, like I needed to wash my face. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for daily use.</li>
            <li> Wonderful protection and great sunblock.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!  Great for my rosacea, I’d say the redness was cut down by ~80%- I no longer feel my face get red/hot when embarrassed, or any other of the common triggers.  Elta MD was originally recommend to me, but after doing some research, found Keys to have about double the active zinc oxide and is moisturizing vs Elta MD being drying (I don’t have acne/oily skin).  I wear this every day as my after face wash moisturizer, even if I know I won’t be in the sun- the smell is “nature” like, but goes away quickly.  Price seems reasonable- it lasts a very long time if you are just using it for your face.  Only real downfall for me is that it’s not water/sweat proof, so not usable for a pool day.</li>
            <li> this works great and is healthier to use than most sunscreens but it is too expensive.</li>
            <li> I love this facial cream. It&#x27;s thick and nourishing. If you don&#x27;t like the feeling of moisturizer on your face, you won&#x27;t like this one. I think it&#x27;s feels great! My face never feels dry throughout the day. I&#x27;ve been using this for at least 5 years and I am happy with how it&#x27;s kept my face looking great. The ingredients list is small and made of stuff I know, nothing artificial or complicated, just good simple ingredients. The sunblock works immediately so you can apply and go. I wear foundation as well and have never had any issues. I apply my foundation within 5 minutes of this lotion.</li>
            <li> Fantastic cream no chemicals!</li>
            <li> This is the best sunblock I have ever found. Certain antibiotics I have been on for Lyme disease make me extremely sensitive to the sun. Other sunblocks were useless. This is the only one that I have found that really works. And it seems to last nearly all day.</li>
            <li> A very good sun screen and skin conditioning product.  The product contains no known cancer producing ingredients.  Can be used as a zinc oxide lotion.  One disadvantage of the product is that it is not water resistant.  Heavy sweating will cause the product to run.</li>
            <li> To me, it&#x27;s important that the smell of the sunscreen isn&#x27;t overpowering and that the texture isn&#x27;t awfully tacky, chalky, or thick.  I&#x27;ve tried all of the top 10 sunscreen rated by EWG and this one is my favorite.      Pros:   Physical sunscreen  Rated 0 by Environmental Working Group   Doesn&#x27;t leave a tacky or chalky residue  Smooth and easy to apply  Sets fine under some mineral makeup  Doesn&#x27;t start running as milky beads when I sweat (however, it is not waterproof)  Non-messy pump dispenser  Shelf life is ~2 years  Non-comedogenic: I&#x27;m extremely acne-prone but this product has not caused breakouts      Cons:  Feels a bit greasy (but it&#x27;s better than tacky!)  Not waterproof  High price  Pump dispenser: can&#x27;t get every last drop      Other things to note:    Other reviewers noted the scent: personally, I think it smells like citrus and pencil shavings! It&#x27;s a subtle smell that dissipates after a while.     Keys carries two sunscreens: this \\&quot;Broad Spectrun Sunblock\\&quot; and a \\&quot;Moisturizer/Therapeutic Sunblock.\\&quot; The Broad Spectrum has a 5-star UVA rating, where as the Moisturizer one has a 4-star.  The only notable difference I in its ingredient list is that the Broad Spectrum has 18.8% Nano Zinc-Oxide and the Moisturizer has 20%.  I&#x27;ve used both and haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference between the two in terms of performance or product quality.     Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t get myself to use this product all over my body because of the high price.  I use this product on my face and chest area and Episencial Sunny Sunscreen on the rest of my body. (Sure, there are \\&quot;safer\\&quot; sunscreen than the Episencial brand, which has an EWG rating of 2... but I can&#x27;t stand the smell and/or texture of them...)  I&#x27;m constantly on the lookout for new \\&quot;safe\\&quot; sunscreens, but I&#x27;ve stuck to the combination of these two products for 2 years now.</li>
            <li> I had been using Keys Soap sunscreen but was scared off by the nano particles issue. I started using Marie Veronique&#x27; sunscreen, but did not like the texture of it at all and my skin broke out after using it-plus it is very expensive. After further research about nano particles I am convinced that it isn&#x27;t a concern and I am back. I love the texture of Keys Soap- it is very moisturizing but not greasy and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin break out. This brand is the very best of many I have tried.</li>
            <li> I have tried several non-toxic face sunscreens.  This one is only slightly white going on, which is a great improvement over some of the mineral sunscreens I have tried.  It is a bit sticky, but I add a drop of mattifying primer as a cure to the stickiness.  You can also dust with powder.  I prefer the slight stickiness to some of the facial sunscreens that I have tried that are dryer like Skintegrity.  I felt like I had spackle on my face.  I just purchased my second bottle.</li>
            <li> Does not cause breakouts. Feels good on skin. Recommended over all other sunblock for the face including Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every sunscreen out there, and I keep coming back to this one.  PROS:    -Simple Ingredient list: nano zinc-oxide (20%), shea butter (10%), avocado oil, carrot seed oil, black cumin oil, essential oil blend, purified water, vegetable glycerin, vegetable wax, and rosemary extract.   -100% vegan   -EWG rating of 1, which means it&#x27;s safe   -UVA 4 star rating and 30+ SPF (UVA and UVB protection)   -Moisturizing (I can go without moisturizer, which keeps my routine simple and fast)   -Therapeutic (think zinc for diaper rash: calms any irritation that I may have from peels or rosacea)   -Causes NO breakouts, spots, bumps, or pimples for me   -100% chemical free; chemical-based sunscreens sting and irritate my rosacea-prone skin   -Does NOT accentuate flaws or fine lines   -NO shimmery or reflective look that some mineral-based makeups have   -Some ability to balance the look of my skin tone (the zinc hides some discoloration)  - Shea butter base, which has a comedomicity rating of 0, and is natural  CONS:    -Feels greasy when I first apply it   -Looks shiny (I have to apply powder to set it)   -It will rub off if I don&#x27;t set it with powder   -Has a white cast if I apply too much (but I am able to use a darker powder on top if needed)   -Cost is a bit high, but one container lasts six months   -SPF isn&#x27;t as high as I&#x27;d like, but from the studies I&#x27;ve read, higher doesn&#x27;t protect better</li>
            <li> Best natural moisturizer I have ever used...does not leave skin greasy and I have oily skin.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful item. A natural sunblock that does not make you all white and streaky. It blends in well and has a natural fragrance that I find pleasing. I bought this item for use on my face but it is great as a body cram/block as well. I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thick and hard to get out of the container.  Other than that I liked it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and it&#x27;s not too thick like most of the healthier sunscreens I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve made return purchases and I recommend this to all my friends. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Only sunscreen I use every day on my face!</li>
            <li> I have tried too many sunscreens to count.  I have very sensitive skin that breaks out easily and also gets irritated easily.  I have had sooo much trouble finding a sunscreen to use on my face that wasn&#x27;t too greasy or made me look chalk white, not to mention cause irritation or a break out.  This product works great.  It is expensive, but given the fact that there is not much out there given my expectations I feel it is worth it, but I do wish it cost less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that said, it can still be slightly heavy, but it is the best I have found that is not loaded with terrible chemicals.  I do make sure that I wash my face well at the end of the day so that my pores don&#x27;t get clogged.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it is truly effective. I have a sun allergy, and last weekend I was out in the sun all day. Slathered my face with Keys and next day, all was well. No ill effects from the sun. Also, driven home in a converrtible w/ top down, and was fine.</li>
            <li> The medicinal scent of this is so strong I find it completely unusable.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this after reading cancer society/government recommendations about sunscreens...many of them just really don&#x27;t do the job blocking the rays and that&#x27;s the real point of it all, and this brand was highly recommended. The popular B and B&#x27;s don&#x27;t make the list at all--convenient but not the best for sun protection.  Living in FL sunscreen is a priority for me.  I will say that a little goes a long way.  It really does blend in well with no chalkiness or skin color change noted.  My main &amp;#34;complaint&amp;#34; and this really is all about personal preference, is that the lotion is just too heavy.  I &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; it all day long on my skin and to me, it makes my skin look greasy.  I am not one of the &amp;#34;dewey&amp;#34; look fans, so others may like it skipping the need for any moisturizer  I am 62, and used to have oily skin, but skin is normal now.  I will go back to solarscience md. --it&#x27;s rated very high against sun rays, it blends beautifully with a much lighter feel on the skin acting really like a primer.</li>
            <li> The best moisturizer with sunscreen I have ever used. I love that it is able to really moisturizer without being oily:)</li>
            <li> Really nice feel, light no residue.  Smells really nice and clean.  No problems with allergies and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell initially but really love it.&lt;br /&gt;face doesn&#x27;t get oily even after walking outside under the sun for hrs.&lt;br /&gt;my extremely sensitive skin loves this product!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been scouring the web and EWG for a good sunscreen with packaging that appeals to men (e.g., my husband). Most sunscreen packaging look ugly, medicinal, childish, or girlish. This one my husband is not embarrassed to bring to the gym. It also doesn&#x27;t give him too much of a &amp;#34;white face.&amp;#34; I hope that this sunscreen will make him use his sunscreen more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 star off for being nano.</li>
            <li> I have used this moisturizer/sunscreen on my face for several years now  with excellent results.  When used as directed, it is effective; however, this is NOT a sunscreen you can put on in order to sun bathe.  Solar Rx must be reapplied if you plan to spend a lot of time in the sun and/or go swimming or perspire a lot.  I discovered this product through the EWG Skin deep website which recommended it as being free of harmful chemicals.  I have had good luck with it and will continue to use it as a facial sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This smelled so bad, I immediately threw it out.</li>
            <li> EWG.org/skindeep  rates this product 1. It contains two ingredients of concern. Though in my review of other broad spectrum sun screen products, it has fewer ingredients and appears to be less harmful than other like products. There are no broad spectrum sunscreens rated zero on EWG as of today. Want more information on sun protection products, see skincancer.org.  They have a great information on sunscreen products and the regulation by the FDA.  Dont delay to educate youself.  I was skeptical non-sun worshiper, meaning low exposure, that is now having AK cells (precancerous) treated. Never thought it would happen to me!</li>
            <li> This product is new to me. I do like the texture of the cream and that it doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing any pore clogging.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased it for its purity of the natural ingredients. Thus far it&#x27;s been working very well for sun protection.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I have been using it for just over a year now. It works well and the 3.4 oz lasts for several months.</li>
            <li> My favorite sunscreen (along with tinted Sunsi&#x27;belle) non-toxic, effective, no white residue, works under powder bleach or mineral foundation. Nothing about it that&#x27;s not to like!</li>
            <li> I consider this is a heavy-duty moisturizer that happens to have SPF 30 protection.  As an aging woman living in a dry southwestern climate, I am delighted with it, but it would be too heavy for, say, Austin, TX.  It applies as though it&#x27;s going to be too zinc-y, but if you let it sit for 30 seconds, it absorbs very nicely.  I do have to check for white spots, but in every other way it is just what I was looking for - and it rates very well on the EWG list, too!</li>
            <li> Loved the all natural ingredients of Keys products.  Love that this is a sunscreen moisturizer that I use under makeup for the day.  Goes on light and protects.</li>
            <li> Great ingredients!!!!  Seems to work well as a sunblock on my face, the pump dispenses too much lotion, if you don&#x27;t press it down all the way it will still keep coming out...wasteful.  It’s a little on the greasy side.</li>
            <li> Love this! It is my new daily facial moisturizer. The high zinc content calms my normally red and sensitive skin and it provides just the right amount of moisture to my dry skin. There is a film more or less after you apply it but this allows it to act like a primer under my foundation. The smell did take some getting used to; but it fades very quickly. I wouldn&#x27;t use this anywhere except my face. A little goes a long way, I expect to get 6 or so months out of one container. I will by again and again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this sunscreen for a few years. Love the fact it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of chemicals.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and love it! If I need more sun protection, I just layer more on top couple hours later...and my skin just feels so care for and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I use sun screen religiously and have been looking for the healthiest for my skin.  This sunscreen goes on thick but soon blends into my skin and stays put for hours.  I tried putting makeup on over it, but it&#x27;s too thick. I wear it on my hikes and walks and in the pool - the best.</li>
            <li> ok, i actually don&#x27;t know if it works yet, we haven&#x27;t had a really sunny day here yet.  I got this after doing a lot of research to replace my DeVita solar50, which they changed the recipe.  It had been my favorite sunscreen then it turned my face white with big flecks.  This smells interesting and i will have to see if i burn or not later in summer.</li>
            <li> So sad to have to give this report.  This is my 3rd bottle of Keys Solar Rx.  Since I ordered a 3rd, I was obviously satisfied with my first two bottles.  But this time it came from a different Amazon seller than the first two bottles.  The packaging has changed.  You can no longer see how much product is remaining in the bottle.  But that&#x27;s minor.  What wasn&#x27;t minor was the terribly offensive odor in this third bottle.  The first time I applied it, I was almost nauseated by the smell and immediately washed my face.  I waited about a week and tried it again, but I still HATED the smell.  This time I left the product on hoping the smell would dissipate, but after about 30 minutes I couldn&#x27;t stand it any longer, so again I washed it off.  Then I contacted the seller, Fresh Bontanica, to return the item.  I was dismayed to discover that it is their &amp;#34;policy&amp;#34; to charge a 30 percent restocking fee.  In addition, they said they would also take my original shipping fee out of my refund.  However, they actually took double what I had paid for shipping.  I paid $1.00 to have the product shipped to me, and they took $2.00 out of my refund for shipping.  (This had nothing to do with the cost to ship it back to them...I paid that myself.)  So my recommendation is do not give this product a try, and especially do not purchase through this Amazon seller.  They do not stand behind their product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it DID ghost me (made me look like I was wearing white powder) and it caused me to break out in hives and itch.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this sunblock since it is highly rated on EWG.org. While I am sure it is an extremely safe and effective sunblock, it might not be the best for me as it is relatively dry on the skin.  For folks who have oily skin, I would definitely recommend this product.  For me though, with my dry skin, an oilier sunblock like Sunology or Soleo is better.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Too bad it&#x27;s so expensive.</li>
            <li> The product smells so terrible, I had to return it.</li>
            <li> Not greasy. This is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Although I appreciate that Solar Keys used good quality ingredients in this sunblock and no preservatives or synthetic chemicals, all those oils and waxes are simply not going to work on clog-prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this for two months.  It does prevent sunblock, especially if re-applied often. The shea butter is very moisturizing and helped with the fine lines around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on looking mostly matte, but unfortunately if this stayed on my skin for 4+ hours my face looked shiny like I had slathered olive oil all over it.  For the record, I have \\&quot;normal\\&quot; skin usually (not dry or oily).  Sun exposure seemed to \\&quot;melt\\&quot; the sunblock to turn it excessively shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ultimate reason I won&#x27;t be using this on my face anymore is the acne it caused.  I started with two zits on my face, after using this for 2 months I had 30. It was like puberty all over again. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two weeks after stopping use and being really diligent with hot water compresses and a honey+rosemary concoction (comment for details if you are curious) my face is finally looking back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For sunblock now I use a mixture of zinc oxide powder + cocoa powder and it is just effective and doesn&#x27;t make my skin breakout.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this sunscreen.  I use it every day and have for many years.  It it great sunscreen, non greasy but provides a great light moisturizer and it doesn&#x27;t make my face shiny like most sunscreen&#x27;s do.  I don&#x27;t have the need to use powder over it.  Perfect once just applied.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this product after thoroughly reading so many positive reviews about it. I didn&#x27;t find big negatives so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try since I wanted a zinc oxide based daily face lotion.  I gave it only 2 stars since I was disappointed in how heavy this lotion felt on my face and the odd herbal scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Works well as a sunscreen. I did not burn while wearing it, even on days I spent a lot of time in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to apply and rubs in easily so your face doesn&#x27;t appear white.&lt;br /&gt;-The pump is easy to use. I prefer this over a tube that you have to squeeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-It feels heavy. I expected it to feel light (like Obagi NuDerm SPF 35). I was so wrong. When my face sweat, it felt like my skin was suffocating and the sweat couldn&#x27;t get through the lotion.&lt;br /&gt;-Feels greasy.&lt;br /&gt;-Herbal smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product since I prefer a lighter feeling daily face sunscreen. I will be going back to using Obagi NuDerm SPF 35.</li>
