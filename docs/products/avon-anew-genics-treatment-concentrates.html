            <li>Oh and the price is great!</li>
            <li>WONDERFUL</li>
            <li>This is one of the best product in the market, with excellent results, and for the price even in Avon is perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it!!!</li>
            <li>Of course I have very good skin to start with</li>
            <li>A very good product for the price.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li>price is perfect for my budget! :)</li>
            <li>and it smells good</li>
            <li>The size is good and it&#x27;s just as if I bought it from a rep</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li>but if you want amazing results you need to use the Night treatment.  </li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s an amazing product.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find it on Amazon for cheaper than from my Avon Rep.  </li>
            <li>I LIKED THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li>Nice texture, smoothens the skin.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the way this treatment works and twice as glad that Amazon carried it.</li>
            <li>This is a great serum for under your regular cream to fight wrinkles; another great product by Avon.</li>
            <li>I love this product help my skin a lot...</li>
            <li>this cream i feel my face is more hydrate .&lt;br</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;d better stop looking at these products at all.</li>
            <li>Enjoyed this - my wife have me using it because she likes it:)</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Very rich cream, not heavily scented, absorbs into skin, not greasy, and my skin looks amazing &amp; I havent even gone 1/4 through the bottle!</li>
            <li>my fine lines were ironed out.way to go.</li>
            <li>What makes it remarkable is I&#x27;ve only been using it two months.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nothing special for a moisturiser.</li>
            <li>I just love this product and would readily recommend it for anyone.  </li>
            <li>At first they seem fine then over a period of 2 or 3 weeks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been loyal to Olay, but telling I can lose 10 yrs was too much to pass up.  </li>
            <li>Because I use several products throughout the week,  of course that is an option personally, however I find by experimenting with these fine products I achieve maximum results at a  price better than leading products.</li>
            <li>I get the crinkled when I smile (because I&#x27;m not botoxed or lifted) but other than that I have better skin at 60 than I did at 50.  </li>
            <li>I can tell such a huge difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>it really works  </li>
            <li>THE WHOLE LINE&lt;br /&gt;OF GENICS</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d like to have something that actually makes it feel more moisturized not less.</li>
            <li>my skin has just become softer than when I was in high school</li>
            <li>/&gt;Results you see every day my skin that is very sensitive, doesnt have any reaction.</li>
            <li>and my skin looks younger and much nicer  </li>
            <li>So far, I like it.</li>
            <li>I have used this for a week without using the clearly C, and there were no noticeable results, I went back to using the Clearly C.</li>
            <li>i live in Texas and the weather is really dry</li>
            <li>This product works but it gives me breakouts in the first few applications..</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This seems like other Avon products that I&#x27;ve ordered and tried after reading glowing reviews. At first they seem fine then over a period of 2 or 3 weeks I see that they actually dry and dull my skin. I guess I&#x27;d better stop looking at these products at all.

            <li> The size is good and it&#x27;s just as if I bought it from a rep only cheaper but it&#x27;s nothing special for a moisturiser.</li>
            <li> OMG...I love this stuff!!  I was thrilled to find it on Amazon for cheaper than from my Avon Rep.  Since using this product (this is my second bottle) my skin has just become softer than when I was in high school and I definitely have less little lines.  My husband has  even noticed!  I just love this product and would readily recommend it for anyone.  I am sooooo hooked on this Anew Genics!</li>
            <li> Enjoyed this - my wife have me using it because she likes it:) and I think she will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> I LIKED THIS PRODUCT IT MADE MY SKIN LOOK WONDERFUL I USE THE WHOLE LINE&lt;br /&gt;OF GENICS IT WILL MAKE YOUR SKIN GLOW.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a week without using the clearly C, and there were no noticeable results, I went back to using the Clearly C.</li>
            <li> This is a great serum for under your regular cream to fight wrinkles; another great product by Avon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been loyal to Olay, but telling I can lose 10 yrs was too much to pass up.  It&#x27;s a good product but if you want amazing results you need to use the Night treatment.  I have no permanent wrinkles now.  I get the crinkled when I smile (because I&#x27;m not botoxed or lifted) but other than that I have better skin at 60 than I did at 50.  What makes it remarkable is I&#x27;ve only been using it two months.  My BFF thought I got Botox, that&#x27;s an amazing product.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I can tell such a huge difference in my skin.  I will buy this again and again!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the way this treatment works and twice as glad that Amazon carried it.</li>
            <li> I love it!!! My dark spots are gone and I can wear it underneath my makeup.It&#x27;s not oily it has no fragrance. I LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> Nice texture, smoothens the skin. Will definitively try it on for a longer period of time. A very good product for the price.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best product in the market, with excellent results, and for the price even in Avon is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Results you see every day my skin that is very sensitive, doesnt have any reaction.</li>
            <li> Because I use several products throughout the week,  of course that is an option personally, however I find by experimenting with these fine products I achieve maximum results at a  price better than leading products. Especially through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Overall, not impressed with this product.  I used it for two months and saw no noticeable improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> So far, I like it. This product works but it gives me breakouts in the first few applications..I tried alternating it with Roc and I like the results. Seems like my fine lines were ironed out.way to go.</li>
