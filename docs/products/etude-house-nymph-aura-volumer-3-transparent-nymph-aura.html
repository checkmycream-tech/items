            <li>I was very impressed.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product.  </li>
            <li>This product works great!</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the smell is very good.</li>
            <li>mixd with any BB or CC cream and it upgrades the product to a beautiful dewy, moisturized, finish.</li>
            <li>Beautiful dewy effect</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t experienced any drying from this product.</li>
            <li>and he looked great after he completed his face</li>
            <li>but i give it a four because it smells great</li>
            <li>greatly recommend this product if you love dewy skin!</li>
            <li>But if u get really good at make up, maybe you cant get it to soften on the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Good moisturizer</li>
            <li>If you can get over that stickiness, it still does a good job of being shiny and wet-looking.</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li>love love love this product works so awesomely.</li>
            <li>Honestly, the &amp;#34;luminescence&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;dewiness&amp;#34; is just from the castor oil in the product.</li>
            <li>Give your face a nice dewy look</li>
            <li>I own all of the Nymph volumers and this one is definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li>Very nice and fresh I don&#x27;t mix with foundation</li>
            <li>Gives my face (combo skin) a healthy glow and shine.</li>
            <li>Also I love this product.</li>
            <li>I just absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more.  </li>
            <li>Really enjoyed this product while I needed it.</li>
            <li>I have tried it both ways and think they are equally appealing.</li>
            <li>Make sure your skin is well-exfoliated and moisturized before using this product.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll be achieving that healthy dewy skin look with this product :)</li>
            <li>This is more of a serum then a moisturizer though.</li>
            <li>I  dab it on brow bones and cheeks and forehead love it</li>
            <li>And, if you add an anti-shine powder over it, you&#x27;re negating the original intent of the product.</li>
            <li>Its like one of those serums u can put on top of your make up to illuminate certain areas of your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>:) I will be buying them for sure in the future.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear, a bit thinner than the first one, and looks lovely on the skin!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for several weeks in combination with Etude House&#x27;s Precious Mineral Cotton Fit BB Cream in Light Beige.</li>
            <li>I mix half of a pump with my BB/CC or foundation and gives me such a beautiful moisturized finish that is perfect for the winter time when my skin is dry.</li>
            <li>The Etude House Nymph Aura Volumer #3 is exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>Great for normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li>Definitely only on your high points and then set you&#x27;re makeup really good with a powder.</li>
            <li>But yep with the right usage and makeup routine</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>If mixed with BB cream at the correct ratio, it gives me a healthy, dewy glow.</li>
            <li>Was exactly correct.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re into kpop or all the asian makeup trends you&#x27;ll love this product to help give you that dewy look you see them have.</li>
            <li>I really like the fresh look on my face with aura volumer</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably best if your skin is on the dry side, otherwise your face just ends up feeling like an oil slick.</li>
            <li>It made my face look really oily.</li>
            <li>Gives a very interresting effect for photos .</li>
            <li>It gives the BB cream a much dewier look.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, to me, it just looks very oily.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like that.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>In the right picture, it shows the product completely spread out on my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product, especially on my dry skin, it gives a very dewy moisturized look.</li>
            <li>I would use it more if I had better skin, because the shininess brings attention to my bad skin texture.</li>
            <li>I have been using TONYMOLY&#x27;s Cat&#x27;s Wink Clear Pact in shade #1.</li>
            <li>but it gives natural glow on my face and looks moisturized.</li>
            <li>Be sure and heed the instructions regarding the ratio of volumer to BB cream you should use when mixing, because a little bit of this goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave glow much if I use loose powder</li>
            <li>If you are going to mix, use less BB cream than you would without the volumer, otherwise you will have too much!</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t even put on a lot, but it just feels very thick and sticky.</li>
            <li> irritating ingredients.</li>
            <li> Combined with foundation or bb cream creates a dewy natural looking finish that makes you look hydrated and supple without that nasty oily shine.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way! I mix this with my bb cream to get a dewey finish and I love it! I have dry/combination skin and I haven&#x27;t experienced any drying from this product. I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li> mixd with any BB or CC cream and it upgrades the product to a beautiful dewy, moisturized, finish.</li>
            <li> After mixing the volumer with bb cream it made my skin extremely shiny and oily looking. I looked like a shiny pokemon.</li>
            <li> irritating ingredients. worst</li>
            <li> Awesome item! I use the recommended amount of 1/3 of my bb cream and mix it together. Gives my face (combo skin) a healthy glow and shine. Never looks oily on me.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping. I was very impressed. Also I love this product. It doesn&#x27;t leave glow much if I use loose powder but it gives natural glow on my face and looks moisturized. I wanna try #2 next.</li>
            <li> The Etude House Nymph Aura Volumer #3 is exactly what I was looking for! If mixed with BB cream at the correct ratio, it gives me a healthy, dewy glow. I apply it with my fingers and then blend it with a beauty blender. I just absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t make any difference. It made my face look really oily. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone! Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  I will be buying more.  I saw a korean actor showing how he applies makeup on utube and he looked great after he completed his face and he described this product as the one he was using.  Was exactly correct.</li>
            <li> Gives a very interresting effect for photos .</li>
            <li> Really enjoyed this product while I needed it. Last year, I had extremely dry skin. My dry skin just sucked it all up! Also, I was getting into the dewy skin look, so this was a must have. I decided to get #3 because I heard reviews from #1 and #2 because they were wayy to watery. As of now, I use this during winter time or when I want to mix my blush or eyeshadow with this.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping! Absolutely love this product, especially on my dry skin, it gives a very dewy moisturized look. I would definitely use this again!</li>
            <li> I own all of the Nymph volumers and this one is definitely my favorite. It&#x27;s clear, a bit thinner than the first one, and looks lovely on the skin! I mix half of a pump with my BB/CC or foundation and gives me such a beautiful moisturized finish that is perfect for the winter time when my skin is dry. It lasts forever since you only need the tiniest bit and you can even use it as a face pack at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I greatly recommend this product if you love dewy skin!</li>
            <li> I have never used volumer before, and I like it quite a bit. I have been using this product for several weeks in combination with Etude House&#x27;s Precious Mineral Cotton Fit BB Cream in Light Beige. It gives the BB cream a much dewier look. Be sure and heed the instructions regarding the ratio of volumer to BB cream you should use when mixing, because a little bit of this goes a long way. If you are going to mix, use less BB cream than you would without the volumer, otherwise you will have too much! You can also use this product as a highlighter, in which case you would not mix it with the BB cream. I have tried it both ways and think they are equally appealing. Make sure your skin is well-exfoliated and moisturized before using this product. I would also recommend using a powder to set the BB cream/volumer mixture. I have been using TONYMOLY&#x27;s Cat&#x27;s Wink Clear Pact in shade #1. I plan on trying out Nymph Aura Volumer #4 next.</li>
            <li> Beautiful dewy effect</li>
            <li> I use this product to add glow to my skin (dewy look). This product works great! A little goes a long way! 4 stars because product tends to be too sticky on face!</li>
            <li> Such a silky texture not oily or greasy. Combined with foundation or bb cream creates a dewy natural looking finish that makes you look hydrated and supple without that nasty oily shine. love love love this product works so awesomely.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re into kpop or all the asian makeup trends you&#x27;ll love this product to help give you that dewy look you see them have. Great for normal to dry skin. For those with oily skin you can still use this product but just not everywhere. Definitely only on your high points and then set you&#x27;re makeup really good with a powder. It&#x27;s a semi-sticky texture so don&#x27;t smother it all over your face. But yep with the right usage and makeup routine you&#x27;ll be achieving that healthy dewy skin look with this product :)</li>
            <li> This would be rated a three but i give it a four because it smells great and it is moisturizing. This is more of a serum then a moisturizer though. Its like one of those serums u can put on top of your make up to illuminate certain areas of your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, to me, it just looks very oily.  In my picture, the left side shows the product on half of my hand compared to the other side that does not contain the product. In the right picture, it shows the product completely spread out on my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was less than a pea size amount. It just looks oily and greasy in my opinion. But if u get really good at make up, maybe you cant get it to soften on the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the smell is very good. It smells a bit like a citrus floral smell.</li>
            <li> Good product. Good moisturizer but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Very nice and fresh I don&#x27;t mix with foundation I  dab it on brow bones and cheeks and forehead love it</li>
            <li> I really like the fresh look on my face with aura volumer :) I will be buying them for sure in the future.</li>
            <li> I would use it more if I had better skin, because the shininess brings attention to my bad skin texture. It does its job which is to highlight your skin and make your skin look dewy. It&#x27;s quite sticky. It&#x27;s so sticky that my hair kept sticking to where I put it... I don&#x27;t even put on a lot, but it just feels very thick and sticky. I didn&#x27;t really like that. If you can get over that stickiness, it still does a good job of being shiny and wet-looking.</li>
            <li> Honestly, the &amp;#34;luminescence&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;dewiness&amp;#34; is just from the castor oil in the product. It just left my skin feeling greasy and heavy. My skin gets oily around the T zone, which is unfortunate since you&#x27;re supposed to apply the product in pretty much the same area. And, if you add an anti-shine powder over it, you&#x27;re negating the original intent of the product. It&#x27;s probably best if your skin is on the dry side, otherwise your face just ends up feeling like an oil slick.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Give your face a nice dewy look</li>
