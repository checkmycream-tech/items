    <ol>
            <li>I ordered this product on sale and it Is awesome.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product..not animal tested</li>
            <li>It gives me just the perfect balance of moisture and luminance.</li>
            <li>but this cream has tightened my lids greatly.  </li>
            <li>So, basically what I am saying, this has been one of my best beauty purchases ever and the organic and cruelty free aspect is the icing on the cake.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non-greasy, but if used correctly, does provide some life and good moisure to my aging eye area.</li>
            <li>In my experience, it worked just as well, if not a bit better than the eye cream you pay more money for from Avon, plus, it smelled great!  </li>
            <li>Great service, great price and fantastic results.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product and will oder it again.  </li>
            <li>Bummer, I was really enjoying this stuff!</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply, smells great, and lasts..</li>
            <li>I have been using this eye cream for 3-4 weeks and the results are amazing.  </li>
            <li>I also liked that unlike the Avon day eye cream, this didn&#x27;t sting my eyes.  </li>
            <li>No miracles in any lotions, but this is as good as any top of the line, and it&#x27;s organic to boot.</li>
            <li>This Avalon Organics Lift has a nice consistency, creamy and spreadable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and so far the results are the best I&#x27;ve ever had from any eye products...ever.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light lotion, perfect for mature skin in the summer.</li>
            <li>Love this eye cream.</li>
            <li>But I think it will help keep more from occurring.  </li>

            <li>Was pleasantly surprised how effective it was using it first thing in the morning for puffiness.</li>
            <li>It makes my eye area very smooth and soft and there has been zero irritation at all</li>
            <li>They will always be there to some degree, but they are lighter and much easier to cover because my skin in so smooth.</li>
            <li>Lovely, natural scent.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s still worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got more than a teeny bit left here, and it&#x27;s looking like I won&#x27;t get to use the rest of it, because I can&#x27;t even scrape it up with the pump&#x27;s wand, inside.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love it except it is only 70% organic and it &amp;#34;draws&amp;#34; moisture up from deeper layers in my skin.</li>
            <li>Now that I have found my Essential Lift products from Avalon, the mirror is much kinder in the morning, and I am certain to stick with this amazing combination of natural ingredients and minerals.</li>

            <li> I ordered on a whim and it&#x27;s been barely a month</li>
            <li> For that reason, I only use this occassionally - for special events or for days when my eyes look particularly tired.</li>
            <li> After I gently apply a small dot of the lotion under each eye, the skin stays moisturized all day (and because of this, the under-eye area doesn&#x27;t look as wrinkly.)  </li>
            <li> I have verrryyy oily skin with the occasional dry patches under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Then, almost instantly, your skin is dry again.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 50s, with lifelong dark circles and some new crowsfeet.  </li>
            <li> I actually can see the LIFT for which I have been searching so long!!</li>
            <li> The reason I am deducting a star is because I have between a third and a half of the container left, and I can no longer pump stuff out because the pump is too short.  </li>
            <li> After endless trials at finding a night cream and eye cream that actually DO provide a VISIBLE LIFT, I have found the answer to my skin care dilemma.  </li>
            <li> The only saving grace to this eye serum is that it is comprised of all natural ingredients and therefore much safer for you, especially since it is applied to the thin, delicate skin around the eye.  </li>
            <li> It is solid in the jar, and in order to make it spreadable, you have to rub it for awhile between your fingers or in your palm, thereby wasting half the product.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have bags, but I&#x27;m beginning to get a little sagging of the skin above my eyelids, and this seems to tighten that</li>
            <li> I decided to use this product because eye area isn&#x27;t as firm as it used to be and have few minor lines under my eyes at upper cheek.</li>
            <li> Waking up with dark circles under my eyes and drooping skin has made it even harder to get up in the morning and to peer into the mirror.  </li>
            <li> This is typical when it comes to using stuff with a pump, but this usually doesn&#x27;t happen until you&#x27;ve got a teeny bit left.  </li>
            <li> While this stuff didn&#x27;t completely get rid of my circles, it has decreased both the puffiness and the darkness by quite a bit.  </li>
            <li> like the slightly herbal smell (rosemary)</li>
            <li> bought it on eBay for under $10, now I can&#x27;t find it for less than $17.  </li>
            <li> I like the consistency as it is not too heavy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy or heavy, it minimizes lines while firming, it absorbs well.  </li>
            <li> Not sure that it truly \\&quot;lifted\\&quot; my eye area, but I think it does reduce the appearance of lines and under-eye circles.</li>
            <li> This cream is very thin and takes &#x27;forever&#x27; to absorb into the skin.  </li>

            <li> While this stuff didn&#x27;t completely get rid of my circles, it has decreased both the puffiness and the darkness by quite a bit.  You can definitely tell when I put it on, versus when I don&#x27;t.  In my experience, it worked just as well, if not a bit better than the eye cream you pay more money for from Avon, plus, it smelled great!  I also liked that unlike the Avon day eye cream, this didn&#x27;t sting my eyes.  The reason I am deducting a star is because I have between a third and a half of the container left, and I can no longer pump stuff out because the pump is too short.  This is typical when it comes to using stuff with a pump, but this usually doesn&#x27;t happen until you&#x27;ve got a teeny bit left.  I&#x27;ve got more than a teeny bit left here, and it&#x27;s looking like I won&#x27;t get to use the rest of it, because I can&#x27;t even scrape it up with the pump&#x27;s wand, inside.  So, looks like I&#x27;ll be looking for another eye cream, maybe one that I can squeeze out, or in a jar.  Bummer, I was really enjoying this stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love it except it is only 70% organic and it &amp;#34;draws&amp;#34; moisture up from deeper layers in my skin. I&#x27;d rather it keep all my layers moisturized.  For that reason, I only use this occassionally - for special events or for days when my eyes look particularly tired. I use moisturizing eye creams at night, instead of this one.  My skin and eyes are sensitive so I use Simple moisturizing eye balm or Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance Eye Cream at night and sometimes under this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did buy another eye cream - BorageThrapy by Shikai - and it irritated my eyes, as a heads up if you&#x27;re sensitive and doing a search for organic eye creams on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Purchased for fresh Rosemary scent as I have purchased other Avalon items in the Rosemary line.  Was pleasantly surprised how effective it was using it first thing in the morning for puffiness.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product on sale and it Is awesome.  It is easy to apply, smells great, and lasts..awesome...buy it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different eye products and this was just another one that didn&#x27;t work for me....but that&#x27;s just me...</li>
            <li> After endless trials at finding a night cream and eye cream that actually DO provide a VISIBLE LIFT, I have found the answer to my skin care dilemma.  Waking up with dark circles under my eyes and drooping skin has made it even harder to get up in the morning and to peer into the mirror.  Now that I have found my Essential Lift products from Avalon, the mirror is much kinder in the morning, and I am certain to stick with this amazing combination of natural ingredients and minerals. I actually can see the LIFT for which I have been searching so long!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I found the cream leaves my eyes puffier and showing more wrinkles.</li>
            <li> To start, I&#x27;m 30 with hereditary dark circles and the beginning of fine lines. I have verrryyy oily skin with the occasional dry patches under my eyes. I have tried a zillion eye creams to combat dark circles (no real luck) and have neglected the fine lines...until now. I have recently tried to go natural and cruelty free with my beauty products so I came across Avalon during my search for a product with those qualities. I ordered on a whim and it&#x27;s been barely a month and so far the results are the best I&#x27;ve ever had from any eye products...ever. My lines are NOTICEABLY smoother, some of the smaller ones are even almost gone. It makes my eye area very smooth and soft and there has been zero irritation at all (and I use the cream morning and night). And, in a wonderful surprise to me, I honestly have seen an improvement in my dark circles. They will always be there to some degree, but they are lighter and much easier to cover because my skin in so smooth. So, basically what I am saying, this has been one of my best beauty purchases ever and the organic and cruelty free aspect is the icing on the cake.</li>
            <li> I decided to use this product because eye area isn&#x27;t as firm as it used to be and have few minor lines under my eyes at upper cheek. But since using this product, I haven&#x27;t noticed enough difference to note.</li>
            <li> My make-up doesn&#x27;t go over it very well.  I use it at night when its stickiness doesn&#x27;t make my powder build up in fine lines</li>
            <li> Give it 4-6 weeks and you will be amazed.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful, gentle lifting lotion that does not bother my sensitive eyes. It&#x27;s non-greasy, but if used correctly, does provide some life and good moisure to my aging eye area. So I don&#x27;t run out, I started ordering two at a time!</li>
            <li> So far it feels firmer and is not causing rash or breakout.&lt;br /&gt;Avalon: place seals on products or consumers beware.&lt;br /&gt;Opalwind</li>
            <li> This is a very absorbent, non greasy eye cream.  It works well at night or for day under makeup.  I like the consistency as it is not too heavy yet it moisturizes and refreshes the eye area well.  Not sure that it truly \\&quot;lifted\\&quot; my eye area, but I think it does reduce the appearance of lines and under-eye circles.</li>
            <li> I thought the silt sounded like a good thing, and it really is.  I find it very hydrating.  No miracles in any lotions, but this is as good as any top of the line, and it&#x27;s organic to boot. It&#x27;s perfect to use also as a light facial lotion.  It&#x27;s a light lotion, perfect for mature skin in the summer.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews on this eye cream, most good, some not but decided to give it a try since I like some of Avalon&#x27;s other products.  This works for me!  It&#x27;s not greasy or heavy, it minimizes lines while firming, it absorbs well.  I&#x27;m 56 so I expect quite a bit out of my eye cream &amp; it delivers for me.</li>
            <li> I like this product... A little goes a long way, it has a pleasant smell and feels really soft on your skin</li>
            <li> I bought this for bags under the eye area. I do not see a difference in the appearance of my eyes.</li>
            <li> Excellent product..not animal tested, this is what I look for &amp; require now before purchase. Always look for not animal tested when buying..</li>
            <li> This cream is very thin and takes &#x27;forever&#x27; to absorb into the skin.  Then, almost instantly, your skin is dry again.  It does not moisturize at all.  And does not do any of the things it claims to do.  The only saving grace to this eye serum is that it is comprised of all natural ingredients and therefore much safer for you, especially since it is applied to the thin, delicate skin around the eye.  I do not recommend this... I would recommend Derma e pycnogenal eye cream instead.</li>
            <li> Love this eye cream. Lovely, natural scent. And feels light going on, but without feeling too greasy. It gives me just the perfect balance of moisture and luminance.</li>
            <li> I got this primarily because the skin around my eyes is super dry all the time.  This lotion really makes a difference.  After I gently apply a small dot of the lotion under each eye, the skin stays moisturized all day (and because of this, the under-eye area doesn&#x27;t look as wrinkly.)  I&#x27;m allergic to everything and this lotion does not irritate my skin or eyes.</li>
            <li> I needed an eye cream that was rated organic so it did not have any unwanted ingredients.  This product fits that need.  I have been using this eye cream for 3-4 weeks and the results are amazing.  I am 67 years old and I have eye lids that were saging.  I realize that no cream can undo old age but this cream has tightened my lids greatly.  I am very pleased with this product and will oder it again.  Great service, great price and fantastic results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 50s, with lifelong dark circles and some new crowsfeet.  This product brightens my undereyes instantly - reflecting the light to hide them.  It masks the fine lines too, while not actually repairing them.  But I think it will help keep more from occurring.  I don&#x27;t have bags, but I&#x27;m beginning to get a little sagging of the skin above my eyelids, and this seems to tighten that up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest issue is with the pump.  It stopped being able to dispense product when the bottle was only about 60% empty.  So I have to scoop out the balance with a chopstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the slightly herbal smell (rosemary) and I like that this has no animal ingredients or testing.  The last vegan eye cream I got was from Reviva Labs.  It is solid in the jar, and in order to make it spreadable, you have to rub it for awhile between your fingers or in your palm, thereby wasting half the product.  This Avalon Organics Lift has a nice consistency, creamy and spreadable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it on eBay for under $10, now I can&#x27;t find it for less than $17.  But it&#x27;s still worth it.</li>
