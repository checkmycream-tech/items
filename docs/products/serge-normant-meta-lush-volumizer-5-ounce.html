            <li>Works good.</li>
            <li>good price for the money...</li>
            <li>The best of it is that it leaves your hair \\&quot;feeling clean.\\&quot;You see and feel the boost, but, it still feels clean, bouncy and weightless.</li>
            <li>Perfect for fine hair, smells amazing, not sticky, and gives volume.</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>i heard so many good things about this volumizer</li>
            <li>AND...it smells really nice &amp; earthy with the cedar bark that&#x27;s in there.</li>
            <li>I love love love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I love that it has UV filters, so it will protect color treated hair from UV damage.</li>
            <li>This worked much better for me.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Healthy ingredients.</li>
            <li>better volumizing products out there.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with a hair product</li>
            <li>Okay, I was just looking at this and accidentally hit the one-click button.</li>
            <li>Would buy for light volume, texture, and for healthy hair reasons.</li>
            <li>product came early than date promised and is this great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it has a strong smell, leaves hair oily and doesn&#x27;t volumize at all.</li>
            <li>The offensive scent stayed strong all day.</li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone needing lift for fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine bleached blonde hair and did it give me a great lift.</li>
            <li>The product I used to use is no longer available, so I tried this.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>Great product for fine hair, adds volume without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>What I liked the most about it is you can use it after washing hair and you can use it on dry hair if you are out and about.</li>
            <li>Pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>i have thinning fine, soft hair on top and this is the only thing that really works to give it texture and volume.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair and it was recommended for the same</li>
            <li>And...it gives my hair a nice little shine when I use it to perk up the &#x27;doo in the afternoon.</li>
            <li>I have thick, naturally curly hair &amp; have a lot of my own volume, but this works really great on the little frizzies I get.</li>
            <li>Really gives my hair the &amp;#34;oomph&amp;#34; it needs.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t smell or make hair feel sticky.</li>
            <li>the volume I&#x27;ve been trying to get - more than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>main source&amp;#34; amazon to order.</li>
            <li>(so much so that I ordered another after using my first only twice).</li>
            <li>Very fine mist not heavy and will not make your hair look stiff.</li>
            <li>I used to use a root lifter by first drying my hair, then spraying in on only the roots, then styling.</li>
            <li>a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was nicely surprised.</li>
            <li>My hair is thick and fine</li>
            <li>I towel drying my hair a couple of times until it was just damp, then spraying this onto the general &amp;#34;root&amp;#34; area of where I wanted the &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>and it worked ok but not great.</li>
            <li>It does work, but be careful how much you apply, it can have the adverse effect, and make hair flat.</li>
            <li>Item smelled like cheap salon product, reminiscent of products from the &#x27;70&#x27;s; and a sparing application left my thick head of medium-thickness hair gooey and droopy.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> i heard so many good things about this volumizer but i guess they were all just marketing stuff planted in the internet.&lt;br /&gt;it has a strong smell, leaves hair oily and doesn&#x27;t volumize at all.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my hair after using this.  Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> It dries out the hair.  I have fine hair and it was recommended for the same but it did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> Best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> Item smelled like cheap salon product, reminiscent of products from the &#x27;70&#x27;s; and a sparing application left my thick head of medium-thickness hair gooey and droopy.  The offensive scent stayed strong all day.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because People magazine promoted it and it does nothing for my hair. My hair is thick and fine so I need volumizer to keep the body in it throughout the day and this product is not it.</li>
            <li> Pricey but worth it. Great product for fine hair, adds volume without weighing it down. I love that it has UV filters, so it will protect color treated hair from UV damage.</li>
            <li> I love love love this stuff!  Smells wonderful and adds volume anywhere you spray it.  It smells so good, sometime I think I&#x27;ve over-done it with the volume!</li>
            <li> Lightweight! Perfect for fine hair, smells amazing, not sticky, and gives volume. Would recommend to anyone needing lift for fine hair.</li>
            <li> Awful. This turned my hair into the consistency of greasy straw, and I hardly used any. I couldn&#x27;t wait to wash it out.</li>
            <li> I have very thin, fine, limp hair. The product I used to use is no longer available, so I tried this. I used to use a root lifter by first drying my hair, then spraying in on only the roots, then styling. Tried using this that way for awhile and it worked ok but not great. It didn&#x27;t compare to the other product in the results (but then again the other product wasn&#x27;t all natural and probably not good for you either). Then I tried applying it differently. I towel drying my hair a couple of times until it was just damp, then spraying this onto the general &amp;#34;root&amp;#34; area of where I wanted the &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34;. Then I dried my hair with a blow dryer (head upside down) and then styled. This worked much better for me. I think it&#x27;s all in how you use it. All in all -- a good product.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Gives my flat hair the volume I&#x27;ve been trying to get - more than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> i have thinning fine, soft hair on top and this is the only thing that really works to give it texture and volume.  i will repurchase.</li>
            <li> Love this! Use it all the time.</li>
            <li> does nothing for my fine thin hair, disappointment</li>
            <li> Works good. Healthy ingredients. Pricey, but you are paying for a Serge Normant product. I think there are&lt;br /&gt;probably better volumizing products out there. Would not buy again for volumizing, that was why it was&lt;br /&gt;developed. Would buy for light volume, texture, and for healthy hair reasons.</li>
            <li> This volumizer works greatl for me! I use it with Serge Normant shampoo and hair spray. My hair style stays all day.</li>
            <li> This has to be the best volumizer I have tried.......and I have tried tons of them.The best of it is that it leaves your hair \\&quot;feeling clean.\\&quot;You see and feel the boost, but, it still feels clean, bouncy and weightless. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with a hair product (so much so that I ordered another after using my first only twice).</li>
            <li> Okay, I was just looking at this and accidentally hit the one-click button. Instead of cancelling I just let it go and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was nicely surprised. I have thick, naturally curly hair &amp; have a lot of my own volume, but this works really great on the little frizzies I get. And...it gives my hair a nice little shine when I use it to perk up the &#x27;doo in the afternoon. AND...it smells really nice &amp; earthy with the cedar bark that&#x27;s in there.</li>
            <li> It does work, but be careful how much you apply, it can have the adverse effect, and make hair flat.</li>
            <li> Read about this product in an interview with actress Julia Roberts. said what a great product this was . so I was intrigued and went to my&amp;#34; main source&amp;#34; amazon to order. product came early than date promised and is this great. I have baby fine bleached blonde hair and did it give me a great lift. What I liked the most about it is you can use it after washing hair and you can use it on dry hair if you are out and about. Very fine mist not heavy and will not make your hair look stiff. Lasts a long time even after brushing or combing hair.. good price for the money...a must try</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT! Really gives my hair the &amp;#34;oomph&amp;#34; it needs.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t smell or make hair feel sticky. Fantastic product.</li>
