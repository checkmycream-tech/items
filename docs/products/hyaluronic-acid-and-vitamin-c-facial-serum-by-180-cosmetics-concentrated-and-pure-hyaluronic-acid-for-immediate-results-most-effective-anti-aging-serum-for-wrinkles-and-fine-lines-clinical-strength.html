            <li>I was given a chance to test and give my honest opinion on this product during a promotion.</li>
            <li>This is the best I&#x27;ve tried for such a great price.</li>
            <li>so I like to warm about that.</li>
            <li>So I am torn between my thrifty side and my luxury loving side.  </li>
            <li>Use this along with Argan Oil and Rose Hips oil</li>
            <li>So this is a nice serum but didn&#x27;t work for me with microneedling</li>
            <li>Since there were so many good reviews, I decided to try it again.</li>
            <li>BUT I LIKED THE&lt;br /&gt;FEEL OF TIGHTNESS AFTER USE.</li>
            <li>It is nice to get compliments that I have a glow.</li>
            <li>Looking forward to more of a good thing.</li>
            <li>this was nice</li>
            <li>The price is excellent &amp; it works very well.</li>
            <li>I make my own creams, lotions, soap, bath oils and sugar and salt scrubs.</li>
            <li>have been using this product for one week and at it astounding that after 2 days I could already see the increased moisture in my skin.  </li>
            <li>I amusing this with accumulation of another skin products.  </li>
            <li>I just put in my face once a day, and it feels nice.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin with a nice glow and it doesn&#x27;t feel oily.</li>
            <li>Timely delivery, nice packaging.</li>
            <li>It feels nice going on the skin</li>
            <li>I like this product, feels nice.</li>
            <li>But honestly, I don&#x27;t see any difference and am wondering why I bought it.</li>
            <li>This is not a one of a kind product.</li>
            <li>Just make it smell nice.  </li>
            <li>I noticed this was a popular item</li>
            <li>I am loving this product.  </li>
            <li>Nice fancy bottle.</li>
            <li>I waited some time to write my review to see what kind of results I would get.  </li>
            <li>I will purchase this effective serum again when I&#x27;m done with this bottle.</li>
            <li>It absorcion is so faster and effective.</li>
            <li>Nice product, thank you</li>
            <li>Really nice serum, it&#x60;s nicely absorbs</li>
            <li>I liked it for the two weeks</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if it was effective</li>
            <li>Kind of pricy for what you get.</li>
            <li>Really is the BEST hyaluronic serum I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I thought this would be effective.  </li>
            <li>I liked the serum alot.  </li>
            <li>Goes on nicely, face feels smoother to the touch</li>
            <li>but it sure feels good.  </li>
            <li>I was so dissapointed because I loved the results with Hyaluronic acid and was worried I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use it.  </li>
            <li>MY  SKIN  IS  NICE  </li>

            <li>Makes my skin feel nice</li>
            <li>but it does make the skin feel nice &amp; claims to help lock in moisture after washing face or showering</li>
            <li>This felt nice</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell or have any kind of acidic taste.  </li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel nice.</li>

            <li>If the price sounds too good to be true, it is.</li>
            <li>it looked too good to be true, it probably was.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>But, since I dont use Botox, the fine lines and textural problems do tend to creep in!  </li>
            <li>Before I finished one bottle, others could even notice a reduction of fine lines!  </li>
            <li>Very light feel.</li>
            <li>Very light weight and not at all oily.  </li>
            <li>It becomes very smooth.</li>
            <li>The box looks a very cheap.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel very smooth.</li>
            <li>One of the reviews said that the product was like water and that reviewer would be correct the consistency is very light</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend and definitely a good price!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and smooths my skin nicely.  </li>
            <li>I bought 1 the first time and just bought 2 more and plan to buy more at this great price.</li>
            <li>Considering the ingredients aren&#x27;t all that spectacular, you can easily find dozens of hyaluronic acid serums with better ingredients and a greater amount of product for the money.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve seen a difference in some fine lines that were kind of developing around the eye area, but I also just got a chemical peel</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the applicator, it keeps the product in the bottle clean..</li>
            <li>I am happy to say that after a week of use I am certainly seeing some differences in the pore sizes as well as the firmness of my skin.</li>
            <li>which is where I&#x27;m really expressive and have large expression lines.</li>
            <li>So far seems like a very good product</li>
            <li>A huge joke!</li>
            <li>really nice serum, leaves the face feeling smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li>If it does as well as the reviews says it does, then it will deserve a five star rating:)</li>
            <li>As I use it I realize that there is more in there</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I have two of the serums.</li>
            <li>It looks noticeably more hydrated.</li>
            <li>my opinion- requaire more time to see all the posives efects</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m using this more as a prevention method than a cure.  </li>
            <li>It is okay used as a moisturizer but not what</li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found using Tarte Marjacula Oil every night to be a much better treatment for my skin.</li>
            <li>It is mostly water but doesn&#x27;t moisturize skin or help wrinkles disappear.  </li>
            <li>but I wish more was in it.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>I am glad I found it.</li>
            <li>I love the way the product feels when applied.</li>
            <li>If I had bought a cheaper moisturizing cream, may have been much better.</li>
            <li>for nothing worthwhile.</li>
            <li>and I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>After 3 weeks with morning and bedtime use have started noticing a brighter more youthful appearance to my skin.</li>
            <li>Have been using the serum for several weeks and my skin feels wonderful...</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I will give it some more time to see results.</li>
            <li>I simply love this product too...</li>
            <li>You can do better at the drugstore.</li>
            <li>Love this potion.</li>
            <li>I will keep using this product to see how much better my face gets.</li>
            <li>I love the texture and feel of this serum...</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a serum which would give the most noticeable results for the aging skin (my skin).  </li>
            <li>Soft and smooth and feels great!</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin more luminous.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I will order more before I run out on it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t return the product since it has been over a month ago, but SURE I will never ever order this brand again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I used it.  </li>
            <li>Even the bottle has an elegant feel to it.  </li>
            <li>I love 180 Cosmetics.</li>
            <li>This is great product and Vitamin C works really well to plump up the skin.  </li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>She said this product is really working great</li>
            <li>Great serum with high percentage of hyaluronic acid AND vitamin c!  </li>
            <li>I thought the volume of serum was more when I ordered it.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely fantastic serum!</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better one.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering more soon.  </li>
            <li>Light and not greasy!  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling fantastic!</li>
            <li>Just try it, your skin will love you for it.</li>
            <li>There are much better choice for comparable products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this 5 stars because I absolutely love the product, but there is one caveat, the size.</li>
            <li>I have since added a product containing retinol for even better results</li>
            <li>I Imagined it more thicker</li>
            <li>I love that fact that its not oily, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my fingers or face feeling oily.</li>
            <li>ok no problem.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s improved the lines between my eyes most of all.</li>
            <li>This product is ok, but there are better.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, you need more.  </li>
            <li>I think this is a product that will be on my face regiment for many years to come at 59.  </li>
            <li>I look glowing and my turkey neck is in much better shape.  </li>
            <li>The 180 Cosmetics brand is more luxurious, has vitamin C, and works even better.  </li>
            <li>He gave me a recovery serum from Melanopeel made with argan oil which gave me better results.</li>
            <li>It feels like water on the skin - LOVE it and will continue to order it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: This product was sent to me for free for review, but all opinions 100% honest and unbiased</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m going to order more.</li>
            <li>Like many products  </li>
            <li>but it does moisturize very well, and makes my skin look great.</li>
            <li>I ordered two bottles this time, just to see if using it for more than a month would make a difference.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and I am hoping this will help the serum work better.</li>
            <li>This product was ok</li>
            <li>Most people claim I look 35 anyway, so maybe I&#x27;m a bit premature with all of this.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, without redness, and my skin has a nice glow as a result of it.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately</li>
            <li>Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Worth the money and works even BETTER when used with a micro needles roller or a microdermibrasion buffer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If nothing else it makes me feel like I look better.</li>
            <li>My skin looks my better.</li>
            <li>I want more....</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>but I had tried another brand that had more of a tightening property to it</li>
            <li>After trying many products, I found this to work similarily as others.  </li>
            <li>but for now, I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>I like it - it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I Love it...</li>
            <li>so have ordered more.</li>

            <li>I found the more</li>
            <li>I used it the more</li>
            <li>I was completely satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li>i did love it</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Love that product, you will too</li>
            <li>I am still looking for a better product l didn&#x27;t like the alcohol content in this product I would have preferred more of the vitamin C and hyaluronic acid.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much better my skin looks already&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I plan to order some more and see if it just takes time to work</li>
            <li>re-ordered the Swiss Formula because i got better and quicker results.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have had many may compliments on the smoothness and glow it</li>
            <li>Seems to work okay, but nothing beats Dr. perricone nueropeptide.</li>
            <li>I waited to review this until I was sure of how this product affected my skin.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic Product!  </li>
            <li>But the rest are ok.</li>
            <li>so I oredered one more time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pretty sure there has been improvement in my skin/wrinkles</li>
            <li>I need more of a moisturizing product.</li>
            <li>I love the anti aging.</li>
            <li>I need to use a longer time to see more the properties.</li>
            <li>I ordered more and will see if more skin improvement.</li>
            <li>Skin already feels better.</li>
            <li>Should know more after a weeks use.  </li>
            <li>She was pleased with it and has been using it.</li>
            <li>but I feel that using this product will help prevent more damage.</li>
            <li>I love the combo of</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thicker and more concentrated that others.</li>
            <li>I love the product.  </li>
            <li>most all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If so, please do not send me any more.</li>
            <li>I use this at night mostly...</li>
            <li>(your skin doing most of it&#x27;s regenerating then)</li>
            <li>I will order more soon.</li>
            <li>an exellent product, timely delivery,was what I ordered extremely satisfied.  </li>

            <li>love the way it feels</li>
            <li>test it and make sure it works.  </li>
            <li>Please keep your cost as it is for ones to buy more of it.  </li>
            <li>It has nice consistency, almost gooey and applies on smoothly to your skin.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>For a product that I use twice a day, I thought I would see more improvement.</li>
            <li>I love it,  </li>
            <li>Sincerely, Alice</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Will continue to use some more.</li>
            <li>it is ok.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve seen anything magical, but I do believe it&#x27;s helping to keep my skin more moisturized (without breaking me out...</li>
            <li>but I do love the feeling of the tightening effect after application.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem any better than vitamin C, you get what u pay for</li>
            <li>box itself was not sealed, which would of been okay if the product itself was sealed.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s cheap, so take a chance!</li>
            <li>have tried many products and</li>
            <li>I love the product and have used it for years.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have visible age spots on my face, but I do see areas on my cheeks, nose and forehead that are damaged by too many hours in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The improvement I&#x27;ve noticed the most is the improvement in the elasticity of my skin.  </li>
            <li>My neck looks firmer and my face just looks more rested and</li>
            <li>than that, I didn&#x27;t have many wrinkles to begin with</li>
            <li>It feels refreshing on the face.</li>
            <li>I ordered more to share with her.</li>
            <li>Glad I had seen this advertisement on tv.</li>
            <li>If anything I feel like my acne has gotten better.</li>
            <li>Love it, love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>and I think a better product.</li>
            <li>keeping that glow that I love.</li>
            <li>:) Going to look for a cheaper alternative, but I would recommend for wrinkles and acne.</li>
            <li>I hope I feel better because my skin hurts a lot.</li>
            <li>My skin has improved the more I use it.</li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>if &amp;#34;I love it&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>and I love what it has done for my face.</li>
            <li>In the morning I do see my skin more refreshed.</li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>Ok so I have this serum in my possession close to 3 weeks and quite frankly  there is no difference to my skin.</li>
            <li>Love it, can see a change already</li>
            <li>thanks for a great product.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll test the product out and see if it seems OK to use but based on how it was shipped I will not be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li>I am glad to have tried this product.</li>
            <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t pay a lot, and got to try it out</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>i love it ..</li>
            <li>It has worked phenomenally with the peels and hydration masks I have started to repair years of sun damage and to turn my skin around.</li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>okay still waitting.</li>
            <li>Will give it one more week.</li>
            <li>much more even!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Most of cosmetic bottles that I&#x27;ve used are not like this.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for two weeks and the results keep getting better by the day.</li>
            <li>this is not the cheapest product out there with the same ingredients but the results are wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I love it and will continue to buy from this seller.</li>
            <li>I have seen a notable difference in my skin since using this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok....</li>
            <li>This is ok just need to use more of it .</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>However I must say I see a glow and a more youthful look already.</li>
            <li>Really love this product.  </li>
            <li>so I will probably need more sooner than if you just use it on your face and neck.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure it will take a gallon at my age.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>love it..</li>
            <li>Though not a &#x27;sun worshiper,&#x27; I do love yard work and being outdoors.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>be sure you have time to wait for it.</li>
            <li>skin looks better already after two days of use.</li>
            <li>Just OK.</li>
            <li>I would say that I would recommend it if I knew more about it</li>
            <li>The only reason I don&#x27;t give it five stars is because the smell is not the best.</li>
            <li>have tried many products</li>
            <li>but this product is at the top of my list for effectiveness.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is a gel.</li>
            <li>I noticed that it is better used with another moisturizer on top.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin silky smooth and glowing!</li>
            <li>&quot; and more of the acid, or if it is because of the vitamin C in it.  </li>
            <li>I bet you will love it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t notice any difference like so many others reported seeing.</li>
            <li>I had brought this after seeing so many 5 star review.</li>
            <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>

            <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>I look better, I can tell it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>Maybe my skin is just to thirsty and needs more.  </li>
            <li>recommend that product for sure.</li>
            <li>so you have to stop using the dropper to be able to use all of the product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I just wish there was a bit more to the product</li>
            <li>and I want to order more of it.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hopeful with more time</li>
            <li>there will be more noticeable results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>recommend this product, whether it works miracles or not, it does help my skin look better and stay moist.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll buy more .</li>
            <li>I would give more stars if they offered a bulk purchasing option.</li>
            <li>I look forward to seeing more results as time goes by.</li>
            <li>I love this serum.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my skin feel once I apply it.  </li>
            <li>I have skin that is allergic to many products and this works well without irritation and since I also have combination skin maybe it would cause breakouts</li>
            <li>I love the way the product makes my face feel.</li>
            <li>I sure hope it works soon.</li>
            <li>Excellent product to use daily.</li>
            <li>wish that I could be more helpful to you.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Im gonna use this product again and again:)</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t feel like serum but water and the package appeared tampered with...not sure where...possibly in transit...</li>
            <li>I sometimes touch up with more dabs of this serum throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>I bought more of this product and have been using it now for months and still love it.  </li>
            <li>Bottle was not sealed properly so most of the product was gone before it got to me; felt it may have lost its effectiveness.</li>
            <li>I need more.</li>
            <li>This is another awesome product for next to nothing.</li>
            <li>Keep healthy skin face</li>
            <li>I love the product but did not pay attention to the size of the item.  </li>
            <li>and I can already tell a difference in my wrinkles and age spots, can&#x27;t afford a face lift and not so sure that would be the way to go anyway</li>
            <li>Very happy with this product, in fact, have purchased a second bottle.  </li>
            <li>and I am still upset I wasn&#x27;t able to finish the bottle.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not nasty but maybe a bit herbal?</li>
            <li>it absorbs through the skin and leaves my skin glowing and healthy.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to any woman over 40 who wants a great product.</li>
            <li>I have been using them for many many months.  </li>
            <li>not that I have that many...</li>
            <li>I love the style like serumwhat</li>
            <li>Skin feels more hydrated and plumper.</li>
            <li>This is, possibly, the best product I&#x27;ve ever found in the &#x27;fountain of youth&#x27; category...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Hoping that trying out for 2 more weeks will have better results.  </li>
            <li>I love the way my skin feels after using this serum.  </li>
            <li>feels much more hydrated.</li>
            <li>As a forty-something woman, I decided I needed to start taking better care of my skin.  </li>
            <li>Great bargain and arrived fast.</li>
            <li>and I can put sunscreen on top for daytime.</li>
            <li>This is awesome and it last all day!</li>
            <li>I found something better</li>
            <li>buy more, I hope for a better offer</li>
            <li>I put this on and magically they disappear.</li>
            <li>am so happy I found this and at such a good price.</li>
            <li>I will be getting more of this serum.</li>
            <li>more time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly and I&#x27;m very satisfied because it&#x27;s absorbs well and won&#x27;t leave your face cakey like some products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased and will become a loyal customer.</li>
            <li>With 180° Cosmetics Pure Swiss Hyaluronic Serum + Oxygen, your skin gets the nourishing ingredients it needs to stay toned, smooth, rejuvenated, and beautiful.</li>
            <li>so far so good!</li>
            <li>Yes, so far so good!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m picky about the ingredients I put on my skin (which is a large, absorbent organ!), and this serum is formulated with good ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m picky about the ingredients I put on my skin (which is a large, absorbent organ!), and this serum is formulated with good ingredients.  </li>
            <li>It has no smell, which is good when it comes to serums, because most of the serums I&#x27;ve come into contact with always have a funny smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t write reviews but this product is great.</li>
            <li>His skin is pretty good for his age</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful product for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>loved the product the first time I ordered it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was excited to try out this serum!</li>
            <li>Well, I was so excited about this purchase!</li>
            <li>More smooth and more</li>
            <li>Nice light serum, not sticky and fragrance free.</li>
            <li>It goes very nicely and absorbs quickly so I can apply my moisturize right after.</li>
            <li>I tried another that was well rated and did not get the quick, beautiful results as I did with the 180 pure Swiss product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not designed nor effective for us older girls!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with it so far!</li>
            <li>This is great so far!  </li>
            <li>Very light and comfortable on the skin.</li>
            <li>I never skip the 3-5 minutes it takes to clean and nourish my face, and it pays off!  </li>
            <li>Hopefully I&#x27;ll&lt;br /&gt;be able to give you a fine review once I&#x27;ve tried it for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;Thnaks</li>
            <li>I am hopeful, however, that soon I will see some progress in eliminating or significantly reducing my more prominent wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Also I like that the ingredients are more straightforward than most serums.</li>
            <li>but hey, I&#x27;m okay with a quick fix when I want it!  </li>
            <li>I really loved the Ultima Pure Swiss Hyaluranic Acid Serum</li>

            <li>I love the light scent and the way it does not make my face feel oily.</li>
            <li>I used it after one week, I felt the difference,my skin being more smooth.</li>
            <li>A Great price for a quality product that is proven skin care nourishment and keeps aging skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li>Love it it makes your skin feel so smooth.</li>
            <li>Thus far, it is great.</li>
            <li>So far, I am happy with the product and hopeful that it will improve the condition of my face and hand skin challenges.  </li>
            <li>So far I have not seen any great changes in my skin</li>

            <li>It just more of an original shape.</li>
            <li>Not exactly the best hyaluronic acid out there.</li>
            <li>I apply under other products for best results.  .</li>
            <li>I like this serum much better than I originally thought I would.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, and am excited to know the benefits of vitamin C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Marie</li>

            <li>I have been looking for a moisturizer that would last more than an hour or two and thought I&#x27;d try this as I heard hyaluronic acid was a great moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>This is an easy to use serum</li>
            <li>It is easy to use. .</li>

            <li>I contacted them (very quick reply).  </li>
            <li>: easy to apply but after 3 weeks, I don&#x27;t see any difference/improvement.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>Excellent for aging skin or anyone else who wants to keep skin looking young.</li>
            <li>It absorbs into the skin very quickly and leaves no oily feel.  </li>
            <li>My face feels and looks plumper, more full....did not expect such great results....</li>

            <li>Easy to spread on face.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much I purchased 5 more.</li>
            <li>Instructions are easy to follow.  </li>
            <li>I was given this serum and totally loved the way it made my face feel so soft, when I ran out I ordered more.  </li>
            <li>It does absorb quickly and is very light.</li>
            <li>but I was really impressed at how quickly my skin absorbed the serum and how soft and smooth my face looked in the morning.</li>
            <li>Produced nice dewy results at first.</li>
            <li>but to those of you that wish to spend the money go for it, it feels nice on the skin, and the bottle is pretty.</li>
            <li>I will know more after a full bottle use.</li>
            <li>In the last 2 days, 4 of my friends all commented on how beautiful I looked, and asked if I had changed my makeup or hairstyle.</li>
            <li>My beautiful daughter is the last person in the world that needs this</li>
            <li>Product looks nice in a pretty bottle but it did not perform as it advertised.  </li>
            <li>I liked the feel of the product while using the first bottle, but I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement.  </li>

            <li>it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>My fine lines around my eyes are smoother, the crease inbetween</li>
            <li>It tightens up the skin and reduces fine lines.</li>
            <li>It visibly reduces fine lines around my eyes.  </li>

            <li>The fine lines around my lips have all but disappeared.  </li>
            <li>It seems to me that they do lessen fine lines and they do lighten daker spots.  </li>
            <li>I use it with the derma roller and it seems to be working fine.</li>

            <li>I really like how it goes on nice and smooth, and i don&#x27;t feel like I need moisturizer after I put it on.</li>
            <li>I just used it once and noticed a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>I like the product, but it was not a 30 day supply to make an accurate assessment.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of serums like this one.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed a huge difference  in my skin.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous product.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your skin silky smooth</li>

            <li>Its feels so amazingly smooth and not oily at all.  </li>
            <li>but this product is gentle and effective.  </li>
            <li>This is odor free.</li>
            <li>Item as described, smooth transaction.</li>
            <li>Makeup can go over it smoothly.  </li>
            <li>This serum feels nice, but it really burned after microneedling with my derma roller and my skin reacted.</li>
            <li>I applied it morning and night, make up goes on smoothly over it.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really see that much of a difference, but it was nice because after you put it on it tighten up your face so that&#x27;s was nice.</li>
            <li>I do like the way it glides over my face, however I enjoy using a product that leaves the skin feeling moist.  </li>

            <li>of course the price was cheap and it must be a reason.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping nice item</li>
            <li>I smooth it in after using a needle roller.</li>
            <li>skin looks smooth</li>
            <li>It is absolutely fantastic on my rosaesa face with pores....</li>
            <li>what I like the most about this one  is the texture of my skin, which is smoother, fresh and moist-looking.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t get glowing wrinkle free skin either .&lt;br</li>
            <li>Softens the skin and makes it feel so smooth.</li>

            <li>Nice but soaks up fast</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made my face skin so smooth.</li>
            <li>Tried 3 drops on my face and felt smooth immediately.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>noticeable smooth skin results within 3 days...</li>
            <li>begins to tighten and smooth.  </li>
            <li>gives me a smooth texture.  </li>
            <li>The line on my face filled out, cellulite is leaving and stretch marks are fading away.  </li>
            <li>Smooth, would purchase again.</li>
            <li>The bottle looks cheaply made and the product does not do anything at all to my skin.</li>
            <li>The price is great for the quality;but, wish it came in a larger size.</li>
            <li>AND  REALLY  SMOOTH.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just trying to smooth out the wrinkles some.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin look and feel smooth.  </li>
            <li>I was about to be cheap and order another brand</li>
            <li>If she likes it then it has to truly be a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>This feels so light on the skin and doesn&#x27;t make the skin oily or greasy.</li>
            <li>I can tell such a great difference in my appearance and</li>
            <li>Seems to be great, only have been using it for a week.</li>
            <li>I did not notice any fantastic results.</li>
            <li>This serum makes my face feel smooth</li>
            <li>and, that is important to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was looking for a light anti aging moisturizer to go with it.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smoothly and feels like silk.</li>
            <li>My cheeks are smooth.  </li>
            <li>it just feels light when it&#x27;s applied.  </li>
            <li>the few drops I tried were awesome..</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t gotten any younger LOL.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the product: 180 Cosmetics,  Hyaluronic Acid Serum + Vitamin C.</li>
            <li>After complaining they sent me a knew one which came great the second time.</li>
            <li>smooth skin in one week of use.</li>
            <li>This is nice after doing home micro-dermabrasion and helps with healing and collagen production, but you have to be consistent in using it to get the full results.</li>
            <li>So far I like this product, feels good on the skin.  </li>
            <li>far so good</li>
            <li>So far item feel good on the skin, will have to use for a longer time to give a five star.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>I have just started using this product and so far so good.  </li>
            <li>So far so good, still waiting to see all results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had acne for years and recently started doing diamond microdermabrasion, which on its own is effective but takes time.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Love this product , love the price , absolutely fantastic fast results.</li>
            <li>I am 74 years old and have always taken good care of my skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks, you have a great priduct that really works.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my new serum.</li>
            <li>So for right now I have to say It&#x27;s okay because I am not done using it.</li>
            <li>: Make sure you check it right away after you receive it.</li>
            <li>I typically do not use serums, as I&#x27;ve never gotten particularly good results with any I&#x27;ve tried, so don&#x27;t incur the expense of buying them.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>Really like this serum!!!</li>
            <li>Best results if you let it soak in and dry completely before &amp;#34;layering&amp;#34; with your favorite moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Important to apply to clean</li>
            <li>effective when you consider for me it averaged out to $4-$5/month for a decent skincare product.</li>
            <li>The makers have managed to hit upon that perfect consistency--- not too thick and sticky, yet not so watery that you can&#x27;t apply it easily.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and the results were very noticeable and rewarding.</li>
            <li>and I was not disappointed it has made my eyes look 100%</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say that I can tell a significant difference  in my skin around my eyes which is where I needed it.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin softer than the other brands I have tried, and I love the texture of it... not just watery liquid (like most HA serums), but this one has a slightly more viscous texture, which is lovely.  </li>
            <li>I am taking off one star from my original rating.to</li>
            <li>I am taking off one star from my original rating.</li>
            <li>So far, am very pleased with product.  </li>
            <li>Not disappointed though.</li>
            <li>:) thanks!</li>
            <li>and  I was so excited.  </li>
            <li>Smile lines (aka parentheses) have almost vanished!</li>
            <li>so I was excited to try the serum to see if it helped.</li>
            <li>I ordered 2 more bottles as the price went up from the first time I ordered.</li>
            <li>Now that the top layer is almost exfoliated, the skin underneath is looking better than ever, and feels soft as a baby!</li>
            <li>When used with the roller ball, there is a significant reduction in skin pores and the texture of your skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure, but I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed by this.</li>
            <li>My original review said that I thought that this product gave me rash</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get it.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
            <li>At first, I had to use a lot more than I do now.  </li>
            <li>It helps replenish the moisture content of aging and environmentally damaged skin, restores youthful radiance, smooths the look of fine lines, and helps increase the skin&#x27;s ability to retain moisture, leaving skin fresh and fabulous.</li>
            <li>Fine lines leaving, laugh lines filled out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and is easily absorbed.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to be absorbed.</li>
            <li>During that time, I really liked how fast it absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li>After hearing that both hyaluronic acid and topical vitamin C were good for firming skin and protecting it from free radicals, I started to look for a product.  </li>
            <li>I have had similar experiences with a MAC Studio fix powder that I got from Amazon on good discout and it turned out a duplicate (confirmed).</li>
            <li>This is, by far, the best facial product I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li>I will see more positive results.</li>
            <li>and I am expecting more positive results.</li>
            <li>I wish I could write something more positive.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is very effective, and I have had only success using this with my clients!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, I do love this product, and I do think it is noticeably superior to other brands I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the packaging the bottle and dropper top are super classy looking</li>
            <li>I have many large pores on my face</li>
            <li>I have tried pure Hyaluronic Acid before, but this one combines Vit. C with HA, and it seems to work better.</li>
            <li>Not anything special.  </li>
            <li>so I think it will take more than using Pure Swiss for 2 weeks to see a difference.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I found 180 Pure Swiss.</li>
            <li>and my face was bright red.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good so far, noticing a difference....</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used long but impressed so far with product.  </li>
            <li>in pictures my skin looks like its of a 15 yr old girl, amazing.</li>
            <li>I really think I&#x27;m enjoying this</li>
            <li>It arrived fairly timely but just not enough usage yet to determine efficacy.</li>
            <li>Good stuff but its not very big...</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>That being said, the product is so good that I AM constantly re-ordering.</li>
            <li>Also, I think the bottle is very well designed and elegant.  </li>
            <li>To be fair - I have only used it for 3 days - but I can see some results already.  </li>
            <li>This was 3/4 full.  </li>
            <li>It is too early to tell how effective it is.</li>
            <li>Just beginning to use this product and so far loving the affect on my skin.</li>
            <li>I have ordered another bottle, hoping it will be full.  </li>
            <li>but I never see any difference with any wrinkle cream that I use the only good thing</li>
            <li>So a rating I would say give me a full month.</li>
            <li>and I love it, but didn&#x27;t really like the price.  </li>
            <li>the serum feels nice, but as far as what it will do for my skin</li>
            <li>My skin feel soft and nice.</li>
            <li>I love this so much.</li>
            <li>I use some Lancome products and this is as effective and natural, unlike all the additives in Lancome.</li>
            <li>I am in my late 30&#x27;s and want wrinkle and pimple prevention!&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I am very impressed with this and have seen a noticeable change taking place already.</li>
            <li>It will be interesting to see if the Ultima makes as much change as the Mary Kay does.</li>
            <li>I absolute love this product</li>
            <li>I have been looking for something to keep my skin feeling soft and nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: I did end up receiving a full refund.</li>
            <li>We love it, we did a lots of research before purchase and came up with a promising result.</li>
            <li>It has a nice soft texture.</li>
            <li>I am getting ready to reorder, I have found some wrinkle changes that aren&#x27;t there any more</li>
            <li>Price is not bad either.</li>
            <li>First time user; so far so good</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly, leaves the skin baby-soft to touch and feeling fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li>my skin looks so smooth, I definitely plan to order more!</li>
            <li>It is perfect for a special evening out because it tightens the skin instantly and keeps that look for several hours.</li>
            <li>At first my skin reacted with dome raised pores that emptied quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>Purchase was fine, but have not used product enough to know how effective it is.</li>
            <li>Makes my face nice and plump vanishing any super fine lines instantly.  </li>
            <li>In the morning I follow up with 50 spf cc cream from It Cosmetics and my skin, which tends to get oily, feels fresh and clean all day.</li>
            <li>but it seems as though I&#x27;m running through it quickly.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll be lucky to get another couple of weeks out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>It dries quickly and leaves skin feeling super</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Intense hydration in a super concentrated 75 percent hyaluronic acid serum helps keep the skin hydrated all day and night with an invisible veil of moisture.</li>
            <li>My skin feels like it is getting more of the serum in each drop rather than having to put more on to make it feel like I have coated my face properly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick drying and doesn&#x27;t leave that gunky serum feel on my face.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quick.</li>
            <li>but it dries  quickly.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and as described</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It is not oily and soaks into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li>Noticeable difference to skin tone, absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>I like the product , quick delivery</li>
            <li>One drop is adequate to cover your face.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand companies that overcharge when they&#x27;ll make more keeping at a decent price.  </li>
            <li>Better products out there that actually work better too</li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly in a well-packed container.</li>
            <li>Time will work its magic; I&#x27;ve only just begun. :)</li>
            <li>It spreads around like a light gel, when it dries it seems to clear up my pores so my moisturizer will soak in better.  </li>
            <li>and I even saw a mild peeling, nothing noticeable after applying moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It soaks in quickly.</li>
            <li>My skin drinks it up quickly.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy, it absorbs quickly and I am seeing a difference in the tightness of my face.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and helps skin to feel smoother after 1 use.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feeling.  </li>
            <li>I thought my face was looking older with more wrinkles after 4 days of use</li>
            <li>Thanks for such a great product.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping and packaged well.  </li>
            <li>With so many crucial vitamins and anti-aging ingredients, this packs it in for the price. :-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure with regular use the impact would be greater.</li>
            <li>I like it very much it leaves my skin silky smooth</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the performance of the product and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This product is so clean, I&#x27;ve had no negative reaction to it which says a lot about this product!!!</li>
            <li>I have ordered this due to all the good reviews it had, but trust me when I say this, I&#x27;m very aware of all the fine lines I have</li>
            <li>Worked like a charm, from the very first try.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if the lovely texture and better results are due to the addition of Vitamin C (which supposedly has superb anti-aging properties) or something else.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, Watts did not have the added vitamin C, which is supposed to be a powerful anti-aging and collagen producing ingredient, and the type of vitamin C that 180 Cosmetics uses is indeed the very best and most expensive type, which is the gentlest on the skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is pretty cheap and lasts me about a month.&lt;br /&gt;So</li>
            <li>I am sure by using it a few more weeks-there will be an even more noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this products that I had purchased recently.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth trying and at a great price compared to other products.  </li>
            <li>After trying other products through the years, this by far is the best and for the price it is unbeatable in my option.</li>
            <li>The very first use, I noticed the difference.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty fantastic.</li>
            <li>No unpleasant scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&amp;#34;180&#x27; Cosmetics Pure Swiss Hyaluronic Serum + Vitamin C&amp;#34; is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>very wonderful.she love it very much.</li>
            <li>I love the product but will probably look for a new place to provide it to me.</li>
            <li>I found it absorbed quickly allowing me to get on with my morning and night routines.  </li>
            <li>I had been using it for the last month, i have to say it is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve been able to find long-term (as in 6-8 hours) relief from my skin drying out so much that it burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>A bit sticky compared to Keihl&#x27;s product, but feels good once dry.  </li>
            <li>I do like the who easy and fast</li>
            <li>Love this my skin is very sensitive  </li>
            <li>I will be back for more!</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more!</li>
            <li>SHe also stated it does not take much at each use!!</li>
            <li>Love it for the first time in a while my skin glows:) Will definitely get another bottle when I finish this 1.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it as well and like it enough to purchase more!</li>
            <li>I love it so far!</li>
            <li>I was pretty excited for this to come in bc of all the ratings on it.  </li>
            <li>So I tried it, and I really like it...!!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li>I applied the product in both the morning and evening right after cleansing with a mildly exfoliating cleanser like Neutrogena Pore Minimizer and toner like Sea Breeze.</li>
            <li>I appreciate the product and a very good source for beauty aide, but it is hard...</li>
            <li>Order came super fast, classy box for the serum, nice for gift giving, but I won&#x27;t be doing that.  </li>
            <li>It really eliminated fine lines and reduced a lot of the deeper lines around the eye area.  </li>
            <li>I gently rub it into fine lines...</li>
            <li>It is so light, almost feels like pure water, I used it during night in the summer by itself.</li>
            <li>super smooth serum, dries fast, the smell is a big turn off but who cares when the results are so amazing.</li>
            <li>After a little over a week of use I have not seen any changes in my skin but the product feels great.  </li>
            <li>have tested several different hyaluronic acids out there and 180 Pure Swiss has given me the best results out of them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly</li>
            <li>In just moments, this amazing serum penetrates deep into the skin, nourishing it from the core.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Immediately after applying, I could tell that my skin was going to feel amazing after just a short time!  </li>
            <li>This product is truly amazing, I keep it on my night stand and apply it religiously every night.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and is very soothing.</li>
            <li>I have even gotten a few comments on how great my skin looks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>From the very fist time I feel my skin so smooth and regenerated..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this serum for just 2 days, and that too only in the morning, cannot believe how amazing this product is.</li>
            <li>Really makes my skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li>Hopefully my sharing this information will lead to a more accurate product description with age recommendations included so others like me won&#x27;t make the same mistake.</li>
            <li>Also is useful as under light-weight foundation.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled that the results are noticeable and have made such a change.</li>
            <li>It would be nice to have a bigger bottle of the product.  </li>
            <li>It was so soft and smooth!  </li>
            <li>however,somedays I wake up and think it almost makes me look more wrinkly and older...could be my imagination, but I don&#x27;t notice any considerable difference.  </li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not crazy about the sticky feeling it leaves on  my face, once I put my moisturizer on</li>
            <li>Really works great after derma rolling my face, though it really would turn your face really red when you applied it</li>
            <li>I think I will need to use the serum for several weeks before I can tell if it is effective</li>
            <li>but I love how soft it makes my skin.</li>
            <li>but it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>However, I like the way the product goes on and seems to be absorbed well.</li>
            <li>feel I am getting my moneys worth with this product....</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>But so far I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try a different serum or make my own finding ingredients on amazon.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary sample of 180 Cosmetics serum for testing and review purposes.</li>
            <li>I received a complimentary sample of 180 Cosmetics serum for testing and review purposes.</li>
            <li>Just started to use, so far okay.  </li>
            <li>I am a 61 year old Gentleman and I was blessed with healthy skin but</li>
            <li>I got MAYBE 2 weeks worth out of it.</li>
            <li>I started using the serum last year and I am thrilled with the results, as well as the quality of the product.</li>
            <li>But for this price, it worth it a try.</li>
            <li>This serum proves it.</li>
            <li>It is well worth its price.</li>
            <li>find it an economical product because the amount of serum needed for is just one drop.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>My skin appears  to be more radiant, clear.</li>
            <li>Skin feels more supple and soft.</li>
            <li>Once that is totally absorbed into my skin, I apply a moisturizing sunscreen by Neutrogena.  </li>
            <li>Worked on a smile line.</li>
            <li>I had to go back using the kind I already have.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It DOES NOT sting and for me who has sensitive skin, that matters most.</li>
            <li>I bought the product to use on the smile lines or folds on both sides of my mouth.  </li>
            <li>this product leaves my skin feeling fresh &amp; silky.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and holds moisturizer better when Ultima is under it.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed applying the product to my skin, which has a tendency to be somewhat sensitive.</li>
            <li>I chose this product because I have been in search of something that would help smooth my wrinkles and improve my overall skin tone and, for the most part,  it has DELIVERED</li>
            <li>My skin felt fresh and looked healthier.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll worth the price.</li>
            <li>I am using the serum with phytoceramides and in less than a month the results are amazing!  </li>
            <li>That being said, apply it quickly, as it dries fast!</li>
            <li>I fould another good deal on this product with some other things</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other stuff before and nothing is as good as this.</li>
            <li>The price is right and affordable.  </li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m not using it right or something, but I don&#x27;t have time to play.</li>
            <li>and I can see a tightening right away.  </li>
            <li>The product stays in place right where it is needed.</li>
            <li>Right now I&#x27;m neutral.  </li>
            <li>My scowl was turning into a permanent river right between the eyes.</li>
            <li>and I can see a tightening right away.</li>
            <li>I could notice a difference right away.</li>
            <li>Then I wait an hour in a cool room and apply a couple other products.&lt;br /&gt;You can be rid of many crow&#x27;s feet fine lines in about a week.</li>
            <li>I thought from all the positive feedback this would be very moisturizing, but on my skin which is very nice but dry, it has done nothing.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know how long it takes to get good results</li>
            <li>Well worth the price and much more affordable than buying a less concentrated version in many of the moisturizers you will find on the market.</li>
            <li>I am 57 and my skin has held up remarkably but it is starting to show some signs of being 57 with marionette lines near my mouth and lines around my lips and my under eye area has bags.  </li>
            <li>I only put 3 stars at this time but I like how its easy to apply &amp; absorbs quickly but its too soon to comment on how it works.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li>It is a Nice product, I felt it helped with some fine lines, very light feeling on the face, I used it up fast, very small bottle, I would use it again and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>So far very good and can see a difference after less than 2 vials.  </li>
            <li>I found absolutely nothing special about this product.</li>
            <li>My skin seems more more even toned with less lines.</li>
            <li>We are very conscious about using a good stuff in our daily life.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li>It is wonderful for all skin types, and especially for mature facial skin, both for women and men.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>I have bought several different hyaluronic acid serum products before and this is the best so far.</li>
            <li>Worth difference in higher price but again not alot in quantity.</li>
            <li>and I found it light not thick.</li>
            <li>This stuff takes 6 months of silt use to REALLY give your skin the full benefits.</li>
            <li>After only using one body I have seen a huge difference in the diminished appearance of fine lines around my lips/ mouth.</li>
            <li>Who could ask for more.&lt;br /&gt;Brings back the softness and helps smooth out fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>Like this particular serum say, original price was $89.89 and is being sold for $14.43 (84% discount).</li>
            <li>Get it right the first time.</li>
            <li>but it certainly does not help after!  </li>
            <li>a product i will certainly buy again!</li>
            <li>Very helpful and quick response time</li>
            <li>Liked what was left in the bottle, I see the difference absolutely....</li>
            <li>I am a 69 year old female with fairly good skin (</li>
            <li>hasnt been that long..maybe i can review better in a few more weeks</li>
            <li>Spreads very well and the skin absorbs it quickly.  </li>
            <li>After a nice cleansing skin massage using a face brush, splash on a toner and dry.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product and will be ordering more, has helped my sensitive skin quit a bit.  </li>
            <li>I really feel like this stuff was cheap because it is not the real stuff.  </li>
            <li>I use it every morning, and maybe I shouldn&#x27;t use as much as I do, but hey, if it&#x27;s not broken, don&#x27;t fit it.  </li>
            <li>The product absorbed quickly and it was fine to apply my regular skin care regiment over it.  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied and will keep ordering due to the results</li>
            <li>just goes right into your skin and makes it look smooth and soft yet</li>
            <li>Very reasonably prices as well.</li>
            <li>This product is watery and dries very fast on your skin.  </li>
            <li>also  appreciate it&#x27;s very reasonable</li>
            <li>I very much hopes product works as stated.  </li>
            <li>I like this stuff very much and will use it again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have any smell, absorbs very fast, doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t like it very much .the</li>
            <li>I like this product very much.</li>
            <li>thank you very much.</li>
            <li>Very fast delivary</li>
            <li>Very gentle serum</li>
            <li>I like the product, for it makes my facial skin very smooth when I put it on.  </li>
            <li>I meant to say is I like it very much</li>
            <li>I love the way it goes on so smoothly and a few drops covers far more area than I imagined.</li>
            <li>My skin texture is soft and the fine lines are disappearing after two weeks of using it.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and fine lines are gone.</li>
            <li>Fine lines nearly disappeared once you apply.</li>
            <li>It smells good (mildly like big red gum) and tightened up my skin immediately.  </li>
            <li>Well, I have not seen any change, yet, but I do wish, as with some products there is a positive glow or feeling with your skin right away.  </li>
            <li>My face seems to &#x27;puff&#x27; out a little (in a good way) and the lines seem to be gone.  </li>
            <li>It would have to do something tremendously in the next few days for me to buy it again!!  :D</li>
            <li>To be fair, I have super sensitive skin (which is why I only use all natural products with no chemicals), so it is possible that others won&#x27;t have the same sensitivity I experienced.  </li>

            <li>Hard lesson learned for me, lol.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lucky as the gals in my family always looked good, even in old age, due to youthful skin.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to give it the full 5-star rating, but it does feel good going on</li>
            <li>First of all, this is not a fake review.</li>
            <li>This serum makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Wish I could buy some more at the same price!</li>
            <li>High-end technology brings the anti-aging solution that regenerates your skin cells and provides the moisture your skin needs to look and feel young and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have only used for a couple of days, we shall see after many weeks.  </li>
            <li>it really worked for me!</li>
            <li>I purchased several and glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I love this because as soon as you put this on you can feel your skin get the instant hydration it needs.</li>
            <li>This is a plumper so you can instantly feel this as soon as you put this on around your eyes, which I love.</li>
            <li>really see a difference!</li>
            <li>I used this for 1 month, and I saw no results, so I switched to a different brand, which I like a lot better.</li>
            <li>Transaction was fast!</li>
            <li>I really hope this will take care of that &amp;#34;waddle&amp;#34; under my chin!  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I almost done with the first bottle</li>
            <li>Many is the day I forgot till later that evening.</li>
            <li>Takes way more than a couple drops, I stream it on to my entire face with the dropper.</li>
            <li>I love it and would definitely order it again!</li>
            <li>, the glass bottle broke, so I was only able to get 3 days use out of it.</li>
            <li>My skin feels really smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>I will most likely buy it again.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more in the future.  </li>
            <li>Lines that were looking better with another similar product have now returned within 2 wks.  </li>
            <li>I had tried another brand first</li>
            <li>Take the first step to feeling younger!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;a</li>
            <li>I first tried this serum when I saw a Dr. Oz show</li>
            <li>, my skin is smooth, clear and  firm.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I ordered this and when it arrived I was surprised that the package seemed light.  </li>
            <li>My wife was pleased with the results in only four days.  </li>
            <li>I think I noticed a change the first day I used the product.  </li>
            <li>First product I didn&#x27;t have to throw out from irritation.</li>
            <li>I first wash my face and tone it...</li>
            <li>This item makes your face smooth, soft.</li>
            <li>My face feels smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Actually there are more than 15 days of use</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s really working!</li>
            <li>and I think my expectations were more of that of a jar of cream with  the above ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>I really like this product!  </li>
            <li>i think the younger you are when you beginb using this, the better it will work for you, although even at my age</li>
            <li>First time tried this product.</li>
            <li>Dries almost on contact - doesn&#x27;t feel oily, makes your skin really smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I just got this today to use with my derma roller (first time using both).  </li>
            <li>Over the last two years I&#x27;ve been using Hyaluronic acid and Vitamin C serums and love the way they help my skin renew itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We are told that this product is very safe for everyone, and only natural ingredients were used.</li>
            <li>I noticed immediately the clear smooth sink.  </li>
            <li>, I think another 3 to 4 weeks is necessary to give this a better review on how it&#x27;s working for me.</li>
            <li>all gone and it made me pretty</li>
            <li>will be ordering more, should be offered in bigger bottle!</li>
            <li>Just trying this for the first time seems to work as directed with no breakouts</li>
            <li>but I am willing to use it longer and find out.</li>
            <li>Not what i expected but feels nice on your skin, i of course am looking for that fountain of youth, haha, something that fills in wrinkles!</li>
            <li>I have used many serums over the last 10 years,this one tops them all.</li>
            <li>funny how this universe works...</li>
            <li>Love this product just wish the bottle was bigger.</li>
            <li>but i will continue using it as i know it helps retain moisture which is key to having youthful skin:-)</li>
            <li>Most products I have to remind myself to use, this product I have to remind myself to only use it twice a day.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>Want one product that gives you younger, more radiant skin.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product because it has some similar ingredients to another product that I love and has been discontinued.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I wish I had a bigger bottle! :-)</li>
            <li>THANKS MOM!</li>
            <li>Overall really pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>I saw results the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>contents are a bit jelly and not watery like most serums, but it actually works somewhat better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>I love this product; this is the second time I ordered it.</li>
            <li>Works very well!</li>
            <li>I would most definitely recommend this to a friend!</li>
            <li>With first use my skin felt softer.  </li>
            <li>it leaves my skin smooth and soft to touch.</li>
            <li>So, as with all things, be sure to do a test before slathering it on because everyone&#x27;s skin is different.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll stick with what is working and pay the higher price</li>
            <li>First time user</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>This did not leave my skin feeling any different or with more moisture than anything else I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>The first time I applied this on my skin</li>
            <li>My first bottle came defective and damaged.  </li>
            <li>I put this serum on first thing in the morning after i wash my face,  Then, at the end of the day, I wash my face and put the serum on again before going to bed.  </li>
            <li>I think with continued use the results will only get better.</li>
            <li>I will order more definitely</li>
            <li>Tried this product for the first time today.</li>
            <li>I would most definitely recommend this to a friend!</li>
            <li>my husband even noticed (unprovoked) and asked if I had snuck off and gotten a face lift because I keep looking younger!!:)  </li>
            <li>really works!</li>
            <li>I will give more feedback later.</li>
            <li>but it seems to be working pretty well.  </li>
            <li>I have used one bottle of this magic stuff and have just ordered my second one.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this product.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>This product really work!  </li>
            <li>So, in short, I love this product, it has a thickness to it</li>
            <li>They immediately sent a new full bottle (not the blue but that is OK).  </li>
            <li>I ordered 5 of these and thought it would be good because it has a good review,only to find out that it is not as good as the other brand iI tried before, and also I just opened my other bottle yesterday only to find out that its empty!</li>
            <li>Noticed a positive difference right away, and it dries very quickly, enabling you to put a regular moisturizer on right away.</li>
            <li>I go through this little bottle very quickly!!</li>
            <li>and I have super sensitive skin!!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not too heavy but provides a perfect level of moisture for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin glow and feel so soft!!!!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing a whole lot right now.</li>
            <li>IT was shipped right away and very well packaged.  </li>
            <li>Really helps diminish fine lines and wrinkles and doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li>But its pretty good quality all you need are a few drops ,it absorbs really fast into your skin.</li>
            <li>I have tried many facial serums and this one in particular is one of my favorites!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hyaluronic Acid helps lock in moisture, and encourages older skin to make new, collagen filled skin cells like we had decades ago.  </li>
            <li>made my face feel so soft and clean</li>
            <li>I have been using it for two weeks and find that this brand is as good as the more expensive brand I was using.</li>
            <li>love this product,  i use it under moisturizer, and think it really does help overall!!</li>
            <li>lol.it does feel good and great make-up base.</li>
            <li>(I am 43 and have used sunscreen religiously on my face since my teens) but I am hoping regular use of a good product like this will prevent excess aging of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Working good but need to be careful with sensitive skin, I had some allergic reaction</li>
            <li>I love this product and for such a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I read the reviews prior to ordering and because it was on daily deals for a good price I decided to try it.</li>
            <li>Good little product!</li>
            <li>I was very surprised at how quickly this improved my skin.</li>
            <li>It is great,I am completely satisfied and I am not a very young person,so,with this words I can say that it works.</li>
            <li>Very lightweight, no additives, no heavy perfume; leaves skin very fresh.</li>
            <li>Put a drop or two on your finger and quickly apply it in circular motion [message] and WOW!</li>
            <li>I have pretty dry skin, mostly during winter, and this product did help a bit with that, although I would not buy it for this purpose.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t asked to leave a positive review, nor was I paid or otherwise compensated for reviewing this item.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t asked to leave a positive review, nor was I paid or otherwise compensated for reviewing this item.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t hopefully looking for positive results, I had forgotten that I used it.</li>
            <li>Not any positive results that I can see.</li>
            <li>On the positive side, this product reminded me to pause, self-reflect, chuckle, and recalibrate my level of vanity.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in my skin from the first use; the serum is very hydrating without adding an oil to my skin.  </li>
            <li>At first I really didn&#x27;t notice a change in my skin.</li>
            <li>Have used product only a short time but so far I&#x27;m happy with the results.</li>
            <li>This product really controls the oil on my face ;)</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect this product to help a whole lot - but what a surprise to see that within 14 days my skin absolutely is smoother!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few of the other Hyaluronic Acid skin care products and this one has worked the best for my skin.  </li>
            <li>and I must say that the fast shipping, proper packing, sturdy glass packaging and cute box with gold accents really leave a lot for the eyes to take</li>
            <li>I am not sure I have seen any reversing of the aging process, but my skin looks darn good</li>
            <li>No stickiness, no smell, no bad skin reactions (my skin is awfully sensitive)</li>
            <li>If you want  the youth secret to beautiful skin...</li>
            <li>My skin had less wrinkles, less dryness, and felt great!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to see the more long term results!</li>
            <li>It worked okay, but it seemed to dry my skin out.</li>
            <li>This is so easy and it makes a big improvement.  </li>
            <li>I took it easy with the roller (scared of having red face at work tomorrow) and applied this serum before and after.  </li>
            <li>I love how silky it feels and that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin at all.</li>
            <li>This actually shows results very quickly.</li>
            <li>Matter of fact, it&#x27;s made it even more dry than it&#x27;s been before.</li>
            <li>I read reviews of the 180 Cosmetics Pure Swiss serum, and ordered it.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend Pure Swiss</li>
            <li>I have been using Ultima Pure Swiss, for 2 years now.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&amp;#34;180&#x27; Cosmetics Pure Swiss Hyaluronic Serum + Vitamin C&amp;#34; is designed to help you reverse the signs aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;180&#x27; Cosmetics Pure Swiss Hyaluronic Serum +</li>
            <li>There is also no indication of what percentage of the liquid is pure Hyaluronic Acid.  </li>
            <li>I like this version (180 Cosmetics Pure Swiss)</li>
            <li>but it certainly did work to erase them.</li>
            <li>I use Ultima Pure Swiss Hyaluronic Acid after using the 1.0 mm derma roller.  </li>
            <li>After using the roller, I use witch hazel as an astringent, then the Ultima Pure Swiss.  </li>
            <li>I purchased 180 Cosmetics Ultima Pure Swiss, Hyaluronic Acid Serum +</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s been using it for a couple of weeks now and is certain that some of her age lines have lessened and skin texture improved.</li>
            <li>180 Cosmetics Pure Swiss, Hyaluronic Acid Serum + Vitamin C (Ultima) does not appear to work.</li>
            <li>and it certainly does nothing to help with anything.  </li>
            <li>In this case you certainly get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>I will certainly reorder.</li>
            <li>B008CEDY5O Ultima Pure Swiss, Hyaluronic Acid Serum with Vitamin C, Anti-Aging, Anti-Wrinkle, Instant-Lift Solution]]</li>
            <li>I wash my face with Avalon Organics face wash, tone with Avalon toner and then put on the Ultima Pure Swiss Hyaluronic Acid  with Vit C.  </li>
            <li>I have just started using Ultima Pure Swiss, and already have noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li>would certainly recommend this to a friend.  </li>
            <li>I ordered ULTIMA PURE SWISS HYALURONIC ACID + VITAMIN C</li>
            <li>I plan on buying the 180 pure swiss hyaluronic with peptides also..</li>
            <li>This is a moisturizer, and while it certainly keeps skin supple all day, it also seems to provide some level of oil control.  </li>
            <li>It is absorbed quickly and leaves the skin tight and smooth.</li>
            <li>The new design with dropper are so much better than that of the blue bottle.  </li>
            <li>It felt good going on but it didn&#x27;t seem to last very long</li>
            <li>I have now used it for a week, and the lines are still just slightly diminished, but even more noticeable is the texture of my skin, which is smoother and \\&quot;dewy\\&quot;, you know, not oily, but just fresh and moist-looking.  </li>
            <li>have been seeing fine lines/crows feet for a couple years and I wanted to find a product that would help slow this process down and after much research I found this Vitamin C Hyaluronic acid to be the most liked and let me tell you</li>
            <li>I have no facial wrinkles but these lines above my mouth, and thought I&#x27;d try 180 Ultima Pure Swiss given their claims \\&quot;This incredible serum will restore your skin&#x27;s elasticity, leaving it looking and feeling rejuvenated, supple, and smooth.\\&quot; Apparently, not if you are 40 or older according to \\&quot;Kate\\&quot; who provided a customer service reply to my email about the lack of any results for me.  </li>
            <li>After using it for just three days, I could definitely see a difference in the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>The fine lines at the outside corner of my eyes and under my eyes just disappear with this serum.  </li>
            <li>Deep ones, and the fine ones...</li>
            <li>I can see a trend here on products that show very high discounts.</li>
            <li>we applied the serum to our faces, we found that when we placed just a few drops, the serum instantly absorbed into our skin and our faces felt very smooth and relaxed.</li>
            <li>not to sure, so far nothing has happened, smooth and tight.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, absorbs nice and you only need a little bit.</li>
            <li>After the first 2 uses, my skin was unbelievably soft!!</li>
            <li>I love this product, only compliant is that the bottle broke when knocked over (not very hard or fast) on countertop in bathroom.  </li>
            <li>Lightly exfoliates skin, not like retinol that can give red and very peely skin.</li>
            <li>Amazing product this is my third bottle and can visually see my skin is tightening around my chin and cheeks,</li>
            <li>I can tell a huge difference in my skin especially after using it with the micro needle roller.</li>
            <li>I would really like to stay with it to see if I can tell a difference</li>
            <li>My box was torn and then to my surprise the dropper was so cheap looking and did not even work properly.  </li>
            <li>When I use this I make sure my skin is wet, then I dip the dropper into the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Used faithfully whole bottle</li>
            <li>and I have to say I really feel a difference.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have any wrinkles, but it does seem to be helping with some discoloration I&#x27;ve been noticing.</li>
            <li>(really)...</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t see much difference</li>
            <li>I can really feel the product working on my face, neck and hands.</li>
            <li>That absolutely was the case here.</li>
            <li>Really helps pull your skin up on neck and jaw areas as well as around eyes.  </li>
            <li>It is really making a difference in skin texture and shrinking pores.</li>
            <li>Absolutely will continue to use it</li>
            <li>The serum was extremely gentle on my skin and I suffered no breakouts from it.  </li>
            <li>Just expected it to work better.</li>
            <li>One or two drops cover your whole face and neck.</li>
            <li>I do not see much of of difference.</li>
            <li>Evaporated too fast in bottle.</li>
            <li>Makes me question if it has too much H20.</li>
            <li>As for a decrease in wrinkles and lines, haven&#x27;t seen much difference.</li>
            <li>I am probably using too much of this.</li>
            <li>I find hyaluronic acid serum to be an indispensable part of my daily beauty routine.  </li>
            <li>It truly makes a very noticeable difference to my skin, so I will be a lifetime user of HA serum.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this product for my wife and it worked very well for her.  </li>
            <li>Tightens skin a bit immediately after use, but I don&#x27;t see a real difference in wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about a week, but my face feels smooth and moisturized without being oily because I tend to have oily skin.  </li>
            <li>I USED TO MUCH</li>
            <li>Feels really silky on my skin.  </li>
            <li>works, it isn&#x27;t greasy and it really does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t tell the difference....but will keep on during .it</li>
            <li>After much research I decided to try this product.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t really say wrinkles have disappeared</li>
            <li>and you do not need much.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t notice much difference.</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Bought for my mom and she really likes it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed much change in my wrinkles on my face.  </li>
            <li>Really like the feel of my skin after using this for 3 weeks now, night and day.</li>
            <li>I really like it a lot.</li>
            <li>I tried a cheaper brand and it didn&#x27;t make my skin as smooth, so I went back to this one.  </li>
            <li>This seems to really work.</li>
            <li>thanks Mom)</li>
            <li>The two work really well together</li>
            <li>This really works and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>I did not pay much for this product, and was warned by another review that &amp;#34;if</li>
            <li>but really, one drop does the trick for your whole face.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect so much difference.</li>
            <li>so this help is appreciated.</li>
            <li>Amazon sells hyaluronic acid at a much lower price per volume;  and</li>
            <li>so I looked for one on Amazon with a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who wants to erase wrinkles from their face..</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t think this is much help.</li>
            <li>I think to really know how well this works would take much longer use than I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>really the amount was so miniscule</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if it works very well</li>
            <li>i expected more.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sceptical if this is the real deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So as this was a gift i cant talk to much about the product it self.</li>
            <li>I especially like this brand of serum because free of formaldehyde, parabens, phthalates, petro-chemicals, GMO ingredients, triclosan, fragrance and colors.  </li>
            <li>I especially like this brand of serum because free of formaldehyde, parabens, phthalates, petro-chemicals, GMO ingredients, triclosan, fragrance and colors.  </li>
            <li>+ yes to tomatoes, my face clears up fast.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like its smell...</li>
            <li>I really wish I could give this product 5 stars, however, I have been using it faithfully for one month and see no change in my wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I really have not noticed a difference, and am just now finishing up my bottle.  </li>
            <li>I use it morning and night, and it doesn&#x27;t take much at all.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this product to speed up the results and it really delivered.</li>
            <li>I really like this serum</li>
            <li>I received it really fast with my derma roller.</li>
            <li>Did absolutely nothing...</li>
            <li>We spend so much money and all for nothing.  </li>
            <li>Very cheap.&lt;br /&gt;Product</li>
            <li>Can buy quality hyaluronic acid at a much lower price</li>
            <li>I would really recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li>Really.  </li>
            <li>I tried moistening my hands/face with water beforehand, but that really didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really see a difference.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t care too much for this product.</li>
            <li>I suffer from skin conditions and this product has not only smooth those</li>
            <li>Highly recommend !</li>
            <li>but you don&#x27;t get much for your money.</li>
            <li>It is much softer and firmer.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much at all.</li>
            <li>It really helped to moisturize.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, It was late,but really like it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really like this product...</li>
            <li>I can see a difference on my skin, it appears much brighter and had minimize some of the lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I started using this product the very day I received it.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think this product would prevent them since I didn&#x27;t feel like it did much.</li>
            <li>I really like the texture</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It is very concentrated so with</li>
            <li>This really works well</li>
            <li>I would like to continue with this serum, but it is very expenside.</li>
            <li>, just a couple of drops does my whole face and neck.</li>
            <li>thanks ..</li>
            <li>It does make my face, neck and chest much softer and the lines are fading.  </li>
            <li>I use this product before my night time cream and it keeps my skin very hydrated.</li>
            <li>shipment was fast, and the product did everything it said it would do...</li>
            <li>This product was highly recommended to me to reduce wrinkles!</li>
            <li>I have also changed my rating from 3 stars (because of the rash) to 5 stars because it really does work.</li>
            <li>I really notice a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I really like the feeling when applying to the face.</li>
            <li>Taking care of my skin and overall appearance has always been important to me, and I do not wish to go the route of chemical peels, botox, dermabrasion or mini-lifts.  </li>
            <li>One drop covers my whole face/neck.  </li>
            <li>Product made no difference to our skin even after finishing the whole bottle.  </li>
            <li>Very drying.  </li>
            <li>and I just rubbed it gently on the parts of my face and neck that looked like it needed help.  </li>
            <li>this serum is gentle and I have seen a difference in tone and texture.</li>
            <li>It really does plump the skin - my crow&#x27;s feet,</li>
            <li>Still looking for the product the really softens your wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really bombed about it.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product with the hope of some real improvements in my skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>One has to use this for much longer than the supply lasts to notice if there is an effect.  </li>
            <li>ABSOLUTELY nothing happens.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really notice any difference in my skin after using this product.</li>
            <li>I expected more from a product of this cost.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell the difference using it or not using it.  </li>
            <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t take much for an application.  </li>
            <li>As of about the sixth day, I really haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference on my face.  </li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much to happen this soon anyway</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any real benefit</li>
            <li>I will recommend this to every woman this really keeps</li>
            <li>I am gonna get a whole ton of Hyaluronic acid wholesale.  </li>
            <li>Ultima really works.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>I really like this.  </li>
            <li>Fast Delivery .</li>
            <li>After washing my face each morning, I dot the serum around my eyes and mouth area and then gently rub it in to the areas that need work.  </li>
            <li>It works, of course, and I recommend this to anyone who wants to improve their skin (face and neck).</li>
            <li>IT REALLY WORKS.</li>
            <li>I found a product that really does what it claims it will</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really describe it</li>
            <li>Rough skin around rhe top of my ears and on my forehead are rapidly going away.</li>
            <li>it is very &amp;#34;water-like&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see any real difference over anything else I use.</li>
            <li>Really hoping for some wrinkle reduction and tightening.i am using it as recommended.</li>
            <li>I used this today and it really perked up my complexion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve finished a bottle and didn&#x27;t see much difference.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really see a change....</li>
            <li>Really like the product.  </li>
            <li>Not really any better than some of the others on the market.</li>
            <li>I am really disapointef.</li>
            <li>Results are better than expected.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t notice the lines a much.  </li>
            <li>i really like it</li>
            <li>I am 27 and really wanted to boost my skins vitality.</li>
            <li>used for few days and so far so good.  </li>
            <li>Nice hydrating product for daily use, especially in the summer time lotion.</li>
            <li>my skin started to get a little dry on the very top layer and lightly peel.</li>
            <li>Really soaks in and other products go on very smooth.  </li>
            <li>I would have been much more likely to purchase this product again and rate it five stars if the bottles I received, were more than only HALF full.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I have been using this product for little more that a month, I can tell that it is very pure (not a lot of &amp;#34;filler&amp;#34; ingredients) and may be helping with the lip area (I also take supplements).</li>
            <li>I am half way through the first and my skin looks better.  </li>
            <li>I was a little skeptic when I purchased this, but I figured, why not - it&#x27;s worth a shot, and 2 months before my wedding, I was willing to try just about anything within reason - and by &amp;#34;within reason&amp;#34; I meant cheap.</li>
            <li>Well i have tried a few companies hyaluronic acid and this is the best by far, You will notice the first few days</li>
            <li>The product gives your skin a very smooth young look - how did I go so long without this product.</li>
            <li>I makes it feel more hydrated and fine wrinkles seem less obvious, although I am combining this with IPL skin rejuvenation treatment.</li>
            <li>Given the lower price of this serum, I&#x27;m pleased with the results and will try other products.</li>
            <li>I noticed significant improvement after the second time I used it.</li>
            <li>Us women are always looking for that magic cure for the aging process and other than cosmetic surgery creams and potions will not work</li>
            <li>Read my other reviews for a much better choice.</li>
            <li>I have used many of other vitamin C products and i purchased two bottles 180 ultima vitamin C</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe the original price was almost 90$ for this tiny bottle!.</li>
            <li>Actually, for the original price ($89.89), I would prefer to buy  Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder.</li>
            <li>I am now back to using the Ole serum and spending $50 per bottle, but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>I had read other reviews and hoped I&#x27;d see results like the others, however it was just okay...</li>
            <li>it works as well or better than other pricey C products.</li>
            <li>Will keep on seeking other manufactures for results that may produce more.</li>
            <li>I would reccomend this product to many other people.</li>
            <li>it was just the right amount to get me the free shipping on the other product I was purchasing.</li>
            <li>It seems tacky at first, but distributing it across my face is easy, without tugging my skin like some other viscous products can do.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m not sure someone who has had these same issues for many years will have as complete and rapid results as I have, but I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li>I still think this is a great product, but only for people with skin less sensitive than mine.  </li>
            <li>I still think this is a great product, but only for people with skin less sensitive than mine.  </li>
            <li>I just used it and can say the serum absorbed quickly and left my skin feeling so soft.  </li>
            <li>It was the size stated in the ad but did not last as long as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin very soft and is now starting to plump up the fine lines I have (after a month of using)</li>
            <li>Most other similar products are a full ounce.</li>
            <li>I highly recommended to my boyfriend&#x27;s mom and she really like it after applying on her face.</li>
            <li>I havent seen much difference in how my skin looks as of yet, but I have high hopes.</li>
            <li>I was a new user to this product 6 months ago and really didn&#x27;t expect much..</li>
            <li>180 Ultima Pure Swiss, Hyaluronic Acid Serum is light and leave your skin with a fresh and firm sensation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and have received compliments left and right!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second bottle and trying to go easy, but it makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>I washed my face last night, and let the water on it, dry on its own.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and I use it daily with very satisfactory results.</li>
            <li>This product makes your skin feel terrific and other products glide on easily and smoothly afterwards.</li>
            <li>I have ordered this in the past and it was amazing and it had a pleasent smell.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I have quit using it; so hopefully my face will clear before the first of the year.</li>
            <li>I put several dots of this serum on my cheeks, chin, forehead, neck and chest and had to work fast to rub them in because this stuff gets absorbed fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not really sure how this product works on it&#x27;s own the brush</li>
            <li>However, when I ordered it the second time it came 1/3 full, bottle was scratched and leaking.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used the full bottle yet since I also ordered another serum the same time I bought this.  </li>
            <li>wokring pretty well so far</li>
            <li>Was only 1/4 full when I opened bottle</li>
            <li>I clean my face every morning with an astringent/salicylic acid cleanser for sensitive skin (like Clean &amp; Clear or Sea Breeze), then when my face is completely dry from that, I apply the serum.  </li>
            <li>I just started using the second bottle and so far I can see an improvement, seems to diminish the fine lines.</li>
            <li>When I apply it to may face, it feels nice and silky and moisturizing compared to other serums that make my face feel very dry after being absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and will be buying this product as long as the makers keep it available.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, smooth, dries fast, not greasy, a little covers the entire face.</li>
            <li>and it really tightens my face and promotes new cell growth.</li>
            <li>does not begin to live up to description...does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.  </li>
            <li>less visible, but I will order one more, bcause siendo</li>
            <li>This product goes on smooth - no clumpiness on my dry skin.</li>
            <li>I am not sure whether or not this product has actually improved the appearance of my fine lines and wrinkles--but I do know my skin looks and feels more hydrated.  </li>
            <li>I have used more than half of the product and did not see any differences.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the product; you truly need to use only two drops for your entire face.  </li>
            <li>The highest quality of Swiss Hyaluronic acid serum, complemented by natural ingredients and enriched with vitamin C,  brings the elasticity back to your skin, making it look and feel youthful and smooth.</li>
            <li>I love this product in the short time I have been using it, I am noticing a big difference..</li>
            <li>few more weeks to notice any real improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be for advertisement mainly but not for practical results.</li>
            <li>Any help you can give me in this matter would be greatly appreciated, I would definitely be a customer worth keeping along with my connections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When the product arrived, the package says that the MAIN INGREDIENT IS WATER.</li>
            <li>This particular brand also includes Vit. C</li>
            <li>I just turned 27 and thought I should take some extra measures to keep my skin looking healthy, but I didn&#x27;t expect this big of a difference.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product mainly to get rid of age spots.</li>
            <li>Even if they valued their product enough to safely bottle and package it, the minuscule amount of product you&#x27;ll receive only makes you feel &amp;#34; taken&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This magical Hyaluronic Acid and Vitamin C, according to my dermatologist who is cash only and charges an exorbitant amount of money per visit, are the only two chemicals he&#x27;d recommend to people.</li>
            <li>I dont know if the product itself is a hoax, or if I got a duplicate item from the particular seller.</li>
            <li>However I&#x27;m 68 years and am realistic.</li>
            <li>anything I look older and</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for younger and more hydrated skin, I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li>It is the only moisturizer I use at night, and my skin feels smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Try mixing with a few drops of almond or even avocado oil for more intense moisture, which works like a charm in winter months.</li>
            <li>It glided on my skin smoothly, was cool to the touch, and there was no overwhelming scent or stinging.</li>
            <li>After only a week I can notice a tremendous difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>I prefer a mild micro-cleanser to open pores for maximum absorption.</li>
            <li>Still too early to know of definitive or lasting results, but it feels light and non-greasy</li>
            <li>The smell is not at all pleasant and the texture is thin.</li>
            <li>Just goes to show you more expensive does not mean better.</li>
            <li>and I clearly see positive results.</li>
            <li>So far, I have seen no visible positive results in my skin.</li>
            <li>but perhaps over a considerably longer period of time I would see positive results and provide for updates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the bottle, and I pour my other serum from Cosmedica Skincare into the now empty container, because I like the color of the bottle, but let me say here that although I liked this Pure Swiss serum, it&#x27;s way more expensive then the Cosmedica brand, so that I will not be buying it any to soon, unless Ultima Pure Swiss lower its price;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see the long term results of using this product.</li>
            <li>Reading reviews, I had high hopes.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>High quality.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and will buy it again.</li>
            <li>I highly recommended..</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this serum.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend the 180 serum.  </li>
            <li>and I have high hopes it will work on my under eye wrinkles....</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>So I would highly recommend this product for its soothing benefits.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>Seller highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, I am lazy.  </li>
            <li>I can already tell that my skin is a little more toned too.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s helping, but as with most facial products I&#x27;m not sure if the effects are significant</li>
            <li>will give product a little more time</li>
            <li>I have little puffy spots at each end of my mouth and this serum makes them appear more evened out--less puffy.</li>
            <li>I am using it for a little more then a week</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m just old!!</li>
            <li>I was so happy and skeptical to find this particular item being sold for $20.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll see that I work hard to give an honest opinion of the products I review.ed me about a month.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll see that I work hard to give an honest opinion of the products I review.</li>
            <li>It last a very long time and allows makeup to be applied very smoothly.</li>
            <li>but I really like it so far.  </li>
            <li>but I can say that my skin definitely looks clear, hydrated, soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>So far I believe this product really works.</li>
            <li>So far I really like it.</li>
            <li>Goes on wet but soaks in within a minute or so leaving your skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li>This really made my skin baby soft, and rejuvenated the dullness of my skin tone...</li>
            <li>really makes your skin soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for nearly a year straight, morning and night.  </li>
            <li>My 15 year old son, bless his heart, says, &#x27;Mom, you really don&#x27;t look as old as you really are, even my friends think you&#x27;re my sister.&#x27;</li>
            <li>So far I really like this serum.</li>
            <li>- all of this info about the clear bottle and how long it will take is  all credible- through Dr Oz</li>
            <li>I am 54, and never have done a facial regiment, which I think it&#x27;s in my best interest to do, but with sensitive skin, it&#x27;s scarey</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t noticed a real difference in lines/wrinkles</li>
            <li>I could really see a big difference the first time.</li>
            <li>Pleased with this product although I have been using it a few weeks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only been a couple weeks - seems and feels like it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job, and the price and fast shipping are a real plus!</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to use a moisturizer over it (after it has dried).</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t know the advantage of using it for a few more weeks.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it helped with my deep wrinkles, but I feel like it is a good serum to use before moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to give it a few more days &amp; will start using the 180 on my face again.</li>
            <li>Just after a few application my skin started looking so much better and fresher.</li>
            <li>After a week, the fine lines are less noticeable and my skin texture is much improved.</li>
            <li>Doubted that this would be the same, but is as good if not better.  </li>
            <li>It goes on like an oil which I like, but within minutes it&#x27;s absorbed yet my skin doesn&#x27;t feel or look any different.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t forget to apply your normal moisturizer cream for the day or night and this amplifies the effect.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Will report more in a few weeks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this under my normal moisturizer</li>
            <li>I have not used it long enough to see anyvisible changes to my skin, but I love how it</li>
            <li>Pretty good product, noticed some difference in lines in my face, but expensive for the amount you get.</li>
            <li>I will order again if price remains the same; pretty fast delivery as well.</li>
            <li>Not sure how to rate it overall, but the ingredients are good for my skin.</li>
            <li>Definitely a snake oil worth the price and inflated confidence.</li>
            <li>And in the end my skin just has a far less blotchy appearance with a more even tone and firmer feel around the eyes.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for cosmetic professional results go to to plastic surgeon, if you want more moisture and less noticeable wrinkles try this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an &#x27;impulse package&#x27; shopper, which means, if it looks unique or cute (good grief!)</li>
            <li>Did not do anything, like putting plain water on your face, store bought products work better than this.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t open it right away after I bought it</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product so far!</li>
            <li>I am relieved that I did not pay so much for this product that I would bother to send it back for a refund, but this experience has lowered my confidence in positive customer reviews at Amazon.</li>
            <li>Lines in forehead are becoming less pronounced I think.  </li>
            <li>Actually this product does a much better job than many more expensive products hands down.</li>
            <li>My neck was showing the most age and now it is tight and I am 57 years old.  </li>
            <li>very nice product, but too expensive.</li>
            <li>After reading so many five-star reviews, I started out with high hopes, but for me, this product does the opposite of what I expected from those majority reviews and the description advertised.  </li>
            <li>Have only use the product (180 Ultima Pure Swiss Hyaluronic Acid Serum with Vit.C,Anti-Aging) for one week twice a day as directed,&lt;br /&gt;have not notice any real improvement yet..</li>
            <li>havent been using long enough to make a reccomendation yet, but so far seems ok</li>
            <li>I see a little improvement, the liquid glides on smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily apprearance, it soaks into my poors really quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>I am on my second bottle of this and so far I really like it!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always searching for new products to fight aging.  </li>
            <li>I contacted the seller and they immediately sent a new one, no questions asked.</li>
            <li>Since i live in FL and im 61..</li>
            <li>/&gt;It claimed to be new, however the seller did not state what their version of new was.</li>
            <li>I like the product but in two weeks I will have to be buying a new one</li>
            <li>Bottle scratched, no signs of being a new product.</li>
            <li>I ordered this serum , looking to try something new, and I been using it for a week I start to notice that my skin looks brighter</li>
            <li>I am always trying new serums and moisturizers.</li>
            <li>They reached out to me, sent me a new one promptly no questions</li>
            <li>This one is relatively new to me</li>
            <li>Morning and night, I smooth the Serum on my face, neck, upper chest and the back of my hands.  </li>
            <li>I have been using for few weeks and feel my face more soft and moisture,  </li>
            <li>and I strongly encourage all women (you&#x27;re never too young to start) to make this a daily part of your skin&#x27;s overall health.</li>
            <li>I have only used this product one time, so I really don&#x27;t have much to type</li>
            <li>I like this product , after using it for 2 weeks I can see a difference, but I still would like to use for a few more weeks, before giving a complete opinion...</li>
            <li>However really need to get through my second jar to really see if the results are what I expect.</li>
            <li>Does not make my skin feel soft or vibrant.</li>
            <li>the price is reasonable and it makes my face looks so soft until so soft</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, get reactions from almost everything, but this product corrected my wrinkles, and skin texture.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feeling very soft at touch; it takes just a couple of drops and it spreads all over face.</li>
            <li>The serum is very absorbing, after a short massage, there is no trace of it on my face.</li>
            <li>, that is very sensitive, and prone to hormonal breakouts.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very sensitive to chemicals .</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It made my face feel very soft.</li>
            <li>I use it in the mornings and evenings after D&#x27;arsonval High frequency direct for Home Use.</li>
            <li>They are all very expensive, but I found very good for my skin.</li>
            <li>The product seemed to be nice,but even using a few drops at a time - The first of two, half filled bottles did not last long enough to give a happy review.</li>
            <li>I get better results from using plain, old aloe vera gel.  </li>
            <li>Feels oily when you put it on, but it sinks right in!</li>
            <li>I am not sure if I am going to purchase more yet.</li>
            <li>It is extremely wallet friendly when you consider what itdoes for your skin.</li>
            <li>One thing I can confirm though, it does get absorbed extremely fast, as per the other reviews.</li>
            <li>am not sure which one worked, but I feel that my skin became more springy.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I was hoping for some noticeable tightening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, suggestions on which product to use first and whether or not to alternate or one in am, pm...and so on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the bottle was much to small more like a sampler than a purchase</li>
            <li>I like my usual Vitamin C serum from Irene Gari better.</li>
            <li>There are a lot of much more expensive products out there, but this serum actually works better than any I tried.  </li>
            <li>My skin was too sensitive for this!  </li>
            <li>My skin is smoother and fine lines are less.</li>
            <li>it is a small bottle though, wish there was more.</li>
            <li>It made me break out, and I do not have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>They state that the first ingredient is hyaluronic acid, with water somewhere in the middle.  </li>
            <li>I could be paying for a small bottle of mostly water.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it to all interested friends.</li>
            <li>It is smoother, softer, Less fine lines.</li>
            <li>I will be re-ordering soon as the price is pretty low.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed about this serum that was different was the texture of it.  </li>
            <li>This serum makes my skin feel so soft and seems to fill in any wrinkles!</li>
            <li>My face was still red for one day, the second it was ok, but I decided not to use the product again until a week later.</li>
            <li>This is the first product I used that actually delivers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it about 6 months now and the fine lines at the sides of my eyes are less visible.</li>
            <li>It really gets rid of all the dead skin that the RetinA leaves and makes my skin feeling smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>The change to my skin has been a healthy one it is firm and the consistency feels strengthened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just reordered in August!</li>
            <li>I would have to get another 2-3 drops for my forehead, and another 2-3 drops for my lower face/neck, all the while wondering how much my of this precious liquid was merely being absorbed by my hands.</li>
            <li>My wife wants me to order more bottles in the next few months.</li>
            <li>The bottle is tiny, I might be able to spread it out very carefully and get 10 days of use out of it.</li>
            <li>The Ultima goes on nicely and absorbs well, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>My 56 year old husband wanted to try something new for his skin.</li>
            <li>I have not used it long enough to see a huge improvement</li>
            <li>The serum doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s absorbed into my skin and makes it feel really dry.  </li>
            <li>just so easy all u do is add a few drops</li>
            <li>Then I wipe it on my fingers and quickly rub it all over my still wet face.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually wear makeup, but since this dries completely and is colorless, you can wear makeup on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>I like it but was surprised what a small bottle it comes in so will probably order more.</li>
            <li>The box was a little beat up within the shipping package, but the product inside was fine.</li>
            <li>The company contacted me and ask me to submit only positive reviews about this product.  </li>
            <li>I used with a positive charge ion roller to ensure it went deep into the skin.</li>
            <li>Even the dark spots at the corners of my mouth lightened up significantly.</li>
            <li>on dry winter days as we are having now I put a light moisturizer on my entire face.  </li>
            <li>It is too soon to give a longer term results, and most people do not come back after using a product for very long to give you actual results....</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would recommend the Ultimate Pure Swiss brand.</li>
            <li>I will definitely switch to the pure hyaluronic acid that I used before.</li>
            <li>Younger, firmer, and new!!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a little pricey not to be able to get every last drop.</li>
            <li>I was only able to use it for a little over a week</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to rate a product like this until you have used it for about 30 days or more.  </li>
            <li>and it seems to work much better and not get hard.</li>
            <li>So far I really like it, but only time will tell.</li>
            <li>Once it dried, however, my skin felt \\&quot;tight\\&quot; rather than soft or smooth.  </li>
            <li>Only been using the product one week, but I really like the product so far.</li>
            <li>No, I still look middle aged and have light crows feet.  </li>
            <li>clear</li>
            <li>Goes on clear and it is somewhat like a gel.</li>
            <li>I really like that the bottle is colored glass because vitamin c loses its effectiveness when exposed to light.</li>
            <li>After purchasing this I read that vitamin C is not stable in a clear container.</li>
            <li>This is the second product I have tried by 180 Cosmetics and I am once again very happy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>I am 67 years old and hoping I do get some results from it.</li>
            <li>like this ultima hyaluronic acid, it keep my skin soft, and help me to moisturize my sking.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for nearly 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never know, but my kids think I&#x27;m old.  </li>

            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and lots of allergies</li>
            <li>I have spent hundreds of dollars on serum&#x27;s and find this works better than the most expensive ones I have purchased.</li>
            <li>When I used it on my face and around my eyes my skin felt so soft.</li>
            <li>had to stop using this because I developed skin sensitivity and a rash on my eyelids.  </li>
            <li>: I had to stop using this because I developed skin sensitivity and a rash on my eyelids.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind my natural life-lines but</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think there is a cream or lotion what could bring my youth back, but when I heard about hyalironic acid, I decided to try and got hooked.</li>
            <li>I completely forgot I put it on</li>
            <li>and I like the way it makes the skin on my face and neck feel soft.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that it lightened age spots on my face.</li>
            <li>I have not used it enough to tell anything miraculous about my skin really.</li>
            <li>Leave my skin feeling pampered and ready for my daily cream.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still early</li>
            <li>SO FAR I LIKE IT.</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>seems to help, and leaves skin feeling soft and silky....</li>
            <li>I just started using this, it is too early to tell the effects.</li>
            <li>It absorbs completely without a greasy feel.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels soft already</li>
            <li>I have not seen much improvement over the last month of using the serum to lighten acne discoloration.</li>
            <li>It appears that the product is very volatile and it has simply evaporated.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You will be soooo surprised....</li>
            <li>but your product is by far</li>
            <li>So far I like it.  </li>
            <li>I am a 49 year old mom.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, so far it didn&#x27;t cause any irritation.</li>
            <li>So far I like this product.</li>
            <li>I am a mature woman,  but no wrinkles,  I think this serum help a lot</li>
            <li>I makes my skin feel so soft.  </li>
            <li>far seems to work-</li>
            <li>It goes directly into the skin.</li>
            <li>My old skin soaks up this stuff.  </li>
            <li>The serum does not cause any skin redness or breakouts and seems to give my face a delicate healthy glow (after using for two weeks).  </li>
            <li>It really renews your skin and is simply applied.</li>
            <li>I like the sensation in my skin, so soft.</li>
            <li>This stuff really does plump up those deep lines !</li>
            <li>However, it is too early to determine if all evidence of pimples, etc. will be done away with using this product skin is clear when there was no acne visible.</li>
            <li>I am a 42 year old mom.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There are two reasons I did not give 5 stars:  One, the whole \\&quot;Instant Lift\\&quot; thing is a joke.  </li>
            <li>and I really like the way my face looks the following day.</li>
            <li>But darn near close to it</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it does not cause any issues for me.</li>
            <li>and wow they&#x27;re almost gone</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive sense of smell and this product did not affect me.</li>
            <li>I have adult acne, but when I&#x27;m on Hyaluronic Acid serums the acne is always somewhat controlled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My husband is very anti-beauty products, but he WILL put this on himself, especially on scars.</li>
            <li>I will have to do another review, but I like it so far.</li>
            <li>I really liked the 1st bottle, &amp; would still recommend at least trying this product yourself, maybe I just have extra sensitive</li>
            <li>I use it directly after cleansing my skin with either Cerave or Cetaphil.  </li>
            <li>Skin is soft, pores reduced, wrinkles...eh?  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin,  this product is for you.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li>I am 37 years old and people think i am still 29-30 tops..</li>
            <li>It penetrates completely within seconds</li>
            <li>and so far I do not see any difference to my 56 year old face.</li>
            <li>but so far, appears to be helping.  </li>
            <li>I have rosacea &amp; nearly 50 year old sun abused skin.</li>
            <li>I like it so far.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and firm.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m African-American and 34 years old</li>
            <li>I mix it with my regular cream to ensure it wont burn so much.</li>
            <li>I am 23 years old</li>
            <li>It automatically tighten my skin while still looking natural.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the seller for offering it at such a savings</li>
            <li>it makes my skin soft and tightens the skin.</li>
            <li>In the one month I have seen marked improved in my skin.</li>
            <li>Not heavy, not greasy.</li>
            <li>I had never used this product before but was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 48 years old and at my age I need this since my body does not produce this in my skin anymore.</li>
            <li>I have 70 year old skin</li>
            <li>and I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>it is still early to qualify it.</li>
            <li>This serum leaves skin feeling incredibly soft, shrinks the appearance of pores.  </li>
            <li>Too early to tell.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping it would add moisture and make my skin feel soft again.</li>
            <li>and wow what a difference.</li>
            <li>I rubbed this serum on my lips one time and it completely took care of the cracking and peeling in one day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It makes my skin soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>It really helps your skin to look younger.</li>
            <li>This is a moisturizer, and make skins soft.</li>
            <li>but I do see results, more later after I see how it goes over a period of a few months.</li>
            <li>returned because cost wise compare with others too expensive for 05oz</li>
            <li>When my face became more dry, rough, and leathery--more wrinkly!--than ever before, I decided I should stop, as I feared the apparent damage might become permanent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The purchase was made because of recent articles in medical journals assuring us that a good, penetrating vitamin c serum and hyaluronic acid are the active ingredients even in the most expensive products.</li>
            <li>It feels luxurious going on and sinks in right away, leaving my skin feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li>Reading the evaluations I read from other customers I expected better.</li>
            <li>Bottle was half full when I got it.</li>
            <li>but the bottle was half full.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It arrived half full.</li>
            <li>; it&#x27;s only been a few weeks, however if this makes sense I would give it 5 stars for clearing up most of the dry flakes I had, as far as removing &amp;#34;fine lines&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t see a difference yet, however if I get another reminder to update this product I will certainly do so</li>
            <li>I had used Hyaluronic Acid Serum in the past and this 180 Ultima Pure Swill is a better price</li>
            <li>andI generally have very sensitive skin, almost anything I apply on it irritates it.</li>
            <li>It took a few weeks longer to see a significant reduction in the crepe like skin under my eyes to go away.</li>
            <li>I love the product, was somewhat disappointed when I received it as the product had leaked through the top, around the soft part of the applicator.</li>
            <li>Bottle is very small, I should have paid more attention to the size</li>
            <li>Apparently, you&#x27;re only supposed to leave reviews on Amazon.com for this particular company when they have a 5 star rating!</li>
            <li>Now, full disclosure, I&#x27;m young and all my skin problems are due to way too much time spent sunbathing and partying in the sun on South Beach.</li>
            <li>This is one little way that I can make myself feel like I am doing some special just for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This really seems to help keep the moisture in my face and keep it from getting dry in the harsh winter weather - also helps keep my skin feeling smooth throughout the year.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is possible that the product was also frozen or mishandled in some other manner, as the serums have a grainy quality that I doubt is a part of the original design.</li>
            <li>I do not necessarily want to pay $85 for the small bottle, which is MRSP, but for about $20, I think it is fabulous!</li>
            <li>I rate it 4 star, because it&#x27;s smaller than I thought, and I feel it not nourishing enough because of quick dryness shortly after using it.</li>
            <li>I am at the last drops of my first bottle, and have already received the second bottle of this product.  </li>
            <li>The price was right compared to other products on the market.  </li>
            <li>This product certainly doesn&#x27;t harm my skin, but there are no real positive signs of my skin improving thus far.</li>
            <li>Then it was super easy to knock over because it is a small, narrow glass bottle.</li>
            <li>My skin stays smooth all day and even on dry, windy days it doesn&#x27;t get those rough patches I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li>It takes only a few drops and spreads easily over my face.</li>
            <li>It is a thick gel-like serum that penetrates into the skin quickly and absolutely</li>
            <li>honestly can&#x27;t tell the difference from previous purchases of same product by other manufacturers.  </li>
            <li>My doctor recommended me NOT to use active serums right after microneedling since it can cause nodules under the skin.</li>
            <li>i could barely see my pores AND my skin is soooo soft.</li>
            <li>I do like this serum, but it only came a 1/2 filled not full bottle</li>
            <li>Pretty inexpensive, but the quantity wasn&#x27;t as expected.  </li>
            <li>Once applied, the serum dried quickly and my skin actually felt refreshed and somewhat firmer, particularly in the chin area.</li>
            <li>texture is a soft gel, that goes on very smoothly, and you only need a very small amount.</li>
            <li>I suppose it worked a little better than using no serum at all but not what I expected, thus the 2 star review.</li>
            <li>I use many other products so hard to say which ones are really doing the work.</li>
            <li>Results are immediate, &amp;#34;crows feet&amp;#34; virtually disappear and skin looks fresh, clean and tight (not dry and tight).  </li>
            <li>but I informed the seller and a new one was sent promptly back.</li>
            <li>There are so many products out there that is so hard to decide!</li>
            <li>it dry my skyn too much.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this product long enough to rate higher than 4 stars.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product I&#x27;ve only been using it for a short time and</li>
            <li>It is a clear, thick liquid that spreads smoothly and soothes my skin.  </li>
            <li>This has really helped the skin around my eyes to look firmer and younger, plus its effects last all day.</li>
            <li>when i first recieved this item i was dissapointed, the seal was broken, and it wasnt a full bottle.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive, but I didn&#x27;t notice any rashes recently.</li>
            <li>I thought the new bottle was supposed to be OPAQUE BLUE., clear bottles are considered garbage they won&#x27;t work because if any natural light touches the serum it ruins the active ingredients.</li>
            <li>Since only a few drops are needed, the 15 ml solution goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Because of the special formula of Pure Swiss serum</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other Hyaluronic acid formulas before, this one had a lot of hype, and a pretty bottle.</li>
            <li>Takes a little time, but time it what got me here in the first place!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I have seen any major changes as yet, but will keep using.  </li>
            <li>Please try this if for no other reason than the price.</li>
            <li>though -and this is something I never expected - is that it removed a wart I had within two uses!</li>
            <li>I used this product consistently for 2-3 weeks along with my other skin care regimen (face wash, toner, moisturizer) and didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
            <li>you have similar dry sensitive skin, you might want to think twice before using this, or at least be prepared for a red face, some tingling, and to use a good moisturizer afterwards or mixed in.</li>
            <li>Products with Vitamin C and hyaluronic acid and other anti-aging ingredients are always expensive, so this is a great value at the reduced price from expederm on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It helps retain moisture and &amp;#34;plump&amp;#34; fine lines around mouth, eyes and delicate areas.</li>
            <li>Did not make any difference to my skin, just noticed a slight brightness in the first time of application after that my skin got back to normal condition.</li>
            <li>I am a 45-year old pre-menopausal woman, with several fine wrinkles, a few deeper wrinkles, several dark spots, uneven skin tone, and most noticeably, quite a lot of sagging and loss of firmness.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin so lines and wrinkles seem to be creeping up on me fast.</li>
            <li>I have not had my order long enough to make a comment, other than it is smooth and tightens my skin.  </li>
            <li>I do however have expression lines across my forehead and 2 small fine lines between my eyebrows, but when I use this religiously I don&#x27;t even notice them, with or without makeup!</li>
            <li>have received compliments on the condition of my skin, and feel I am seeing steady improvement in decreasing tiny facial wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I have used other more expensive versions and I find this to be just as good if not better!</li>
            <li>Love the product but bottle is too small, i would be willing to pay a little extra for a bigger bottle</li>
            <li>I do not know if this was a over sight during packaging or general practice.</li>
            <li>Generally they say after 4 to 6 weeks you see the difference.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use it alone, generally underneath a moisturizer or cream.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve only been using it for 7 days and can clearly see a difference.</li>
            <li>However, I wish it was not in a glass bottle as I have dropped and broken the bottle a couple of times and wasted this amazing product!</li>
            <li>There is no heavy, sticky or oily feeling left on my face after I apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since using it my face feels silky soft and is starting to Brighten my complexion.  </li>
            <li>The only difference between the two brands as far as ingredients, is the Vitamin C, so I assume that it what my skin is reacting to.  </li>
            <li>The only difference between the two brands as far as ingredients, is the Vitamin C, so I assume that it what my skin is reacting to.  </li>
            <li>My skin is soft with fewer wrinkles, and my pores are much smaller.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural made with essential oils.</li>
            <li>and you apparently don&#x27;t have a number for anyone to address questions, which I find is a bit disconcerting.  </li>
            <li>Apparently you&#x27;re supposed to use this after using the microdermabrasion roller on your skin.</li>
            <li>I thought the product has spilled, but there were no wet spots in my bag.</li>
            <li>With no regrets.</li>
            <li>That box too was not fully taped and barely close on one side..</li>
            <li>I am 64 years old and have tried lots of products to help to keep my skin looking younger.</li>
            <li>I noticed that if I did not use it for about three days that my old skin appearance was back.</li>
            <li>The alcohol in this made my skin red and sensitive</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to complete the vial to see if it works &amp;#34;over time&amp;#34;, but my initial recommendation is try something</li>
            <li>smaller pores especially on the nose and face is more moisturized with lesser visible lines and wrinkles for small price</li>
            <li>I thought wow must be the same  </li>
            <li>Glad I only spent a few bucks for this product.</li>
            <li>Of course it didn&#x27;t help that when I was a lot younger, I completely ignored sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Just received it last week so far I like the way it feels on my face.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, when I went back to using Curel Ultra Healing lotion, my skin smoothness and softness was immediately restored to pre-180 Serum state, and I did not have to waste time with some application ritual nor go through the process and expense of reordering a tiny bottle of serum every couple of months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m somewhat confused with this product as it didn&#x27;t come with much on the how to&#x27;s and what to expect from it, which is pretty much normal for any skin care product.</li>
            <li>True, the bottle is quite small for what you get...</li>
            <li>This left my skin feeling super soft, and in a little under two weeks I am already seeing a noticeable difference in lines and clarity!</li>
            <li>It not only fills the thin lines, but helped tremendously on the deep ones in the forehead and laugh lines.</li>
            <li>I received one bottle full and another bottle only has a half left.</li>
            <li>This works really well, particularly when used with one of those little sip key roller things.</li>
            <li>It is thicker than other 100% pure hyaluronic acid products have been….I</li>
            <li>so I can share with other amazon customers and the 180 Cosmetics Pure Swiss Hyaluronic Acid</li>
            <li>product was not sealed when i twisted the whole thing came off easy</li>
            <li>Feels good on face, but the bottle is a little small, didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>It worked wonders to soothe and make the skin fill less hot and inflamed.  </li>
            <li>When the first item arrived it was a malfunctioned bottle like someone used it with half of the liquid inside.</li>
            <li>thanks to the seller.good quality.it&#x27;s a little dry skin, but it helps to moisturize:)I want a large volume.....</li>
            <li>Will try to update later after I&#x27;ve used it long enough to really tell if it&#x27;s doing all I hoped it could...</li>
            <li>I can really provide any review, other than to state that I will not purchase it again.</li>
            <li>I have been trying to think of other things that I am doing to change the appearance of my skin but nothing else would cause this much of a difference.</li>
            <li>it really does do what people say on the other reviews.</li>
            <li>3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing exciting, not good, not bad, but certainly not worth recommending.</li>
            <li>Was expecting more dramatic results.</li>
            <li>I have seen a marked difference, especially on the back of my hands.  </li>
            <li>Will go back to one of those when ready to purchase again, which looks like it will be soon as this bottle is almost empty.</li>
            <li>Tried more expensive products that did not work near as well as this product.&lt;br /&gt;Take</li>
            <li>This serum is not cheap and I looked fantastic until the bottle was empty.  </li>
            <li>This serum goes a long way and it should be considered a base pre-moisturizer which you will then apply your normal moisturizer on top of which will make this stuff last longer as it isn&#x27;t cheap</li>
            <li>that smelled a little funny</li>
            <li>I had a facial with the esthetician I&#x27;ve been working with for at least the last decade this past weekend, and she asked what I changed in my skin routine because my skin has never looked as good as does as a result of the serum.  </li>
            <li>The wanted me to address any problems with them directly instead of posting negative feedback; however, consumers has the right to know how the product performs.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thicker than the previous one I was using, not sure it works any better.  </li>
            <li>I have received this product twice,  first time one of them was almost empty!!!</li>
            <li>Cant get enough of it especially in the dry climate I live in!</li>
            <li>Great disappointment!</li>
            <li>Seems to make a big difference in my skin breakouts and the texture of my skin in general.  </li>
            <li>I rated it against other similar products that I have and really read the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Amazon refunded me for the total cost, which I appreciated as it was virtually empty, but the tiny bit I used has prompted hope!  </li>
            <li>but I can only barely tell where it was to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li>I gave this a four star rating as I have not been using it that long although I like it very much so far.  </li>
            <li>See the difference with first time use.&lt;br /&gt;Its not greasy or heavy</li>
            <li>Disappointed as the bottle was at most only 3/4 full.  </li>
            <li>The next thing I noticed was that after a few days of use, the fine lines were actually harder to see!  </li>
            <li>As we age, our body produces less and less of this important acid, thus affecting how moisture is stored in our skin.</li>
            <li>I usually order a different brand that costs less for more product, but in like that</li>
            <li>i have had other HA serums and this one is not any better than other that cost much less.</li>
            <li>Having dry skin and wearing foundation isn&#x27;t a pretty combo, the dryness is extremely noticeable and often looks scaly.</li>
            <li>Sort of tacky getting an empty bottle in a new order.</li>
            <li>, I highly recommend this product for anti aging amongst other over priced items.</li>
            <li>I get dry skin on my face frequently</li>
            <li>I have used hyaluronic acid previously and really believe in it&#x27;s ability to help hold moisture in the skin.  </li>
            <li>Been using this product for two weeks and don&#x27;t really see any changes as promised regarding increased firmness or less wrinkles.</li>
            <li>The bottle was small, be it does not take much to put on your face, it goes far....</li>
            <li>However, after it sinks into the skin, I&#x27;m back to normal.</li>
            <li>It is extremely thick as it comes out but absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that my skin is becoming very dry in some places</li>
            <li>Before I started using this serum my forehead, eyebrows and eye areas were very flaky, since I have been using this item I have little to no dry skin.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s working a little on a very old face.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s just NOT true and is very misleading.  </li>
            <li>Granted I have only had this for a couple of weeks, and I am just now 40 and starting to notice some sagging around my eyes due to high cheek bones.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Twice a day I apply a few drops of this 180 Cosmetics serum to my freshly washed face, neck and upper chest, and let it absorb and dry.  </li>
            <li>I actually needed more than 2-3 drops to really get all over my face AND the dropper only goes about 1/3 down into the bottle: while this may allow for extra product room, its really difficult to tilt the bottle and see if the dropper is picking stuff up.</li>
            <li>2 drops seemed too little, 3 too much.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any difference good or bad , I used it as indicated but not results</li>
            <li>I have no idea if it was good or bad since I couldn&#x27;t try it.  </li>
            <li>I did notice an instant small amount of &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; because my fine line were instantly less pronounced.</li>

            <li> Your bottle is beautiful, but too flimsy.</li>
            <li> I have had no problem at all- just absolutely beautiful results.  </li>
            <li> I was told by an esthetician friend of mine that the best defense is a good moisturizer, I found this product, read some reviews and gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product!</li>

            <li> Again, I broke my own rule of buying a product that has the word &#x27;BEST&#x27; in it&#x27;s name or description, and I paid for it too.</li>
            <li> great feel on my skin.</li>

            <li> Hyaluronic acid is remarkable for tightening the skin, or maybe what I am feeling is the plumping of the moisture kept inside the skin with this product.</li>

            <li> that as nice</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it will  be good once I give it some time.</li>
            <li> I was given a chance to test and give my honest opinion on this product during a promotion.</li>
            <li> This is the best I&#x27;ve tried for such a great price.</li>
            <li> so I like to warm about that.</li>
            <li> So I am torn between my thrifty side and my luxury loving side.  </li>
            <li> Use this along with Argan Oil and Rose Hips oil</li>
            <li> So this is a nice serum but didn&#x27;t work for me with microneedling</li>
            <li> Since there were so many good reviews, I decided to try it again.</li>
            <li> BUT I LIKED THE&lt;br /&gt;FEEL OF TIGHTNESS AFTER USE.</li>
            <li> It is nice to get compliments that I have a glow.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to more of a good thing.</li>
            <li> this was nice</li>
            <li> The price is excellent &amp; it works very well.</li>
            <li> I make my own creams, lotions, soap, bath oils and sugar and salt scrubs.</li>
            <li> have been using this product for one week and at it astounding that after 2 days I could already see the increased moisture in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I amusing this with accumulation of another skin products.  </li>
            <li> I just put in my face once a day, and it feels nice.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin with a nice glow and it doesn&#x27;t feel oily.</li>
            <li> Timely delivery, nice packaging.</li>
            <li> It feels nice going on the skin</li>
            <li> I like this product, feels nice.</li>
            <li> But honestly, I don&#x27;t see any difference and am wondering why I bought it.</li>
            <li> This is not a one of a kind product.</li>
            <li> Just make it smell nice.  </li>
            <li> I noticed this was a popular item</li>
            <li> I am loving this product.  </li>
            <li> Nice fancy bottle.</li>
            <li> I waited some time to write my review to see what kind of results I would get.  </li>
            <li> I will purchase this effective serum again when I&#x27;m done with this bottle.</li>
            <li> It absorcion is so faster and effective.</li>
            <li> Nice product, thank you</li>
            <li> Really nice serum, it&#x60;s nicely absorbs</li>
            <li> I liked it for the two weeks</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it was effective</li>
            <li> Kind of pricy for what you get.</li>
            <li> Really is the BEST hyaluronic serum I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I thought this would be effective.  </li>
            <li> I liked the serum alot.  </li>
            <li> Goes on nicely, face feels smoother to the touch</li>
            <li> but it sure feels good.  </li>
            <li> I was so dissapointed because I loved the results with Hyaluronic acid and was worried I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use it.  </li>
            <li> MY  SKIN  IS  NICE  </li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> Also liked the fact</li>
            <li> I honestly have noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li> This feel really nice going on.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel nice</li>
            <li> but it does make the skin feel nice &amp; claims to help lock in moisture after washing face or showering</li>
            <li> This felt nice</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell or have any kind of acidic taste.  </li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel nice.</li>
            <li> nice produc</li>

            <li> This one is by far the best!  </li>
            <li> This is a great serum and is fully absorbed after the procedure.</li>
            <li> i really  love it so much it is an amazing product i ever use it</li>
            <li> This is a good light moisturizer for the face.</li>
            <li> I wore it on top of my foundation today and it worked as an amazing primer-</li>
            <li> It feels wonderful, weightless, completely non-greasy.</li>
            <li> Tried this because of so many reviews.this product was horrible,it did nothing.my father in law bought another brand and was amazing.</li>
            <li> so is perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> my skin is great, deffenetly worth buying.</li>
            <li> This is one of the most amazing products I have ever used, and I have tried them all.</li>
            <li> We are using it, and so far we are very happy with the result.</li>
            <li> Amazon offers the best price out there for this serum.  </li>
            <li> This serum, by far, is the best wrinkle serum that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> One thing that&#x27;s been working excellent for me thus far is Nivea.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really works and I love, love, love it!!!</li>
            <li> This serum absorbs  right on contact and makes skin fell great.</li>
            <li> Just the feeling of pure hydration and healthy, happy skin!&lt;br /&gt;I am in love with this!</li>
            <li> I apply my own moisturizer on top, although my skin is more oily in the summer</li>
            <li> I bought this item mostly because of all these good ingredients listed, H.A. Vitamin C, and of course the huge discount.</li>
            <li> a great product at great price….I can actually see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Great product, love how it makes my skin feel, it seems to drink it right up with no residue after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product has really given my skin a beautiful appearance.</li>
            <li> This was great at first but after 10 days the breakouts began.</li>
            <li> If the price sounds too good to be true, it is.</li>
            <li> it looked too good to be true, it probably was.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> But, since I dont use Botox, the fine lines and textural problems do tend to creep in!  </li>
            <li> Before I finished one bottle, others could even notice a reduction of fine lines!  </li>
            <li> Very light feel.</li>
            <li> Very light weight and not at all oily.  </li>
            <li> It becomes very smooth.</li>
            <li> The box looks a very cheap.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel very smooth.</li>
            <li> One of the reviews said that the product was like water and that reviewer would be correct the consistency is very light</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend and definitely a good price!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and smooths my skin nicely.  </li>
            <li> I bought 1 the first time and just bought 2 more and plan to buy more at this great price.</li>
            <li> Considering the ingredients aren&#x27;t all that spectacular, you can easily find dozens of hyaluronic acid serums with better ingredients and a greater amount of product for the money.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve seen a difference in some fine lines that were kind of developing around the eye area, but I also just got a chemical peel</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the applicator, it keeps the product in the bottle clean..</li>
            <li> I am happy to say that after a week of use I am certainly seeing some differences in the pore sizes as well as the firmness of my skin.</li>
            <li> which is where I&#x27;m really expressive and have large expression lines.</li>
            <li> So far seems like a very good product</li>
            <li> A huge joke!</li>
            <li> really nice serum, leaves the face feeling smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li> If it does as well as the reviews says it does, then it will deserve a five star rating:)</li>
            <li> As I use it I realize that there is more in there</li>
            <li> and I am so glad I have two of the serums.</li>
            <li> It looks noticeably more hydrated.</li>
            <li> my opinion- requaire more time to see all the posives efects</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m using this more as a prevention method than a cure.  </li>
            <li> It is okay used as a moisturizer but not what</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found using Tarte Marjacula Oil every night to be a much better treatment for my skin.</li>
            <li> It is mostly water but doesn&#x27;t moisturize skin or help wrinkles disappear.  </li>
            <li> but I wish more was in it.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> I am glad I found it.</li>
            <li> I love the way the product feels when applied.</li>
            <li> If I had bought a cheaper moisturizing cream, may have been much better.</li>
            <li> for nothing worthwhile.</li>
            <li> and I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks with morning and bedtime use have started noticing a brighter more youthful appearance to my skin.</li>
            <li> Have been using the serum for several weeks and my skin feels wonderful...</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I will give it some more time to see results.</li>
            <li> I simply love this product too...</li>
            <li> You can do better at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> Love this potion.</li>
            <li> I will keep using this product to see how much better my face gets.</li>
            <li> I love the texture and feel of this serum...</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a serum which would give the most noticeable results for the aging skin (my skin).  </li>
            <li> Soft and smooth and feels great!</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin more luminous.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I will order more before I run out on it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t return the product since it has been over a month ago, but SURE I will never ever order this brand again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I used it.  </li>
            <li> Even the bottle has an elegant feel to it.  </li>
            <li> I love 180 Cosmetics.</li>
            <li> This is great product and Vitamin C works really well to plump up the skin.  </li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> She said this product is really working great</li>
            <li> Great serum with high percentage of hyaluronic acid AND vitamin c!  </li>
            <li> I thought the volume of serum was more when I ordered it.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic serum!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better one.  </li>
            <li> I will be ordering more soon.  </li>
            <li> Light and not greasy!  </li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling fantastic!</li>
            <li> Just try it, your skin will love you for it.</li>
            <li> There are much better choice for comparable products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this 5 stars because I absolutely love the product, but there is one caveat, the size.</li>
            <li> I have since added a product containing retinol for even better results</li>
            <li> I Imagined it more thicker</li>
            <li> I love that fact that its not oily, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my fingers or face feeling oily.</li>
            <li> ok no problem.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s improved the lines between my eyes most of all.</li>
            <li> This product is ok, but there are better.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, you need more.  </li>
            <li> I think this is a product that will be on my face regiment for many years to come at 59.  </li>
            <li> I look glowing and my turkey neck is in much better shape.  </li>
            <li> The 180 Cosmetics brand is more luxurious, has vitamin C, and works even better.  </li>
            <li> He gave me a recovery serum from Melanopeel made with argan oil which gave me better results.</li>
            <li> It feels like water on the skin - LOVE it and will continue to order it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: This product was sent to me for free for review, but all opinions 100% honest and unbiased</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m going to order more.</li>
            <li> Like many products  </li>
            <li> but it does moisturize very well, and makes my skin look great.</li>
            <li> I ordered two bottles this time, just to see if using it for more than a month would make a difference.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> and I am hoping this will help the serum work better.</li>
            <li> This product was ok</li>
            <li> Most people claim I look 35 anyway, so maybe I&#x27;m a bit premature with all of this.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, without redness, and my skin has a nice glow as a result of it.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Worth the money and works even BETTER when used with a micro needles roller or a microdermibrasion buffer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If nothing else it makes me feel like I look better.</li>
            <li> My skin looks my better.</li>
            <li> I want more....</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> but I had tried another brand that had more of a tightening property to it</li>
            <li> After trying many products, I found this to work similarily as others.  </li>
            <li> but for now, I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> I like it - it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I Love it...</li>
            <li> so have ordered more.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I found the more</li>
            <li> I used it the more</li>
            <li> I was completely satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li> i did love it</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Love that product, you will too</li>
            <li> I am still looking for a better product l didn&#x27;t like the alcohol content in this product I would have preferred more of the vitamin C and hyaluronic acid.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much better my skin looks already&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I plan to order some more and see if it just takes time to work</li>
            <li> re-ordered the Swiss Formula because i got better and quicker results.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I have had many may compliments on the smoothness and glow it</li>
            <li> Seems to work okay, but nothing beats Dr. perricone nueropeptide.</li>
            <li> I waited to review this until I was sure of how this product affected my skin.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic Product!  </li>
            <li> But the rest are ok.</li>
            <li> so I oredered one more time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pretty sure there has been improvement in my skin/wrinkles</li>
            <li> I need more of a moisturizing product.</li>
            <li> I love the anti aging.</li>
            <li> I need to use a longer time to see more the properties.</li>
            <li> I ordered more and will see if more skin improvement.</li>
            <li> Skin already feels better.</li>
            <li> Should know more after a weeks use.  </li>
            <li> She was pleased with it and has been using it.</li>
            <li> but I feel that using this product will help prevent more damage.</li>
            <li> I love the combo of</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thicker and more concentrated that others.</li>
            <li> I love the product.  </li>
            <li> most all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If so, please do not send me any more.</li>
            <li> I use this at night mostly...</li>
            <li> (your skin doing most of it&#x27;s regenerating then)</li>
            <li> I will order more soon.</li>
            <li> an exellent product, timely delivery,was what I ordered extremely satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I love the way the serum flows over my face.</li>

            <li> :)</li>
            <li> My skin is looking much better.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with it and look forward to a facial improvement</li>
            <li> love the way it feels</li>
            <li> test it and make sure it works.  </li>
            <li> Please keep your cost as it is for ones to buy more of it.  </li>
            <li> It has nice consistency, almost gooey and applies on smoothly to your skin.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> For a product that I use twice a day, I thought I would see more improvement.</li>
            <li> I love it,  </li>
            <li> Sincerely, Alice</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Will continue to use some more.</li>
            <li> it is ok.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve seen anything magical, but I do believe it&#x27;s helping to keep my skin more moisturized (without breaking me out...</li>
            <li> but I do love the feeling of the tightening effect after application.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem any better than vitamin C, you get what u pay for</li>
            <li> box itself was not sealed, which would of been okay if the product itself was sealed.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s cheap, so take a chance!</li>
            <li> have tried many products and</li>
            <li> I love the product and have used it for years.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have visible age spots on my face, but I do see areas on my cheeks, nose and forehead that are damaged by too many hours in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The improvement I&#x27;ve noticed the most is the improvement in the elasticity of my skin.  </li>
            <li> My neck looks firmer and my face just looks more rested and</li>
            <li> than that, I didn&#x27;t have many wrinkles to begin with</li>
            <li> It feels refreshing on the face.</li>
            <li> I ordered more to share with her.</li>
            <li> Glad I had seen this advertisement on tv.</li>
            <li> If anything I feel like my acne has gotten better.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> and I think a better product.</li>
            <li> keeping that glow that I love.</li>
            <li> :) Going to look for a cheaper alternative, but I would recommend for wrinkles and acne.</li>
            <li> I hope I feel better because my skin hurts a lot.</li>
            <li> My skin has improved the more I use it.</li>
            <li> and i love it.</li>
            <li> if &amp;#34;I love it&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> and I love what it has done for my face.</li>
            <li> In the morning I do see my skin more refreshed.</li>
            <li> Glad</li>
            <li> Ok so I have this serum in my possession close to 3 weeks and quite frankly  there is no difference to my skin.</li>
            <li> Love it, can see a change already</li>
            <li> thanks for a great product.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll test the product out and see if it seems OK to use but based on how it was shipped I will not be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> I am glad to have tried this product.</li>
            <li> Glad I didn&#x27;t pay a lot, and got to try it out</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> i love it ..</li>
            <li> It has worked phenomenally with the peels and hydration masks I have started to repair years of sun damage and to turn my skin around.</li>
            <li> I love this.  </li>
            <li> okay still waitting.</li>
            <li> Will give it one more week.</li>
            <li> much more even!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Most of cosmetic bottles that I&#x27;ve used are not like this.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for two weeks and the results keep getting better by the day.</li>
            <li> this is not the cheapest product out there with the same ingredients but the results are wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I love it and will continue to buy from this seller.</li>
            <li> I have seen a notable difference in my skin since using this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok....</li>
            <li> This is ok just need to use more of it .</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> However I must say I see a glow and a more youthful look already.</li>
            <li> Really love this product.  </li>
            <li> so I will probably need more sooner than if you just use it on your face and neck.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure it will take a gallon at my age.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> love it..</li>
            <li> Though not a &#x27;sun worshiper,&#x27; I do love yard work and being outdoors.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> be sure you have time to wait for it.</li>
            <li> skin looks better already after two days of use.</li>
            <li> Just OK.</li>
            <li> I would say that I would recommend it if I knew more about it</li>
            <li> The only reason I don&#x27;t give it five stars is because the smell is not the best.</li>
            <li> have tried many products</li>
            <li> but this product is at the top of my list for effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is a gel.</li>
            <li> I noticed that it is better used with another moisturizer on top.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin silky smooth and glowing!</li>
            <li> &quot; and more of the acid, or if it is because of the vitamin C in it.  </li>
            <li> I bet you will love it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t notice any difference like so many others reported seeing.</li>
            <li> I had brought this after seeing so many 5 star review.</li>

            <li> I look better, I can tell it&#x27;s working.</li>

            <li> I look forward to seeing more results as time goes by.</li>
            <li> I love this serum.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel once I apply it.  </li>
            <li> I have skin that is allergic to many products and this works well without irritation and since I also have combination skin maybe it would cause breakouts</li>
            <li> I love the way the product makes my face feel.</li>
            <li> I sure hope it works soon.</li>
            <li> Excellent product to use daily.</li>

            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Im gonna use this product again and again:)</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t feel like serum but water and the package appeared tampered with...not sure where...possibly in transit...</li>
            <li> I sometimes touch up with more dabs of this serum throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> I bought more of this product and have been using it now for months and still love it.  </li>
            <li> Bottle was not sealed properly so most of the product was gone before it got to me; felt it may have lost its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I need more.</li>
            <li> This is another awesome product for next to nothing.</li>
            <li> Keep healthy skin face</li>
            <li> I love the product but did not pay attention to the size of the item.  </li>
            <li> and I can already tell a difference in my wrinkles and age spots, can&#x27;t afford a face lift and not so sure that would be the way to go anyway</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product, in fact, have purchased a second bottle.  </li>
            <li> and I am still upset I wasn&#x27;t able to finish the bottle.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not nasty but maybe a bit herbal?</li>
            <li> it absorbs through the skin and leaves my skin glowing and healthy.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to any woman over 40 who wants a great product.</li>
            <li> I have been using them for many many months.  </li>
            <li> not that I have that many...</li>
            <li> I love the style like serumwhat</li>
            <li> Skin feels more hydrated and plumper.</li>
            <li> This is, possibly, the best product I&#x27;ve ever found in the &#x27;fountain of youth&#x27; category...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Hoping that trying out for 2 more weeks will have better results.  </li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels after using this serum.  </li>
            <li> feels much more hydrated.</li>
            <li> As a forty-something woman, I decided I needed to start taking better care of my skin.  </li>
            <li> Great bargain and arrived fast.</li>
            <li> and I can put sunscreen on top for daytime.</li>
            <li> This is awesome and it last all day!</li>
            <li> I found something better</li>
            <li> buy more, I hope for a better offer</li>
            <li> I put this on and magically they disappear.</li>
            <li> am so happy I found this and at such a good price.</li>
            <li> I will be getting more of this serum.</li>
            <li> more time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and I&#x27;m very satisfied because it&#x27;s absorbs well and won&#x27;t leave your face cakey like some products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased and will become a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> With 180° Cosmetics Pure Swiss Hyaluronic Serum + Oxygen, your skin gets the nourishing ingredients it needs to stay toned, smooth, rejuvenated, and beautiful.</li>
            <li> so far so good!</li>
            <li> Yes, so far so good!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m picky about the ingredients I put on my skin (which is a large, absorbent organ!), and this serum is formulated with good ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m picky about the ingredients I put on my skin (which is a large, absorbent organ!), and this serum is formulated with good ingredients.  </li>
            <li> It has no smell, which is good when it comes to serums, because most of the serums I&#x27;ve come into contact with always have a funny smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews but this product is great.</li>
            <li> His skin is pretty good for his age</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful product for my sensitive skin.  </li>

            <li> Nice light serum, not sticky and fragrance free.</li>
            <li> It goes very nicely and absorbs quickly so I can apply my moisturize right after.</li>
            <li> I tried another that was well rated and did not get the quick, beautiful results as I did with the 180 pure Swiss product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not designed nor effective for us older girls!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with it so far!</li>
            <li> This is great so far!  </li>
            <li> Very light and comfortable on the skin.</li>
            <li> I never skip the 3-5 minutes it takes to clean and nourish my face, and it pays off!  </li>
            <li> Hopefully I&#x27;ll&lt;br /&gt;be able to give you a fine review once I&#x27;ve tried it for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;Thnaks</li>
            <li> I am hopeful, however, that soon I will see some progress in eliminating or significantly reducing my more prominent wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Also I like that the ingredients are more straightforward than most serums.</li>
            <li> but hey, I&#x27;m okay with a quick fix when I want it!  </li>
            <li> I really loved the Ultima Pure Swiss Hyaluranic Acid Serum</li>

            <li> I love the light scent and the way it does not make my face feel oily.</li>
            <li> I used it after one week, I felt the difference,my skin being more smooth.</li>
            <li> A Great price for a quality product that is proven skin care nourishment and keeps aging skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li> Love it it makes your skin feel so smooth.</li>
            <li> Thus far, it is great.</li>
            <li> So far, I am happy with the product and hopeful that it will improve the condition of my face and hand skin challenges.  </li>
            <li> So far I have not seen any great changes in my skin</li>

            <li> I was given this serum and totally loved the way it made my face feel so soft, when I ran out I ordered more.  </li>
            <li> It does absorb quickly and is very light.</li>
            <li> but I was really impressed at how quickly my skin absorbed the serum and how soft and smooth my face looked in the morning.</li>
            <li> Produced nice dewy results at first.</li>
            <li> but to those of you that wish to spend the money go for it, it feels nice on the skin, and the bottle is pretty.</li>
            <li> I will know more after a full bottle use.</li>
            <li> In the last 2 days, 4 of my friends all commented on how beautiful I looked, and asked if I had changed my makeup or hairstyle.</li>
            <li> My beautiful daughter is the last person in the world that needs this</li>
            <li> Product looks nice in a pretty bottle but it did not perform as it advertised.  </li>

            <li> I like this because it seems to be filling in those fine lines around my eyes and mouth.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> My fine lines around my eyes are smoother, the crease inbetween</li>
            <li> It tightens up the skin and reduces fine lines.</li>
            <li> It visibly reduces fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It smooths the skin and pumps up the fine lines.  </li>
            <li> I have already noticed that the fine lines around my eyes aren&#x27;t as visible and my skins texture is smoother.  </li>
            <li> I recommended it to my daughter-in-law who said she was already finding the fine lines around her mouth.</li>
            <li> Would like to get rid of those fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of use I have a noticeable difference in the fine lines around my eyes and even the deeper lines beneath my nose.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I started to see fine lines &amp;#34;fuzz out&amp;#34; and the texture of my skin was like I had never felt it before.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>

            <li> No difference in fine lines.</li>

            <li> Helps diminish fine lines and gives you a glow too.</li>

            <li> The fine lines around my lips have all but disappeared.  </li>
            <li> It seems to me that they do lessen fine lines and they do lighten daker spots.  </li>

            <li> old and my skin is fine and sensitive and this product has been great!</li>
            <li> Nice packaging, looks very high quality, but the product itself is just &#x27;meh&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Not greasy at all and easy to wear make up or lotion very right over it.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle and makes putting on makeup reallye easy too!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to all!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference and felt like I needed to use a moisturizer and eye cream with it.</li>
            <li> I really like how it goes on nice and smooth, and i don&#x27;t feel like I need moisturizer after I put it on.</li>
            <li> I just used it once and noticed a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> I like the product, but it was not a 30 day supply to make an accurate assessment.</li>

            <li> I have noticed a huge difference  in my skin.</li>

            <li> Makeup can go over it smoothly.  </li>
            <li> This serum feels nice, but it really burned after microneedling with my derma roller and my skin reacted.</li>
            <li> I applied it morning and night, make up goes on smoothly over it.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see that much of a difference, but it was nice because after you put it on it tighten up your face so that&#x27;s was nice.</li>
            <li> I do like the way it glides over my face, however I enjoy using a product that leaves the skin feeling moist.  </li>
            <li> A consumer expects a filled bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it primarily for age spots</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy with this product, and already look about 8 years younger,</li>

            <li> The bottle lasted me almost 3 months, so I&#x27;m really pleased with that, which is why i think it&#x27;s definitely worth purchasing again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> of course the price was cheap and it must be a reason.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping nice item</li>
            <li> I smooth it in after using a needle roller.</li>
            <li> skin looks smooth</li>
            <li> It is absolutely fantastic on my rosaesa face with pores....</li>
            <li> what I like the most about this one  is the texture of my skin, which is smoother, fresh and moist-looking.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t get glowing wrinkle free skin either .&lt;br</li>
            <li> Softens the skin and makes it feel so smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great non greasy treatment to my facial regiment.</li>
            <li> Nice but soaks up fast</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made my face skin so smooth.</li>
            <li> Tried 3 drops on my face and felt smooth immediately.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> noticeable smooth skin results within 3 days...</li>
            <li> begins to tighten and smooth.  </li>
            <li> gives me a smooth texture.  </li>
            <li> The line on my face filled out, cellulite is leaving and stretch marks are fading away.  </li>
            <li> Smooth, would purchase again.</li>
            <li> The bottle looks cheaply made and the product does not do anything at all to my skin.</li>
            <li> The price is great for the quality;but, wish it came in a larger size.</li>
            <li> AND  REALLY  SMOOTH.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just trying to smooth out the wrinkles some.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin look and feel smooth.  </li>
            <li> I was about to be cheap and order another brand</li>
            <li> If she likes it then it has to truly be a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> This feels so light on the skin and doesn&#x27;t make the skin oily or greasy.</li>
            <li> I can tell such a great difference in my appearance and</li>
            <li> Seems to be great, only have been using it for a week.</li>
            <li> I did not notice any fantastic results.</li>
            <li> This serum makes my face feel smooth</li>
            <li> and, that is important to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was looking for a light anti aging moisturizer to go with it.</li>
            <li> It goes on so smoothly and feels like silk.</li>
            <li> My cheeks are smooth.  </li>
            <li> it just feels light when it&#x27;s applied.  </li>
            <li> the few drops I tried were awesome..</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t gotten any younger LOL.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the product: 180 Cosmetics,  Hyaluronic Acid Serum + Vitamin C.</li>
            <li> After complaining they sent me a knew one which came great the second time.</li>
            <li> smooth skin in one week of use.</li>
            <li> This is nice after doing home micro-dermabrasion and helps with healing and collagen production, but you have to be consistent in using it to get the full results.</li>
            <li> So far I like this product, feels good on the skin.  </li>
            <li> far so good</li>
            <li> So far item feel good on the skin, will have to use for a longer time to give a five star.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> I have just started using this product and so far so good.  </li>
            <li> So far so good, still waiting to see all results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne for years and recently started doing diamond microdermabrasion, which on its own is effective but takes time.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Love this product , love the price , absolutely fantastic fast results.</li>
            <li> I am 74 years old and have always taken good care of my skin.</li>
            <li> Thanks, you have a great priduct that really works.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my new serum.</li>
            <li> So for right now I have to say It&#x27;s okay because I am not done using it.</li>
            <li> : Make sure you check it right away after you receive it.</li>
            <li> I typically do not use serums, as I&#x27;ve never gotten particularly good results with any I&#x27;ve tried, so don&#x27;t incur the expense of buying them.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Really like this serum!!!</li>
            <li> Best results if you let it soak in and dry completely before &amp;#34;layering&amp;#34; with your favorite moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Important to apply to clean</li>
            <li> effective when you consider for me it averaged out to $4-$5/month for a decent skincare product.</li>
            <li> The makers have managed to hit upon that perfect consistency--- not too thick and sticky, yet not so watery that you can&#x27;t apply it easily.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and the results were very noticeable and rewarding.</li>
            <li> and I was not disappointed it has made my eyes look 100%</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say that I can tell a significant difference  in my skin around my eyes which is where I needed it.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin softer than the other brands I have tried, and I love the texture of it... not just watery liquid (like most HA serums), but this one has a slightly more viscous texture, which is lovely.  </li>
            <li> I am taking off one star from my original rating.to</li>
            <li> I am taking off one star from my original rating.</li>
            <li> So far, am very pleased with product.  </li>
            <li> Not disappointed though.</li>
            <li> :) thanks!</li>
            <li> and  I was so excited.  </li>
            <li> Smile lines (aka parentheses) have almost vanished!</li>
            <li> so I was excited to try the serum to see if it helped.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 more bottles as the price went up from the first time I ordered.</li>
            <li> Now that the top layer is almost exfoliated, the skin underneath is looking better than ever, and feels soft as a baby!</li>
            <li> When used with the roller ball, there is a significant reduction in skin pores and the texture of your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure, but I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed by this.</li>
            <li> My original review said that I thought that this product gave me rash</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get it.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
            <li> At first, I had to use a lot more than I do now.  </li>
            <li> It helps replenish the moisture content of aging and environmentally damaged skin, restores youthful radiance, smooths the look of fine lines, and helps increase the skin&#x27;s ability to retain moisture, leaving skin fresh and fabulous.</li>
            <li> Fine lines leaving, laugh lines filled out.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and is easily absorbed.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to be absorbed.</li>
            <li> During that time, I really liked how fast it absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li> After hearing that both hyaluronic acid and topical vitamin C were good for firming skin and protecting it from free radicals, I started to look for a product.  </li>
            <li> I have had similar experiences with a MAC Studio fix powder that I got from Amazon on good discout and it turned out a duplicate (confirmed).</li>
            <li> This is, by far, the best facial product I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li> I will see more positive results.</li>
            <li> and I am expecting more positive results.</li>
            <li> I wish I could write something more positive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is very effective, and I have had only success using this with my clients!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, I do love this product, and I do think it is noticeably superior to other brands I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the packaging the bottle and dropper top are super classy looking</li>
            <li> I have many large pores on my face</li>
            <li> I have tried pure Hyaluronic Acid before, but this one combines Vit. C with HA, and it seems to work better.</li>
            <li> Not anything special.  </li>
            <li> so I think it will take more than using Pure Swiss for 2 weeks to see a difference.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I found 180 Pure Swiss.</li>
            <li> and my face was bright red.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good so far, noticing a difference....</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used long but impressed so far with product.  </li>
            <li> in pictures my skin looks like its of a 15 yr old girl, amazing.</li>
            <li> I really think I&#x27;m enjoying this</li>
            <li> It arrived fairly timely but just not enough usage yet to determine efficacy.</li>
            <li> Good stuff but its not very big...</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> That being said, the product is so good that I AM constantly re-ordering.</li>
            <li> Also, I think the bottle is very well designed and elegant.  </li>
            <li> To be fair - I have only used it for 3 days - but I can see some results already.  </li>
            <li> This was 3/4 full.  </li>
            <li> It is too early to tell how effective it is.</li>
            <li> Just beginning to use this product and so far loving the affect on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have ordered another bottle, hoping it will be full.  </li>
            <li> but I never see any difference with any wrinkle cream that I use the only good thing</li>
            <li> So a rating I would say give me a full month.</li>
            <li> and I love it, but didn&#x27;t really like the price.  </li>
            <li> the serum feels nice, but as far as what it will do for my skin</li>
            <li> My skin feel soft and nice.</li>
            <li> I love this so much.</li>
            <li> I use some Lancome products and this is as effective and natural, unlike all the additives in Lancome.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 30&#x27;s and want wrinkle and pimple prevention!&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I am very impressed with this and have seen a noticeable change taking place already.</li>
            <li> It will be interesting to see if the Ultima makes as much change as the Mary Kay does.</li>
            <li> I absolute love this product</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something to keep my skin feeling soft and nice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: I did end up receiving a full refund.</li>
            <li> We love it, we did a lots of research before purchase and came up with a promising result.</li>
            <li> It has a nice soft texture.</li>
            <li> I am getting ready to reorder, I have found some wrinkle changes that aren&#x27;t there any more</li>
            <li> Price is not bad either.</li>
            <li> First time user; so far so good</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly, leaves the skin baby-soft to touch and feeling fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li> my skin looks so smooth, I definitely plan to order more!</li>
            <li> It is perfect for a special evening out because it tightens the skin instantly and keeps that look for several hours.</li>
            <li> At first my skin reacted with dome raised pores that emptied quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> Purchase was fine, but have not used product enough to know how effective it is.</li>
            <li> Makes my face nice and plump vanishing any super fine lines instantly.  </li>
            <li> In the morning I follow up with 50 spf cc cream from It Cosmetics and my skin, which tends to get oily, feels fresh and clean all day.</li>
            <li> but it seems as though I&#x27;m running through it quickly.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll be lucky to get another couple of weeks out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> It dries quickly and leaves skin feeling super</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Intense hydration in a super concentrated 75 percent hyaluronic acid serum helps keep the skin hydrated all day and night with an invisible veil of moisture.</li>
            <li> My skin feels like it is getting more of the serum in each drop rather than having to put more on to make it feel like I have coated my face properly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick drying and doesn&#x27;t leave that gunky serum feel on my face.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quick.</li>
            <li> but it dries  quickly.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and as described</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> It is not oily and soaks into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li> Noticeable difference to skin tone, absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> I like the product , quick delivery</li>
            <li> One drop is adequate to cover your face.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand companies that overcharge when they&#x27;ll make more keeping at a decent price.  </li>
            <li> Better products out there that actually work better too</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly in a well-packed container.</li>
            <li> Time will work its magic; I&#x27;ve only just begun. :)</li>
            <li> It spreads around like a light gel, when it dries it seems to clear up my pores so my moisturizer will soak in better.  </li>
            <li> and I even saw a mild peeling, nothing noticeable after applying moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It soaks in quickly.</li>
            <li> My skin drinks it up quickly.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t greasy, it absorbs quickly and I am seeing a difference in the tightness of my face.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and helps skin to feel smoother after 1 use.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feeling.  </li>
            <li> I thought my face was looking older with more wrinkles after 4 days of use</li>
            <li> Thanks for such a great product.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and packaged well.  </li>
            <li> With so many crucial vitamins and anti-aging ingredients, this packs it in for the price. :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure with regular use the impact would be greater.</li>
            <li> I like it very much it leaves my skin silky smooth</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the performance of the product and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product is so clean, I&#x27;ve had no negative reaction to it which says a lot about this product!!!</li>
            <li> I have ordered this due to all the good reviews it had, but trust me when I say this, I&#x27;m very aware of all the fine lines I have</li>
            <li> Worked like a charm, from the very first try.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the lovely texture and better results are due to the addition of Vitamin C (which supposedly has superb anti-aging properties) or something else.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, Watts did not have the added vitamin C, which is supposed to be a powerful anti-aging and collagen producing ingredient, and the type of vitamin C that 180 Cosmetics uses is indeed the very best and most expensive type, which is the gentlest on the skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is pretty cheap and lasts me about a month.&lt;br /&gt;So</li>
            <li> I am sure by using it a few more weeks-there will be an even more noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this products that I had purchased recently.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth trying and at a great price compared to other products.  </li>
            <li> After trying other products through the years, this by far is the best and for the price it is unbeatable in my option.</li>
            <li> The very first use, I noticed the difference.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty fantastic.</li>
            <li> No unpleasant scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&amp;#34;180&#x27; Cosmetics Pure Swiss Hyaluronic Serum + Vitamin C&amp;#34; is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> very wonderful.she love it very much.</li>
            <li> I love the product but will probably look for a new place to provide it to me.</li>
            <li> I found it absorbed quickly allowing me to get on with my morning and night routines.  </li>
            <li> I had been using it for the last month, i have to say it is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve been able to find long-term (as in 6-8 hours) relief from my skin drying out so much that it burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A bit sticky compared to Keihl&#x27;s product, but feels good once dry.  </li>
            <li> I do like the who easy and fast</li>
            <li> Love this my skin is very sensitive  </li>
            <li> I will be back for more!</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more!</li>
            <li> SHe also stated it does not take much at each use!!</li>
            <li> Love it for the first time in a while my skin glows:) Will definitely get another bottle when I finish this 1.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it as well and like it enough to purchase more!</li>
            <li> I love it so far!</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited for this to come in bc of all the ratings on it.  </li>
            <li> So I tried it, and I really like it...!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> I applied the product in both the morning and evening right after cleansing with a mildly exfoliating cleanser like Neutrogena Pore Minimizer and toner like Sea Breeze.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the product and a very good source for beauty aide, but it is hard...</li>
            <li> Order came super fast, classy box for the serum, nice for gift giving, but I won&#x27;t be doing that.  </li>
            <li> It really eliminated fine lines and reduced a lot of the deeper lines around the eye area.  </li>
            <li> I gently rub it into fine lines...</li>
            <li> It is so light, almost feels like pure water, I used it during night in the summer by itself.</li>
            <li> super smooth serum, dries fast, the smell is a big turn off but who cares when the results are so amazing.</li>
            <li> After a little over a week of use I have not seen any changes in my skin but the product feels great.  </li>
            <li> have tested several different hyaluronic acids out there and 180 Pure Swiss has given me the best results out of them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly</li>
            <li> In just moments, this amazing serum penetrates deep into the skin, nourishing it from the core.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Immediately after applying, I could tell that my skin was going to feel amazing after just a short time!  </li>
            <li> This product is truly amazing, I keep it on my night stand and apply it religiously every night.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and is very soothing.</li>
            <li> I have even gotten a few comments on how great my skin looks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> From the very fist time I feel my skin so smooth and regenerated..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this serum for just 2 days, and that too only in the morning, cannot believe how amazing this product is.</li>
            <li> Really makes my skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li> Hopefully my sharing this information will lead to a more accurate product description with age recommendations included so others like me won&#x27;t make the same mistake.</li>
            <li> Also is useful as under light-weight foundation.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled that the results are noticeable and have made such a change.</li>
            <li> It would be nice to have a bigger bottle of the product.  </li>
            <li> It was so soft and smooth!  </li>
            <li> however,somedays I wake up and think it almost makes me look more wrinkly and older...could be my imagination, but I don&#x27;t notice any considerable difference.  </li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not crazy about the sticky feeling it leaves on  my face, once I put my moisturizer on</li>
            <li> Really works great after derma rolling my face, though it really would turn your face really red when you applied it</li>
            <li> I think I will need to use the serum for several weeks before I can tell if it is effective</li>
            <li> but I love how soft it makes my skin.</li>
            <li> but it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> However, I like the way the product goes on and seems to be absorbed well.</li>
            <li> feel I am getting my moneys worth with this product....</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> But so far I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try a different serum or make my own finding ingredients on amazon.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary sample of 180 Cosmetics serum for testing and review purposes.</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary sample of 180 Cosmetics serum for testing and review purposes.</li>
            <li> Just started to use, so far okay.  </li>
            <li> I am a 61 year old Gentleman and I was blessed with healthy skin but</li>
            <li> I got MAYBE 2 weeks worth out of it.</li>
            <li> I started using the serum last year and I am thrilled with the results, as well as the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> But for this price, it worth it a try.</li>
            <li> This serum proves it.</li>
            <li> It is well worth its price.</li>
            <li> find it an economical product because the amount of serum needed for is just one drop.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> My skin appears  to be more radiant, clear.</li>
            <li> Skin feels more supple and soft.</li>
            <li> Once that is totally absorbed into my skin, I apply a moisturizing sunscreen by Neutrogena.  </li>
            <li> Worked on a smile line.</li>
            <li> I had to go back using the kind I already have.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It DOES NOT sting and for me who has sensitive skin, that matters most.</li>
            <li> I bought the product to use on the smile lines or folds on both sides of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> this product leaves my skin feeling fresh &amp; silky.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and holds moisturizer better when Ultima is under it.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed applying the product to my skin, which has a tendency to be somewhat sensitive.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because I have been in search of something that would help smooth my wrinkles and improve my overall skin tone and, for the most part,  it has DELIVERED</li>
            <li> My skin felt fresh and looked healthier.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll worth the price.</li>
            <li> I am using the serum with phytoceramides and in less than a month the results are amazing!  </li>
            <li> That being said, apply it quickly, as it dries fast!</li>
            <li> I fould another good deal on this product with some other things</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other stuff before and nothing is as good as this.</li>
            <li> The price is right and affordable.  </li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m not using it right or something, but I don&#x27;t have time to play.</li>
            <li> and I can see a tightening right away.  </li>
            <li> The product stays in place right where it is needed.</li>
            <li> Right now I&#x27;m neutral.  </li>
            <li> My scowl was turning into a permanent river right between the eyes.</li>
            <li> and I can see a tightening right away.</li>
            <li> I could notice a difference right away.</li>
            <li> Then I wait an hour in a cool room and apply a couple other products.&lt;br /&gt;You can be rid of many crow&#x27;s feet fine lines in about a week.</li>
            <li> I thought from all the positive feedback this would be very moisturizing, but on my skin which is very nice but dry, it has done nothing.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know how long it takes to get good results</li>
            <li> Well worth the price and much more affordable than buying a less concentrated version in many of the moisturizers you will find on the market.</li>
            <li> I am 57 and my skin has held up remarkably but it is starting to show some signs of being 57 with marionette lines near my mouth and lines around my lips and my under eye area has bags.  </li>
            <li> I only put 3 stars at this time but I like how its easy to apply &amp; absorbs quickly but its too soon to comment on how it works.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> It is a Nice product, I felt it helped with some fine lines, very light feeling on the face, I used it up fast, very small bottle, I would use it again and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> So far very good and can see a difference after less than 2 vials.  </li>
            <li> I found absolutely nothing special about this product.</li>
            <li> My skin seems more more even toned with less lines.</li>
            <li> We are very conscious about using a good stuff in our daily life.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> It is wonderful for all skin types, and especially for mature facial skin, both for women and men.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> I have bought several different hyaluronic acid serum products before and this is the best so far.</li>
            <li> Worth difference in higher price but again not alot in quantity.</li>
            <li> and I found it light not thick.</li>
            <li> This stuff takes 6 months of silt use to REALLY give your skin the full benefits.</li>
            <li> After only using one body I have seen a huge difference in the diminished appearance of fine lines around my lips/ mouth.</li>
            <li> Who could ask for more.&lt;br /&gt;Brings back the softness and helps smooth out fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Like this particular serum say, original price was $89.89 and is being sold for $14.43 (84% discount).</li>
            <li> Get it right the first time.</li>
            <li> but it certainly does not help after!  </li>
            <li> a product i will certainly buy again!</li>
            <li> Very helpful and quick response time</li>
            <li> Liked what was left in the bottle, I see the difference absolutely....</li>
            <li> I am a 69 year old female with fairly good skin (</li>
            <li> hasnt been that long..maybe i can review better in a few more weeks</li>
            <li> Spreads very well and the skin absorbs it quickly.  </li>
            <li> After a nice cleansing skin massage using a face brush, splash on a toner and dry.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product and will be ordering more, has helped my sensitive skin quit a bit.  </li>
            <li> I really feel like this stuff was cheap because it is not the real stuff.  </li>
            <li> I use it every morning, and maybe I shouldn&#x27;t use as much as I do, but hey, if it&#x27;s not broken, don&#x27;t fit it.  </li>
            <li> The product absorbed quickly and it was fine to apply my regular skin care regiment over it.  </li>
            <li> Very satisfied and will keep ordering due to the results</li>
            <li> just goes right into your skin and makes it look smooth and soft yet</li>
            <li> Very reasonably prices as well.</li>
            <li> This product is watery and dries very fast on your skin.  </li>
            <li> also  appreciate it&#x27;s very reasonable</li>
            <li> I very much hopes product works as stated.  </li>
            <li> I like this stuff very much and will use it again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have any smell, absorbs very fast, doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like it very much .the</li>
            <li> I like this product very much.</li>
            <li> thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivary</li>
            <li> Very gentle serum</li>
            <li> I like the product, for it makes my facial skin very smooth when I put it on.  </li>
            <li> I meant to say is I like it very much</li>
            <li> I love the way it goes on so smoothly and a few drops covers far more area than I imagined.</li>
            <li> My skin texture is soft and the fine lines are disappearing after two weeks of using it.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and fine lines are gone.</li>
            <li> Fine lines nearly disappeared once you apply.</li>
            <li> It smells good (mildly like big red gum) and tightened up my skin immediately.  </li>
            <li> Well, I have not seen any change, yet, but I do wish, as with some products there is a positive glow or feeling with your skin right away.  </li>
            <li> My face seems to &#x27;puff&#x27; out a little (in a good way) and the lines seem to be gone.  </li>
            <li> It would have to do something tremendously in the next few days for me to buy it again!!  :D</li>
            <li> To be fair, I have super sensitive skin (which is why I only use all natural products with no chemicals), so it is possible that others won&#x27;t have the same sensitivity I experienced.  </li>

            <li> Hard lesson learned for me, lol.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lucky as the gals in my family always looked good, even in old age, due to youthful skin.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to give it the full 5-star rating, but it does feel good going on</li>
            <li> First of all, this is not a fake review.</li>
            <li> This serum makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Wish I could buy some more at the same price!</li>
            <li> High-end technology brings the anti-aging solution that regenerates your skin cells and provides the moisture your skin needs to look and feel young and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have only used for a couple of days, we shall see after many weeks.  </li>
            <li> it really worked for me!</li>
            <li> I purchased several and glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I love this because as soon as you put this on you can feel your skin get the instant hydration it needs.</li>
            <li> This is a plumper so you can instantly feel this as soon as you put this on around your eyes, which I love.</li>
            <li> really see a difference!</li>
            <li> I used this for 1 month, and I saw no results, so I switched to a different brand, which I like a lot better.</li>
            <li> Transaction was fast!</li>
            <li> I really hope this will take care of that &amp;#34;waddle&amp;#34; under my chin!  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I almost done with the first bottle</li>
            <li> Many is the day I forgot till later that evening.</li>
            <li> Takes way more than a couple drops, I stream it on to my entire face with the dropper.</li>
            <li> I love it and would definitely order it again!</li>
            <li> , the glass bottle broke, so I was only able to get 3 days use out of it.</li>
            <li> My skin feels really smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> I will most likely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more in the future.  </li>
            <li> Lines that were looking better with another similar product have now returned within 2 wks.  </li>
            <li> I had tried another brand first</li>
            <li> Take the first step to feeling younger!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;a</li>
            <li> I first tried this serum when I saw a Dr. Oz show</li>
            <li> , my skin is smooth, clear and  firm.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I ordered this and when it arrived I was surprised that the package seemed light.  </li>
            <li> My wife was pleased with the results in only four days.  </li>
            <li> I think I noticed a change the first day I used the product.  </li>
            <li> First product I didn&#x27;t have to throw out from irritation.</li>
            <li> I first wash my face and tone it...</li>
            <li> This item makes your face smooth, soft.</li>
            <li> My face feels smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Actually there are more than 15 days of use</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s really working!</li>
            <li> and I think my expectations were more of that of a jar of cream with  the above ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> I really like this product!  </li>
            <li> i think the younger you are when you beginb using this, the better it will work for you, although even at my age</li>
            <li> First time tried this product.</li>
            <li> Dries almost on contact - doesn&#x27;t feel oily, makes your skin really smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I just got this today to use with my derma roller (first time using both).  </li>
            <li> Over the last two years I&#x27;ve been using Hyaluronic acid and Vitamin C serums and love the way they help my skin renew itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We are told that this product is very safe for everyone, and only natural ingredients were used.</li>
            <li> I noticed immediately the clear smooth sink.  </li>
            <li> , I think another 3 to 4 weeks is necessary to give this a better review on how it&#x27;s working for me.</li>
            <li> all gone and it made me pretty</li>
            <li> will be ordering more, should be offered in bigger bottle!</li>
            <li> Just trying this for the first time seems to work as directed with no breakouts</li>
            <li> but I am willing to use it longer and find out.</li>
            <li> Not what i expected but feels nice on your skin, i of course am looking for that fountain of youth, haha, something that fills in wrinkles!</li>
            <li> I have used many serums over the last 10 years,this one tops them all.</li>
            <li> funny how this universe works...</li>
            <li> Love this product just wish the bottle was bigger.</li>
            <li> but i will continue using it as i know it helps retain moisture which is key to having youthful skin:-)</li>
            <li> Most products I have to remind myself to use, this product I have to remind myself to only use it twice a day.</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> Want one product that gives you younger, more radiant skin.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product because it has some similar ingredients to another product that I love and has been discontinued.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I wish I had a bigger bottle! :-)</li>
            <li> THANKS MOM!</li>
            <li> Overall really pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> I saw results the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> contents are a bit jelly and not watery like most serums, but it actually works somewhat better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> I love this product; this is the second time I ordered it.</li>
            <li> Works very well!</li>
            <li> I would most definitely recommend this to a friend!</li>
            <li> With first use my skin felt softer.  </li>
            <li> it leaves my skin smooth and soft to touch.</li>
            <li> So, as with all things, be sure to do a test before slathering it on because everyone&#x27;s skin is different.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll stick with what is working and pay the higher price</li>
            <li> First time user</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> This did not leave my skin feeling any different or with more moisture than anything else I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> The first time I applied this on my skin</li>
            <li> My first bottle came defective and damaged.  </li>
            <li> I put this serum on first thing in the morning after i wash my face,  Then, at the end of the day, I wash my face and put the serum on again before going to bed.  </li>
            <li> I think with continued use the results will only get better.</li>
            <li> I will order more definitely</li>
            <li> Tried this product for the first time today.</li>
            <li> I would most definitely recommend this to a friend!</li>
            <li> my husband even noticed (unprovoked) and asked if I had snuck off and gotten a face lift because I keep looking younger!!:)  </li>
            <li> really works!</li>
            <li> I will give more feedback later.</li>
            <li> but it seems to be working pretty well.  </li>
            <li> I have used one bottle of this magic stuff and have just ordered my second one.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this product.</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> This product really work!  </li>
            <li> So, in short, I love this product, it has a thickness to it</li>
            <li> They immediately sent a new full bottle (not the blue but that is OK).  </li>
            <li> I ordered 5 of these and thought it would be good because it has a good review,only to find out that it is not as good as the other brand iI tried before, and also I just opened my other bottle yesterday only to find out that its empty!</li>
            <li> Noticed a positive difference right away, and it dries very quickly, enabling you to put a regular moisturizer on right away.</li>
            <li> I go through this little bottle very quickly!!</li>
            <li> and I have super sensitive skin!!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not too heavy but provides a perfect level of moisture for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin glow and feel so soft!!!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing a whole lot right now.</li>
            <li> IT was shipped right away and very well packaged.  </li>
            <li> Really helps diminish fine lines and wrinkles and doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li> But its pretty good quality all you need are a few drops ,it absorbs really fast into your skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried many facial serums and this one in particular is one of my favorites!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hyaluronic Acid helps lock in moisture, and encourages older skin to make new, collagen filled skin cells like we had decades ago.  </li>
            <li> made my face feel so soft and clean</li>
            <li> I have been using it for two weeks and find that this brand is as good as the more expensive brand I was using.</li>
            <li> love this product,  i use it under moisturizer, and think it really does help overall!!</li>
            <li> lol.it does feel good and great make-up base.</li>
            <li> (I am 43 and have used sunscreen religiously on my face since my teens) but I am hoping regular use of a good product like this will prevent excess aging of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Working good but need to be careful with sensitive skin, I had some allergic reaction</li>
            <li> I love this product and for such a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews prior to ordering and because it was on daily deals for a good price I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> Good little product!</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at how quickly this improved my skin.</li>
            <li> It is great,I am completely satisfied and I am not a very young person,so,with this words I can say that it works.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight, no additives, no heavy perfume; leaves skin very fresh.</li>
            <li> Put a drop or two on your finger and quickly apply it in circular motion [message] and WOW!</li>
            <li> I have pretty dry skin, mostly during winter, and this product did help a bit with that, although I would not buy it for this purpose.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t asked to leave a positive review, nor was I paid or otherwise compensated for reviewing this item.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t asked to leave a positive review, nor was I paid or otherwise compensated for reviewing this item.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t hopefully looking for positive results, I had forgotten that I used it.</li>
            <li> Not any positive results that I can see.</li>
            <li> On the positive side, this product reminded me to pause, self-reflect, chuckle, and recalibrate my level of vanity.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my skin from the first use; the serum is very hydrating without adding an oil to my skin.  </li>
            <li> At first I really didn&#x27;t notice a change in my skin.</li>
            <li> Have used product only a short time but so far I&#x27;m happy with the results.</li>
            <li> This product really controls the oil on my face ;)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect this product to help a whole lot - but what a surprise to see that within 14 days my skin absolutely is smoother!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few of the other Hyaluronic Acid skin care products and this one has worked the best for my skin.  </li>
            <li> and I must say that the fast shipping, proper packing, sturdy glass packaging and cute box with gold accents really leave a lot for the eyes to take</li>
            <li> I am not sure I have seen any reversing of the aging process, but my skin looks darn good</li>
            <li> No stickiness, no smell, no bad skin reactions (my skin is awfully sensitive)</li>
            <li> If you want  the youth secret to beautiful skin...</li>
            <li> My skin had less wrinkles, less dryness, and felt great!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see the more long term results!</li>
            <li> It worked okay, but it seemed to dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> This is so easy and it makes a big improvement.  </li>
            <li> I took it easy with the roller (scared of having red face at work tomorrow) and applied this serum before and after.  </li>
            <li> I love how silky it feels and that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin at all.</li>
            <li> This actually shows results very quickly.</li>
            <li> Matter of fact, it&#x27;s made it even more dry than it&#x27;s been before.</li>
            <li> I read reviews of the 180 Cosmetics Pure Swiss serum, and ordered it.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend Pure Swiss</li>
            <li> I have been using Ultima Pure Swiss, for 2 years now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&amp;#34;180&#x27; Cosmetics Pure Swiss Hyaluronic Serum + Vitamin C&amp;#34; is designed to help you reverse the signs aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;180&#x27; Cosmetics Pure Swiss Hyaluronic Serum +</li>
            <li> There is also no indication of what percentage of the liquid is pure Hyaluronic Acid.  </li>
            <li> I like this version (180 Cosmetics Pure Swiss)</li>
            <li> but it certainly did work to erase them.</li>
            <li> I use Ultima Pure Swiss Hyaluronic Acid after using the 1.0 mm derma roller.  </li>
            <li> After using the roller, I use witch hazel as an astringent, then the Ultima Pure Swiss.  </li>
            <li> I purchased 180 Cosmetics Ultima Pure Swiss, Hyaluronic Acid Serum +</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s been using it for a couple of weeks now and is certain that some of her age lines have lessened and skin texture improved.</li>
            <li> 180 Cosmetics Pure Swiss, Hyaluronic Acid Serum + Vitamin C (Ultima) does not appear to work.</li>
            <li> and it certainly does nothing to help with anything.  </li>
            <li> In this case you certainly get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I will certainly reorder.</li>
            <li> B008CEDY5O Ultima Pure Swiss, Hyaluronic Acid Serum with Vitamin C, Anti-Aging, Anti-Wrinkle, Instant-Lift Solution]]</li>
            <li> I wash my face with Avalon Organics face wash, tone with Avalon toner and then put on the Ultima Pure Swiss Hyaluronic Acid  with Vit C.  </li>
            <li> I have just started using Ultima Pure Swiss, and already have noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li> would certainly recommend this to a friend.  </li>
            <li> I ordered ULTIMA PURE SWISS HYALURONIC ACID + VITAMIN C</li>
            <li> I plan on buying the 180 pure swiss hyaluronic with peptides also..</li>
            <li> This is a moisturizer, and while it certainly keeps skin supple all day, it also seems to provide some level of oil control.  </li>
            <li> It is absorbed quickly and leaves the skin tight and smooth.</li>
            <li> The new design with dropper are so much better than that of the blue bottle.  </li>
            <li> It felt good going on but it didn&#x27;t seem to last very long</li>
            <li> I have now used it for a week, and the lines are still just slightly diminished, but even more noticeable is the texture of my skin, which is smoother and \\&quot;dewy\\&quot;, you know, not oily, but just fresh and moist-looking.  </li>
            <li> have been seeing fine lines/crows feet for a couple years and I wanted to find a product that would help slow this process down and after much research I found this Vitamin C Hyaluronic acid to be the most liked and let me tell you</li>
            <li> I have no facial wrinkles but these lines above my mouth, and thought I&#x27;d try 180 Ultima Pure Swiss given their claims \\&quot;This incredible serum will restore your skin&#x27;s elasticity, leaving it looking and feeling rejuvenated, supple, and smooth.\\&quot; Apparently, not if you are 40 or older according to \\&quot;Kate\\&quot; who provided a customer service reply to my email about the lack of any results for me.  </li>
            <li> After using it for just three days, I could definitely see a difference in the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> The fine lines at the outside corner of my eyes and under my eyes just disappear with this serum.  </li>
            <li> Deep ones, and the fine ones...</li>
            <li> I can see a trend here on products that show very high discounts.</li>
            <li> we applied the serum to our faces, we found that when we placed just a few drops, the serum instantly absorbed into our skin and our faces felt very smooth and relaxed.</li>
            <li> not to sure, so far nothing has happened, smooth and tight.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, absorbs nice and you only need a little bit.</li>
            <li> After the first 2 uses, my skin was unbelievably soft!!</li>
            <li> I love this product, only compliant is that the bottle broke when knocked over (not very hard or fast) on countertop in bathroom.  </li>
            <li> Lightly exfoliates skin, not like retinol that can give red and very peely skin.</li>
            <li> Amazing product this is my third bottle and can visually see my skin is tightening around my chin and cheeks,</li>
            <li> I can tell a huge difference in my skin especially after using it with the micro needle roller.</li>
            <li> I would really like to stay with it to see if I can tell a difference</li>
            <li> My box was torn and then to my surprise the dropper was so cheap looking and did not even work properly.  </li>
            <li> When I use this I make sure my skin is wet, then I dip the dropper into the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Used faithfully whole bottle</li>
            <li> and I have to say I really feel a difference.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have any wrinkles, but it does seem to be helping with some discoloration I&#x27;ve been noticing.</li>
            <li> (really)...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see much difference</li>
            <li> I can really feel the product working on my face, neck and hands.</li>
            <li> That absolutely was the case here.</li>
            <li> Really helps pull your skin up on neck and jaw areas as well as around eyes.  </li>
            <li> It is really making a difference in skin texture and shrinking pores.</li>
            <li> Absolutely will continue to use it</li>
            <li> The serum was extremely gentle on my skin and I suffered no breakouts from it.  </li>
            <li> Just expected it to work better.</li>
            <li> One or two drops cover your whole face and neck.</li>
            <li> I do not see much of of difference.</li>
            <li> Evaporated too fast in bottle.</li>
            <li> Makes me question if it has too much H20.</li>
            <li> As for a decrease in wrinkles and lines, haven&#x27;t seen much difference.</li>
            <li> I am probably using too much of this.</li>
            <li> I find hyaluronic acid serum to be an indispensable part of my daily beauty routine.  </li>
            <li> It truly makes a very noticeable difference to my skin, so I will be a lifetime user of HA serum.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my wife and it worked very well for her.  </li>
            <li> Tightens skin a bit immediately after use, but I don&#x27;t see a real difference in wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about a week, but my face feels smooth and moisturized without being oily because I tend to have oily skin.  </li>
            <li> I USED TO MUCH</li>
            <li> Feels really silky on my skin.  </li>
            <li> works, it isn&#x27;t greasy and it really does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t tell the difference....but will keep on during .it</li>
            <li> After much research I decided to try this product.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t really say wrinkles have disappeared</li>
            <li> and you do not need much.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t notice much difference.</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Bought for my mom and she really likes it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much change in my wrinkles on my face.  </li>
            <li> Really like the feel of my skin after using this for 3 weeks now, night and day.</li>
            <li> I really like it a lot.</li>
            <li> I tried a cheaper brand and it didn&#x27;t make my skin as smooth, so I went back to this one.  </li>
            <li> This seems to really work.</li>
            <li> thanks Mom)</li>
            <li> The two work really well together</li>
            <li> This really works and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> I did not pay much for this product, and was warned by another review that &amp;#34;if</li>
            <li> but really, one drop does the trick for your whole face.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect so much difference.</li>
            <li> so this help is appreciated.</li>
            <li> Amazon sells hyaluronic acid at a much lower price per volume;  and</li>
            <li> so I looked for one on Amazon with a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who wants to erase wrinkles from their face..</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t think this is much help.</li>
            <li> I think to really know how well this works would take much longer use than I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> really the amount was so miniscule</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it works very well</li>
            <li> i expected more.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sceptical if this is the real deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So as this was a gift i cant talk to much about the product it self.</li>
            <li> I especially like this brand of serum because free of formaldehyde, parabens, phthalates, petro-chemicals, GMO ingredients, triclosan, fragrance and colors.  </li>
            <li> I especially like this brand of serum because free of formaldehyde, parabens, phthalates, petro-chemicals, GMO ingredients, triclosan, fragrance and colors.  </li>
            <li> + yes to tomatoes, my face clears up fast.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like its smell...</li>
            <li> I really wish I could give this product 5 stars, however, I have been using it faithfully for one month and see no change in my wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I really have not noticed a difference, and am just now finishing up my bottle.  </li>
            <li> I use it morning and night, and it doesn&#x27;t take much at all.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product to speed up the results and it really delivered.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum</li>
            <li> I received it really fast with my derma roller.</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing...</li>
            <li> We spend so much money and all for nothing.  </li>
            <li> Very cheap.&lt;br /&gt;Product</li>
            <li> Can buy quality hyaluronic acid at a much lower price</li>
            <li> I would really recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> Really.  </li>
            <li> I tried moistening my hands/face with water beforehand, but that really didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really see a difference.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care too much for this product.</li>
            <li> I suffer from skin conditions and this product has not only smooth those</li>
            <li> Highly recommend !</li>
            <li> but you don&#x27;t get much for your money.</li>
            <li> It is much softer and firmer.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much at all.</li>
            <li> It really helped to moisturize.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , It was late,but really like it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really like this product...</li>
            <li> I can see a difference on my skin, it appears much brighter and had minimize some of the lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I started using this product the very day I received it.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think this product would prevent them since I didn&#x27;t feel like it did much.</li>
            <li> I really like the texture</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It is very concentrated so with</li>
            <li> This really works well</li>
            <li> I would like to continue with this serum, but it is very expenside.</li>
            <li> , just a couple of drops does my whole face and neck.</li>
            <li> thanks ..</li>
            <li> It does make my face, neck and chest much softer and the lines are fading.  </li>
            <li> I use this product before my night time cream and it keeps my skin very hydrated.</li>
            <li> shipment was fast, and the product did everything it said it would do...</li>
            <li> This product was highly recommended to me to reduce wrinkles!</li>
            <li> I have also changed my rating from 3 stars (because of the rash) to 5 stars because it really does work.</li>
            <li> I really notice a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I really like the feeling when applying to the face.</li>
            <li> Taking care of my skin and overall appearance has always been important to me, and I do not wish to go the route of chemical peels, botox, dermabrasion or mini-lifts.  </li>
            <li> One drop covers my whole face/neck.  </li>
            <li> Product made no difference to our skin even after finishing the whole bottle.  </li>
            <li> Very drying.  </li>
            <li> and I just rubbed it gently on the parts of my face and neck that looked like it needed help.  </li>
            <li> this serum is gentle and I have seen a difference in tone and texture.</li>
            <li> It really does plump the skin - my crow&#x27;s feet,</li>
            <li> Still looking for the product the really softens your wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really bombed about it.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product with the hope of some real improvements in my skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> One has to use this for much longer than the supply lasts to notice if there is an effect.  </li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY nothing happens.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice any difference in my skin after using this product.</li>
            <li> I expected more from a product of this cost.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell the difference using it or not using it.  </li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t take much for an application.  </li>
            <li> As of about the sixth day, I really haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference on my face.  </li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much to happen this soon anyway</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any real benefit</li>
            <li> I will recommend this to every woman this really keeps</li>
            <li> I am gonna get a whole ton of Hyaluronic acid wholesale.  </li>
            <li> Ultima really works.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> I really like this.  </li>
            <li> Fast Delivery .</li>
            <li> After washing my face each morning, I dot the serum around my eyes and mouth area and then gently rub it in to the areas that need work.  </li>
            <li> It works, of course, and I recommend this to anyone who wants to improve their skin (face and neck).</li>
            <li> IT REALLY WORKS.</li>
            <li> I found a product that really does what it claims it will</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really describe it</li>
            <li> Rough skin around rhe top of my ears and on my forehead are rapidly going away.</li>
            <li> it is very &amp;#34;water-like&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any real difference over anything else I use.</li>
            <li> Really hoping for some wrinkle reduction and tightening.i am using it as recommended.</li>
            <li> I used this today and it really perked up my complexion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finished a bottle and didn&#x27;t see much difference.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t really see a change....</li>
            <li> Really like the product.  </li>
            <li> Not really any better than some of the others on the market.</li>
            <li> I am really disapointef.</li>
            <li> Results are better than expected.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t notice the lines a much.  </li>
            <li> i really like it</li>
            <li> I am 27 and really wanted to boost my skins vitality.</li>
            <li> used for few days and so far so good.  </li>
            <li> Nice hydrating product for daily use, especially in the summer time lotion.</li>
            <li> my skin started to get a little dry on the very top layer and lightly peel.</li>
            <li> Really soaks in and other products go on very smooth.  </li>
            <li> I would have been much more likely to purchase this product again and rate it five stars if the bottles I received, were more than only HALF full.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I have been using this product for little more that a month, I can tell that it is very pure (not a lot of &amp;#34;filler&amp;#34; ingredients) and may be helping with the lip area (I also take supplements).</li>
            <li> I am half way through the first and my skin looks better.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptic when I purchased this, but I figured, why not - it&#x27;s worth a shot, and 2 months before my wedding, I was willing to try just about anything within reason - and by &amp;#34;within reason&amp;#34; I meant cheap.</li>
            <li> Well i have tried a few companies hyaluronic acid and this is the best by far, You will notice the first few days</li>
            <li> The product gives your skin a very smooth young look - how did I go so long without this product.</li>
            <li> I makes it feel more hydrated and fine wrinkles seem less obvious, although I am combining this with IPL skin rejuvenation treatment.</li>
            <li> Given the lower price of this serum, I&#x27;m pleased with the results and will try other products.</li>
            <li> I noticed significant improvement after the second time I used it.</li>
            <li> Us women are always looking for that magic cure for the aging process and other than cosmetic surgery creams and potions will not work</li>
            <li> Read my other reviews for a much better choice.</li>
            <li> I have used many of other vitamin C products and i purchased two bottles 180 ultima vitamin C</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the original price was almost 90$ for this tiny bottle!.</li>
            <li> Actually, for the original price ($89.89), I would prefer to buy  Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder.</li>
            <li> I am now back to using the Ole serum and spending $50 per bottle, but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I had read other reviews and hoped I&#x27;d see results like the others, however it was just okay...</li>
            <li> it works as well or better than other pricey C products.</li>
            <li> Will keep on seeking other manufactures for results that may produce more.</li>
            <li> I would reccomend this product to many other people.</li>
            <li> it was just the right amount to get me the free shipping on the other product I was purchasing.</li>
            <li> It seems tacky at first, but distributing it across my face is easy, without tugging my skin like some other viscous products can do.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not sure someone who has had these same issues for many years will have as complete and rapid results as I have, but I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li> I still think this is a great product, but only for people with skin less sensitive than mine.  </li>
            <li> I still think this is a great product, but only for people with skin less sensitive than mine.  </li>
            <li> I just used it and can say the serum absorbed quickly and left my skin feeling so soft.  </li>
            <li> It was the size stated in the ad but did not last as long as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin very soft and is now starting to plump up the fine lines I have (after a month of using)</li>
            <li> Most other similar products are a full ounce.</li>
            <li> I highly recommended to my boyfriend&#x27;s mom and she really like it after applying on her face.</li>
            <li> I havent seen much difference in how my skin looks as of yet, but I have high hopes.</li>
            <li> I was a new user to this product 6 months ago and really didn&#x27;t expect much..</li>
            <li> 180 Ultima Pure Swiss, Hyaluronic Acid Serum is light and leave your skin with a fresh and firm sensation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and have received compliments left and right!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle and trying to go easy, but it makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> I washed my face last night, and let the water on it, dry on its own.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and I use it daily with very satisfactory results.</li>
            <li> This product makes your skin feel terrific and other products glide on easily and smoothly afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this in the past and it was amazing and it had a pleasent smell.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I have quit using it; so hopefully my face will clear before the first of the year.</li>
            <li> I put several dots of this serum on my cheeks, chin, forehead, neck and chest and had to work fast to rub them in because this stuff gets absorbed fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure how this product works on it&#x27;s own the brush</li>
            <li> However, when I ordered it the second time it came 1/3 full, bottle was scratched and leaking.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used the full bottle yet since I also ordered another serum the same time I bought this.  </li>
            <li> wokring pretty well so far</li>
            <li> Was only 1/4 full when I opened bottle</li>
            <li> I clean my face every morning with an astringent/salicylic acid cleanser for sensitive skin (like Clean &amp; Clear or Sea Breeze), then when my face is completely dry from that, I apply the serum.  </li>
            <li> I just started using the second bottle and so far I can see an improvement, seems to diminish the fine lines.</li>
            <li> When I apply it to may face, it feels nice and silky and moisturizing compared to other serums that make my face feel very dry after being absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend and will be buying this product as long as the makers keep it available.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, smooth, dries fast, not greasy, a little covers the entire face.</li>
            <li> and it really tightens my face and promotes new cell growth.</li>
            <li> does not begin to live up to description...does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.  </li>
            <li> less visible, but I will order one more, bcause siendo</li>
            <li> This product goes on smooth - no clumpiness on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I am not sure whether or not this product has actually improved the appearance of my fine lines and wrinkles--but I do know my skin looks and feels more hydrated.  </li>
            <li> I have used more than half of the product and did not see any differences.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the product; you truly need to use only two drops for your entire face.  </li>
            <li> The highest quality of Swiss Hyaluronic acid serum, complemented by natural ingredients and enriched with vitamin C,  brings the elasticity back to your skin, making it look and feel youthful and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this product in the short time I have been using it, I am noticing a big difference..</li>
            <li> few more weeks to notice any real improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be for advertisement mainly but not for practical results.</li>
            <li> Any help you can give me in this matter would be greatly appreciated, I would definitely be a customer worth keeping along with my connections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When the product arrived, the package says that the MAIN INGREDIENT IS WATER.</li>
            <li> This particular brand also includes Vit. C</li>
            <li> I just turned 27 and thought I should take some extra measures to keep my skin looking healthy, but I didn&#x27;t expect this big of a difference.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product mainly to get rid of age spots.</li>
            <li> Even if they valued their product enough to safely bottle and package it, the minuscule amount of product you&#x27;ll receive only makes you feel &amp;#34; taken&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This magical Hyaluronic Acid and Vitamin C, according to my dermatologist who is cash only and charges an exorbitant amount of money per visit, are the only two chemicals he&#x27;d recommend to people.</li>
            <li> I dont know if the product itself is a hoax, or if I got a duplicate item from the particular seller.</li>
            <li> However I&#x27;m 68 years and am realistic.</li>
            <li> anything I look older and</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for younger and more hydrated skin, I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> It is the only moisturizer I use at night, and my skin feels smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Try mixing with a few drops of almond or even avocado oil for more intense moisture, which works like a charm in winter months.</li>
            <li> It glided on my skin smoothly, was cool to the touch, and there was no overwhelming scent or stinging.</li>
            <li> After only a week I can notice a tremendous difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I prefer a mild micro-cleanser to open pores for maximum absorption.</li>
            <li> Still too early to know of definitive or lasting results, but it feels light and non-greasy</li>
            <li> The smell is not at all pleasant and the texture is thin.</li>
            <li> Just goes to show you more expensive does not mean better.</li>
            <li> and I clearly see positive results.</li>
            <li> So far, I have seen no visible positive results in my skin.</li>
            <li> but perhaps over a considerably longer period of time I would see positive results and provide for updates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the bottle, and I pour my other serum from Cosmedica Skincare into the now empty container, because I like the color of the bottle, but let me say here that although I liked this Pure Swiss serum, it&#x27;s way more expensive then the Cosmedica brand, so that I will not be buying it any to soon, unless Ultima Pure Swiss lower its price;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see the long term results of using this product.</li>
            <li> Reading reviews, I had high hopes.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> High quality.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I highly recommended..</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this serum.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend the 180 serum.  </li>
            <li> and I have high hopes it will work on my under eye wrinkles....</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> So I would highly recommend this product for its soothing benefits.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Seller highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, I am lazy.  </li>
            <li> I can already tell that my skin is a little more toned too.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s helping, but as with most facial products I&#x27;m not sure if the effects are significant</li>
            <li> will give product a little more time</li>
            <li> I have little puffy spots at each end of my mouth and this serum makes them appear more evened out--less puffy.</li>
            <li> I am using it for a little more then a week</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just old!!</li>
            <li> I was so happy and skeptical to find this particular item being sold for $20.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll see that I work hard to give an honest opinion of the products I review.ed me about a month.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll see that I work hard to give an honest opinion of the products I review.</li>
            <li> It last a very long time and allows makeup to be applied very smoothly.</li>
            <li> but I really like it so far.  </li>
            <li> but I can say that my skin definitely looks clear, hydrated, soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> So far I believe this product really works.</li>
            <li> So far I really like it.</li>
            <li> Goes on wet but soaks in within a minute or so leaving your skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li> This really made my skin baby soft, and rejuvenated the dullness of my skin tone...</li>
            <li> really makes your skin soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for nearly a year straight, morning and night.  </li>
            <li> My 15 year old son, bless his heart, says, &#x27;Mom, you really don&#x27;t look as old as you really are, even my friends think you&#x27;re my sister.&#x27;</li>
            <li> So far I really like this serum.</li>
            <li> - all of this info about the clear bottle and how long it will take is  all credible- through Dr Oz</li>
            <li> I am 54, and never have done a facial regiment, which I think it&#x27;s in my best interest to do, but with sensitive skin, it&#x27;s scarey</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t noticed a real difference in lines/wrinkles</li>
            <li> I could really see a big difference the first time.</li>
            <li> Pleased with this product although I have been using it a few weeks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a couple weeks - seems and feels like it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job, and the price and fast shipping are a real plus!</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to use a moisturizer over it (after it has dried).</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t know the advantage of using it for a few more weeks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it helped with my deep wrinkles, but I feel like it is a good serum to use before moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to give it a few more days &amp; will start using the 180 on my face again.</li>
            <li> Just after a few application my skin started looking so much better and fresher.</li>
            <li> After a week, the fine lines are less noticeable and my skin texture is much improved.</li>
            <li> Doubted that this would be the same, but is as good if not better.  </li>
            <li> It goes on like an oil which I like, but within minutes it&#x27;s absorbed yet my skin doesn&#x27;t feel or look any different.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget to apply your normal moisturizer cream for the day or night and this amplifies the effect.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Will report more in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this under my normal moisturizer</li>
            <li> I have not used it long enough to see anyvisible changes to my skin, but I love how it</li>
            <li> Pretty good product, noticed some difference in lines in my face, but expensive for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> I will order again if price remains the same; pretty fast delivery as well.</li>
            <li> Not sure how to rate it overall, but the ingredients are good for my skin.</li>
            <li> Definitely a snake oil worth the price and inflated confidence.</li>
            <li> And in the end my skin just has a far less blotchy appearance with a more even tone and firmer feel around the eyes.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for cosmetic professional results go to to plastic surgeon, if you want more moisture and less noticeable wrinkles try this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an &#x27;impulse package&#x27; shopper, which means, if it looks unique or cute (good grief!)</li>
            <li> Did not do anything, like putting plain water on your face, store bought products work better than this.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t open it right away after I bought it</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product so far!</li>
            <li> I am relieved that I did not pay so much for this product that I would bother to send it back for a refund, but this experience has lowered my confidence in positive customer reviews at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Lines in forehead are becoming less pronounced I think.  </li>
            <li> Actually this product does a much better job than many more expensive products hands down.</li>
            <li> My neck was showing the most age and now it is tight and I am 57 years old.  </li>
            <li> very nice product, but too expensive.</li>
            <li> After reading so many five-star reviews, I started out with high hopes, but for me, this product does the opposite of what I expected from those majority reviews and the description advertised.  </li>
            <li> Have only use the product (180 Ultima Pure Swiss Hyaluronic Acid Serum with Vit.C,Anti-Aging) for one week twice a day as directed,&lt;br /&gt;have not notice any real improvement yet..</li>
            <li> havent been using long enough to make a reccomendation yet, but so far seems ok</li>
            <li> I see a little improvement, the liquid glides on smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily apprearance, it soaks into my poors really quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle of this and so far I really like it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always searching for new products to fight aging.  </li>
            <li> I contacted the seller and they immediately sent a new one, no questions asked.</li>
            <li> Since i live in FL and im 61..</li>
            <li> /&gt;It claimed to be new, however the seller did not state what their version of new was.</li>
            <li> I like the product but in two weeks I will have to be buying a new one</li>
            <li> Bottle scratched, no signs of being a new product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this serum , looking to try something new, and I been using it for a week I start to notice that my skin looks brighter</li>
            <li> I am always trying new serums and moisturizers.</li>
            <li> They reached out to me, sent me a new one promptly no questions</li>
            <li> This one is relatively new to me</li>
            <li> Morning and night, I smooth the Serum on my face, neck, upper chest and the back of my hands.  </li>
            <li> I have been using for few weeks and feel my face more soft and moisture,  </li>
            <li> and I strongly encourage all women (you&#x27;re never too young to start) to make this a daily part of your skin&#x27;s overall health.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product one time, so I really don&#x27;t have much to type</li>
            <li> I like this product , after using it for 2 weeks I can see a difference, but I still would like to use for a few more weeks, before giving a complete opinion...</li>
            <li> However really need to get through my second jar to really see if the results are what I expect.</li>
            <li> Does not make my skin feel soft or vibrant.</li>
            <li> the price is reasonable and it makes my face looks so soft until so soft</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, get reactions from almost everything, but this product corrected my wrinkles, and skin texture.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feeling very soft at touch; it takes just a couple of drops and it spreads all over face.</li>
            <li> The serum is very absorbing, after a short massage, there is no trace of it on my face.</li>
            <li> , that is very sensitive, and prone to hormonal breakouts.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very sensitive to chemicals .</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It made my face feel very soft.</li>
            <li> I use it in the mornings and evenings after D&#x27;arsonval High frequency direct for Home Use.</li>
            <li> They are all very expensive, but I found very good for my skin.</li>
            <li> The product seemed to be nice,but even using a few drops at a time - The first of two, half filled bottles did not last long enough to give a happy review.</li>
            <li> I get better results from using plain, old aloe vera gel.  </li>
            <li> Feels oily when you put it on, but it sinks right in!</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I am going to purchase more yet.</li>
            <li> It is extremely wallet friendly when you consider what itdoes for your skin.</li>
            <li> One thing I can confirm though, it does get absorbed extremely fast, as per the other reviews.</li>
            <li> am not sure which one worked, but I feel that my skin became more springy.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I was hoping for some noticeable tightening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, suggestions on which product to use first and whether or not to alternate or one in am, pm...and so on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the bottle was much to small more like a sampler than a purchase</li>
            <li> I like my usual Vitamin C serum from Irene Gari better.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of much more expensive products out there, but this serum actually works better than any I tried.  </li>
            <li> My skin was too sensitive for this!  </li>
            <li> My skin is smoother and fine lines are less.</li>
            <li> it is a small bottle though, wish there was more.</li>
            <li> It made me break out, and I do not have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> They state that the first ingredient is hyaluronic acid, with water somewhere in the middle.  </li>
            <li> I could be paying for a small bottle of mostly water.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it to all interested friends.</li>
            <li> It is smoother, softer, Less fine lines.</li>
            <li> I will be re-ordering soon as the price is pretty low.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> first thing I noticed about this serum that was different was the texture of it.  </li>
            <li> This serum makes my skin feel so soft and seems to fill in any wrinkles!</li>
            <li> My face was still red for one day, the second it was ok, but I decided not to use the product again until a week later.</li>
            <li> This is the first product I used that actually delivers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it about 6 months now and the fine lines at the sides of my eyes are less visible.</li>
            <li> It really gets rid of all the dead skin that the RetinA leaves and makes my skin feeling smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> The change to my skin has been a healthy one it is firm and the consistency feels strengthened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just reordered in August!</li>
            <li> I would have to get another 2-3 drops for my forehead, and another 2-3 drops for my lower face/neck, all the while wondering how much my of this precious liquid was merely being absorbed by my hands.</li>
            <li> My wife wants me to order more bottles in the next few months.</li>
            <li> The bottle is tiny, I might be able to spread it out very carefully and get 10 days of use out of it.</li>
            <li> The Ultima goes on nicely and absorbs well, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My 56 year old husband wanted to try something new for his skin.</li>
            <li> I have not used it long enough to see a huge improvement</li>
            <li> The serum doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s absorbed into my skin and makes it feel really dry.  </li>
            <li> just so easy all u do is add a few drops</li>
            <li> Then I wipe it on my fingers and quickly rub it all over my still wet face.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually wear makeup, but since this dries completely and is colorless, you can wear makeup on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> I like it but was surprised what a small bottle it comes in so will probably order more.</li>
            <li> The box was a little beat up within the shipping package, but the product inside was fine.</li>
            <li> The company contacted me and ask me to submit only positive reviews about this product.  </li>
            <li> I used with a positive charge ion roller to ensure it went deep into the skin.</li>
            <li> Even the dark spots at the corners of my mouth lightened up significantly.</li>
            <li> on dry winter days as we are having now I put a light moisturizer on my entire face.  </li>
            <li> It is too soon to give a longer term results, and most people do not come back after using a product for very long to give you actual results....</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would recommend the Ultimate Pure Swiss brand.</li>
            <li> I will definitely switch to the pure hyaluronic acid that I used before.</li>
            <li> Younger, firmer, and new!!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a little pricey not to be able to get every last drop.</li>
            <li> I was only able to use it for a little over a week</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to rate a product like this until you have used it for about 30 days or more.  </li>
            <li> and it seems to work much better and not get hard.</li>
            <li> So far I really like it, but only time will tell.</li>
            <li> Once it dried, however, my skin felt \\&quot;tight\\&quot; rather than soft or smooth.  </li>
            <li> Only been using the product one week, but I really like the product so far.</li>
            <li> No, I still look middle aged and have light crows feet.  </li>
            <li> clear</li>
            <li> Goes on clear and it is somewhat like a gel.</li>
            <li> I really like that the bottle is colored glass because vitamin c loses its effectiveness when exposed to light.</li>
            <li> After purchasing this I read that vitamin C is not stable in a clear container.</li>
            <li> This is the second product I have tried by 180 Cosmetics and I am once again very happy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin beware.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> skin remains soft with fewer wrinkles than my contemporaries.</li>
            <li> I am 67 years old and hoping I do get some results from it.</li>
            <li> like this ultima hyaluronic acid, it keep my skin soft, and help me to moisturize my sking.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for nearly 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never know, but my kids think I&#x27;m old.  </li>

            <li> I have spent hundreds of dollars on serum&#x27;s and find this works better than the most expensive ones I have purchased.</li>
            <li> When I used it on my face and around my eyes my skin felt so soft.</li>
            <li> had to stop using this because I developed skin sensitivity and a rash on my eyelids.  </li>
            <li> : I had to stop using this because I developed skin sensitivity and a rash on my eyelids.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind my natural life-lines but</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think there is a cream or lotion what could bring my youth back, but when I heard about hyalironic acid, I decided to try and got hooked.</li>
            <li> I completely forgot I put it on</li>
            <li> and I like the way it makes the skin on my face and neck feel soft.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that it lightened age spots on my face.</li>
            <li> I have not used it enough to tell anything miraculous about my skin really.</li>
            <li> Leave my skin feeling pampered and ready for my daily cream.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still early</li>
            <li> SO FAR I LIKE IT.</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> seems to help, and leaves skin feeling soft and silky....</li>
            <li> I just started using this, it is too early to tell the effects.</li>
            <li> It absorbs completely without a greasy feel.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels soft already</li>
            <li> I have not seen much improvement over the last month of using the serum to lighten acne discoloration.</li>
            <li> It appears that the product is very volatile and it has simply evaporated.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You will be soooo surprised....</li>
            <li> but your product is by far</li>
            <li> So far I like it.  </li>
            <li> I am a 49 year old mom.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so far it didn&#x27;t cause any irritation.</li>
            <li> So far I like this product.</li>
            <li> I am a mature woman,  but no wrinkles,  I think this serum help a lot</li>
            <li> I makes my skin feel so soft.  </li>
            <li> far seems to work-</li>
            <li> It goes directly into the skin.</li>
            <li> My old skin soaks up this stuff.  </li>
            <li> The serum does not cause any skin redness or breakouts and seems to give my face a delicate healthy glow (after using for two weeks).  </li>
            <li> It really renews your skin and is simply applied.</li>
            <li> I like the sensation in my skin, so soft.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does plump up those deep lines !</li>
            <li> However, it is too early to determine if all evidence of pimples, etc. will be done away with using this product skin is clear when there was no acne visible.</li>
            <li> I am a 42 year old mom.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There are two reasons I did not give 5 stars:  One, the whole \\&quot;Instant Lift\\&quot; thing is a joke.  </li>
            <li> and I really like the way my face looks the following day.</li>
            <li> But darn near close to it</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it does not cause any issues for me.</li>
            <li> and wow they&#x27;re almost gone</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive sense of smell and this product did not affect me.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne, but when I&#x27;m on Hyaluronic Acid serums the acne is always somewhat controlled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband is very anti-beauty products, but he WILL put this on himself, especially on scars.</li>
            <li> I will have to do another review, but I like it so far.</li>
            <li> I really liked the 1st bottle, &amp; would still recommend at least trying this product yourself, maybe I just have extra sensitive</li>
            <li> I use it directly after cleansing my skin with either Cerave or Cetaphil.  </li>
            <li> Skin is soft, pores reduced, wrinkles...eh?  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin,  this product is for you.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li> I am 37 years old and people think i am still 29-30 tops..</li>
            <li> It penetrates completely within seconds</li>
            <li> and so far I do not see any difference to my 56 year old face.</li>
            <li> but so far, appears to be helping.  </li>
            <li> I have rosacea &amp; nearly 50 year old sun abused skin.</li>
            <li> I like it so far.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth and firm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African-American and 34 years old</li>
            <li> I mix it with my regular cream to ensure it wont burn so much.</li>
            <li> I am 23 years old</li>
            <li> It automatically tighten my skin while still looking natural.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the seller for offering it at such a savings</li>
            <li> it makes my skin soft and tightens the skin.</li>
            <li> In the one month I have seen marked improved in my skin.</li>
            <li> Not heavy, not greasy.</li>
            <li> I had never used this product before but was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 48 years old and at my age I need this since my body does not produce this in my skin anymore.</li>
            <li> I have 70 year old skin</li>
            <li> and I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> it is still early to qualify it.</li>
            <li> This serum leaves skin feeling incredibly soft, shrinks the appearance of pores.  </li>
            <li> Too early to tell.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping it would add moisture and make my skin feel soft again.</li>
            <li> and wow what a difference.</li>
            <li> I rubbed this serum on my lips one time and it completely took care of the cracking and peeling in one day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It makes my skin soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> It really helps your skin to look younger.</li>
            <li> This is a moisturizer, and make skins soft.</li>
            <li> but I do see results, more later after I see how it goes over a period of a few months.</li>
            <li> returned because cost wise compare with others too expensive for 05oz</li>
            <li> When my face became more dry, rough, and leathery--more wrinkly!--than ever before, I decided I should stop, as I feared the apparent damage might become permanent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The purchase was made because of recent articles in medical journals assuring us that a good, penetrating vitamin c serum and hyaluronic acid are the active ingredients even in the most expensive products.</li>
            <li> It feels luxurious going on and sinks in right away, leaving my skin feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> Reading the evaluations I read from other customers I expected better.</li>
            <li> Bottle was half full when I got it.</li>
            <li> but the bottle was half full.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It arrived half full.</li>
            <li> ; it&#x27;s only been a few weeks, however if this makes sense I would give it 5 stars for clearing up most of the dry flakes I had, as far as removing &amp;#34;fine lines&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t see a difference yet, however if I get another reminder to update this product I will certainly do so</li>
            <li> I had used Hyaluronic Acid Serum in the past and this 180 Ultima Pure Swill is a better price</li>
            <li> andI generally have very sensitive skin, almost anything I apply on it irritates it.</li>
            <li> It took a few weeks longer to see a significant reduction in the crepe like skin under my eyes to go away.</li>
            <li> I love the product, was somewhat disappointed when I received it as the product had leaked through the top, around the soft part of the applicator.</li>
            <li> Bottle is very small, I should have paid more attention to the size</li>
            <li> Apparently, you&#x27;re only supposed to leave reviews on Amazon.com for this particular company when they have a 5 star rating!</li>
            <li> Now, full disclosure, I&#x27;m young and all my skin problems are due to way too much time spent sunbathing and partying in the sun on South Beach.</li>
            <li> This is one little way that I can make myself feel like I am doing some special just for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This really seems to help keep the moisture in my face and keep it from getting dry in the harsh winter weather - also helps keep my skin feeling smooth throughout the year.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is possible that the product was also frozen or mishandled in some other manner, as the serums have a grainy quality that I doubt is a part of the original design.</li>
            <li> I do not necessarily want to pay $85 for the small bottle, which is MRSP, but for about $20, I think it is fabulous!</li>
            <li> I rate it 4 star, because it&#x27;s smaller than I thought, and I feel it not nourishing enough because of quick dryness shortly after using it.</li>
            <li> I am at the last drops of my first bottle, and have already received the second bottle of this product.  </li>
            <li> The price was right compared to other products on the market.  </li>
            <li> This product certainly doesn&#x27;t harm my skin, but there are no real positive signs of my skin improving thus far.</li>
            <li> Then it was super easy to knock over because it is a small, narrow glass bottle.</li>
            <li> My skin stays smooth all day and even on dry, windy days it doesn&#x27;t get those rough patches I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> It takes only a few drops and spreads easily over my face.</li>
            <li> It is a thick gel-like serum that penetrates into the skin quickly and absolutely</li>
            <li> honestly can&#x27;t tell the difference from previous purchases of same product by other manufacturers.  </li>
            <li> My doctor recommended me NOT to use active serums right after microneedling since it can cause nodules under the skin.</li>
            <li> i could barely see my pores AND my skin is soooo soft.</li>
            <li> I do like this serum, but it only came a 1/2 filled not full bottle</li>
            <li> Pretty inexpensive, but the quantity wasn&#x27;t as expected.  </li>
            <li> Once applied, the serum dried quickly and my skin actually felt refreshed and somewhat firmer, particularly in the chin area.</li>
            <li> texture is a soft gel, that goes on very smoothly, and you only need a very small amount.</li>
            <li> I suppose it worked a little better than using no serum at all but not what I expected, thus the 2 star review.</li>
            <li> I use many other products so hard to say which ones are really doing the work.</li>
            <li> Results are immediate, &amp;#34;crows feet&amp;#34; virtually disappear and skin looks fresh, clean and tight (not dry and tight).  </li>
            <li> but I informed the seller and a new one was sent promptly back.</li>
            <li> There are so many products out there that is so hard to decide!</li>
            <li> it dry my skyn too much.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product long enough to rate higher than 4 stars.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product I&#x27;ve only been using it for a short time and</li>
            <li> It is a clear, thick liquid that spreads smoothly and soothes my skin.  </li>
            <li> This has really helped the skin around my eyes to look firmer and younger, plus its effects last all day.</li>
            <li> when i first recieved this item i was dissapointed, the seal was broken, and it wasnt a full bottle.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive, but I didn&#x27;t notice any rashes recently.</li>
            <li> I thought the new bottle was supposed to be OPAQUE BLUE., clear bottles are considered garbage they won&#x27;t work because if any natural light touches the serum it ruins the active ingredients.</li>
            <li> Since only a few drops are needed, the 15 ml solution goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Because of the special formula of Pure Swiss serum</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Hyaluronic acid formulas before, this one had a lot of hype, and a pretty bottle.</li>
            <li> Takes a little time, but time it what got me here in the first place!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I have seen any major changes as yet, but will keep using.  </li>
            <li> Please try this if for no other reason than the price.</li>
            <li> though -and this is something I never expected - is that it removed a wart I had within two uses!</li>
            <li> I used this product consistently for 2-3 weeks along with my other skin care regimen (face wash, toner, moisturizer) and didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
            <li> you have similar dry sensitive skin, you might want to think twice before using this, or at least be prepared for a red face, some tingling, and to use a good moisturizer afterwards or mixed in.</li>
            <li> Products with Vitamin C and hyaluronic acid and other anti-aging ingredients are always expensive, so this is a great value at the reduced price from expederm on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It helps retain moisture and &amp;#34;plump&amp;#34; fine lines around mouth, eyes and delicate areas.</li>
            <li> Did not make any difference to my skin, just noticed a slight brightness in the first time of application after that my skin got back to normal condition.</li>
            <li> I am a 45-year old pre-menopausal woman, with several fine wrinkles, a few deeper wrinkles, several dark spots, uneven skin tone, and most noticeably, quite a lot of sagging and loss of firmness.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin so lines and wrinkles seem to be creeping up on me fast.</li>
            <li> I have not had my order long enough to make a comment, other than it is smooth and tightens my skin.  </li>
            <li> I do however have expression lines across my forehead and 2 small fine lines between my eyebrows, but when I use this religiously I don&#x27;t even notice them, with or without makeup!</li>
            <li> have received compliments on the condition of my skin, and feel I am seeing steady improvement in decreasing tiny facial wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I have used other more expensive versions and I find this to be just as good if not better!</li>
            <li> Love the product but bottle is too small, i would be willing to pay a little extra for a bigger bottle</li>
            <li> I do not know if this was a over sight during packaging or general practice.</li>
            <li> Generally they say after 4 to 6 weeks you see the difference.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use it alone, generally underneath a moisturizer or cream.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve only been using it for 7 days and can clearly see a difference.</li>
            <li> However, I wish it was not in a glass bottle as I have dropped and broken the bottle a couple of times and wasted this amazing product!</li>
            <li> There is no heavy, sticky or oily feeling left on my face after I apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since using it my face feels silky soft and is starting to Brighten my complexion.  </li>
            <li> The only difference between the two brands as far as ingredients, is the Vitamin C, so I assume that it what my skin is reacting to.  </li>
            <li> The only difference between the two brands as far as ingredients, is the Vitamin C, so I assume that it what my skin is reacting to.  </li>
            <li> My skin is soft with fewer wrinkles, and my pores are much smaller.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural made with essential oils.</li>
            <li> and you apparently don&#x27;t have a number for anyone to address questions, which I find is a bit disconcerting.  </li>
            <li> Apparently you&#x27;re supposed to use this after using the microdermabrasion roller on your skin.</li>
            <li> I thought the product has spilled, but there were no wet spots in my bag.</li>
            <li> With no regrets.</li>
            <li> That box too was not fully taped and barely close on one side..</li>
            <li> I am 64 years old and have tried lots of products to help to keep my skin looking younger.</li>
            <li> I noticed that if I did not use it for about three days that my old skin appearance was back.</li>
            <li> The alcohol in this made my skin red and sensitive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to complete the vial to see if it works &amp;#34;over time&amp;#34;, but my initial recommendation is try something</li>
            <li> smaller pores especially on the nose and face is more moisturized with lesser visible lines and wrinkles for small price</li>
            <li> I thought wow must be the same  </li>
            <li> Glad I only spent a few bucks for this product.</li>
            <li> Of course it didn&#x27;t help that when I was a lot younger, I completely ignored sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Just received it last week so far I like the way it feels on my face.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, when I went back to using Curel Ultra Healing lotion, my skin smoothness and softness was immediately restored to pre-180 Serum state, and I did not have to waste time with some application ritual nor go through the process and expense of reordering a tiny bottle of serum every couple of months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m somewhat confused with this product as it didn&#x27;t come with much on the how to&#x27;s and what to expect from it, which is pretty much normal for any skin care product.</li>
            <li> True, the bottle is quite small for what you get...</li>
            <li> This left my skin feeling super soft, and in a little under two weeks I am already seeing a noticeable difference in lines and clarity!</li>
            <li> It not only fills the thin lines, but helped tremendously on the deep ones in the forehead and laugh lines.</li>
            <li> I received one bottle full and another bottle only has a half left.</li>
            <li> This works really well, particularly when used with one of those little sip key roller things.</li>
            <li> It is thicker than other 100% pure hyaluronic acid products have been….I</li>
            <li> so I can share with other amazon customers and the 180 Cosmetics Pure Swiss Hyaluronic Acid</li>
            <li> product was not sealed when i twisted the whole thing came off easy</li>
            <li> Feels good on face, but the bottle is a little small, didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> It worked wonders to soothe and make the skin fill less hot and inflamed.  </li>
            <li> When the first item arrived it was a malfunctioned bottle like someone used it with half of the liquid inside.</li>
            <li> thanks to the seller.good quality.it&#x27;s a little dry skin, but it helps to moisturize:)I want a large volume.....</li>
            <li> Will try to update later after I&#x27;ve used it long enough to really tell if it&#x27;s doing all I hoped it could...</li>
            <li> I can really provide any review, other than to state that I will not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to think of other things that I am doing to change the appearance of my skin but nothing else would cause this much of a difference.</li>
            <li> it really does do what people say on the other reviews.</li>
            <li> 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing exciting, not good, not bad, but certainly not worth recommending.</li>
            <li> Was expecting more dramatic results.</li>
            <li> I have seen a marked difference, especially on the back of my hands.  </li>
            <li> Will go back to one of those when ready to purchase again, which looks like it will be soon as this bottle is almost empty.</li>
            <li> Tried more expensive products that did not work near as well as this product.&lt;br /&gt;Take</li>
            <li> This serum is not cheap and I looked fantastic until the bottle was empty.  </li>
            <li> This serum goes a long way and it should be considered a base pre-moisturizer which you will then apply your normal moisturizer on top of which will make this stuff last longer as it isn&#x27;t cheap</li>
            <li> that smelled a little funny</li>
            <li> I had a facial with the esthetician I&#x27;ve been working with for at least the last decade this past weekend, and she asked what I changed in my skin routine because my skin has never looked as good as does as a result of the serum.  </li>
            <li> The wanted me to address any problems with them directly instead of posting negative feedback; however, consumers has the right to know how the product performs.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thicker than the previous one I was using, not sure it works any better.  </li>
            <li> I have received this product twice,  first time one of them was almost empty!!!</li>
            <li> Cant get enough of it especially in the dry climate I live in!</li>
            <li> Great disappointment!</li>
            <li> Seems to make a big difference in my skin breakouts and the texture of my skin in general.  </li>
            <li> I rated it against other similar products that I have and really read the ingredients.</li>
            <li> Amazon refunded me for the total cost, which I appreciated as it was virtually empty, but the tiny bit I used has prompted hope!  </li>
            <li> but I can only barely tell where it was to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> I gave this a four star rating as I have not been using it that long although I like it very much so far.  </li>
            <li> See the difference with first time use.&lt;br /&gt;Its not greasy or heavy</li>
            <li> Disappointed as the bottle was at most only 3/4 full.  </li>
            <li> The next thing I noticed was that after a few days of use, the fine lines were actually harder to see!  </li>
            <li> As we age, our body produces less and less of this important acid, thus affecting how moisture is stored in our skin.</li>
            <li> I usually order a different brand that costs less for more product, but in like that</li>
            <li> i have had other HA serums and this one is not any better than other that cost much less.</li>
            <li> Having dry skin and wearing foundation isn&#x27;t a pretty combo, the dryness is extremely noticeable and often looks scaly.</li>
            <li> Sort of tacky getting an empty bottle in a new order.</li>
            <li> , I highly recommend this product for anti aging amongst other over priced items.</li>
            <li> I get dry skin on my face frequently</li>
            <li> I have used hyaluronic acid previously and really believe in it&#x27;s ability to help hold moisture in the skin.  </li>
            <li> Been using this product for two weeks and don&#x27;t really see any changes as promised regarding increased firmness or less wrinkles.</li>
            <li> The bottle was small, be it does not take much to put on your face, it goes far....</li>
            <li> However, after it sinks into the skin, I&#x27;m back to normal.</li>
            <li> It is extremely thick as it comes out but absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that my skin is becoming very dry in some places</li>
            <li> Before I started using this serum my forehead, eyebrows and eye areas were very flaky, since I have been using this item I have little to no dry skin.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s working a little on a very old face.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s just NOT true and is very misleading.  </li>
            <li> Granted I have only had this for a couple of weeks, and I am just now 40 and starting to notice some sagging around my eyes due to high cheek bones.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Twice a day I apply a few drops of this 180 Cosmetics serum to my freshly washed face, neck and upper chest, and let it absorb and dry.  </li>
            <li> I actually needed more than 2-3 drops to really get all over my face AND the dropper only goes about 1/3 down into the bottle: while this may allow for extra product room, its really difficult to tilt the bottle and see if the dropper is picking stuff up.</li>
            <li> 2 drops seemed too little, 3 too much.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference good or bad , I used it as indicated but not results</li>
            <li> I have no idea if it was good or bad since I couldn&#x27;t try it.  </li>
            <li> I did notice an instant small amount of &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; because my fine line were instantly less pronounced.</li>
            <li> The cost is very reasonable and it works better than other very expensive products.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida and had a bunch of dark spots on my face.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find this any better or worse than other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I love the consistency but the bottle is very thin and I ran out within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t go out in the sun, due to photo sensitive medication.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately Hyaluronic Acid is the only thing that helps wrinkles,as they say in my country, good things come in small packages,I bought 48 hours ago and my face looks radiant.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see any difference between this and the other hyaluronic acid I&#x27;ve bought from other manufacturers which cost a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this product long enough to see benefits of &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; claim; however, this serum definitely makes my skin feel softer (which can&#x27;t hurt!).</li>
            <li> Does not last long especially since it recommends you use it two times a day..</li>
            <li> I  had hoped that this product would tighten up the skin under my eyes, but it doesn&#x27;t last long enough to matter.</li>
            <li> I use this serum in the morning and night and my skin feels very soft and wrinkles are much less visible.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time believing that all the stellar reviews for this product are legitimate.</li>
            <li> Although I would recommend purchasing a larger bottle because it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> serum may be quite effective over extended use, but for me, if I give it another go, I will probably look for a less expensive HA-Vit C product.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products and spent so much with bad to no results.  </li>
            <li> So far this product is not worth sending for.  </li>
            <li> It is very inexpensive for a small bottle.</li>
            <li> No expensive creams needed, at least not for me.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if i see much change in my skin as of yet</li>
            <li> And ,now, I am not sure, if this is a real product in that box.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure which of the two ingredients, Vita-C or Hyaluronic Acid, is responsible for clearing acne, but it does help with that.</li>
            <li> bottle is small , used so fast ,just so so.</li>
            <li> This product works instantly and the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using the product long enough to tell if it is making a difference in the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used product enough to see long term effects.  </li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used long enough for results.</li>
            <li> And no, I did not use the scraper thing long enough to do this.  </li>
            <li> for 15ml bottle, I don&#x27;t know how long it will last.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t use it long enough to see results.</li>
            <li> I do not think I have been using it long enough to see any results.</li>
            <li> I had a few blemishes come and go, (normal for me).</li>
            <li> Previously I complained that I had received a bottle of the 180 Pure Swiss Hyaluronic Acid that was obviously a returned item.</li>
            <li> and it actually made my face very dry, red, and blotchy.  </li>
            <li> As far as I am concern is not real authentic stuff.</li>
            <li> It only made my skin dry.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for less than a week so far</li>
            <li> Made my skin dry as hell, I thought it was supposed to do the opposite.</li>
            <li> The bottle is about half used and I haven&#x27;t found any difference, but I fill I am just to old.</li>
            <li> This product made my skin dry and made it peel even though I used a regular moisturizer afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Next I had a few brown sun spots on my cheek that completely disappeared.</li>
            <li> Of course no real noticeable or lasting results with only one use</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about two weeks and not one single change that I or anyone else can see but only time will tell.</li>
            <li> Pretty hard to do because I have really dry skin.</li>
            <li> Had dark bags under eyes ever since I can remember, finally decided to do something about it and try some different options, this was the second item I tried</li>
            <li> so I stopped using both products &amp; went back to plain old Oil of Olay.</li>
            <li> I feel it is helping in the firming of my skin as I am in the  50&#x27;s and starting to loose firmness.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try this Swiss brand because it was a little less expensive and had good reviews.</li>
            <li> my skin feels tight and I can see its helping my face look alive and have been getting lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> You only need a few drops daily, so I currently use that to justify the extra</li>
            <li> The bottle only contains .5 ounces, I can get 2 ounces of this stuff for the same price, there was no difference in this and the other formulas I&#x27;ve used, so no repeat business from me for this product.</li>
            <li> I especially like that it isn&#x27;t white and greasy like other products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It definitely helps (in tandem with HA lotion) to keep my skin from needing lotion all the time in the very dry winter environment of Denver.</li>
            <li> Seems a little drying, but it does clear bumps and spots.</li>
            <li> I am 56 years old, I wasn&#x27;t looking for a miracle, just a little help.  </li>
            <li> and  my skin does not look as dull and it really feels firmer.  </li>
            <li> I feel my skin a little bit too dry but not stiff.</li>
            <li> I am afraid that I will not be able to get all the product out</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will continue using this for a long time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin, and stopped use after a few weeks when I noticed some pimples.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to keep re-ordering for as long as they keep making it.&lt;br /&gt;EDIT</li>
            <li> but you could feel it stretched and numbed your face a bit.</li>
            <li> It spreads a long way.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t use it for long to notice any changes in wrinkles yet .</li>
            <li> I had spent quite a lot of money and time on facial treatments at spas.</li>
            <li> When I received the bottle it was open and 1/2 empty.  </li>
            <li> Need to see how long it takes for improvements</li>
            <li> It will go a long way.</li>
            <li> but it goes long way.</li>
            <li> but I expected a larger amount.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just wondering how long it takes to see results?</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had the product long to rate it.  </li>
            <li> I looked so crabby before and no its not completely gone</li>
            <li> I am 28 years old and have a few wrinkles on my forehead.</li>
            <li> Kinda strange since I am one of those people who try everything on the market to try to rid yself of wrinkles while getting smoother skin.</li>
            <li> As I have aged, my upper eyes have drooped to the point where the fold was so deep that you could not really see any of my eyelid.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d pay almost a hundred bucks a bottle but as long as it&#x27;s under $20 here on Amazon</li>
            <li> It arrived almost empty  a couple of drops left.</li>
            <li> and I had a tough time getting the right amount of product on my skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered two bottles, and one of them when i open the box, seeing that the cap of the bottle was not proper closed (tilted), and there are some gel like stuff around, only half of the content was still in side the bottle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;HOWEVER, this brand is significantly more expensive than the brand I was using previously.  </li>
            <li> I have rosacea and my face was less red after only one application.</li>
            <li> When I hear it I think chemicals but on further research I have discovered that it is naturally occurring in our bodies, but as we age our bodies make less and less of it.  </li>
            <li> its not nearly as pricey as other items that are similar</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started using this product for a few weeks, but some of my fine lines seem to have decreased.  </li>
            <li> I am not happy at all the bottle of ulyima pure swiss was not sealed properly, I plan to return.</li>
            <li> I had read other reviews that were similar, so I had assumed that the manufacturer had corrected this misleading information.  </li>
            <li> I just only wish the  bottle was a little larger.</li>
            <li> though that being said, I do use other products on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> This is no different than any other skin care product.  </li>
            <li> but the results are no different than any other product.</li>
            <li> I have tried countless other products never getting anything close to the results of this serum</li>
            <li> Ordered 2 sent one back and threw the other way.&lt;br /&gt;No substance</li>
            <li> I had not used any other different product on my face</li>
            <li> Other people are starting to notice the improvement and ask what I am doing.  </li>
            <li> I will use up the bottle - maybe using only every other day.</li>
            <li> It seems to be working .I have not been using it for very long.</li>
            <li> and I am seeing some results even though I haven&#x27;t been using it very long.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have the opportunity to use this stuff very long..</li>
            <li> have not used it very long</li>
            <li> Have not been doing it for very long</li>
            <li> I HAVE NOT BEEN USING IT FOR VERY LONG -</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t do a lot of tightening for very long.  </li>
            <li> If you have mildly to moderately dry skin this product would help with that.  </li>
            <li> When my skin was completely dry</li>
            <li> I have let it dry before applying my face lotion</li>
            <li> But,after a couple of weeks of use, it makes me itch and seems to dry out areas on my face.,</li>
            <li> Seemed to dry out my skin and no amount of lotion could correct it.  </li>
            <li> Fewer dry spots and skin feels tighter.  </li>
            <li> it is 10 days i use this serum, but i dont see diferens and it is immediately dry on the skin.</li>
            <li> wask face, let it&lt;br /&gt;dry, apply acid, let it dry, then apply moisturizer.</li>
            <li> this goes so well with the Argon oil, if your skin is dry.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin dry, didn&#x27;t work for me, would not reccomend.</li>
            <li> and it makes my face feel really dry after I put it on.</li>
            <li> and I can tell my skin isn&#x27;t quite as dry.</li>
            <li> I noticed my dry areas on my face improved .</li>
            <li> when dry it was without a shine.</li>
            <li> Give it about 5-10 minutes to completely dry.  </li>
            <li> The moment I put it on, it relaxes the dry skin and makes it smoother immediately.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days and that&#x27;s not enough time to evaluate it.</li>
            <li> My main complaint is with the package or bottle the serum comes in.</li>
            <li> Have only been using it for a few days, but can actually feel a difference.</li>
            <li> There seemed to be no damage except a soggy box of Hyalunic acid with a greasy outside and a few drops left.</li>
            <li> Did not live up to it&#x27;s claim.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it didn&#x27;t last long enough.</li>
            <li> Small wrinkles are diminished and my skin tone is clear and even.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise so far I like the product, but not sure if it&#x27;s supposed to leave a sticky film on your skin?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t look at all like my age but the dark spots tend to tell a different story.</li>
            <li> It definitely gets rid of age spot, dark spots.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works yet, but so far I like it.  </li>
            <li> There is no magic but still you will notice after 2 weeks that your skin feels incredibly soft, it shrinks the appearance of pores.</li>
            <li> It was loose, no safety purpose.</li>
            <li> I especially like that a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> It only takes 3 drops to cover your face &amp; neck, so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This was a decent serum, however, for the price, you get a VERY small amount.</li>
            <li> I have very pale, sensitive, dry skin.</li>
            <li> I just put a few drops on my palm and dab it on my crows feet and other crucial facial areas, I follow this by a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Returned *and then got a different serum for a lot less</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t realize this was less for the same price I paid for 2 oz of another brand.</li>
            <li> my eyebrows is much less noticeable, Overall my skin has a smoother look.</li>
            <li> which is 1/2 oz), however, since you only need a few drops per application, it lasts a surprisingly long time.  </li>
            <li> When I stopped using this product and switched back to my previous brand of hyaluronic acid serum, the rash went away.  </li>
            <li> When I stopped using this product and switched back to my previous brand of hyaluronic acid serum, the rash went away.  </li>
            <li> Although I have only been using once a day or every other, alternating with other products.  </li>
            <li> All in all, I have used it regularly and have noticed a small difference on overall quality of skin.</li>
            <li> Only thing was it was pricey for a small bottle that didn&#x27;t even last a month.</li>
            <li> You should go back to the previous packaging</li>
            <li> I did notice a small rash in 2 spots on my face after starting the 2nd bottle.</li>
            <li> I used it twice a day, and it only lasted for less than a month.</li>
            <li> I uses it along, my skin would feel very dry.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this serum because I have very dry skin on my face.</li>
            <li> All over-the-counter products at local department stores claiming to lighten age spots did nothing, not even a little.</li>
            <li> ONLY WISH IT WERE A LITTLE CHEAPER, ALTOUGH</li>
            <li> The only issue was my bottle was a little crusty when I opened it.  </li>
            <li> I put it on the little tiny wrinkles around my eyes, massage it in, and the wrinkles are gone.</li>
            <li> Got the same product for my little sister to try.</li>
            <li> I do wish that the bottles were a little larger.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks and no more crows feet, and laugh lines and other wrinkles or uneven skin problems</li>
            <li> and I live in So Cal, where sun does serious damage to skin.</li>
            <li> I was shocked it worked so well. :)</li>
            <li> I am not sure how long it will last</li>
            <li> Long term I&#x27;m not sure yet, takes several months to yrs.</li>
            <li> After I posted the second negative review on this product, the company again ask me to only post positives.  </li>
            <li> I am 56, have always looked at least 10 years younger than my actual age which is in part the luck of the genetic draw.  </li>
            <li> If the ingredients are trully natural, then it would be a preference over chemical based products at least.</li>
            <li> Left my skin looking dried out.</li>
            <li> I never really had wrinkles, so I cannot comment on those.</li>
            <li> Simply put a few drops on your face and massage in circular motions.</li>
            <li> You do need to be careful about going in the sun with no protection</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> however, almost all had drained out of the very loose cap.  </li>
            <li> Be careful what you purchase online these days.</li>
            <li> Will keep using it just because I spent the money.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> I am a 40 year old Hispanic female and I have been battling for a year with a change in hormones which has left me with skin which seems unable to be quenched.  </li>
            <li> one of a few that actually is absorbs into the dermal layer!!</li>
            <li> Money well spent.</li>
            <li> Received quickly as expected.  </li>
            <li> I expected quicker results.  </li>
            <li> What is the expected time frame to know whether or not it will work and if so is it a product you have to keep using?  </li>
            <li> Nothing, the bottle was empty.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Either that, or I had received an empty bottle in the mail.</li>
            <li> Your face tingles as it sinks into your skin.  </li>
            <li> There is not much in the bottle.</li>
            <li> No difference at all what a waste of money after regular use&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have aged</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product a few days, and I can already feel the difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> a third of the bottle was gone-cap was not secure and the the bottle had product on it.</li>
            <li> It got wet.  </li>
            <li> I tried 2 save some but not much</li>
            <li> However, when I stopped using it for a few days, the lines did come back.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not very useful.i</li>
            <li> never really saw any results at all after a month.  </li>
            <li> There was a Difference but not much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days, so</li>
            <li> If my joints are helped in a few months, I&#x27;ll report back!</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer, it made my face red and tingly, and it totally dried out my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for a few days</li>
            <li> Received as expected.</li>
            <li> It was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have been using for only a few weeks</li>
            <li> Only been using it for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> and I see absolutely no change yet.</li>
            <li> Every day for three weeks I carefully followed all directions that came with the product.  </li>
            <li> Been using it for a few weeks with no big difference</li>
            <li> This producted did not really work for me as I hope,</li>
            <li> Absorbs completely and creates a smooth base for makeup application.</li>
            <li> Very sad but saved it by quickly putting it in a heavier glass short container.</li>
            <li> After using the product for over a month, twice a day, half of the bottle is gone, I see no clear results....</li>
            <li> I use only a small dab on my middle finger, small amount goes a long way, no odor at all.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a subtle change in my facial wrinkles in a very short time.</li>
            <li> I use raw shea butter (the white one) over this</li>
            <li> It is but product and works as expected though leave face skin little dry.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, a little can go a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this product.  </li>
            <li> A little does go long way.</li>
            <li> but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need much so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A LITTLE DOES GO A LONG WAY.</li>
            <li> I will use it forever and  a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I have some little blotchy areas on my cheeks for long time</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> (15ml)but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Worried that small size wouldn&#x27;t last but a little bit goes a long way,</li>
            <li> Bottle is microscopically tiny and there&#x27;s very little product.</li>
            <li> Since there&#x27;s actually very little serum in the bottle, I thought I&#x27;d try a second.  </li>
            <li> Some contain only 1% or less and that is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m applying it twice a day as I have with my other serums</li>
            <li> and you only have to use a small amount.  </li>
            <li> Is thicker than other brands I bought.</li>
            <li> Always arrives broken and empty had to send it back a third time.</li>
            <li> bottle is small (only 15 ml  </li>
            <li> May work on other people.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first based on such a small bottle and the price.</li>
            <li> and I am not sure if I am applying enough.</li>
            <li> And if it&#x27;s one or the other.</li>
            <li> I saw a friend the other day that I hadn&#x27;t seen in 2 weeks</li>
            <li> It was cost prohibitive return due to cost and shipping and handling fees and then to pay return shipping.</li>
            <li> Feels softer and smoother and works well with my other makeup.....not sticky or overly oily......</li>
            <li> am starting to see small results, I will keep it up.  </li>
            <li> After a year of extreme trauma, I didn&#x27;t want to look in the mirror and be reminded of the toll everything had taken on me.  </li>
            <li> I looked forward to using it during one of my travels, because it is small enough to get through security check.</li>
            <li> This has never happened to me before with any other cosmetics I have used, and I use a lot of cosmetics, and I travel a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a small growth just below my left lower eyelid.</li>
            <li> But it is WAYY too pricey for such a small bottle.</li>
            <li> I use it in the morning without any other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I only wasted $13  on this junk!</li>
            <li> whether there is any benefit to this product versus dozens of other cheaper products I have used.</li>
            <li> The advertisement of the elderly lady with extreme wrinkles had visible results per the U Tube segment, which did not seem doctored up at all...</li>
            <li> Plus it had HA in it that was the other plus factor.</li>
            <li> I should mention that I am also using other products as well</li>
            <li> It comes in a small bottle but can last a while.</li>
            <li> and I use it every other day (when I remember)</li>
            <li> It works well with my other cosmetics.</li>
            <li> I had tried other brands of hyaluronic acid before and not seen any results at all.  </li>
            <li> Also, I apply the serum LIBERALLY immediately after doing my TCA peel, and it is extremely soothing to my stinging skin.  </li>
            <li> but she hasn&#x27;t commented other than (when opening it)....</li>
            <li> He uses them himself and he doesn&#x27;t recommend any other cream/lotion for his patients (for their faces).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t specify the percentage of Hyaluronic Acid and Vitamin C, so it is a bit discerning, but I gave it a try anyway due to the cost.</li>
            <li> Bottle too small needed a larger size</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensative skin, and never had a problem with any other types of eye serums or creams.  </li>
            <li> Price is another plus for this type of beauty product compared to other stores.</li>
            <li> etc., are almost non-existent due to the plumping effect.</li>
            <li> I would not hesitate to purchase from this company again due to the ease of doing business with them.</li>
            <li> and I use it twice daily usually combined with ceremides.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used any other serums before this but after reading these reviews and seeing the price I couldn&#x27;t pass it up.</li>
            <li> I received this on the day that it was due to arrive....wrapped neatly in a bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> it had 15 ml ; I think this is a scam it has happened to other buyers .&lt;br /&gt;I will be returning product</li>
            <li> I use other serums after.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping to keep it that way but don&#x27;t want surgery, injections and other nonsense.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was just looking to tighten the skin with something other than a moisturizer, and that is why i purchased this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands of  hyaluronic acid, and they have a thicker consistency than this.  </li>
            <li> A little after a week though I noticed that I hadn&#x27;t seen any dry patches on my face like I used to get.</li>
            <li> a little bit stinky, i&#x27;d say, and makes my face really dry.</li>
            <li> This left me with dull, aged looking skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A few weeks later they had cleared up &amp; I tried the formula again and after a few days had bumps again.</li>
            <li> Seems to tighten the skin slightly which I expected.</li>
            <li> Disliked the product because it made my skin feel dry.  </li>
            <li> Using this as directed for two months with  no real fantastic results.</li>
            <li> Bottle was half empty.</li>
            <li> I imagine it to the same gooey texture left behind by a snail.</li>
            <li> When I received this item it was half empty.  </li>
            <li> Then, it got dry, and changed nothing, except maybe dried out my skin</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin in the harsh NE winter.  </li>
            <li> I like it very much, just the price which is a little expensive.</li>
            <li> Just remember to wet your skin a little before applying.</li>
            <li> It was an empty bottle, with too little to draw into the eye dropper.  </li>
            <li> I fell in love with the Skinceuticals line a few years ago, then dropped it as it was so expensive, and have been on a hunt for less expensive products that could give similar results in skin clarity and hydration.</li>
            <li> If you look at the other products in the stores, you can spend a lot of money, and they do not do half of what this does...</li>
            <li> Have only used it 3 days so hard to leave a response yet.</li>
            <li> It is overpriced for such a small amount and there is so little one can hardly have enough to try for 30 days.</li>
            <li> The bottle is rather small, but the product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I know the contents seem to be a small amount, but it goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> The product was average thickness and went well onto my skin.  </li>
            <li> It did not get rid of my dark spots.</li>
            <li> The dark spots are  beginning to lighten up.</li>
            <li> I purchased 3 different serums and have been trying all if them for the past few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Would totally recommend for someone who dislikes the heavy, smelly cream usually worn at night.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Smells weird and is very watery.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for a long time, and I was not able to see any changes in my skin.</li>
            <li> would have returned but not worth the hassle.  </li>
            <li> Even though the amount is small, it does go a long way.  </li>
            <li> With the serum as a base, the moisturizer is able to absorb and do it&#x27;s benefits.  </li>
            <li> and I love the base it gives my makeup.  </li>
            <li> The RetinA can be very harsh, but I have used it a long time.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint is the slight smell when you massage it into your skin.</li>
            <li> It was a let down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost down with the jar (I&#x27;ve had it a month)</li>
            <li> It was a little thicker than other solutions I have tried.  </li>
            <li> It will make my face less oily and dark.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste money and time on any other.</li>
            <li> It came on time and it was packaged very carefully!</li>
            <li> After a few weeks, the white cover rubber dropper was misaligned and I could hardly close the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I used to have really bad acne, but when I use this with clean n</li>
            <li> never got to know wether it was good or bad to even rate unfortunately .</li>
            <li> It appears smoother with less depth of my wrinklesðŸ˜</li>
            <li> After about a week I noticed the pores on my cheeks and nose were less visible, as if the skin around them was plumped up.</li>
            <li> It soaks in quickly, is not sticky and my skin feels hydrated.</li>
            <li> We will see how it goes after I finish my half bottle.</li>
            <li> My skin feels nourished and I am wearing less makeup and cover up.</li>
            <li> Its small but u need such a small amount all over your face.</li>
            <li> The size is too small and make me feel dry because of \\&quot;Benzyl Alcohol\\&quot; ingredient inside!</li>
            <li> I felt a slight tightening, but that was it.</li>
            <li> May have slightly had an effect, unclear.  </li>
            <li> and I see a slight difference.  </li>
            <li> Oddly, that&#x27;s also what I didn&#x27;t like about it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been less than a week.</li>
            <li> I do realize that screw of the cover is tilted, so the half was probably leaked out.</li>
            <li> star less because of the price.</li>
            <li> I dont know if that is because it contains less \\&quot;aqua\\</li>
            <li> The rubber squeeze seems nonfunctional, not a super glitch ...</li>
            <li> It is too soon to tell if I have less wrinkles</li>
            <li> I use it with a dermaroller every month 2 month and a half.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Research led me to hyaluronic acid (as well as gelatin supplements) as something that may help plump up the skin and make the joints function less painfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have already reordered as I do seem to notice a difference in the lines around my eyes and they are less puffy.</li>
            <li> notice a difference after less than a week.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs like a dream, literally like water, but slightly thicker.  </li>
            <li> At the same time, my joints, especially my hips, have become very painful from cartilage loss, and apparently, hyaluronic acid loss, as well, which forms part of a fluid sac in the joints that also helps to cushion the bones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While not cheap, this product serves me well as I have no laugh lines.  </li>
            <li> The bottle was not full.</li>
            <li> Does not work, not true what they say about it.</li>
            <li> After partial use, I stopped it for a few weeks, when I opened the bottle, tightly closed, the material had gone thick and could not come out.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and was put into a small brown flat outer cardboard box and shipped via Amazon with another unrelated small item inside.</li>
            <li> My little lines on my forehead are less noticeable and the lines around my eyes are going away too.</li>
            <li> I found they sell this at Sears for a little less</li>
            <li> and it started to make my skin feel tight</li>
            <li> I would just caution that caps are checked for leaking and tight before shipping.</li>
            <li> It does lift without feeling tight and does hydrate.</li>
            <li> The product sometimes makes my skin feel tight, but I just put on mosturizer and it&#x27;s no problem.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is thick which means a little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> Although size is small, very little goes a very long way.  </li>
            <li> But a little to soon to say how it works........</li>
            <li> Serum makes me feel just a little bit pampered.  </li>
            <li> They give so little per purchase.</li>
            <li> no significant change in appearance.</li>
            <li> After doing some research I found the ingredients for what&#x27;s in this little bottle.</li>
            <li> But it seems help a little bit when applying on your skin.</li>
            <li> I strayed  a little and tried another brand</li>
            <li> it consider it unaffordable due to the small quantity</li>
            <li> The bottle is very small, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Box came a little smashed in also.  </li>
            <li> A little goes along way.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a little over a month now</li>
            <li> My product did arrive and I have been using it for a little over a week.  </li>
            <li> It shows a little improvement, but nothing to rave home about.</li>
            <li> not a very interesting product...</li>
            <li> I have used it a few days, but notice a little difference in my skin already.</li>
            <li> the hard ones from stress and loose skin can stand a helping hand!  </li>
            <li> It did not do what I expected it to do!!!</li>
            <li> the other reviewers have said You put this on BEFORE you moisturize!!  </li>
            <li> After about ten days of putting one small drop in the folds of my eyelids, you can see my eyelids again!!  </li>
            <li> so hopefully you don&#x27;t waste your money either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> Yes I smell all the serums because I had a few come in</li>
            <li> For approximately the same price, you can buy a 2 oz (60 ml) bottle of Watts Beauty Hyaluronic Acid.  </li>
            <li> , however, I use both this product and the brush everyday.</li>
            <li> I tried to save money and all I did was waste it.</li>
            <li> This one has all the components I wanted and in the serum, no creams for me - too heavy.  </li>
            <li> After using it a few times, the rubber dropper came off and I had to fix it.</li>
            <li> It virtually erases years after a few days of use.  </li>
            <li> After a very difficult couple of years, with my sleep disturbed nightly, I have been told that I look refreshed and invigorated for the first time in months.  </li>
            <li> nothing works over night, but i see a change.. been a few weeks</li>
            <li> I could see the result after a few days.</li>
            <li> I got this a month ago, a few time s</li>
            <li> I have used this faithfully everyday along with my dermaroller</li>
            <li> I just product a few days ago.  </li>
            <li> AFTER A FEW WEEKS I WILL KNOW WHAT I THINK OF IT.</li>
            <li> The bottle was not completely filled.  </li>
            <li> It dried out my skin</li>
            <li> Amazon has few people that know anything about this product</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t oily nor heavy.</li>
            <li> but my skin got really dried and feels like  plastic.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> I did not enjoy this experience.</li>
            <li> I could not believe the difference I could see in my skin in just a few days.</li>
            <li> Just few drops and than the oil</li>
            <li> totally wasted money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I will let you know what I think about it in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> It pulls skin for a few seconds then disappears once you use your moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, it does not work.</li>
            <li> Once my face was completely dried, I put 4 drops of this serum on the palm of my hand and with my index finger, I started tracing my face with the product while ensuring that my problem areas were covered.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks and Don&#x27;t see any visible difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> This product looks water,did nothing for my skin after few months.</li>
            <li> Its waste of money.</li>
            <li> I think i wasted my money on this serum</li>
            <li> I use it everyday, but have not noticed any difference.</li>
            <li> After a few uses notice skin felt softer.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it after a few days.</li>
            <li> a few minutes after you apply this.  </li>
            <li> This product in just a few days has help reduce the wrinkles I have.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this it is garbage</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;ve wasted my money...</li>
            <li> It dried out my skin and after 1 week have stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does nothing, a waste.........</li>
            <li> I use it everyday</li>
            <li> did make my skin feel tighter as it dried, and afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> Is been a few days</li>
            <li> and I can already firm and tightness in my skin.</li>
            <li> Since price was what attracted me to this particular product I was disappointed when I realized that it actually is no less expensive than similar products.</li>
            <li> I had a problem with a bottle that was broken while shipping, the actual company contacted me for feedback and when I told them what happened, they sent me a replacement immediately, no questions asked.  </li>
            <li> I see the difference in a few days&lt;br</li>
            <li> I prefer serums over heavy creams.</li>
            <li> Did not notice one didifference, waste of money.</li>
            <li> but the it cost a lot if I use this everyday.  </li>
            <li> Once it&#x27;s dried</li>
            <li> I feel I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> There was no seal on it and there was liquid missing.</li>
            <li> For a woman of 67, my face has few wrinkles in it, just some lose skin under the eyes.  </li>
            <li> It was just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Feel like this was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> ,  I use this with my Tria, o my spatula  galvanic, help to keep the skin firm, and radiant,</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and will continue to use..</li>
            <li> Just started using not long ago ,so I haven&#x27;t seen dramatic results.</li>
            <li> less lines around my eye&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> Very small amount, I can see I will need to reorder sooner than I expected.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a dramatic change-but you and others will notice a difference after a short time!</li>
            <li> But I would have to say I saw a little improvement, not sure if it&#x27;s this solution or the derma roller</li>
            <li> My face is a little tighter then usual.</li>
            <li> its a little pricey to be this small.</li>
            <li> the product is way too watery and therefore hard to use because it runs down your fingers before you have a chance to get it on your skin.</li>
            <li> Sad to say I didnt use much at all maybe twice and the bottle must be very delicate it fell in my sink and broke .I</li>
            <li> The worst part was the seller tried to offer other products free</li>
            <li> very little stuff inside, not going to buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> I like the effect of the serum on my skin but the quantity is very little.</li>
            <li> The product contains very little content.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is almost empty again when I got it!!!!</li>
            <li> Seriously, I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement so far, but it hasn&#x27;t made my skin worse either!  </li>
            <li> I feel uncomfortable using products on my face that I&#x27;m not familiar with since I&#x27;ve had a life long battle with cystic acne.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m just not sure yet</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is one of the products that is helping</li>
            <li> This Hyaluronic Acid is not as runny as a lot of the ones that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I noticed no difference after using the small bottle...</li>
            <li> Not satisfied at all.</li>
            <li> I am not a big fan of the slightly weird smell it has when I apply it.</li>
            <li> Not sure of the outcome yet,</li>
            <li> It is a small bottle  </li>
            <li> The small wrinkles are still there.  </li>
            <li> Unbelievable the change on the face  after 2 times, I am ordering another one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this has helped my skin...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle, but I think it did help with small wrinkles (crowsfeet) and texture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure yet.</li>
            <li> Bottle could be bigger, but for the price you cannot go wrong</li>
            <li> But not satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have been using for the past two weeks.  </li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s a small bottle</li>
            <li> There was a small amount of product for the price.</li>
            <li> Not sure about the results yet.  </li>
            <li> b/c size is small&amp; in 3 weeks I can&#x27;t see a difference .</li>
            <li> I see small wrinkles and imperfections that I didn&#x27;t have as a girl.  </li>
            <li> I have always had problems with acne and in the past some skin care products, for whatever reason, have caused my skin to freak out.</li>
            <li> Add a small amount of another serum to my foundation.</li>
            <li> The items gave me hives, sores, and then small scabs.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product with another that was recommended and I am not sure yet</li>
            <li> small bottle</li>
            <li> So, I was not able to see any visible improvements.</li>
            <li> 2-3 Drops wouldn&#x27;t get past my cheeks.</li>
            <li> This product broke up the brown spots on my face; however, the size is too small.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is so small &amp; it had about 20 drops of product in ...</li>
            <li> By the time I opened the package, one of the bottle was empty because the bottle was broken at the bottom.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s arrived with 0.5oz small bottle like sample.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> (But then again, we all know what assume usually means.)</li>
            <li> Not sure yet.</li>
            <li> The bottle is small</li>
            <li> Received a shattered ,thin glass vial ( yes it is that small) and soaking wet, sticky packaging.</li>
            <li> I used it up and not sure what it did for my skin.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell that this did anything for my skin, and it&#x27;s a bit pricey for the small amount I received.</li>
            <li> Not sure.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes along way.  </li>
            <li> but I was also amazed to find that my small lines disappeared</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works</li>
            <li> Yes, seems to fill in small wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> just the bottle is too small with the pricing&lt;</li>
            <li> maybe need to use longer, for results - not sure.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me it wasn&#x27;t the same.</li>
            <li> All you need are a couple small drops along with my Retinol face cream.</li>
            <li> I am sticking with my usual HA</li>
            <li> but this product has lightened my chicken pox scars from when I was 4 years old and the area under my eyes.</li>
            <li> When I received the serum, it was in a small padded shipping envelope.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It may appear to be a small amount.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the lines are disappearing on my face or not.  </li>
            <li> I saw a small difference</li>
            <li> Too small for the price.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it changes the healing time.  </li>
            <li> The small serum bottle lasts me about a month.</li>
            <li> not sure if it&#x27;s &amp;</li>
            <li> so I was never able to use.</li>
            <li> They are small 1/2oz</li>
            <li> 2 1/2 wks, so I am not able to afford it twice a month.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t stop the march of time, but you can at least slow it down, and this product is a must have in my time-fighter toolbox.</li>
            <li> I saw a visible difference after a few uses but, it is just too expensive and complicated (using a refrigerated product, my refrigerator is nowhere near my bathroom) to become a part of my everyday regimen.</li>
            <li> Wow was I wrong !</li>
            <li> Starting with a base of Ultima hyaluronic acid serum is the key!</li>
            <li> Rely too bad as I had high hopes....</li>
            <li> I bought because of the feedback, maybe this product is not suitable for people like me.</li>
            <li> Kinda expensive when u look at it in the long run..</li>
            <li> less tired.</li>
            <li> so its hard to tell yet.</li>
            <li> I have always been a multi step girl and those habits are hard to break.  </li>
            <li> Hard to say something when you haven&#x27;t had a chance to try it.</li>
            <li> This bottle hardly lasted 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> bottle is a little smaller than I was expecting but not in a bad way, it&#x27;s petite but longer.</li>
            <li> in my late 60s and have used prescription Obagi products for years.  </li>
            <li> I returned the product because I was looking for at least 2 oz</li>
            <li> I feel that my skin just sucks this serum</li>
            <li> I am always afraid that it will not give enough moist to my skin,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used lately because I went to prescription Retin A.</li>
            <li> At least once per week.</li>
            <li> so I would not leave a negative feedback.</li>
            <li> the price, ($13 something), at least I wasn&#x27;t out of pocket too much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used this product for at least 4 weeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for at least a week</li>
            <li> Not thrilled with this product.</li>
            <li> I was thick and almost as if it was mineral oil.  </li>
            <li> It was a rather thick formula</li>
            <li> I let the contents slowly defrost and transferred it to another container.</li>
            <li> It is thick and gel like and leaves no greasy residue.</li>
            <li> Slightly thick</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that it has started to diminish my lines slowly.</li>
            <li> , they shrunk sooooo much, redness reduced, all with out the drying &amp; scaliness we all hate.</li>
            <li> skip it, it leaves a thick film that hardens on your skin.</li>
            <li> I have never seen results so quickly with any product before, and my usual reaction to skincare products is a horrible blistering breakout, or no reaction at all.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I mean G.a.r.b.a.g.e.</li>
            <li> I mean that it made no difference whatsoever in the texture, appearance or elasticity.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure, this is the real product in that box, because it&#x27;s the worst product ever use, I waste my money</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past six months and it works!  </li>
            <li> And the bottle is very small.</li>
            <li> very  small  </li>
            <li> Very small jar</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a very small bottle of product (1/2 ounce), but it&#x27;s lasted me about a month.  </li>
            <li> Very small bottle</li>
            <li> Very small vial.</li>
            <li> Very small amount for price.</li>
            <li> This serum is not effective for my skin, it made my skin regress, to the point I had to go out and get a microderm because my skin was in such bad shape.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a month and see a subtle difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Price for this size bottle is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> contents seemed seriously diluted</li>
            <li> The Watts brand is much less expensive and it works.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m seeing subtle results.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed with the size of the bottle and although the serum is thicker than the usual HA product I usually use I saw absolutely no difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Have tried a lot of expensive products which was a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say the product is not a good one, It just doesn&#x27;t work for my skin</li>
            <li> Not a good item for me.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical after a few nights of using his product, but stuck with it to discover that I am finding results with a healthier skin appearance  and feel.</li>
            <li> I guess you pay for what you get, first of all the packaging was horrible.  </li>
            <li> Dumb</li>
            <li> I used Perrico e in the past and boy how expensive</li>
            <li> I don’t feel I have enough criteria to mark any stars yet, but because I have not seen any results yet :(</li>
            <li> The smell is terrible, and it&#x27;s no useless to me.</li>
            <li> but I was disappointed when I discovered, after placing the order, that it was only .5 oz.</li>
            <li> I really was hoping this was going to work, but ended up very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It does not plump my skin up to give the temporary look of no lines but that could be because I am thin and my face has nothing to use to plump .</li>
            <li> well therefore I assume the seal was broken before packing</li>
            <li> not happy at all with this item.</li>
            <li> they all want to know my secret...</li>
            <li> I get tired of returning things</li>
            <li> and I do not see any change I will continue using, but I am not happy if I get to obtain a change will change this feedback.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all.</li>
            <li> No matter how tired I am at night</li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>
            <li> It is completely worthless and definitely does not do what it says it does.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m saying I&#x27;m a bit confused as to how and what is all.</li>
            <li> Within a week my face had broken out with \\&quot;pimples\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Approximately $100 for 100 ml.</li>
            <li> Not happy</li>
            <li> As for the size:  it is just 15 ml/0.05 oz which amounts to one tablespoon of product; one bottle lasted me approximately 5 weeks.</li>
            <li> The bottom of the glass bottle had broken off and the serum had leaked out and frozen to the inside of the envelope.</li>
            <li> After researching the product, I found that the correct retail is approximately $14.99.  </li>
            <li> I was not happy when the product came and it looked like it had been used.</li>
            <li> Received this broken in the mail.  </li>
            <li> ALSO received broken</li>
            <li> Works wonders, but I received product partially used in damaged box...was disappointed about used product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After he recommended this, I started trying to find Hyaluronic Acid products, but that was a few years ago and these products were very expensive.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any dramatic improvement in my skin; but I did find surface breakouts that I assume to be caused by clogged pores.</li>
            <li> I seen dramatic, draw dropping results and do I look 20 again?  </li>
            <li> Not GONE, mind you, but after one application anything noticable is a dramatic result.</li>
            <li> Just feel bad the bottle broke when it hit my granite counter:( a little flimsy bottle so got to be careful when using it.</li>
            <li> I had 2 awful pimples near my mouth, cleansed my skin &amp; applied this, by morning</li>
            <li> I have started to get all those little wrinkles between the mouth and nose and for some reason I really hate the look, along with thin lips.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it was fake or if the product is just that bad.</li>
            <li> I have been using then product for about a month, I waited to see any results, but unfortunately nothing happened.</li>
            <li> This product is useless.  </li>
            <li> The Rx products are expensive.  </li>
            <li> Not really impressed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Hyaluronic acid is a scary word.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t used consistently, unable to determine if it does what it says it does, although, I think it does if you think about the process.&lt;br /&gt;Delivered</li>
            <li> Not impressed with results.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that this would &amp;#34;really&amp;#34; work</li>
            <li> Like four times as expensive.  </li>
            <li> Sorry, this product does not work on my skin</li>
            <li> Overnight results are unrealistic.</li>
            <li> I thought it might be just unfortunate.</li>
            <li> I truly feel that there is something wrong with that.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I received one opened and broken product!</li>
            <li> It seems to be working as well as the expensive product I used before.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is something wrong with this product, either with the packaging or with the product itself.</li>
            <li> Expensive.</li>
            <li> I am basing my review on the fact that the packaging is lousy and came without a seal or shrink wrap around the bottle or the box</li>
            <li> but this product make me wonder if this is fake product because it doesn&#x27;t improve anything to my skin  after two bottles.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have not noticed any results-</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my cleaning person broke the bottle &amp; I didn&#x27;t get the chance to see results.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the wrinkles are still there..</li>
            <li> If you are undecided on buying this, you won&#x27;t be sorry if  you do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed.  </li>
            <li> Expensive.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I did not experience any long-term improvement in the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> Sorry.  </li>
            <li> This container was also broken making it impossible to try the product.</li>
            <li> I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED, THE BOTTLE WAS 1/2 EMPTY.</li>
            <li> Not happy with the  results:( sorry</li>
            <li> thin glass that does not balance well in the bath room is always a bad idea</li>
            <li> I hate to leave negative feedback but feel I needed to for this.  </li>
            <li> i was afraid what may have leaked into</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as if everything was haphazardly thrown together.</li>

            <li> I have a very difficult time finding products for my face that I&#x27;m not allergic to,  I took a chance on this.  </li>

            <li> This product was a bad choice for me.</li>
            <li> However, the company emailed, telling me not to give them a bad review, to contact them if I have any issues.  </li>
            <li> smells bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying this product is bad by any means</li>
            <li> /&gt;Too bad</li>
            <li> My skin isnt bad for my age because I do TCA peels at home, once every 3 or 4 months.  </li>
            <li> The smell of the product made me sick to stomach.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really think I&#x27;m enjoying this but it seems as though I&#x27;m running through it quickly.  I&#x27;m applying it twice a day as I have with my other serums but I&#x27;ll be lucky to get another couple of weeks out of the bottle.  I would really like to stay with it to see if I can tell a difference but I&#x27;m just not sure yet if I can afford to do so.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to give it the full 5-star rating, but it does feel good going on and like how m&#x27;face feels after massaging it in. Also is useful as under light-weight foundation. Will try to update later after I&#x27;ve used it long enough to really tell if it&#x27;s doing all I hoped it could...even at my age, a senior-senior gal. It arrived fairly timely but just not enough usage yet to determine efficacy.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. I tried another that was well rated and did not get the quick, beautiful results as I did with the 180 pure Swiss product. Awesome!</li>
            <li> really nice serum, leaves the face feeling smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product long enough to rate higher than 4 stars.  It was packaged well and arrived in a timely manner.  I&#x27;ve used this serum about four times now, it goes on well and you only have to use a small amount.  So far I really like it, but only time will tell. If it does as well as the reviews says it does, then it will deserve a five star rating:)</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product.  I typically do not use serums, as I&#x27;ve never gotten particularly good results with any I&#x27;ve tried, so don&#x27;t incur the expense of buying them.  I read reviews of the 180 Cosmetics Pure Swiss serum, and ordered it.  I absolutely love the product; you truly need to use only two drops for your entire face.  I noticed a difference in my skin from the first use; the serum is very hydrating without adding an oil to my skin.  My moisturizer and foundation glide on over it easily.  I had a facial with the esthetician I&#x27;ve been working with for at least the last decade this past weekend, and she asked what I changed in my skin routine because my skin has never looked as good as does as a result of the serum.  I was thrilled that the results are noticeable and have made such a change.</li>
            <li> I did not notice any difference until I ran out and was not using it.</li>
            <li> I like the results of this product ,it has made my skin feel nicer and the lines softened . It does not plump my skin up to give the temporary look of no lines but that could be because I am thin and my face has nothing to use to plump . As it does plump my daughters face who is a bit heavier . So I will be buying it again and recommending it as well .</li>
            <li> This is the second product I have tried by 180 Cosmetics and I am once again very happy.&lt;br /&gt;I had an opportunity to purchase this at an introductory price and I must say that the fast shipping, proper packing, sturdy glass packaging and cute box with gold accents really leave a lot for the eyes to take in.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is a little smaller than I was expecting but not in a bad way, it&#x27;s petite but longer. It just more of an original shape. As I use it I realize that there is more in there than I thought. I&#x27;m dreading the day I run out but luckily amazon has 2 day shipping :)</li>
            <li> I love this product!! Everyone should try this my face looks brighter,  smoother and just so much better!! Please try it and you wont be disappointed</li>
            <li> Love it! Considering buying it again. Very lightweight, no additives, no heavy perfume; leaves skin very fresh. Just perfect!</li>
            <li> First of all, this is not a fake review. I have been using then product for about a month, I waited to see any results, but unfortunately nothing happened. And the bottle is very small. The good thing about it is that is not sticky.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin beware.  I&#x27;ve tried this product twice and both times had severe allergic reactions.  I&#x27;ve used Vitamin C and hyaluronic acid separately with great results, but this combined formula is too strong for me.  Won&#x27;t ever use this again.</li>
            <li> This left my skin feeling super soft, and in a little under two weeks I am already seeing a noticeable difference in lines and clarity! I&#x27;m buying this for my mom to try out too - it will make a great gift! Can&#x27;t wait to see the more long term results!</li>
            <li> This serum is great. I actually have this in the set with the cream and I am so glad I have two of the serums. This serum makes my skin feel so soft and smooth. It looks noticeably more hydrated. My little lines on my forehead are less noticeable and the lines around my eyes are going away too. Because of this serum, my makeup applies flawlessly on my face. It absorbs very quickly into your skin and isn&#x27;t greasy at all. I am very happy with this serum! *promotional discount received for testing and review*</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer! Leaves your skin silky smooth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a month now and I wait 5 minutes for it to soak into my skin and I use coconut oil as a mosterizer and I clearly see positive results. The fine lines are gone and my skin is clear and bright. I love this!</li>
            <li> I have notice, that even the color of my complexion, maing the son and age&lt;br /&gt;pots less visible, but I will order one more, bcause siendo the amount very&lt;br /&gt;small -in my opinion- requaire more time to see all the posives efects</li>
            <li> I guess you pay for what you get, first of all the packaging was horrible.  My box was torn and then to my surprise the dropper was so cheap looking and did not even work properly.  I am trying to use it anyway to maybe see if it actually does help, but no use.  I was thick and almost as if it was mineral oil.  Will not buy from this company again , so hopefully you don&#x27;t waste your money either.</li>
            <li> Loved it. Wish I could buy some more at the same price!</li>
            <li> The details describing what you are getting are misleading.  Make no mistake--this is only 0.5 oz of product.  I had read other reviews that were similar, so I had assumed that the manufacturer had corrected this misleading information.  They haven&#x27;t.  For the price, you can probably find cheaper alternatives of similar quality.</li>
            <li> This seems to be making a difference to my skin. I makes it feel more hydrated and fine wrinkles seem less obvious, although I am combining this with IPL skin rejuvenation treatment.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, a little can go a long way.  When I use this I make sure my skin is wet, then I dip the dropper into the bottle.  I do not fill the dropper, I just dip it so it picks up the product.  Then I wipe it on my fingers and quickly rub it all over my still wet face.  It dries quickly and leaves skin feeling super soft.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed a change in my fine lines(after a month), but I&#x27;m using this more as a prevention method than a cure.  If you have mildly to moderately dry skin this product would help with that.  I have pretty dry skin, mostly during winter, and this product did help a bit with that, although I would not buy it for this purpose.&lt;br /&gt;I will probably buy this again, if nothing else for the way it leaves my skin feeling.</li>
            <li> Used faithfully whole bottle but there was no improvement with my skin.  Did not live up to it&#x27;s claim.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> This product does not do what I was hoping for - to tighten under eye puffiness. It is okay used as a moisturizer but not what&lt;br /&gt;I needed it for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now and I have to say I really feel a difference. I use it in the morning and then apply a moisturizer over that. My skin stays smooth all day and even on dry, windy days it doesn&#x27;t get those rough patches I&#x27;m used to. The bottle is rather small, but the product goes a long way. I don&#x27;t really have any wrinkles, but it does seem to be helping with some discoloration I&#x27;ve been noticing. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Did not do anything, like putting plain water on your face, store bought products work better than this. Waste of money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always searching for new products to fight aging.  This is a wonderful product and I saw great results within days, really noticeable.  I found they sell this at Sears for a little less (really)...but here I paid no tax.  I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Intense hydration in a super concentrated 75 percent hyaluronic acid serum helps keep the skin hydrated all day and night with an invisible veil of moisture. It achieves ultimate hydration by attracting up to 1000 times its weight in water from the moisture in the air. It helps replenish the moisture content of aging and environmentally damaged skin, restores youthful radiance, smooths the look of fine lines, and helps increase the skin&#x27;s ability to retain moisture, leaving skin fresh and fabulous. &amp;#34; Sephora&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used products made with hyaluronic acid serum for about three years. They are all very expensive, but I found very good for my skin. I decided to try this Swiss brand because it was a little less expensive and had good reviews. I have been using it for two weeks and find that this brand is as good as the more expensive brand I was using. I am very pleased and will continue purchasing this brand from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin remains soft with fewer wrinkles than my contemporaries. I am not sure I have seen any reversing of the aging process, but my skin looks darn good and I am, ( mumble, mumble ) years old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the Ultimate Pure Swiss brand. prisrob 07-04-13</li>
            <li> Had dark bags under eyes ever since I can remember, finally decided to do something about it and try some different options, this was the second item I tried and I was not disappointed it has made my eyes look 100% better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue using this for a long time.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is one of the products that is helping but I went to my 40th class reunion and wow....hummmm....lets not go there.  Love the way it makes my skin feel.  Really soaks in and other products go on very smooth.  Do think this is keeping the hands of time off my faced!</li>
            <li> I fell in love with the Skinceuticals line a few years ago, then dropped it as it was so expensive, and have been on a hunt for less expensive products that could give similar results in skin clarity and hydration. Reading reviews, I had high hopes. I&#x27;m a 40 y o woman with light skin and the beginnings of some lines and hyperpigmentation. I was hoping this product would address lines and keep my skin supple. I found that the bottle lasted me about 25 days (I used nights and a couple of mornings). It was a rather thick formula and I had a tough time getting the right amount of product on my skin. 2 drops seemed too little, 3 too much. I didn&#x27;t notice any dramatic improvement in my skin; but I did find surface breakouts that I assume to be caused by clogged pores. I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin, and stopped use after a few weeks when I noticed some pimples. A few weeks later they had cleared up &amp; I tried the formula again and after a few days had bumps again. I hate throwing things out, so kept using it once a week until it was gone. I&#x27;ve found using Tarte Marjacula Oil every night to be a much better treatment for my skin. Your results may vary.</li>
            <li> This product is useless.  It is mostly water but doesn&#x27;t moisturize skin or help wrinkles disappear.  Left my skin looking dried out.</li>
            <li> Good product, great price!</li>
            <li> not a very interesting product... I would not buy it again, it dries up the skin.</li>
            <li> Use with a moisturizer as it appears drying.</li>
            <li> It seems to be working .I have not been using it for very long.</li>
            <li> Good stuff but its not very big... it has a glass dropper in it....that as nice but I wish more was in it. Loved the product though.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. After I use this my face feels silky. Pretty hard to do because I have really dry skin. I am glad I found it.</li>
            <li> havent been using long enough to make a reccomendation yet, but so far seems ok</li>
            <li> VERY happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I like the product.  My eyes look younger and  less tired. I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I like this product, even use it around my eyes</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t change anything and as a Esthetician..I was disappointed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days and that&#x27;s not enough time to evaluate it.</li>
            <li> Love it :) will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Very good customer service. I am very satisfied</li>
            <li> I really like this product I&#x27;ve only been using it for a short time and every morning I wake up and my skin truly looks brighter and I feel as though I look younger I would definitely purchase this</li>
            <li> I love the way the product feels when applied. I don&#x27;t see any noticible results yet. I am 67 years old and hoping I do get some results from it.</li>
            <li> I bought this, assuming this with some proven results. It has been absolutely worthless. Didn&#x27;t do any thing. If I had bought a cheaper moisturizing cream, may have been much better. After partial use, I stopped it for a few weeks, when I opened the bottle, tightly closed, the material had gone thick and could not come out. It should be given out as a trial bottle. very little stuff inside, not going to buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;thanks for nothing worthwhile.</li>
            <li> This product reaches my highest expectations.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for a friend and have not heard what she thinks</li>
            <li> I like this product. Good Seller</li>
            <li> Am seeing results as each day goes by.  It would be nice to have a bigger bottle of the product.  Works well but unsure if I will order again.  If it was double or triple the size, I definitely would.</li>
            <li> Feels really great on skin. I have used it a few days, but notice a little difference in my skin already.</li>
            <li> this is the second time that I tried this product. I rated it against other similar products that I have and really read the ingredients. I found that this product contains all the necessary ingredients in one bottle. Price is not bad either.</li>
            <li> Loved this product.. High quality. Is thicker than other brands I bought. I would recommend Pure Swiss</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks and I am pleased with the results. There is a tauntness to my skin and I am getting a glow from the vitamin c additive.Very light and comfortable on the skin.</li>
            <li> I mixed this serume and my skin torner.  It&#x27;s texture changed and helps keep moisture in the skin.&lt;br /&gt;The price  also good.</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks with morning and bedtime use have started noticing a brighter more youthful appearance to my skin. Will continue to use to check maximum benefit</li>
            <li> I tried this cosmetic, because I had a very good experience with hyaluronic acid injections in one of my knees, repeating it every 6 month ...  so my guess was,  if it works as an injection in my knee it could also work as a treatment for my skin ... thats why  I gave it a try  and according to close friends and my wife it works .. if you put it on the skin you can feel a contracting sensation that holds up for some hours ... the change is not permanent, so you have to repeat it daily ...</li>
            <li> Have been using the serum for several weeks and my skin feels wonderful...no burning sensation or redness ...no sensitivity to sun exposure.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my late 60s and have used prescription Obagi products for years.  The Rx products are expensive.  Given the lower price of this serum, I&#x27;m pleased with the results and will try other products.</li>
            <li> I received it on time.&lt;br /&gt;I like this ultima hyaluronic acid, it keep my skin soft, and help me to moisturize my sking.&lt;br /&gt;I have bouthg it several times from the same vendor.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t do it. ...Save your money</li>
            <li> Tightens and smoothes my complexion.  I highly recommend this product and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Have only used it 3 days so hard to leave a response yet. I&#x27;m sure it will  be good once I give it some time.</li>
            <li> Skin on my face and neck area appears hydrated and pores seem smaller. Glowing appearance. Very satisfied with product and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> this is a wonderful product. I noticed significant improvement after the second time I used it. I will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I use it,&lt;br /&gt;But it dry my skyn too much. I dont like it</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see much difference but it does not irritate your skin..</li>
            <li> I bought it for my wife, and she says she saw immediate results in one day. At her age of 71, it&#x27;s amazing to see a product work so well. Very reasonably prices as well.</li>
            <li> High-end technology brings the anti-aging solution that regenerates your skin cells and provides the moisture your skin needs to look and feel young and smooth. The highest quality of Swiss Hyaluronic acid serum, complemented by natural ingredients and enriched with vitamin C,  brings the elasticity back to your skin, making it look and feel youthful and smooth.This revolutionary serum reverse the signs of agings while protecting your skin from free radicals. As we age, our body produces less and less of this important acid, thus affecting how moisture is stored in our skin. With 180° Cosmetics Pure Swiss Hyaluronic Serum + Oxygen, your skin gets the nourishing ingredients it needs to stay toned, smooth, rejuvenated, and beautiful. In just moments, this amazing serum penetrates deep into the skin, nourishing it from the core.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to try out this serum! After receiving it, I used it every day for a week. A little goes a long way with this product.  The vial will last quite a while!  Immediately after applying, I could tell that my skin was going to feel amazing after just a short time!  It was so soft and smooth!  I noticed that my skin was definitely smoother and had a brighter color to it!  This is definitely a product that I would recommend and continue to use.</li>
            <li> I have been using Ultima Pure Swiss, for 2 years now. I love it.I can really feel the product working on my face, neck and hands. I am excited to continue using this and seeing more results!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen the results that I want yet but it&#x27;s only been 4 days. I will give it some more time to see results. I don&#x27;t really know how long it takes to get good results so it&#x27;s a wait and see thing. I&#x27;m not giving up on it.</li>
            <li> The product is great..I will continue ordering this product for myself and members of my family. I use every night and fills great...</li>
            <li> OH! I simply love this product too...puit on at night wake up to better feeling and nice feeling skin !</li>
            <li> Have just begun to use it..but I do see results, more later after I see how it goes over a period of a few months.</li>
            <li> Again, I broke my own rule of buying a product that has the word &#x27;BEST&#x27; in it&#x27;s name or description, and I paid for it too. This was a decent serum, however, for the price, you get a VERY small amount. Considering the ingredients aren&#x27;t all that spectacular, you can easily find dozens of hyaluronic acid serums with better ingredients and a greater amount of product for the money. I&#x27;m an &#x27;impulse package&#x27; shopper, which means, if it looks unique or cute (good grief!) I might buy it as my brain takes a nap from reality. That absolutely was the case here. Nice packaging, looks very high quality, but the product itself is just &#x27;meh&#x27;. You can do better at the drugstore. Returned *and then got a different serum for a lot less that was much better!*</li>
            <li> Love this potion. Started seeing smoother skin within 3 days! Excellent product!</li>
            <li> Not really impressed.  Gave to a friend.</li>
            <li> It gives freshness to the face</li>
            <li> I returned the product because I was looking for at least 2 oz and I didn&#x27;t realize this was less for the same price I paid for 2 oz of another brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for nearly 3 weeks. Can&#x27;t say that I can tell a significant difference  in my skin around my eyes which is where I needed it.</li>
            <li> This Hyaluronic Acid is not as runny as a lot of the ones that I have used in the past. My skin feels like it is getting more of the serum in each drop rather than having to put more on to make it feel like I have coated my face properly. It soaks into my skin well and is not greasy. I have many large pores on my face and I was hoping this would help some with decreasing their size. I am happy to say that after a week of use I am certainly seeing some differences in the pore sizes as well as the firmness of my skin. I never really had wrinkles, so I cannot comment on those. I will keep using this product to see how much better my face gets. I was given a chance to test and give my honest opinion on this product during a promotion.</li>
            <li> The product is very nice. But a little to soon to say how it works........</li>
            <li> I have only used for a couple of days, we shall see after many weeks.  Thank you.  Can anyone tell me the percent of vitamin c in the product.  Cindy</li>
            <li> I like it. Fine lines are diminishing after one week use.  I saw Hyaluronic Acid appear on the Dr. Oz show and so&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this product and it has worked for me.</li>
            <li> exceeded my expectations</li>
            <li> it really worked for me! It does what promises to do and it was a good investment for me! Try it.</li>
            <li> I am loving this serum!  It comes in a tiny glass bottle, but don&#x27;t worry because the serum is lightweight like a water-pack (Korean hydrating mask) and you need only a drop or two to cover your entire face, neck, and decolletage. And, it truly does give you an immediate feeling of hydration, toning, firming, and lifting. It absorbs like a dream, like water.&lt;br /&gt; It has no smell, which is good when it comes to serums, because most of the serums I&#x27;ve come into contact with always have a funny smell.&lt;br /&gt; I also have zero skin sensitivity toward this product and I have super sensitive skin!! No breakouts, no over-production of oil, no drying or cracking at all. Just the feeling of pure hydration and healthy, happy skin!&lt;br /&gt;I am in love with this!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, no smell, great feel on my skin. Well worth the price and much more affordable than buying a less concentrated version in many of the moisturizers you will find on the market. I combine this with CeraVe and it&#x27;s not too heavy but provides a perfect level of moisture for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I love the texture and feel of this serum...however,somedays I wake up and think it almost makes me look more wrinkly and older...could be my imagination, but I don&#x27;t notice any considerable difference.  Would I be a repeat orderer?  nah.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a serum which would give the most noticeable results for the aging skin (my skin).  I find this particular serum very effective and pleasant to use.  It&#x27;s easy to apply and is easily absorbed.  The skin feels literally &amp;#34;rejuvenated&amp;#34;.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> im just using for a week, but a fell my skin more healthy,using to time per day, before cleaning.love it!</li>
            <li> This is nice after doing home micro-dermabrasion and helps with healing and collagen production, but you have to be consistent in using it to get the full results. I use it before I apply my moisturizer and let it sink in before applying the moisturizer. It blends well into the skin without making it feel greasy.</li>
            <li> Soft and smooth and feels great!</li>
            <li> this is a gift for my sister .she lives in China.she say that is very wonderful.she love it very much.</li>
            <li> Really helps pull your skin up on neck and jaw areas as well as around eyes.  I would buy this product again</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot. It leaves my skin more luminous.Price is great!</li>
            <li> Love it. I have always taken care of my skin but age does make a difference. I will order more before I run out on it. It is really making a difference in skin texture and shrinking pores.</li>
            <li> I use after micro needle roller and getting excellent results!  I will be back for more! Completely satisfied! Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is the best I&#x27;ve tried for such a great price. Just remember to wet your skin a little before applying.</li>
            <li> Reading the evaluations I read from other customers I expected better. Maybe it is just too soon. It is not a lot of fluid in this bottle. I just got it and it is almost halfway gone. I am not sure if I am going to purchase more yet.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product  for about 6 weeks now and I can see a bit of a difference in the texture of my skin, especially around my eyes. The lines have definitely &amp;#34;softened&amp;#34; in that area. Absolutely will continue to use it</li>
            <li> My 56 year old husband wanted to try something new for his skin. He is in great shape (in my opinion) and works out every day. We almost always use sunblock when outside or on vacation. His skin is pretty good for his age but he doesn&#x27;t have some fine lines and one &amp;#34;deep&amp;#34; wrinkle across the bridge of his nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He heard about vitamin C and asked me to purchase it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has been using it for about a month and we took before/after photos. We don&#x27;t see any difference. He will continue to use it since we don&#x27;t want to just throw it out but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything.</li>
            <li> Serum was opened upon arrival.  I did dare use on my face. I had to dispose of contents. I was packaged well therefore I assume the seal was broken before packing</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Love it!</li>
            <li> this product is terrible! I ordered 5 of these and thought it would be good because it has a good review,only to find out that it is not as good as the other brand iI tried before, and also I just opened my other bottle yesterday only to find out that its empty! I didn&#x27;t return the product since it has been over a month ago, but SURE I will never ever order this brand again.</li>
            <li> Good product, works well!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Mom, did you ever have a pet dinosaur?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it happened I&#x27;ll never know, but my kids think I&#x27;m old.  My head still says I&#x27;m 21, but my body...oh, that tells such a different story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;180&#x27; Cosmetics Pure Swiss Hyaluronic Serum + Vitamin C&amp;#34; is designed to help you reverse the signs aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic acid is a scary word.  When I hear it I think chemicals but on further research I have discovered that it is naturally occurring in our bodies, but as we age our bodies make less and less of it.  &amp;#34;180&#x27; Cosmetics Pure Swiss Hyaluronic Serum + Vitamin C&amp;#34; is an anti-aging solution that regenerates your skin cells and provides the moisture your skin needs to look and feel young and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I used it.  I have sensitive skin and I was concerned about break-outs.  The serum was extremely gentle on my skin and I suffered no breakouts from it.  What I did notice is that giant wrinkle between my eyebrows was noticeably diminished.  My skin feels tighter and smoother as well.  It feels like an instant facelift!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;180&#x27; Cosmetics Pure Swiss Hyaluronic Serum + Vitamin C&amp;#34; is easy to apply.  Simply put a few drops on your face and massage in circular motions. I found it absorbed quickly allowing me to get on with my morning and night routines.  There is no heavy, sticky or oily feeling left on my face after I apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Serum makes me feel just a little bit pampered.  As a mom we don&#x27;t always take the time we want or need for ourselves.  Even the bottle has an elegant feel to it.  This is one little way that I can make myself feel like I am doing some special just for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> was ok...but will not buy again</li>
            <li> Mehh, go Cosmedica instead</li>
            <li> This product is truly amazing, I keep it on my night stand and apply it religiously every night.  Its feels so amazingly smooth and not oily at all.  I wish it was just a bigger bottle.  I will order it again and I do recommend it with 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a month and see a subtle difference in my skin. It appears smoother with less depth of my wrinklesðŸ˜</li>
            <li> I purchased several and glad I did.  I have sensitive skin and lots of allergies but this product is gentle and effective.  When purchasing hyaluronic acid, always note the concentration.  Some contain only 1% or less and that is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I love this because as soon as you put this on you can feel your skin get the instant hydration it needs. I have very dry skin so lines and wrinkles seem to be creeping up on me fast. I like this because it seems to be filling in those fine lines around my eyes and mouth. This is odor free. Yes I smell all the serums because I had a few come in that smelled a little funny so I like to warm about that. This is a plumper so you can instantly feel this as soon as you put this on around your eyes, which I love. I love 180 Cosmetics. This is the 2nd product I use of theirs and I recommend them!!</li>
            <li> It makes my skin glow and feel so soft!!!! I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and have received compliments left and right!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and rubs in within seconds.  Making your skin feel younger and fresher.  Who could ask for more.&lt;br /&gt;Brings back the softness and helps smooth out fine lines and wrinkles.  Great Product</li>
            <li> This is great product and Vitamin C works really well to plump up the skin.  This product is great... love it</li>
            <li> Always arrives broken and empty had to send it back a third time. Done with it</li>
            <li> If I followed the directions on the bottle it would have lasted about a week.  I use maybe one to two drops, and feel that that is enough but I&#x27;m not crazy about the sticky feeling it leaves on  my face, once I put my moisturizer on it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife to try and she loved it.  She said this product is really working great and she asked me to purchase a bigger bottle for her next time.</li>
            <li> I used this product for several months and received another bottle.  The serum works wonders for the skin...texture of my skin improved.... it&#x27;s does not burn or leave breakout on the face.  I would recommend this product to a friend.  Great Job!</li>
            <li> I have noticed a wonderful difference in my skin.  Great value and product! I have spent hundreds of dollars on serum&#x27;s and find this works better than the most expensive ones I have purchased.</li>
            <li> http://www.amazon.com/review/create-review/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_old_pipeline?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;asin&#x3D;B008CEDY5O&amp;channel&#x3D;ryp-force-old-pipeline&amp;forceOldPipeline&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used 2 bottles of the 180 Serum.  Morning and night, I smooth the Serum on my face, neck, upper chest and the back of my hands.  I have seen a marked difference, especially on the back of my hands.  I will continue to order and use this prodect.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t used consistently, unable to determine if it does what it says it does, although, I think it does if you think about the process.&lt;br /&gt;Delivered on time and as promised.</li>
            <li> After several days of use I saw no change or improvement in my skin.  I also used it on the back of one hand so I could compare.  No difference at all.  My hands are quite wrinkled compared to my face and it did not even temporarily improve the look of my skin.  Even hand lotion does that.&lt;br /&gt;  I get better results from using plain, old aloe vera gel.  Aloe vera gel moisturizes without oils; helps the makeup stay on in the summer.</li>
            <li> Great serum with high percentage of hyaluronic acid AND vitamin c!  I bought this serum to use after my glycolic peels...the perfect serum.</li>
            <li> After a couple of weeks of use, I see no difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Item as described, smooth transaction.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. spots and scars and everything else remained unchanged. Read the one star reviews. Don&#x27;t read the 5 stars</li>
            <li> So far I like this product, feels good on the skin.  My wife has been looking for something for her arms. This could be just what she is looking for.</li>
            <li> When I opened the padded envelope and the box of Ultima serum, the glass bottle was frozen and the bottom had popped off! I let the contents slowly defrost and transferred it to another container. I had to try it. When I used it on my face and around my eyes my skin felt so soft. I will use the rest of the serum, but I hope Ultima will replace the product.  I thought the volume of serum was more when I ordered it.  Under the circumstances, that would have been a bigger Ultima popsicle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My feedback about the FROZEN serum was actually read by the company rep. at expederm, and he emailed me to apologize.  He also promised a replacement bottle of serum that arrived Jan. 30th.  I just used it and can say the serum absorbed quickly and left my skin feeling so soft.  It takes time to see results from skin products, but so far this was seems great. It has no odor and is not sticky.  Makeup can go over it smoothly.  Products with Vitamin C and hyaluronic acid and other anti-aging ingredients are always expensive, so this is a great value at the reduced price from expederm on Amazon. I am very impressed with with the great customer care service I received.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT product!! Worked like a charm, from the very first try.  Absolutely fantastic serum! Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better one.  Five stars all the way...Thank you!</li>
            <li> This feels so great on my face.  Since using it my face feels silky soft and is starting to Brighten my complexion.  I will be ordering more soon.  A little does go long way.</li>
            <li> This skin care product is a must have!  Light and not greasy!  Leaves skin feeling fantastic!</li>
            <li> Not impressed with results. Just expected it to work better.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle of a solution.  Believe it or not, it is a SOLUTION for your skin. I know the contents seem to be a small amount, but it goes a long way.  One or two drops cover your whole face and neck. Put a drop or two on your finger and quickly apply it in circular motion [message] and WOW! I have been using it for a few weeks and no more crows feet, and laugh lines and other wrinkles or uneven skin problems are going- going.  Thank God that I bought this product. Just try it, your skin will love you for it. It is extremely wallet friendly when you consider what itdoes for your skin.</li>
            <li> Price for this size bottle is ridiculous. There are much better choice for comparable products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this 5 stars because I absolutely love the product, but there is one caveat, the size. The 0.5oz lasts me about 1 month so I&#x27;m constantly re-ordering. That being said, the product is so good that I AM constantly re-ordering. I&#x27;ll list the results I experienced in the order I saw them. I applied the product in both the morning and evening right after cleansing with a mildly exfoliating cleanser like Neutrogena Pore Minimizer and toner like Sea Breeze. When my skin was completely dry I put several dots of this serum on my cheeks, chin, forehead, neck and chest and had to work fast to rub them in because this stuff gets absorbed fast. It is thick and gel like and leaves no greasy residue. After about a week I noticed the pores on my cheeks and nose were less visible, as if the skin around them was plumped up. It took a few weeks longer to see a significant reduction in the crepe like skin under my eyes to go away. Next I had a few brown sun spots on my cheek that completely disappeared. And in the end my skin just has a far less blotchy appearance with a more even tone and firmer feel around the eyes. Even the dark spots at the corners of my mouth lightened up significantly. Now, full disclosure, I&#x27;m young and all my skin problems are due to way too much time spent sunbathing and partying in the sun on South Beach. So I&#x27;m not sure someone who has had these same issues for many years will have as complete and rapid results as I have, but I&#x27;m pretty sure if I had nearly perfect results most people will get some improvement to their skin tone and texture. I&#x27;m going to keep re-ordering for as long as they keep making it.&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 6/9/2010 I have since added a product containing retinol for even better results</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!! IM 70  plus 1  and  people don&#x27;t believe it ...LOL</li>
            <li> I loved it I mixed it into my nite cream and my skin felt good and it started to make my skin feel tight and it looked tighter and younger I like the way it made my skin look tighter</li>
            <li> It does what it says it does!!!</li>
            <li> I noticed no difference after using the small bottle...no improvement or change.  It could be that it simply didn&#x27;t work for my skin type...beauty products are like that.</li>
            <li> really see a difference!</li>
            <li> I like it but it is not very big for the cost. I do not see much of of difference. I have been using it foe three weeks.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that this would &amp;#34;really&amp;#34; work but I&#x27;ve only been using it for 7 days and can clearly see a difference. My fine lines around my eyes are smoother, the crease inbetween my eyebrows is much less noticeable, Overall my skin has a smoother look. My only complaint is that my skin is becoming very dry in some places but I&#x27;m hoping this is only temporary. I will be ordering again</li>
            <li> Evaporated too fast in bottle. Makes me question if it has too much H20.</li>
            <li> It feels lie water it doesnt seem like a good product...I Imagined it more thicker</li>
            <li> absorbs quickly, good product</li>
            <li> I love that fact that its not oily, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my fingers or face feeling oily. As for a decrease in wrinkles and lines, haven&#x27;t seen much difference.</li>
            <li> ok no problem.  It is that I hoped, I am going to use, if I like I am goin to buy soon.</li>
            <li> I am probably using too much of this. I&#x27;m on my second bottle and trying to go easy, but it makes my skin so soft. I think it&#x27;s improved the lines between my eyes most of all. I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
            <li> This product is ok, but there are better.  This product is watery and dries very fast on your skin.  Therefore, you need more.  It also has alcohol in it, which may explain why.  There is also no indication of what percentage of the liquid is pure Hyaluronic Acid.  I used this for 1 month, and I saw no results, so I switched to a different brand, which I like a lot better.</li>
            <li> Order came super fast, classy box for the serum, nice for gift giving, but I won&#x27;t be doing that.  I think this is a product that will be on my face regiment for many years to come at 59.  It glides on quick, then you apply some great moisturizers and this serum just absorbs in that moisturizer that you paid so much money for.  With the serum as a base, the moisturizer is able to absorb and do it&#x27;s benefits.  I look glowing and my turkey neck is in much better shape.  Try it, you&#x27;ve got everything to gain.</li>
            <li> not happy at all with this item. contents seemed seriously diluted&lt;br /&gt;The Ultima box was not sealed so that is a possibility.&lt;br /&gt;Not happy I have to return it now.</li>
            <li> This product works instantly and the bottle lasts a long time. It tightens up the skin and reduces fine lines. It is perfect for a special evening out because it tightens the skin instantly and keeps that look for several hours.</li>
            <li> The product was average thickness and went well onto my skin.  Once it dried, however, my skin felt \\&quot;tight\\&quot; rather than soft or smooth.  Maybe \\&quot;tight\\&quot; is the new \\&quot;lifted\\&quot; LOL!  Seriously, I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement so far, but it hasn&#x27;t made my skin worse either!  And the price wasn&#x27;t too bad just to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I find hyaluronic acid serum to be an indispensable part of my daily beauty routine.  It truly makes a very noticeable difference to my skin, so I will be a lifetime user of HA serum.  I like this version (180 Cosmetics Pure Swiss) the best of any I have tried so far.  It visibly reduces fine lines around my eyes.  It makes my skin softer than the other brands I have tried, and I love the texture of it... not just watery liquid (like most HA serums), but this one has a slightly more viscous texture, which is lovely.  It also makes it easier to dispense just the 2-3 drops I need for my entire face [one drop around my eyes, one or two for the rest of my face].  I&#x27;m not sure if the lovely texture and better results are due to the addition of Vitamin C (which supposedly has superb anti-aging properties) or something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is small (only 15 ml  which is 1/2 oz), however, since you only need a few drops per application, it lasts a surprisingly long time.  Also, I think the bottle is very well designed and elegant.  So, I do love this product, and I do think it is noticeably superior to other brands I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, this brand is significantly more expensive than the brand I was using previously.  Like four times as expensive.  For approximately the same price, you can buy a 2 oz (60 ml) bottle of Watts Beauty Hyaluronic Acid.  That is also an excellent product, and I had no complaints when using it.  It worked and did what it said it would.  However, Watts did not have the added vitamin C, which is supposed to be a powerful anti-aging and collagen producing ingredient, and the type of vitamin C that 180 Cosmetics uses is indeed the very best and most expensive type, which is the gentlest on the skin.  So I am torn between my thrifty side and my luxury loving side.  The Watts brand is much less expensive and it works.  The 180 Cosmetics brand is more luxurious, has vitamin C, and works even better.  You only need a few drops daily, so I currently use that to justify the extra expense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDITED TO ADD (6-7-15):&lt;br /&gt;I had to stop using this because I developed skin sensitivity and a rash on my eyelids.  When I stopped using this product and switched back to my previous brand of hyaluronic acid serum, the rash went away.  The only difference between the two brands as far as ingredients, is the Vitamin C, so I assume that it what my skin is reacting to.  To be fair, I have super sensitive skin (which is why I only use all natural products with no chemicals), so it is possible that others won&#x27;t have the same sensitivity I experienced.  I still think this is a great product, but only for people with skin less sensitive than mine.  I am taking off one star from my original rating.to justify the extra expense.

            <li> Feel 20 years younger now, and I am only 35</li>
            <li> Use this along with Argan Oil and Rose Hips oil and you have a perfect anti aging serum that is all natural.</li>
            <li> I love this serum!! Gives a glowing skin! I&#x27;ll purchase again next time ,! Transaction was fast!</li>
            <li> I like this product. I started using this the same day I began using the Microdermabrasion Exfoliator System (electric spinning face brush). I&#x27;m not really sure how this product works on it&#x27;s own the brush made my face feel so soft and clean, however, I use both this product and the brush everyday. My skin feels amazing! I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> This serum feels nice, but it really burned after microneedling with my derma roller and my skin reacted. My doctor recommended me NOT to use active serums right after microneedling since it can cause nodules under the skin. He gave me a recovery serum from Melanopeel made with argan oil which gave me better results. So this is a nice serum but didn&#x27;t work for me with microneedling</li>
            <li> To be fair - I have only used it for 3 days - but I can see some results already.  I really hope this will take care of that &amp;#34;waddle&amp;#34; under my chin!  I don&#x27;t mind my natural life-lines but the hard ones from stress and loose skin can stand a helping hand!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I could really see a big difference the first time. My face looked a lot smother.&lt;br /&gt;Keep up the good work!</li>
            <li> So far, am very pleased with product.  Feels wonderful on skin.  Hope my skin continues to improve......&lt;br /&gt;Will order again soon.</li>
            <li> love this product,  i use it under moisturizer, and think it really does help overall!!</li>
            <li> Very helpful and quick response time</li>
            <li> Sorry, this product does not work on my skin I tried it.  Unsuccessful. Do not like nor recommended. May work on other people.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my wife and it worked very well for her.  She was very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Tightens skin a bit immediately after use, but I don&#x27;t see a real difference in wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful serum and feels great on the skin.  It soaks in quickly, is not sticky and my skin feels hydrated. It feels like water on the skin - LOVE it and will continue to order it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: This product was sent to me for free for review, but all opinions 100% honest and unbiased</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK but I was allergic to it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something with Vitamin C and found this. I normally don&#x27;t write reviews but this product is great. It makes my skin smoother, brighter, and smaller pores. My last facial visit, the girl who does my facial monthly asked what I&#x27;m doing different because she can see my skin improved from last month. I almost done with the first bottle and I&#x27;m going to order more.</li>
            <li> Have not seen any improvement.  So far this product is not worth sending for.  Like many products  I just do not see the results !</li>
            <li> I appreciate the product and a very good source for beauty aide, but it is hard...to remember that I have to go back and put on a cream, to follow, because the serum is drying. Many is the day I forgot till later that evening.</li>
            <li> I really really love this product! It&#x27;s quick drying and doesn&#x27;t leave that gunky serum feel on my face. Plus it definitely helps keep my skin bouncy.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first based on such a small bottle and the price. I have ordered this product again, and must say that my skin in moisturized, feels amazing, and non greasy. It isnt a miracle serum but it does moisturize very well, and makes my skin look great.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied at all. Used product according to the directions and did not see results as advertising leads you to believe.&lt;br /&gt; Trivectin gave me results and I should have stayed with it. I tried to save money and all I did was waste it.</li>
            <li> Yelp this does work great.  Easy to use and smooths my skin nicely.  Will be using this on a regular basis</li>
            <li> Absorbs quick. Takes way more than a couple drops, I stream it on to my entire face with the dropper. Produced nice dewy results at first. Doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing a whole lot right now. Not disappointed though.</li>
            <li> the formula seems to work quite well. but it is a bit too pricey for me. They give so little per purchase.</li>
            <li> I choose this because the boxes the product came in were crushed.&lt;br /&gt;The one i opened to use dropper was cracked...and i had to dispose of it i was afraid what may have leaked into the product.&lt;br /&gt;I use this in my spa on clients....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about a week, but my face feels smooth and moisturized without being oily because I tend to have oily skin.  I can already tell that my skin is a little more toned too.  I&#x27;m excited to see the long term results of using this product.</li>
            <li> Tried this product in Feb 2015 , and did not see any impact. Since there were so many good reviews, I decided to try it again. Maybe it&#x27;s just my skin type, but I can definitely say the product has no impact on the aspect of my skin. One thing I can confirm though, it does get absorbed extremely fast, as per the other reviews. One bottle lasts me 3, 3.5 weeks when used morning and evening. I ordered two bottles this time, just to see if using it for more than a month would make a difference. I will post updates in case my opinion on the product changes.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s helping, but as with most facial products I&#x27;m not sure if the effects are significant</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference.unfortunately!</li>
            <li> I was given this serum and totally loved the way it made my face feel so soft, when I ran out I ordered more.  I applied it morning and night, make up goes on smoothly over it.  Great Product.</li>
            <li> I would give this ten stars if I could. It is my favorite moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Great feeling serum!  The product was recommended to me by a friend and I did some research before buying.  This one has all the components I wanted and in the serum, no creams for me - too heavy.  The Ultima goes on nicely and absorbs well, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It makes my skin feel awesome. I love the light scent and the way it does not make my face feel oily.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think there is a cream or lotion what could bring my youth back, but when I heard about hyalironic acid, I decided to try and got hooked. This is my 3rd bottle. I use it morning and evening under my daily lotion (I use Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder now) and I am taking daily collagen.&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure which one worked, but I feel that my skin became more springy. I contributed that to hyalironic acid. My skin is very sensitive, but I didn&#x27;t notice any rashes recently. I feel that my skin just sucks this serum in.&lt;br /&gt;It is pretty cheap and lasts me about a month.&lt;br /&gt;So far so good</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using the product long enough to tell if it is making a difference in the appearance of my skin. I am not a big fan of the slightly weird smell it has when I apply it. I like the dropper, but it turns into foamy bubbles and I am not sure if I am applying enough. I have let it dry before applying my face lotion and I am hoping this will help the serum work better. I will continue finish the bottle and hope to see results in the end.</li>
            <li> I DID LIKE THE SERUM DIDN&#x27;T LAST TWO WEEKS GUESS I USED TO MUCH EACH NIGHT BUT I LIKED THE&lt;br /&gt;FEEL OF TIGHTNESS AFTER USE.</li>
            <li> While not cheap, this product serves me well as I have no laugh lines.  I am not sure how long it will last but it certainly did work to erase them.</li>
            <li> I used it after one week, I felt the difference,my skin being more smooth. l&#x27;m going to  recommend to my friends. l love it!</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. I&#x27;ve used other Hyaluronic acid formulas before, this one had a lot of hype, and a pretty bottle. I really don&#x27;t see any difference between this and the other hyaluronic acid I&#x27;ve bought from other manufacturers which cost a fraction of the price. The bottle only contains .5 ounces, I can get 2 ounces of this stuff for the same price, there was no difference in this and the other formulas I&#x27;ve used, so no repeat business from me for this product.</li>
            <li> I like the product but not the packaging.  I had a problem with the rubber dropper.  After a few weeks, the white cover rubber dropper was misaligned and I could hardly close the bottle.  After using it a few times, the rubber dropper came off and I had to fix it.</li>
            <li> Pleased with this product although I have been using it a few weeks. Hopefully my skin will continue to improve.</li>
            <li> Good product, good price. Has not worked miracles yet, but who knows.</li>
            <li> I felt the results immediately. Now that I have been using the product for three weeks -I can see improvement in my skin texture. My skin is soft with fewer wrinkles, and my pores are much smaller.</li>
            <li> This product was ok I didn&#x27;t really see that much of a difference, but it was nice because after you put it on it tighten up your face so that&#x27;s was nice. It did not get rid of my dark spots. I would buy it again if the cost was low but for the price plus shipping NO! You do need to be careful about going in the sun with no protection I completely forgot I put it on and my face was bright red.</li>
            <li> Really works great after derma rolling my face, though it really would turn your face really red when you applied it but you could feel it stretched and numbed your face a bit. I love it and would definitely order it again!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and I have seen a difference in my skin. It is nice to get compliments that I have a glow.</li>
            <li> My skin is noticeably smoother and it happened very quickly.  I was using another brand of hyaluronic acid/vitamin C product and while I did see improvement with that one, the 180 Ultima formula is superior.</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better!  Small wrinkles are diminished and my skin tone is clear and even.  Thank  you.</li>
            <li> I have been using this hyaluronic acid serum just a short time.  I do like the way it glides over my face, however I enjoy using a product that leaves the skin feeling moist.  This serum does not.  I think I will need to use the serum for several weeks before I can tell if it is effective</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before; this was my second order and I like the way it makes the skin on my face and neck feel soft.</li>
            <li> The bottle was not full. A consumer expects a filled bottle. This was 3/4 full.  I purchased a never opened item. I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have purchased products priced from $75-$350 .5oz none of which compare to this serum.&lt;br /&gt;Immediately after putting on my forehead I could feel the area tighter.  No I am not paid I am being honest.&lt;br /&gt;I text my friend she ordered a bottle and felt the same way.  Will be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT.  Love it… great product.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week and can already see a big difference.</li>
            <li> I love the bottle, and I pour my other serum from Cosmedica Skincare into the now empty container, because I like the color of the bottle, but let me say here that although I liked this Pure Swiss serum, it&#x27;s way more expensive then the Cosmedica brand, so that I will not be buying it any to soon, unless Ultima Pure Swiss lower its price; but to those of you that wish to spend the money go for it, it feels nice on the skin, and the bottle is pretty.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well for a pre-moisturizer for face as a &#x27;filler&#x27;-if you will. Have only been using about a week.  Not sure of the outcome yet, but I do like the feel of it.</li>
            <li> Feels really silky on my skin.  Have only been using it for a short time but I love how soft it makes my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this my skin is very sensitive  I did not have any problem with this product</li>
            <li> Delivered on a timely manner. It is too early to tell how effective it is. I haven&#x27;t noticed any skin irritation.  Although I have only been using once a day or every other, alternating with other products.  Consistency is like that of aloe vera. Slightly thick but it dries  quickly.</li>
            <li> I chose this serum for several reasons, 1. The price was great considering it was 80% off 2. it was just the right amount to get me the free shipping on the other product I was purchasing. All in all, I have used it regularly and have noticed a small difference on overall quality of skin. I have not noticed any &amp;#34;lifting&amp;#34; effect at all. Granted I have only had this for a couple of weeks, and I am just now 40 and starting to notice some sagging around my eyes due to high cheek bones. It&#x27;s possible you just can&#x27;t escape genetics... Most people claim I look 35 anyway, so maybe I&#x27;m a bit premature with all of this.</li>
            <li> Just beginning to use this product and so far loving the affect on my skin. Would recommend this product because of price and ease of application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a few weeks and I can see changes on my face.The dark spots are  beginning to lighten up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been a couple weeks - seems and feels like it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job, and the price and fast shipping are a real plus!</li>
            <li> I am using this product in my facials.  I am an Aesthetician, and I have used literally, numerous, serums, anti-wrinkle products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is very effective, and I have had only success using this with my clients!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful product for my sensitive skin.  It goes on smoothly, without redness, and my skin has a nice glow as a result of it.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the glass bottle broke, so I was only able to get 3 days use out of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used almost a bottle of this Serum and just yesterday a friend asked what I&#x27;d been doing since I looked 10 years younger!! I&#x27;m 74 so that is an amazing endorsement of this product!&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m on my second bottle and I plan to keep using this product.</li>
            <li> I Iike this product. It&#x27;s thicker than the previous one I was using, not sure it works any better.  But a lot of the anti wrinkle products have hyaluronic acid.  Wear it all the time in conjunction with a moisturizer!  I feel like it&#x27;s helping the wrinkle war.</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works, it isn&#x27;t greasy and it really does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth the money and works even BETTER when used with a micro needles roller or a microdermibrasion buffer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it!</li>
            <li> If nothing else it makes me feel like I look better. I like the way my skin feels. And value priced too. Wow!</li>
            <li> Seems to be a good product. Worried that small size wouldn&#x27;t last but a little bit goes a long way,</li>
            <li> My skin looks my better. More smooth and more even.&lt;br /&gt;I think it works. I moved from creams to serums.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife, here is her review:&lt;br /&gt;I loved the product the first time I ordered it. However, when I ordered it the second time it came 1/3 full, bottle was scratched and leaking. Disappointed, I returned it.</li>
            <li> I want more....I love this stuff.  It virtually erases years after a few days of use.  After a very difficult couple of years, with my sleep disturbed nightly, I have been told that I look refreshed and invigorated for the first time in months.  they all want to know my secret...should I share?  lol  of course,</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about two weeks and not one single change that I or anyone else can see but only time will tell.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t tell the difference....but will keep on during .it might take a minute.....lol.it does feel good and great make-up base.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about two weeks now, and have not seen any noticable improvement on my face. I will stick to Walgreens for my face products because I can get the same comparable item (cheaper) and no shipping fees. I really was hoping this was going to work, but ended up very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Liked what was left in the bottle, I see the difference absolutely....however, almost all had drained out of the very loose cap.  I have ordered another bottle, hoping it will be full.  Amazon refunded me for the total cost, which I appreciated as it was virtually empty, but the tiny bit I used has prompted hope!  Looking forward to more of a good thing.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good so far, noticing a difference.... nothing works over night, but i see a change.. been a few weeks..... i would recommend....</li>
            <li> Good value for the money.  Arrived quickly and as described</li>
            <li> This is stuff is garbage. I mean G.a.r.b.a.g.e. As far as I am concern is not real authentic stuff. It&#x27;s watery and doesn&#x27;t do anything for your face. NONE! Please save your money and look something that&#x27;s been around for awhile with good reputation. I literally threw this stuff after a while cause I was worried what it actually contained. Who knows what they putting in these jars anymore!! Be careful what you purchase online these days.</li>
            <li> After much research I decided to try this product. I was pleasantly surprised that it lightened age spots on my face. All over-the-counter products at local department stores claiming to lighten age spots did nothing, not even a little. I will order again. Very light feel. Absorbs quickly. No unpleasant scent. Not tacky to the touch after application. Give it a try.</li>
            <li> When I buy serum I am always afraid that it will not give enough moist to my skin,&lt;br /&gt;but this was really good, it did not gave me the cake feeling on the face.</li>
            <li> It does make my skin feel good but I had tried another brand that had more of a tightening property to it and I miss that but it didn&#x27;t have vitamin C in it and I like this product for that reason.</li>
            <li> Its kinda too soon to see the results. But I would have to say I saw a little improvement, not sure if it&#x27;s this solution or the derma roller I tried with it. They sell together thou. And if it&#x27;s one or the other. My face is a little tighter then usual.</li>
            <li> cakificacion chose this on the grounds that the product is of excellent quality and is fully satisfied with it so would recommend to everyone</li>
            <li> After trying many products, I found this to work similarily as others.  I have not noticed any difference in my skin.  I will continue to use and perhaps revisit my comments if any change is seen in terms of skin improvement.</li>
            <li> Well, I have not seen any change, yet, but I do wish, as with some products there is a positive glow or feeling with your skin right away.  I was hoping for some noticeable tightening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, suggestions on which product to use first and whether or not to alternate or one in am, pm...and so on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> I could see the result after a few days. Definitely will buy again (bigger size) and I would recommend this product to all of my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find this any better or worse than other product I&#x27;ve used. There were no noticiable imorovements. It was a let down.</li>
            <li> I had heard this is a great product so I thought I would give it a try. Seems to tighten the skin slightly which I expected. I have only used this for two days so have not seen results yet. It shipped promptly and recieved on time.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product. I have been using it for approx. 3 weeks and have noticed-less wrinkles! Yeah! It isn&#x27;t a dramatic change-but you and others will notice a difference after a short time! I am sure by using it a few more weeks-there will be an even more noticeable difference.  There are so many products out there that is so hard to decide! This one I will continue using faithfully-I love it! Terri</li>
            <li> This serum absorbs  right on contact and makes skin fell great. It is a small bottle  but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The product started out feeling great. But,after a couple of weeks of use, it makes me itch and seems to dry out areas on my face.,</li>
            <li> I purchased 3 different serums and have been trying all if them for the past few weeks.  This one is by far the best!  Will definitely buy more!</li>
            <li> Have been using the product for about 2 weeks, so it&#x27;s probably too soon to see results. A little goes a long way. Nice light serum, not sticky and fragrance free. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I like the addition of vitamin C&lt;br /&gt;It is well packed and delivers ...&lt;br /&gt;I use it with the micro needle roller.</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and I&#x27;m very satisfied because it&#x27;s absorbs well and won&#x27;t leave your face cakey like some products I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;m waiting to see the final result  but for now, I&#x27;m satisfied. I just only wish the  bottle was a little larger.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a moisturizer that would last more than an hour or two and thought I&#x27;d try this as I heard hyaluronic acid was a great moisturizer.  It certainly is a great moisturizer but I was also amazed to find that my crow&#x27;s feet almost disappeared too.  This serum goes a long way and it should be considered a base pre-moisturizer which you will then apply your normal moisturizer on top of which will make this stuff last longer as it isn&#x27;t cheap but it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This works really well, particularly when used with one of those little sip key roller things. I&#x27;m using it primarily for age spots and I&#x27;m quite happy with it.</li>
            <li> I like it - it&#x27;s okay.  I have not used it enough to tell anything miraculous about my skin really.</li>
            <li> I got this product for my mother and she used it for a month and she stated that her crows feet are almost gone! People have been commenting on the difference her face looks!! They are telling her she looks so much younger and her skin is looking so youthful!! SHe has asked me to purchase her another bottle so when this one runs out she will have a back up! SHe also stated it does not take much at each use!!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used product enough to see long term effects.  Overnight results are unrealistic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using the Swiss serum every day on my face and neck;  Been using about two months; ordered two bottles last time so I won&#x27;t run out.  It feels wonderful on my face and neck and just have to trust it&#x27;s helping with skin renewal.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I use only a drop under each eye another drop on each cheek.&lt;br /&gt;It smooths the skin and pumps up the fine lines.  It is incredible and a good value&lt;br /&gt;I so recommend this product.  It is amazing.</li>
            <li> After only using one body I have seen a huge difference in the diminished appearance of fine lines around my lips/ mouth. I will continue to use this as a part of my skin care routine. Most of all I love the price!!</li>
            <li> I Love it... I will keep using it. It is not oily and soaks into the skin quickly. Wears well under makeup</li>
            <li> I love this product in the short time I have been using it, I am noticing a big difference.. I saw a friend the other day that I hadn&#x27;t seen in 2 weeks and she asked me what work I had done!!!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product,  I use it every day.  I think it is making a difference in my skin</li>
            <li> Disliked the product because it made my skin feel dry.  Seen no results from use.  Will not buy product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a week or so but I really like it so far.  My skin feels really smooth and soft.  I couldn&#x27;t really say wrinkles have disappeared but I can say that my skin definitely looks clear, hydrated, soft and smooth.  But as I said I&#x27;ve only been using it for one week.</li>
            <li> I like the texture of the serum and you do not need much. It spreads a long way. I will most likely buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is an easy to use serum and I can see the results immediately but they don&#x27;t last long.  I am hoping I might get some longer  lasting improvement if I contiue to use it so have ordered more. I am not looking for a miracle just for a visible improvement that will last a while.  It is very inexpensive for a small bottle.</li>
            <li> I use Ultima Pure Swiss Hyaluronic Acid after using the 1.0 mm derma roller.  After using the roller, I use witch hazel as an astringent, then the Ultima Pure Swiss.  It goes on smooth and is very soothing. I just put a few drops on my palm and dab it on my crows feet and other crucial facial areas, I follow this by a moisturizer.  I do this 3x a week and am seeing a difference in skin texture.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 bottles.  I am half way through the first and my skin looks better.  I live in Florida and had a bunch of dark spots on my face.  They are now almost gone.  It was delivered quickly and was a very good price.  I am very satisfied</li>
            <li> I found the more I used it the more I got wrinkles.  Not what I was looking for. Seemed to dry out my skin and no amount of lotion could correct it.  Stopped using after 1 week.  It was cost prohibitive return due to cost and shipping and handling fees and then to pay return shipping.</li>
            <li> I was completely satisfied with this product.  I will be purchasing more in the future.  I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> highly recommend awesome for my 57 year old skin ...everyone comments how good my skin looks!! Feels softer and smoother and works well with my other makeup.....not sticky or overly oily......just right...great product</li>
            <li> this was nice i did love it the bottle was much to small more like a sampler than a purchase</li>
            <li> I use this at night for a lighter coverage. Would totally recommend for someone who dislikes the heavy, smelly cream usually worn at night.</li>
            <li> I got this a month ago, a few time s it gave me a burn as was put on too thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am starting to see small results, I will keep it up.  :)</li>
            <li> I was waiting some change in my face.  The small wrinkles are still there.  I have not noticed any change.  I&#x27;m using it for 3 weeks.  Maybe I need  another Hyaluronic Acid but I dont  think I will buy another.</li>
            <li> Love it for the first time in a while my skin glows:) Will definitely get another bottle when I finish this 1.</li>
            <li> Do your research!! Ultima 2 (Revlon) withdrew from market in 2001(USA) and 2008(Europe). If the price sounds too good to be true, it is.</li>
            <li> I ordered two Forte and two regular Ultima Swiss  and one of each arrived DOA.&lt;br /&gt;It is possible that the product was also frozen or mishandled in some other manner, as the serums have a grainy quality that I doubt is a part of the original design.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this. It felt good going on but it didn&#x27;t seem to last very long and I didn&#x27;t notice much difference. I like my usual Vitamin C serum from Irene Gari better.</li>
            <li> Using this as directed for two months with  no real fantastic results. Will keep using it just because I spent the money.&lt;br /&gt;When it&#x27;s gone I won&#x27;t re-order.</li>
            <li> I like product, you can feel it working..  It is easy to use. . .I like that you can use face creams .</li>
            <li> Unbelievable the change on the face  after 2 times, I am ordering another one. Love that product, you will too</li>
            <li> I really like this product and I am seeing some results even though I haven&#x27;t been using it very long.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any result</li>
            <li> I am still looking for a better product l didn&#x27;t like the alcohol content in this product I would have preferred more of the vitamin C and hyaluronic acid.  no significant change in appearance.</li>
            <li> very easy to be asorbed by skin. very good.</li>
            <li> I purchased 180 Cosmetics Ultima Pure Swiss, Hyaluronic Acid Serum + Vitamin C  for use after using the Derma Roller and the Dermapen. This is a great serum and is fully absorbed after the procedure. It is not oily, and a great value. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> This Serum is a wonderful first step to your moisturizing regimen.  It makes a freshly cleansed face feel wonderful.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Use sparingly there isn&#x27;t a lot of product but it works.</li>
            <li> Thanks. Great product.</li>
            <li> I  have only been using this product for about a week. I can&#x27;t believe how much better my skin looks already&lt;br /&gt;Will keep bying</li>
            <li> Poor packaging!! Bottle was half full when I got it. The serum had leaked out. I&#x27;ve only used it about 2 weeks so I don&#x27;t see a difference yet but as it stands now I wouldn&#x27;t reorder. We will see how it goes after I finish my half bottle.</li>
            <li> Bought for my mom and she really likes it. She&#x27;s been using it for a couple of weeks now and is certain that some of her age lines have lessened and skin texture improved. She&#x27;s ordering more as I write this! A small amount goes a long way. I&#x27;m using it as well and like it enough to purchase more!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much change in my wrinkles on my face.  I plan to order some more and see if it just takes time to work</li>
            <li> I needed something to finalize my anti-wrinkle regime.  I use the Hyaluronic Serum after a derma roller.  And I&#x27;m seeing subtle results.  Takes a little time, but time it what got me here in the first place!  Will definitely be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Lines that were looking better with another similar product have now returned within 2 wks.  Won&#x27;t purchase again next time</li>
            <li> 180 Cosmetics Pure Swiss, Hyaluronic Acid Serum + Vitamin C (Ultima) does not appear to work. The claims seem to be overstated. It is overpriced for such a small amount and there is so little one can hardly have enough to try for 30 days. Using just a drop twice a day, it runs out before 30 days and if you want to give it a longer try, you have to order again.</li>
            <li> I just try to use . I hope it is good , no allergic reaction . I recommended it to buy</li>
            <li> to smal,just  received,have  to  see  result  in future  use--very  small  amount  to  work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this has helped my skin...it hasn&#x27;t hurt.  I haven&#x27;t used lately because I went to prescription Retin A.</li>
            <li> After 1 week  of using this product I didn&#x27;t want to be without so I ordered 2 more bottles!  The best product I have used ( and I  have tried many )</li>
            <li> This helped with my skin texture - my skin feels smoother and softer. I used it as directed, under a moisturizer. It&#x27;s not a miracle, but I think it did help with small wrinkles (crowsfeet) and texture. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have used this product over a two-week period and have seen a difference.  I use it as a base and then use a moisturizer. I would recommend it to start with.</li>
            <li> I just started using the second bottle and so far I can see an improvement, seems to diminish the fine lines.</li>
            <li> Really like the feel of my skin after using this for 3 weeks now, night and day. Don&#x27;t need much so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It is a very good product. I had tried another brand first it did not perform as well as the Swiss.&lt;br /&gt;I re-ordered the Swiss Formula because i got better and quicker results. This is not an overnight thing. In the course of about two months I have seen my pores shrinking, especially on my nose, which has been problematic since puberty.&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;11&#x27;s&amp;#34; had definitely softened. (Thats those furrows between your brows)&lt;br /&gt;Overall my face is getting a heathier look and glow. I&#x27;ve used the formula on my neck and chest. At first my skin reacted with dome raised pores that emptied quickly and easily. I took that to be the healing phase because now my neck skin is softer and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to the improvements more prolonged use will bring!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin very soft and is now starting to plump up the fine lines I have (after a month of using)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference but I never see any difference with any wrinkle cream that I use the only good thing is it goes on very easily so you don&#x27;t have to pull on your skin and I like that part.</li>
            <li> For this price a great product!  My skin is looking smoother and radient.  Have already decided to purchase again!  Love it.</li>
            <li> After a year of extreme trauma, I didn&#x27;t want to look in the mirror and be reminded of the toll everything had taken on me.  I began researching the best products for repairing and renewing skin.  There are a lot of much more expensive products out there, but this serum actually works better than any I tried.  I&#x27;m extremely happy with this product, and already look about 8 years younger, though I&#x27;ve only used it for about 2 weeks.  Highly recommend and will be buying this product as long as the makers keep it available.</li>
            <li> I have been searching to find what ingredients are really good for  the skin. After doing some research I found the ingredients for what&#x27;s in this little bottle. I have used this faithfully everyday along with my dermaroller and I could not be happier with the results. My skin is so quenched and it looks and feels great. Will be ordering more very soon!! Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> So far item feel good on the skin, will have to use for a longer time to give a five star.</li>
            <li> Looking for helpful information. Click below I am glad I did! Take the first step to feeling younger!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;a href&#x3D;\\&quot;http://a439fncg5kmtilbe-gix9lfk85.hop.clickbank.net/?tid&#x3D;SLEBRON007\\&quot; target&#x3D;\\&quot;_top\\&quot;&gt;Click Here!&amp;lt;/a&gt;</li>
            <li> This product makes your skin feel terrific and other products glide on easily and smoothly afterwards.</li>
            <li> I just product a few days ago.  I haven&#x27;t seen any changes yet except it causes my skin to be extra oily&lt;br /&gt;I will give product a little more time</li>
            <li> I really like it a lot. The price is excellent &amp; it works very well. I definitely would recommend it to one &amp; all !</li>
            <li> Noticeable difference to skin tone, absorbs quickly.  Leave my skin feeling pampered and ready for my daily cream.  Definitely would recommend to people - just wish I had started using it sooner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still early but I have noticed improvement to my skin. Fewer dry spots and skin feels tighter.  I&#x27;ll keep at it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product at night only, Do I see a difference you asked? I&#x27;m not sure yet. because I do not look my age. I am 52, but neighbors, friends and even the employees at the perfume counters at Belk&#x27;s department store always ask me what Cinique or Lancôme products do I use. I don&#x27;t use any of them or ones you can buy at your local drug stores, like oil of Olay, or similar products. I get told I look between 35 and 38 all the time. I decided to try your product  because of the vitamin C that absorbs through the skin and not taken internally. I make my own creams, lotions, soap, bath oils and sugar and salt scrubs. It&#x27;s all natural made with essential oils. Please don&#x27;t take this as a iffy product or unlike remark about your product because this is not what I&#x27;m doing. But, my skin is softer and has helped make my pores look smaller. I don&#x27;t have wrinkles at all. No crows feet but my skin on my face feels softer. E-mail me again in a month. I&#x27;ll let you know if I look thirty. I also don&#x27;t go out in the sun, due to photo sensitive medication. So a rating I would say give me a full month. like I said it makes my skin feel softer than it was. so far so good! So for right now I have to say It&#x27;s okay because I am not done using it. like I said give me a month and E-mail me again. Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> So far very good and can see a difference after less than 2 vials.  Will continue to order it.  I am 68 yrs. old and my skin is fine and sensitive and this product has been great!</li>
            <li> makes the skin feel grear</li>
            <li> Excellent product! My skin texture is soft and the fine lines are disappearing after two weeks of using it.</li>
            <li> I am a 40 year old Hispanic female and I have been battling for a year with a change in hormones which has left me with skin which seems unable to be quenched.  This left me with dull, aged looking skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for one week and at it astounding that after 2 days I could already see the increased moisture in my skin.  This is an amazing product, my skin looks great and I am hooked!!!</li>
            <li> I love it. It makes my skin feel smooth. It is easy to be absorbed. I definitely recommend it to you.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t feel my skin tightening as soon as I apply the serum.  I am very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> My Skin feels smoother.  I&#x27;ve been using the product for several days now. I am going to buy another bottle for myself and one for my mother.  This is a fantastic deal.  Bottle could be bigger, but for the price you cannot go wrong</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference and felt like I needed to use a moisturizer and eye cream with it.</li>
            <li> I first tried this serum when I saw a Dr. Oz show and it recommended using a hyaluronic acid serum with vitamin C and I love it, but didn&#x27;t really like the price.  I tried a cheaper brand and it didn&#x27;t make my skin as smooth, so I went back to this one.  This one is a keeper!</li>
            <li> I  am very pleased with the improvements I see with Ultima Swiss.  I have had many may compliments on the smoothness and glow it promotes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also  appreciate it&#x27;s very reasonable cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tim&lt;br /&gt;San Diego, CA</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s only water inside this bottle. I didn&#x27;t see any difference good or bad , I used it as indicated but not results</li>
            <li> Only been 5 days, can see an improvement in texture. . .know it will take some time to see a youthful dew/tightness to skin,  Try it.</li>
            <li> one of a few that actually is absorbs into the dermal layer!! it creates results in 3 weeks!! Younger, firmer, and new!!</li>
            <li> Not exactly the best hyaluronic acid out there.</li>
            <li> I actually needed more than 2-3 drops to really get all over my face AND the dropper only goes about 1/3 down into the bottle: while this may allow for extra product room, its really difficult to tilt the bottle and see if the dropper is picking stuff up.</li>
            <li> I seldom like to review products. Well you can call me lazy.&lt;br /&gt;But this one is really a good product, so i have to do it.&lt;br /&gt;i have oily skin and breakout often at the age of 40.&lt;br /&gt;after used for about 3 weeks, my skin is smooth, clear and  firm.&lt;br /&gt;I strip 1 star for its tiny volume.</li>
            <li> Seems to work okay, but nothing beats Dr. perricone nueropeptide.</li>
            <li> This serum is really wonderful!  The freckles I had have basically disappeared.  I waited to review this until I was sure of how this product affected my skin.  It feels silkier, lighter in color and even.  My skin feels nourished and I am wearing less makeup and cover up.</li>
            <li> Fantastic Product!  Would not want to be without it.  See the difference with first time use.&lt;br /&gt;Its not greasy or heavy just goes right into your skin and makes it look smooth and soft yet firm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend! 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I have received this product twice,  first time one of them was almost empty!!! But the rest are ok. I thought it might be just unfortunate. I fould another good deal on this product with some other things so I oredered one more time. The bottle is almost empty again when I got it!!!! I dont recommend anyone to order.  Plus smell is not that lovely!!!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptic when I purchased this, but I figured, why not - it&#x27;s worth a shot, and 2 months before my wedding, I was willing to try just about anything within reason - and by &amp;#34;within reason&amp;#34; I meant cheap. I really like how it goes on nice and smooth, and i don&#x27;t feel like I need moisturizer after I put it on. I do actually think it has helped with some wrinkles (for reference i&#x27;m 34 and they are all starting to come out of the woodwork) though that being said, I do use other products on a regular basis. All in all, I&#x27;m going to purchase again. The bottle lasted me almost 3 months, so I&#x27;m really pleased with that, which is why i think it&#x27;s definitely worth purchasing again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the way it feels&lt;br /&gt;Pretty sure there has been improvement in my skin/wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;No negatives&lt;br /&gt;Cost effective when you consider for me it averaged out to $4-$5/month for a decent skincare product.</li>
            <li> Just a few drops covers your whole face, with no sticky or greasy feel. I will keep using with the derma roller.</li>
            <li> nothing change after i finish the bottle so will not buy again. will not recommend to friends and family ever.</li>
            <li> It worked okay, but it seemed to dry my skin out. I need more of a moisturizing product. I love the anti aging. But not satisfied.</li>
            <li> This product is great with a great price!  I am allergic to almost everything, but I have no adverse reactions to this.  It reduced the bags under my eyes immediately.  This is my second purchase and I loved it so much, I bought an extra bottle as a gift.</li>
            <li> I amusing this with accumulation of another skin products.  I feel it is helping in the firming of my skin as I am in the  50&#x27;s and starting to loose firmness.  also I have some age spots from sun damage that it is helping in fading.</li>
            <li> I love the product, was somewhat disappointed when I received it as the product had leaked through the top, around the soft part of the applicator. Bottle was half empty. I will order the product again as it is a good product I would just caution that caps are checked for leaking and tight before shipping.</li>
            <li> I just put in my face once a day, and it feels nice. I need to use a longer time to see more the properties.</li>
            <li> So far I believe this product really works. I ordered more and will see if more skin improvement. So far I really like it.</li>
            <li> It is what I need for summer. It will make my face less oily and dark.</li>
            <li> SO FAR I LIKE IT. IT GOT HERE IN 2 DAYS .. WOW. AFTER A FEW WEEKS I WILL KNOW WHAT I THINK OF IT.</li>
            <li> This seems to really work. I am pushing 70 and saw visible results and have ordered my second bottle. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I ordered two bottles, and one of them when i open the box, seeing that the cap of the bottle was not proper closed (tilted), and there are some gel like stuff around, only half of the content was still in side the bottle. I know, it could happen, BUT I could not get a replacement, I can only return this one, which means for this $16 I have to print out a return tag and package it, and drive 20 minutes to the UPS. What a bother! Buying online definitely wanted save time, ehhh!!</li>
            <li> I love this product, only compliant is that the bottle broke when knocked over (not very hard or fast) on countertop in bathroom.  Very sad but saved it by quickly putting it in a heavier glass short container. :) thanks!</li>
            <li> I ordered this and when it arrived I was surprised that the package seemed light.  It was an empty bottle, with too little to draw into the eye dropper.  I have no idea if it was good or bad since I couldn&#x27;t try it.  The package had an extra label on it that said it was &amp;#34;NEW&amp;#34;.  Amazon was great about the return.</li>
            <li> seems to help, and leaves skin feeling soft and silky.... I have nothing else to say..do not like being told how many words to write! Dumb</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Waiting for results.  Skin already feels better. Should know more after a weeks use.  Have only had for a day but it is easy to do.</li>
            <li> Have only use the product (180 Ultima Pure Swiss Hyaluronic Acid Serum with Vit.C,Anti-Aging) for one week twice a day as directed,&lt;br /&gt;have not notice any real improvement yet.. However, I like the way the product goes on and seems to be absorbed well. I feel it needs&lt;br /&gt;a few more weeks to notice any real improvement in my skin.  I am a 69 year old female with fairly good skin (thanks Mom) so I will&lt;br /&gt;update after a month or so.  Want to give the product a fair chance.</li>
            <li> The bottle was not completely filled.  It was approximately one-forth filled.  It only lasted my wife four days.  My wife was pleased with the results in only four days.  I will probably order the product again, as it was just one of those mistakes that happen in all  businesses from time to time.</li>
            <li> this product was a Christmas gift. She was pleased with it and has been using it. She has no complaints.</li>
            <li> I have been using for the past two weeks.  I like the feel of my skin after applying.  I don&#x27;t know if I have seen any major changes as yet, but will keep using.  I like the cost factor...feel I am getting my moneys worth with this product....I read that what we need to use on our skin is a good Vit. C product and sun screen...and a good moisturizer.  I agree.  I have a lot of sun and aging damage to my skin...so it might take a while to see a lot of changes but I feel that using this product will help prevent more damage.</li>
            <li> I use this after washing my face and then apply St Ives Collagen Elastin Moisturizer. The two work really well together</li>
            <li> when i first recieved this item i was dissapointed, the seal was broken, and it wasnt a full bottle. I contacted the seller and they immediately sent a new one, no questions asked. I appreciate the prompt service! the product itself seems to brightenand tighten  my skin , but i have only been using it for a month- so its hard to tell yet. its not nearly as pricey as other items that are similar, so all in all i am quite happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Purchase was fine, but have not used product enough to know how effective it is. It arrived in good condition.</li>
            <li> I think I noticed a change the first day I used the product.  It has been about a week now and I am delighted.  My skin seems more more even toned with less lines.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read by the reviews and thought I&#x27;d try it, it works well for softening skin but I haven&#x27;t use it for long to notice any changes in wrinkles yet .</li>
            <li> I like the product , quick delivery</li>
            <li> I have tried many facial serums and this one in particular is one of my favorites! I love the combo of Hyaluronic+Vitamin C. Both equally beneficial to my skin&#x27;s hydration and turning back the inevitable aging clock! I have already noticed that the fine lines around my eyes aren&#x27;t as visible and my skins texture is smoother.  I have even gotten a few comments on how great my skin looks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My order was shipped out immediately and at my door step in the matter of days. So quick! Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> My skin was too sensitive for this!  It made me itch and peel!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make any difference. Us women are always looking for that magic cure for the aging process and other than cosmetic surgery creams and potions will not work</li>
            <li> MAKES MY  SKIN LOOK YOUNGER AND IT GLIDES INTO  THE SKIN EASILY. HAS A GREAT SMELL. ONLY WISH IT WERE A LITTLE CHEAPER, ALTOUGH A LITTLE DOES GO A LONG WAY.</li>
            <li> This really works and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it. Have tried a lot of expensive products which was a waste of money and time. This is my second bottle and worth every penny. Goes on wet but soaks in within a minute or so leaving your skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I did not pay much for this product, and was warned by another review that &amp;#34;if it looked too good to be true, it probably was.&amp;#34; Well, I LOVE this stuff! I do not necessarily want to pay $85 for the small bottle, which is MRSP, but for about $20, I think it is fabulous! After using it for just three days, I could definitely see a difference in the fine lines around my eyes. I will purchase this again for sure!</li>
            <li> I like the serum.  It seems to be working well.  My skin is healing not just getting moisturized.  The only issue was my bottle was a little crusty when I opened it.  I don&#x27;t know if it had been used.  I get tired of returning things so I decided to keep it anyway.</li>
            <li> Did see noticable changes. I would buy this product again and would also recommend it to a friend. Money well spent.</li>
            <li> I have just started using this product and so far so good.  It leaves my skin with a nice glow and it doesn&#x27;t feel oily.</li>
            <li> The product arrived as scheduled, but it does nothing. The smell is not at all pleasant and the texture is thin. Didn&#x27;t seem to moisturise</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. I&#x27;ve used other stuff before and nothing is as good as this. It&#x27;s thicker and more concentrated that others. I put it on the little tiny wrinkles around my eyes, massage it in, and the wrinkles are gone. Mind you, they are mini wrinkles, but still-- gone for the day. I use it every day and I still have quite a bit left. Yes it&#x27;s a small bottle but really, one drop does the trick for your whole face. I&#x27;m Asian and have regular skin.</li>
            <li> I love the product.  I use it alone or mix with moisturizer and it keeps my skin moist most all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
            <li> I do not want to order this product again.  I couldn&#x27;t tell any difference in my skin and as soon as I started using it my face started breaking out.  I cant remember if you send automatic shipments.  If so, please do not send me any more. Thank you for the offer to try your product.  It just doesn&#x27;t work for me.  Kathy Gouge</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 wks and have noticed some difference. My skin is smoother and fine lines are less. I use this product in conjunction with a vitamin c serum and a derma roller. I will be buying again. Timely delivery, nice packaging. If you are looking for cosmetic professional results go to to plastic surgeon, if you want more moisture and less noticeable wrinkles try this product.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, get reactions from almost everything, but this product corrected my wrinkles, and skin texture. I didn&#x27;t expect so much difference. It does lift without feeling tight and does hydrate. I&#x27;m 63 so this help is appreciated. First product I didn&#x27;t have to throw out from irritation.</li>
            <li> very nice for my skin i really  love it so much it is an amazing product i ever use it</li>
            <li> Great product (just don&#x27;t forget it is a serum, not a lotion).  Great price (when on sale)!  And, EXCELLENT customer service.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Received quickly as expected.  Disappointed as the bottle was at most only 3/4 full.  Like the feel but honestly can&#x27;t tell the difference from previous purchases of same product by other manufacturers.  Will go back to one of those when ready to purchase again, which looks like it will be soon as this bottle is almost empty.</li>
            <li> it is 10 days i use this serum, but i dont see diferens and it is immediately dry on the skin. of course the price was cheap and it must be a reason.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid and Vitamin C combination.  One of these made me break out on the face.  Which one?  Can you reply to this?</li>
            <li> very nice product, but too expensive. Amazon sells hyaluronic acid at a much lower price per volume;  and yes, I  DO look younger.  wask face, let it&lt;br /&gt;dry, apply acid, let it dry, then apply moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Lines in forehead are becoming less pronounced I think.  Good product.  Dr Oz recommended HA with vitamin C so I looked for one on Amazon with a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a subtle change in my facial wrinkles in a very short time. My skin looks brighter. I am very happy with this product and plan to continue ordering this product.</li>
            <li> I just started using this, it is too early to tell the effects. But it seems help a little bit when applying on your skin.</li>
            <li> I got this product very quickly in the mail and  I was so excited.  I first wash my face and tone it...then I apply this serum and let it absorb fully before I apply my lotion.  I don&#x27;t think this is required because the serum alone is a great moisturizer.  I have always been a multi step girl and those habits are hard to break.  I use this at night mostly...(your skin doing most of it&#x27;s regenerating then) but I will put it on my face during the day if I&#x27;m not going anywhere or using any makeup.  You could totally wear this under makeup though.  It absorbs completely without a greasy feel.  I will re-order</li>
            <li> Perfect day and night serum for your face - I wish it came in a bigger bottle!  Great stuff for you face</li>
            <li> This item makes your face smooth, soft. I use it twice a day, morning and at might. I will order more soon.</li>
            <li> an exellent product, timely delivery,was what I ordered extremely satisfied.  Soon I will order another one.  I very much hopes product works as stated.  Haven&#x27;t used long enough for results.</li>
            <li> used for few days and so far so good.  I would continue using it. recommend to all the ladies out there</li>
            <li> I had spent quite a lot of money and time on facial treatments at spas. This serum has given me the same results. I would advice women my age (67) to go to profesional services just for deep cleansing of their skin and use the serum and their prefered day and night creams. Results are immediate.</li>
            <li> This is no different than any other skin care product.  It feels nice going on the skin but the results are no different than any other product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product . My skin looks younger and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy  it again . Thank you.</li>
            <li> Only been using the product one week, but I really like the product so far. It&#x27;s light, absorbs nice and you only need a little bit. My face feels smooth and soft. I love it so far!</li>
            <li> I love the way the serum flows over my face. One drop is adequate to cover your face.  I&#x27;v been using twice a day for about 2 weeks.  I expected quicker results.  I will continue to use as I like the way my skin feels.</li>
            <li> Actually there are more than 15 days of use and I do not see any change I will continue using, but I am not happy if I get to obtain a change will change this feedback.</li>
            <li> This is so easy and it makes a big improvement.  My skin is so soft and fine lines are gone.</li>
            <li> Love the product. You can feel the tightening. Got the same product for my little sister to try. Can&#x27;t wait for her results</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a difference after using the entire bottle.  I didn&#x27;t like that the bottle was glass as I almost broke it several times. It dried out my skin</li>
            <li> my skin feels tight and I can see its helping my face look alive and have been getting lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful stuff .. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to erase wrinkles from their face.. However is was disappointed to find one bottle cap was on crocked and some of the serum spilled out!!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used the full bottle yet since I also ordered another serum the same time I bought this.  Once I finish using I will update.</li>
            <li> This serum helped with my wrinkles and made my face feel like a million bucks! When you use this product for a week you will see the difference!</li>
            <li> From the very fist time I feel my skin so smooth and regenerated.. I highly recommended.. I will order again. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 57-year-old with some signs of skin aging (excluding wrinkles). This product has totally improved the elasticity and tone of my skin! Smile lines (aka parentheses) have almost vanished! Under eye puffiness is at a level I haven&#x27;t seen in over a decade. I think this product has become a permanent addition to my skincare regimen.  :)</li>
            <li> This is my second order. I think it&#x27;s really working! My skin is looking much better. Will keep ordering. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any results from this product yet.  Seems to be for advertisement mainly but not for practical results.</li>
            <li> A Great price for a quality product that is proven skin care nourishment and keeps aging skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li> Sad to say I didnt use much at all maybe twice and the bottle must be very delicate it fell in my sink and broke .I never got to know wether it was good or bad to even rate unfortunately .</li>
            <li> This is the second order I have placed for this product.  I am very happy with it and look forward to a facial improvement</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping nice item</li>
            <li> This is a gift so I can just say that the package arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> love the way it feels</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft already and and it tightens when its drying. Nice!</li>
            <li> Very small jar and I think my expectations were more of that of a jar of cream with  the above ingredients.  Haven&#x27;t had enough time&lt;br /&gt;to test it and make sure it works.  What is the expected time frame to know whether or not it will work and if so is it a product you have to keep using?  Amazon has few people that know anything about this product and you apparently don&#x27;t have a number for anyone to address questions, which I find is a bit disconcerting.  Any help you can give me in this matter would be greatly appreciated, I would definitely be a customer worth keeping along with my connections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for your time in this matter and if you would have a phone number in which I may reach you would be helpful...&lt;br /&gt;Michelle McWilliams</li>
            <li> I smooth it in after using a needle roller. Then I wait an hour in a cool room and apply a couple other products.&lt;br /&gt;You can be rid of many crow&#x27;s feet fine lines in about a week. This product also seems soothing?</li>
            <li> Since i live in FL and im 61..im not seeing much..still using tho..hasnt been that long..maybe i can review better in a few more weeks</li>
            <li> I did not see any results after using this.  I was very disappointed in this product. I did not like this item</li>
            <li> I like this product, feels nice. Long term I&#x27;m not sure yet, takes several months to yrs. To see results.  But so far I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> I really like this product! I got immediate results; tighter skin until you wash off the serum. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I really like it.  Please keep your cost as it is for ones to buy more of it.  I don&#x27;t understand companies that overcharge when they&#x27;ll make more keeping at a decent price.  Thank you for a good product !</li>
            <li> This is the third product review that I have submitted.  The company contacted me and ask me to submit only positive reviews about this product.  This product is like water, no substance and it certainly does nothing to help with anything.  After I posted the second negative review on this product, the company again ask me to only post positives.  I truly feel that there is something wrong with that.&lt;br /&gt;I use Amazon a lot and I rely on these reviews.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know. I use several different products on my face day and night. Apparently you&#x27;re supposed to use this after using the microdermabrasion roller on your skin. My skin looks nice right now and I&#x27;ve seen a difference in some fine lines that were kind of developing around the eye area, but I also just got a chemical peel and I&#x27;m only 27 so I don&#x27;t think this is much help. Some people wrote that they saw &amp;#34;instant results&amp;#34;.. definitely not.</li>
            <li> Bought it because of the reviews, but I see no change, at all. Bottle is microscopically tiny and there&#x27;s very little product. Bottle is the size of Vienna sausage. It has nice consistency, almost gooey and applies on smoothly to your skin. I imagine it to the same gooey texture left behind by a snail. Once it&#x27;s on, and thoroughly tapped into your skin, it feels moist, as if you had just washed your face. But why not just wash your face and get the same feeling? But honestly, I don&#x27;t see any difference and am wondering why I bought it.</li>
            <li> I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED, THE BOTTLE WAS 1/2 EMPTY. WHAT HAPPEN?</li>
            <li> I like the product but I HATE the way the makers will hound the hell out of you with emails wanting your reviews.If they don&#x27;t stop doing that when I order, I will find another maker... there are a dozen products just like this one. This is not a one of a kind product. So there, you have my review!</li>
            <li> I really like this product!  My neighbor noticed how moisturized my skin is after only 3 days of use! I have tried pure Hyaluronic Acid before, but this one combines Vit. C with HA, and it seems to work better.</li>
            <li> There was a small amount of product for the price.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this in the past and it was amazing and it had a pleasent smell. This time I was very disappointed because the bottle seemed to be old and the smell of the product was terrible. I haven&#x27;t use this bottle at all and will probably end up in the trash. I love the product but will probably look for a new place to provide it to me. Not happy at all.</li>
            <li> I received one opened and broken product!</li>
            <li> I like this product, that&#x27;s why I keep ordering it</li>
            <li> I think to really know how well this works would take much longer use than I&#x27;ve had. It seems to be working as well as the expensive product I used before. I recommended it to my daughter-in-law who said she was already finding the fine lines around her mouth. i think the younger you are when you beginb using this, the better it will work for you, although even at my age I see some improvement.</li>
            <li> This is one great product that you need to have, it hydrates your skin and it feels like silk .. Love it</li>
            <li> Love it it makes your skin feel so smooth.</li>
            <li> I have not seen much improvement over the last month of using the serum to lighten acne discoloration. I use it in the morning and once at night. For a product that I use twice a day, I thought I would see more improvement. I&#x27;m going to try a different serum or make my own finding ingredients on amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product as directed since I got it a week ago, and there is no difference in my skin at all...the serum feels nice, but as far as what it will do for my skin I haven&#x27;t seen any change in the way it looks or feels..&lt;br /&gt;Everyone has &#x27;the solution to the skin problems of aging&#x27;...looks like we have to age gracefully.</li>
            <li> I like th product, yet unsure if the cost verses the benefits/effectiveness are equivalent.  It is thicker than other 100% pure hyaluronic acid products have been….I do like the vitamin C aspect for decreasing brown spots/scarring.</li>
            <li> It is a Nice product, I felt it helped with some fine lines, very light feeling on the face, I used it up fast, very small bottle, I would use it again and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Well, I was so excited about this purchase! I read a lot of good review, and I wanted to believe this product was great.  I looked forward to using it during one of my travels, because it is small enough to get through security check. When I arrived to my destination, the next day I opened the product and there was nothing in the bottle! Nothing, the bottle was empty. I thought the product has spilled, but there were no wet spots in my bag. It appears that the product is very volatile and it has simply evaporated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either that, or I had received an empty bottle in the mail. This has never happened to me before with any other cosmetics I have used, and I use a lot of cosmetics, and I travel a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is something wrong with this product, either with the packaging or with the product itself.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for two weeks already and I don&#x27;t see the change. I won&#x27;t say the product is not a good one, It just doesn&#x27;t work for my skin</li>
            <li> I love it,  Its great for a crepe, wrinkled neck.&lt;br /&gt;Your skin looks smooth&lt;br /&gt;TRY IT !!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I just received this by mistake but i read the reviews and thought i might as well try it---- well ladies let me tell you am i glad i did! It is absolutely fantastic on my rosaesa face with pores.... I noticed a wonderful difference immediately--- i could barely see my pores AND my skin is soooo soft. Please try this if for no other reason than the price. I used Perrico e in the past and boy how expensive BUT now i have this.... Its small but u need such a small amount all over your face. Ladies, please try this cause as of now ill never use another!!!! You will be soooo surprised.... Thanks</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for awhile.  I strayed  a little and tried another brand but your product is by far the best.&lt;br /&gt;I only wish you had a larger size.  I go through this little bottle very quickly!! And maybe a body lotion in the future?? Just make it smell nice.  I tried one brand- it smelled terrible.</li>
            <li> Horrible.  Came leaking.  Better products out there that actually work better too</li>
            <li> It feels good to the skin, can&#x27;t tell any difference in skin elasticity. Sincerely, Alice</li>
            <li> First time tried this product. I love it. My skin feel soft and nice.</li>
            <li> really the amount was so miniscule i couldn&#x27;t gage any effect over time.  it consider it unaffordable due to the small quantity</li>
            <li> I make the order 3 times, Very Good product.&lt;br /&gt;Initially treats for the pores of the nose,&lt;br /&gt;but now I&#x27;m using it on face and neck&lt;br /&gt;very good product. and the price also</li>
            <li> When I received the bottle it was open and 1/2 empty.  (I now notice that happened to others.)  I contacted them (very quick reply).  They immediately sent a new full bottle (not the blue but that is OK).  So far I like it.  Just be sure to use a moisturizer over it (after it has dried).</li>
            <li> I bought it ... I put it on my face .... I keep waiting for the mirror to show me the difference ... still waiting.</li>
            <li> Just started using not long ago ,so I haven&#x27;t seen dramatic results. But its pretty good quality all you need are a few drops ,it absorbs really fast into your skin.</li>
            <li> When I received this item it was half empty.  I wanted to try the product so I kept it.  But I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Dries almost on contact - doesn&#x27;t feel oily, makes your skin really smooth and soft. So far seems like a very good product</li>
            <li> I would consider purchasing this again.  Good product.  Not sure about the results yet.  Will continue to use some more.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it works very well b/c size is small&amp; in 3 weeks I can&#x27;t see a difference . I&#x27;m almost out. Price wasn&#x27;t bad but don&#x27;t see improvements !</li>
            <li> it is ok. i expected more. but it is acceptable for thid price. i haven&#x27;T noticed any change in my face, after two botlles.</li>
            <li> getting rid of wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;using this product with my micro needle derma roller&lt;br /&gt;It was recommended&lt;br /&gt;bought two one for me and for my daughter&lt;br /&gt;Many thanks</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my new serum. I have only been using the product for about two weeks and I already see a difference in my skin. The product arrived quickly in a well-packed container. Would definitely purchase again (and probably will!).</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle of this and so far I really like it!! I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve seen anything magical, but I do believe it&#x27;s helping to keep my skin more moisturized (without breaking me out...which is just as important)!!</li>
            <li> Very light weight and not at all oily.  Nice hydrating product for daily use, especially in the summer time lotion.</li>
            <li> I just got this today to use with my derma roller (first time using both).  I took it easy with the roller (scared of having red face at work tomorrow) and applied this serum before and after.  It smells good (mildly like big red gum) and tightened up my skin immediately.  Of course no real noticeable or lasting results with only one use but I like it.  For the price it was the best serum I could find to use with a roller.</li>
            <li> This product is so nourishing to your skin.  Now that I have started using it, I won&#x27;t ever be without it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a month..and there is a noticable decrease in neck wrinkles...and those deepening creases around the chin line..it&#x27; doesn&#x27;t lift the facial muscies of course but diminishes the creasing caused by aging..am very happy with the results and will continue to order this product...fyi U also CAN NOT BEAT THE PRICE!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a fairly short time but I do love the feeling of the tightening effect after application. On top of that, it smells wonderful. Rinsing it off each morning, I cannot, as of yet, see a big difference. I am hopeful, however, that soon I will see some progress in eliminating or significantly reducing my more prominent wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem any better than vitamin C, you get what u pay for don&#x27;t have much left I will not reorder this one</li>
            <li> So far, it is all I expected it to be. Time will work its magic; I&#x27;ve only just begun. :)</li>
            <li> I received the product, which was not sealed in what seemed like a used box. It was bent in areas and the inside flaps were not flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box itself was not sealed, which would of been okay if the product itself was sealed.  I&#x27;m sceptical if this is the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It claimed to be new, however the seller did not state what their version of new was.</li>
            <li> So as this was a gift i cant talk to much about the product it self. All I can say is that it only took one day to get delivered, the cream cames in a shinny beautifull pack and I hope is as good as described.</li>
            <li> Before I have loved this and it gave me a glow. This bottle hasn&#x27;t got the same consistency and isn&#x27;t having the same effect. But it&#x27;s cheap, so take a chance!</li>
            <li> I am a 49 year old mom. My skin isn&#x27;t bad for my age and I am always looking for great and affordable products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many products and what I like the most about this one  is the texture of my skin, which is smoother, fresh and moist-looking. I can&#x27;t wait to see what happens with continued use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I did not give 5 stars is because they need to sell it in a larger bottle. I use a lot of this, so a 2 oz size instead of a .05 oz would be great!!</li>
            <li> So far so good, still waiting to see all results.</li>
            <li> I have little puffy spots at each end of my mouth and this serum makes them appear more evened out--less puffy.</li>
            <li> Product came damaged in box. Got very good response and quick replacement. I love the product and have used it for years.</li>
            <li> seems to be a great product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I am out in the sun a lot, between gardening and our sons&#x27; sports.  I always wear sunscreen, but as middle age caught up with me I see small wrinkles and imperfections that I didn&#x27;t have as a girl.  Over the last two years I&#x27;ve been using Hyaluronic acid and Vitamin C serums and love the way they help my skin renew itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic Acid helps lock in moisture, and encourages older skin to make new, collagen filled skin cells like we had decades ago.  Vitamin C combats UV sun damage and can even reverse age spots. Several reports I&#x27;ve read show that Vitamin C can also help prevent skin cancer caused by the sun.  I don&#x27;t have visible age spots on my face, but I do see areas on my cheeks, nose and forehead that are damaged by too many hours in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twice a day I apply a few drops of this 180 Cosmetics serum to my freshly washed face, neck and upper chest, and let it absorb and dry.  It is a clear, thick liquid that spreads smoothly and soothes my skin.  I apply my own moisturizer on top, although my skin is more oily in the summer so I usually only moisturize at night.  No matter how tired I am at night I never skip the 3-5 minutes it takes to clean and nourish my face, and it pays off!  I don&#x27;t usually wear makeup, but since this dries completely and is colorless, you can wear makeup on top of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have I seen dramatic, draw dropping results and do I look 20 again?  No, I still look middle aged and have light crows feet.  Have I seen definite improvements in my skin using this serum?  Yes, and it&#x27;s cumulative so continuing to use Hyaluronic Acid and Vitamin C serums will have a long-term effect.  Over the last two years I&#x27;ve seen a reduction of bags under my eyes, a lessening in the wrinkle between my eyebrows and the ones beside my mouth.  The improvement I&#x27;ve noticed the most is the improvement in the elasticity of my skin.  My neck looks firmer and my face just looks more rested and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very small bottle of product (1/2 ounce), but it&#x27;s lasted me about a month.  I especially like this brand of serum because free of formaldehyde, parabens, phthalates, petro-chemicals, GMO ingredients, triclosan, fragrance and colors.  I&#x27;m picky about the ingredients I put on my skin (which is a large, absorbent organ!), and this serum is formulated with good ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary sample of 180 Cosmetics serum for testing and review purposes. I wasn&#x27;t asked to leave a positive review, nor was I paid or otherwise compensated for reviewing this item. Look at the hundreds of reviews I&#x27;ve written over ten years and you&#x27;ll see that I work hard to give an honest opinion of the products I review.ed me about a month.

            <li> This really made my skin baby soft, and rejuvenated the dullness of my skin tone... it is a small bottle though, wish there was more.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but I have to for this one. I have only used this for three days (twice a day). I love the way it goes on so smoothly and a few drops covers far more area than I imagined. The biggest thing, though -and this is something I never expected - is that it removed a wart I had within two uses! I had a small growth just below my left lower eyelid. I went to see a doctor and was told that it was a wart that has to be surgically removed. I actually have an appointment for this procedure tomorrow morning. I woke up yesterday morning and the thing is gone! I&#x27;m not kidding and I&#x27;m not exaggerating ... the thing just disappeared!&lt;br /&gt;I am still going to the appointment tomorrow just to have the area checked but I can only barely tell where it was to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I didn&#x27;t have many wrinkles to begin with (I am 43 and have used sunscreen religiously on my face since my teens) but I am hoping regular use of a good product like this will prevent excess aging of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product so far!</li>
            <li> Very good and cleared up lines well</li>
            <li> This is a good light moisturizer for the face. It isn&#x27;t oily nor heavy. It feels refreshing on the face.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this products that I had purchased recently. I highly recommended to my boyfriend&#x27;s mom and she really like it after applying on her face. She could tell the difference.  I ordered more to share with her. The price is right and affordable.  Glad I had seen this advertisement on tv. With no regrets.</li>
            <li> This is okay little sticky .. good hydrator better products on market  but for price good buy, I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this one again..</li>
            <li> My wife and I found that this product worked. It is wonderful for all skin types, and especially for mature facial skin, both for women and men.&lt;br /&gt;When we applied the serum to our faces, we found that when we placed just a few drops, the serum instantly absorbed into our skin and our faces felt very smooth and relaxed. Since only a few drops are needed, the 15 ml solution goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Because of the special formula of Pure Swiss serum it accelerates the skin self-repairing process. It gave us back our facial skin elasticity and youthful tone and look. We are told that this product is very safe for everyone, and only natural ingredients were used. It was not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> I used two bottles of this stuff and nothing ,nada happened . I didn&#x27;t break out from it but I didn&#x27;t get glowing wrinkle free skin either .&lt;br /&gt;So if you want to try it I say why not ,it my work for you.</li>
            <li> I get dry skin on my face frequently so I was excited to try the serum to see if it helped. At first I really didn&#x27;t notice a change in my skin. A little after a week though I noticed that I hadn&#x27;t seen any dry patches on my face like I used to get. I was ecstatic! Having dry skin and wearing foundation isn&#x27;t a pretty combo, the dryness is extremely noticeable and often looks scaly. Another change I noticed was that my face felt softer to the touch, I assume this can be attributed to the extra moisture in my skin. One thing I was worried about was the serum causing my skin to break out. I have always had problems with acne and in the past some skin care products, for whatever reason, have caused my skin to freak out. This, thankfully,was not an issue. If anything I feel like my acne has gotten better. I will definitely continue using this. I loved the results I saw!</li>
            <li> Have to keep using it to notice the difference</li>
            <li> I noticed immediately the clear smooth sink.  Love it, love it.</li>
            <li> I saw this on Dr. Oz and decided to give it a try.  I love it.  Softens the skin and makes it feel so smooth.</li>
            <li> I like the product because it has the vitamin C as well. Easy to apply, smooth, dries fast, not greasy, a little covers the entire face. Lightly exfoliates skin, not like retinol that can give red and very peely skin. I buff with a wash cloth and my skin looks softer and fresher then before using this product. I started using this product two weeks before this review. I had used Hyaluronic Acid Serum in the past and this 180 Ultima Pure Swill is a better price and I think a better product.</li>
            <li> This serum is excellent. I use it morning and evening and it really tightens my face and promotes new cell growth.</li>
            <li> Great product .  Great service.  Great price. Absorbs completely and creates a smooth base for makeup application. Very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I love this so much. I used to have really bad acne, but when I use this with clean n clear + yes to tomatoes, my face clears up fast. It gives me a youthful glow, which I should already have at 20, but don&#x27;t. I love how silky it feels and that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin at all. You can even wear it over makeup. I wore it on top of my foundation today and it worked as an amazing primer- keeping that glow that I love. But it is WAYY too pricey for such a small bottle. I say make the bottle bigger and you won&#x27;t lose this customer. :) Going to look for a cheaper alternative, but I would recommend for wrinkles and acne.</li>
            <li> I tried this serum because of the reviews., I don&#x27;t know what happened but my skin got really dried and feels like  plastic. My wrinkles got worst. I have been using coconut oil to improve the feeling. I hope I feel better because my skin hurts a lot. Not happy with the  results:( sorry</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost a month and have seen no results in skin color, tone, or wrinkle removal as yet...</li>
            <li> I have been using Hyaluronic Serums for awhile. I will be buying this one again. It works great.Give it a try.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like its smell... a little bit stinky, i&#x27;d say, and makes my face really dry. I bought because of the feedback, maybe this product is not suitable for people like me.</li>
            <li> I love it!  I wish it came in a larger size.  Your face tingles as it sinks into your skin.  My skin has improved the more I use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this serum for just 2 days, and that too only in the morning, cannot believe how amazing this product is. My face is radiant as ever. super smooth serum, dries fast, the smell is a big turn off but who cares when the results are so amazing. I initially bought the cosmetica hyaluronic acid serum, but returned in within days, wonder why that product is such a big seller, so i got this in exchange and i love it. Do give it a try you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Have seen NO improvement in lines being erased and used it as the directions instructed. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> Feels great after applying. I use it in the morning without any other moisturizers. Add a small amount of another serum to my foundation. My skin seems to glow . I will definitely will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> The items gave me hives, sores, and then small scabs.  And no, I did not use the scraper thing long enough to do this.  I believe it was the Acid serum.  I did not enjoy this experience.</li>
            <li> I noticed this was a popular item so I&#x27;m trying it out.  Would like to get rid of those fine lines and wrinkles.  I&#x27;m happy with it so far!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been diligently using this product. I use only a small dab on my middle finger, small amount goes a long way, no odor at all. Before I started using this serum my forehead, eyebrows and eye areas were very flaky, since I have been using this item I have little to no dry skin. I do use another Hyaluronic product but I have seen a bigger difference using this serum. This product is no fountain of youth and there is none out there it&#x27;s how you eat, how hydrated you stay, protecting our skin from the damaging rays of the sun , But I would recommend this product to keep in your beauty arsenal.&lt;br /&gt;I would have given this serum 5 stars but I still think it&#x27;s a bit premature to see if &amp;#34;I love it&amp;#34; it&#x27;s only been a few weeks, however if this makes sense I would give it 5 stars for clearing up most of the dry flakes I had, as far as removing &amp;#34;fine lines&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t see a difference yet, however if I get another reminder to update this product I will certainly do so, I think another 3 to 4 weeks is necessary to give this a better review on how it&#x27;s working for me.</li>
            <li> I like the product but in two weeks I will have to be buying a new one so I think I will search for a bigger size, somewhere else.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my skin since I started using this in conjunction with a derma roller. I used the entire bottle and nothing. I will be trying another one next time.</li>
            <li> after trying this item 2 times I had burn marks on my face. I waited 2 weeks and tried it again for 2 days, again burns on my face. This product was a bad choice for me.</li>
            <li> Great product &amp; prompt delivery. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for months and I love what it has done for my face. I am 47 and I have always taken care of my skin and this is a great serum.</li>
            <li> I am loving this product.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s my imagination but my skin looks younger after only a week or so of use.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone out there who may be feeling the years showing on the face and would like it not to be quite so obvious.</li>
            <li> I like it very much it leaves my skin silky smooth</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I bought 1 the first time and just bought 2 more and plan to buy more at this great price. EXCELLENT</li>
            <li> The size is too small and make me feel dry because of \\&quot;Benzyl Alcohol\\&quot; ingredient inside!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have used other more expensive versions and I find this to be just as good if not better! The makers have managed to hit upon that perfect consistency--- not too thick and sticky, yet not so watery that you can&#x27;t apply it easily. I put it on twice a day after cleansing before I moisturize and I can see how it firms and plumps my skin and leaves it with a glow. I just bought it for the second time because at that price they have made a believer out of me!</li>
            <li> It is so light, almost feels like pure water, I used it during night in the summer by itself. In the morning I do see my skin more refreshed. I have sensitive skin, so far it didn&#x27;t cause any irritation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d Like to reorder please</li>
            <li> Total garbage! Smells weird and is very watery. Tried it for a weekend. It made me break out, and I do not have sensitive skin! It also did nothing, it even left my skin feeling drier than before.! Glad I only wasted $13  on this junk! Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> Ok so I have this serum in my possession close to 3 weeks and quite frankly  there is no difference to my skin. Oh well I will still keep looking until I get one that works best for my skin as I live out in the Caribbean.</li>
            <li> they lie when stating the ingredients!! They state that the first ingredient is hyaluronic acid, with water somewhere in the middle.  When the product arrived, the package says that the MAIN INGREDIENT IS WATER. This is a deceptive misrepresentation. I could be paying for a small bottle of mostly water.</li>
            <li> This serum works great, leaves my skin feeling smooth and moisturized.  I will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> Expensive. Poor quality. Nice fancy bottle. Read my other reviews for a much better choice. I won&#x27;t order again.</li>
            <li> Feels good on face, but the bottle is a little small, didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited for this to come in bc of all the ratings on it.  I didn&#x27;t like the way it feels and it made me broke out after I&#x27;ve given it a month for my skin to adapt.</li>
            <li> this product did nothing for my skin</li>
            <li> Love it, can see a change already</li>
            <li> So far I like this product. Bottle is very small, I should have paid more attention to the size</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product with another that was recommended and I am not sure yet whether there is any benefit to this product versus dozens of other cheaper products I have used.</li>
            <li> Just started to use, so far okay.  Won&#x27;t know the advantage of using it for a few more weeks.  Not a very big bottle for the money.  Is it liquid gold???</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it helped with my deep wrinkles, but I feel like it is a good serum to use before moisturizing.  It spreads around like a light gel, when it dries it seems to clear up my pores so my moisturizer will soak in better.  Also I like that the ingredients are more straightforward than most serums.</li>
            <li> all gone and it made me pretty</li>
            <li> Well i have tried a few companies hyaluronic acid and this is the best by far, You will notice the first few days how much&lt;br /&gt;smoother your skin is and very healthy looking. I am a 61 year old Gentleman and I was blessed with healthy skin but&lt;br /&gt;this product will work and for men it makes it easy to shave and your skin will feel great. thanks for a great product.&lt;br /&gt;All The Best, Alex Czimback</li>
            <li> I really wish I could give this product 5 stars, however, I have been using it faithfully for one month and see no change in my wrinkles.  I knew it would take time but I have seen no improvement at all.</li>
            <li> The advertisement of the elderly lady with extreme wrinkles had visible results per the U Tube segment, which did not seem doctored up at all...thatwas why I bought this product. Plus it had HA in it that was the other plus factor. But I had no results at all. I felt a slight tightening, but that was it. Rely too bad as I had high hopes....but I was duped again!</li>
            <li> I am basing my review on the fact that the packaging is lousy and came without a seal or shrink wrap around the bottle or the box it was in. Anyone could tamper with this bottle. It arrived on time and was put into a small brown flat outer cardboard box and shipped via Amazon with another unrelated small item inside. That box too was not fully taped and barely close on one side.. It&#x27;s as if everything was haphazardly thrown together. I&#x27;ll test the product out and see if it seems OK to use but based on how it was shipped I will not be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> Need to see how long it takes for improvements</li>
            <li> I am 64 years old and have tried lots of products to help to keep my skin looking younger. None of them worked. I have been using this product about a month now and  my skin does not look as dull and it really feels firmer.  Hopefully as a I use it longer I will see more positive results. The bottle is very small, but a little goes a long way. I ordered 2 more bottles as the price went up from the first time I ordered. Still a great buy.</li>
            <li> I am glad to have tried this product. It doesnt irritate my skin and it is soothing after using the derma roller. I have acne prone skin and this doesn&#x27;t have any ingredients that causes flare ups.</li>
            <li> I really have not noticed a difference, and am just now finishing up my bottle.  Glad I didn&#x27;t pay a lot, and got to try it out</li>
            <li> Wonderful product that I&#x27;ve been using to good success 2 X&#x27;s a day - morning and night.  Can definitely see a difference in pore size, tighter texture, and the appearance of wrinkles.  Good product that I&#x27;ll continue to purchase here.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the results.  My skin is smoother and I have finer lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> i love it .. I bought it on the advice of friends .. Will buy it again..and I would recommend it my friends</li>
            <li> My main complaint is with the package or bottle the serum comes in. It had leaked when I received it and the mail. Then it was super easy to knock over because it is a small, narrow glass bottle. I don&#x27;t think I can say whether it worked well b/c I simple didn&#x27;t have enough serum to tell a difference. I got MAYBE 2 weeks worth out of it.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feeling very soft at touch; it takes just a couple of drops and it spreads all over face.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this serum. I could not believe the difference I could see in my skin in just a few days. It is also a great value!</li>
            <li> A few drops are enough to cover your whole face.  Spreads very well and the skin absorbs it quickly.  You can feel it working after a couple of days and I even saw a mild peeling, nothing noticeable after applying moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I like it.  I don&#x27;t look 20 years younger yet but I remain hopeful.  I apply under other products for best results.  .</li>
            <li> Really like this serum!!! Great service! A++++++++ I use it morning and night, and it doesn&#x27;t take much at all. It will go a long way.</li>
            <li> this goes so well with the Argon oil, if your skin is dry.  Just few drops and than the oil and you will see the difference in a couple of weeks! No expensive creams needed, at least not for me.</li>
            <li> I waited some time to write my review to see what kind of results I would get.  This serum gives my skin a glow that gets compliments.  Definitely worth trying and at a great price compared to other products.  This is now a must for my skin care routine!</li>
            <li> I have used many of other vitamin C products and i purchased two bottles 180 ultima vitamin C but this product make me wonder if this is fake product because it doesn&#x27;t improve anything to my skin  after two bottles. totally wasted money. never again trusted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne for years and recently started doing diamond microdermabrasion, which on its own is effective but takes time. I decided to try this product to speed up the results and it really delivered. Initially when I ordered it had leaked out of the bottle but I informed the seller and a new one was sent promptly back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase, this serum truly does work! I will purchase this effective serum again when I&#x27;m done with this bottle.</li>
            <li> Bottle scratched, no signs of being a new product. Not serum like. I am not sure if it was fake or if the product is just that bad. I did not dare to put that product on my face. Returned it.</li>
            <li> Absorbs immediately and feels good . Very easy to use. I also use it on my hands. It works.</li>
            <li> my skin is allergy to this item. Got red pinples after using the toner. I won&#x27;t recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> Have used product only a short time but so far I&#x27;m happy with the results. It&#x27;s a great non greasy treatment to my facial regiment.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, I am lazy.  Feels good and easy to apply.  Noticeable results after a week of dedicated twice a day use.</li>
            <li> Great vitamin c product. I use on my face after using a derma roller. Gives my skin a glowing look</li>
            <li> I have been using for few weeks and feel my face more soft and moisture,  I am a mature woman,  but no wrinkles,  I think this serum help a lot</li>
            <li> Nice but soaks up fast</li>
            <li> I really like this serum but the bottle was half full. I received it really fast with my derma roller. I still gave it 5 star rating.sjh</li>
            <li> I used it every morning for 4 weeks and noticed an improvement. However, it was gone after 4 weeks. My skin had less wrinkles, less dryness, and felt great!</li>
            <li> I like the product, I have can see changes in my face.&lt;br /&gt;My product arrive defective but the seller replaced it inmediatly.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> will be ordering more, should be offered in bigger bottle!</li>
            <li> I started using the serum last year and I am thrilled with the results, as well as the quality of the product. After trying other products through the years, this by far is the best and for the price it is unbeatable in my option. It is part of my daily routine and will continue to be indefinitely. It has worked phenomenally with the peels and hydration masks I have started to repair years of sun damage and to turn my skin around. I wish I had found this years ago and I strongly encourage all women (you&#x27;re never too young to start) to make this a daily part of your skin&#x27;s overall health. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> wokring pretty well so far</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing...ladies over 40 forget it...as a rep explained to me..it&#x27;s not designed nor effective for us older girls!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for age spots. Used it for a month, stayed entirely out of the sun.  May have slightly had an effect, unclear.  For that I would have given it 2 stars. However, the company emailed, telling me not to give them a bad review, to contact them if I have any issues.  That makes two stars into one star.  Get it right the first time.</li>
            <li> I would buy this product again and again I highly recommended excellent product</li>
            <li> Just trying this for the first time seems to work as directed with no breakouts</li>
            <li> Had no change with this product</li>
            <li> I think it is all in our minds that we can get rid of wrinkles.  We spend so much money and all for nothing.  Maybe this would work to decrease wrinkles BEFORE they appear but it certainly does not help after!  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> product was not sealed when i twisted the whole thing came off easy and i have also been using twice a day and feel or see no difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> 180 Ultima Pure Swiss, Hyaluronic Acid Serum is light and leave your skin with a fresh and firm sensation. Io have been using it for only a week and I am expecting more positive results.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell the difference after one bottle. There is not much in the bottle. It soaks in quickly. It only made my skin dry.</li>
            <li> I love this.  I makes my skin feel so soft.  I use it under sunscreen in the day and moisturizer at night.</li>
            <li> I like this serum much better than I originally thought I would.  It makes my skin feel tighter and refreshed.  Some products make my skin break out, but this does not.  I use it morning and night.  I would recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> i have had other HA serums and this one is not any better than other that cost much less. I can&#x27;t believe the original price was almost 90$ for this tiny bottle!.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for less than a week so far but I do like the results. I should mention that I am also using other products as well but my face has never been smoother. I will let you know what I think about it in a few weeks. By the way, there is no oily feeling after I apply this.</li>
            <li> I bought this item mostly because of all these good ingredients listed, H.A. Vitamin C, and of course the huge discount. The item uses this tube to get serum, which remind me my chemical class, and makes me feel like a lab rat. But it&#x27;s alright, I had Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder before, their serum is the same design. The serum is very absorbing, after a short massage, there is no trace of it on my face. I feel my skin a little bit too dry but not stiff. Actually, for the original price ($89.89), I would prefer to buy  Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder. But for this price, it worth it a try. I rate it 4 star, because it&#x27;s smaller than I thought, and I feel it not nourishing enough because of quick dryness shortly after using it.</li>
            <li> not to sure, so far nothing has happened, smooth and tight. okay still waitting. Will give it one more week.</li>
            <li> Just got product.&lt;br /&gt;So far seems to work- I did notice smoother skin right away.&lt;br /&gt;But I will know more after a full bottle use. I have added this product to my&lt;br /&gt;list for my friends to try.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful!!  You can feel you skin getting tighter around your eyes. I will keep buying this product.</li>
            <li> The product absorbed quickly and it was fine to apply my regular skin care regiment over it.  I have not used it long enough to see a huge improvement but I am willing to use it longer and find out.</li>
            <li> Like it. Used 3 bottles already.</li>
            <li> Was only 1/4 full when I opened bottle</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;m on my second bottle--I can tell a big improvement on my sun abused skin.  Thank you for offering for sale :-0</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years from another company but this is not the same. I swelled under the eyes around my mouth I got blisters. Waited 3 weeks to heal tried it again just under the eyes and by noon that day they were swollen again. Will not purchase from this brand/ company again</li>
            <li> nothing great about this product</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this product long enough to see benefits of &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; claim; however, this serum definitely makes my skin feel softer (which can&#x27;t hurt!).</li>
            <li> Not what i expected but feels nice on your skin, i of course am looking for that fountain of youth, haha, something that fills in wrinkles!</li>
            <li> It pulls skin for a few seconds then disappears once you use your moisturizer. It is completely worthless and definitely does not do what it says it does.</li>
            <li> Is perfect to skin because do not  have oil exes in the face after application. It absorcion is so faster and effective.</li>
            <li> I  knew that hyralonic acid was great for the skin. This serum proves it. It goes directly into the skin. There is no fragrance. It firms and moisturizes. I use some Lancome products and this is as effective and natural, unlike all the additives in Lancome.</li>
            <li> This product has really given my skin a beautiful appearance. I noticed that if I did not use it for about three days that my old skin appearance was back. It is not a skin changer, but will make you look great on the days of use.  It is well worth its price.</li>
            <li> When this product arrived, the bottle was opened and some of the liquid was gone.  I returned the product.  There was no safety seal.  When I buy a product such as this, I want to know that I am the only one who has opened it....</li>
            <li> Seems to work as promised</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of use I have a noticeable difference in the fine lines around my eyes and even the deeper lines beneath my nose.&lt;br /&gt;I find it an economical product because the amount of serum needed for is just one drop.&lt;br /&gt;This product has met my expectations. I recently purchased a back-up for travel.</li>
            <li> I actually ordered another serum thinking it was just for eyes, but its for the face also, so I alternate with both and I see a slight difference.  My problem is I need to be dedicated at night.  I would highly recommend the 180 serum.  I will recommend it to my friends and also ordering another bottle soon.  I actually never knew that a product was out there and what is in them.</li>
            <li> its a good product to have a good hidratation for your face skin I recomended this &amp;iacute;tem, try with a dermaroller</li>
            <li> feels great. small bottle but it goes long way. Don&#x27;t see a big difference but it feels good. Probably won&#x27;t purchase this again.will keep searching</li>
            <li> It feels really great on my face.  I havent seen much difference in how my skin looks as of yet, but I have high hopes.</li>
            <li> This serum is a winner! I have tried countless other products never getting anything close to the results of this serum</li>
            <li> I use a lot of different products, but I did see a noticeable improvement after using this product specifically. I&#x27;m actually hoping they have an eye cream, but I haven&#x27;t checked it out yet. If they don&#x27;t, they should!</li>
            <li> just started using....only for about a week...so it really is too soon to tell, however, it seems to firm up my skin and I have high hopes it will work on my under eye wrinkles....</li>
            <li> It had the items that I wanted in this product.  It seems to be helping.  I could find anything like this in the drugstore</li>
            <li> No difference at all what a waste of money after regular use&lt;br /&gt; I would definitely not purchase again. I would ask for my money back but i used entire contents</li>
            <li> I have deep wrinkles on my forward and around my eyes. It smooths my skin and helps my makeup on good!</li>
            <li> I gave it the 5 star rating because it met all my expectations. I would definitely recommend it to all interested friends.</li>
            <li> Loved it. This product really controls the oil on my face ;)</li>
            <li> Received promptly and I am please with the product!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this skin product.  It is easy to use and the results were very noticeable and rewarding.</li>
            <li> I am a 28/yo woman of color. I ordered this serum after my ole henrickson vit c serum ran out, trying to save money. In this case you certainly get what you pay for. I was very happy with what the Ole serum did for me. This serum did nothing compared to the Ole. This serum is not effective for my skin, it made my skin regress, to the point I had to go out and get a microderm because my skin was in such bad shape. I suppose it worked a little better than using no serum at all but not what I expected, thus the 2 star review. I am now back to using the Ole serum and spending $50 per bottle, but it&#x27;s worth it! I have my glowing radiant skin back. I have a hard time believing that all the stellar reviews for this product are legitimate.</li>
            <li> Botte: Didn&#x27;t like the safety bottle cap. It was loose, no safety purpose. Very cheap.&lt;br /&gt;Product: easy to apply but after 3 weeks, I don&#x27;t see any difference/improvement.&lt;br /&gt;Will not reorder.</li>
            <li> I have used hyaluronic acid previously and really believe in it&#x27;s ability to help hold moisture in the skin.  This particular brand also includes Vit. C but I expected a larger amount.  Can buy quality hyaluronic acid at a much lower price</li>
            <li> I have used many serums over the last 10 years,this one tops them all. From $70 serums to $10 serums,this one is the best. Try it yourself,and see.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this (10 days ago) and have been using twice daily. I have used MANY skin products over the years, including Vitamin C, and all kinds of Retin, expensive stuff over the counter, and Rx. I have combination skin, that is very sensitive, and prone to hormonal breakouts. I am in my late 30&#x27;s and want wrinkle and pimple prevention!&lt;br /&gt;I have to say I am very impressed with this and have seen a noticeable change taking place already. After the first 2 uses, my skin was unbelievably soft!! I started to see fine lines &amp;#34;fuzz out&amp;#34; and the texture of my skin was like I had never felt it before.&lt;br /&gt;Then my skin started to get a little dry on the very top layer and lightly peel. I had a few blemishes come and go, (normal for me). Now that the top layer is almost exfoliated, the skin underneath is looking better than ever, and feels soft as a baby! Pores look smaller, and skin tone much more even!&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely keep using this and see where it goes. I would really recommend giving it a try. I have never seen results so quickly with any product before, and my usual reaction to skincare products is a horrible blistering breakout, or no reaction at all.&lt;br /&gt;The texture is a soft gel, that goes on very smoothly, and you only need a very small amount. That being said, apply it quickly, as it dries fast!</li>
            <li> Really.  I never, ever write a review.  My old skin soaks up this stuff.  Wish I could buy it by the gallon at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> I am not happy at all the bottle of ulyima pure swiss was not sealed properly, I plan to return.</li>
            <li> Love the product but bottle is too small, i would be willing to pay a little extra for a bigger bottle</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have the opportunity to use this stuff very long.. maybe 3-4 days. So, I was not able to see any visible improvements. During that time, I really liked how fast it absorbed into my skin. Oddly, that&#x27;s also what I didn&#x27;t like about it. 2-3 Drops wouldn&#x27;t get past my cheeks. I would have to get another 2-3 drops for my forehead, and another 2-3 drops for my lower face/neck, all the while wondering how much my of this precious liquid was merely being absorbed by my hands. I tried moistening my hands/face with water beforehand, but that really didn&#x27;t help. Then, of all the items on my bathroom vanity (and there&#x27;s a lot), my cat chooses this, the liquid that, ounce per ounce, quite literally costs twice the price of human blood, to knock onto the floor... funny how this universe works...&lt;br /&gt;This serum may be quite effective over extended use, but for me, if I give it another go, I will probably look for a less expensive HA-Vit C product.</li>
            <li> Love this product just wish the bottle was bigger. Does not last long especially since it recommends you use it two times a day.. Excellent for aging skin or anyone else who wants to keep skin looking young.</li>
            <li> Love it. Really makes my skin feel smooth. Seems to be helping the lines in my face..</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used long but impressed so far with product.  Will buy this product again if delivers results as promised.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really see a difference.</li>
            <li> This stuff is like magic!  It really eliminated fine lines and reduced a lot of the deeper lines around the eye area.  I could feel it lifting after applying it.  Only thing was it was pricey for a small bottle that didn&#x27;t even last a month.</li>
            <li> The serum does not cause any skin redness or breakouts and seems to give my face a delicate healthy glow (after using for two weeks).  My skin drinks it up quickly.</li>
            <li> I gave this a four star rating as I have not been using it that long although I like it very much so far.  Probably give it the five very shortly.  It absorbs into the skin very quickly and leaves no oily feel.  try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The glass they use for the bottle is so fragile that it smashed into tiny pieces after one accidental fall from the shelf above the sink to the counter of the sink. Most of cosmetic bottles that I&#x27;ve used are not like this.</li>
            <li> Thank you for your rushed delivery!!!! I am not sure if i see much change in my skin as of yet but i will continue using it as i know it helps retain moisture which is key to having youthful skin:-)</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care too much for this product. Box came a little smashed in also.  Won&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Seems a little drying, but it does clear bumps and spots.</li>
            <li> Nice product, thank you</li>
            <li> It did not do what I expected it to do!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for about 2 mnths, what a difference it has made.  My face feels and looks plumper, more full....did not expect such great results....I will be ordering this product from now on!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff. I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I have used this product and am amazed at the results. I have tried so many products and spent so much with bad to no results.  I have used this product for two weeks and the results keep getting better by the day. this is not the cheapest product out there with the same ingredients but the results are wonderful.  I love it and will continue to buy from this seller. No problems or delays with shipping either.  I got it asap.</li>
            <li> I like it but was surprised what a small bottle it comes in so will probably order more.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Works beautifully! I will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> I have seen a notable difference in my skin since using this product.  I suffer from skin conditions and this product has not only smooth those but but has improved the overall appearance.  I will certainly reorder.</li>
            <li> my wife loves his product second time ordering thank you</li>
            <li> I have tried two bottle of this but my fine lines have shown no impovement.  Great disappointment!</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at how quickly this improved my skin. I did notice an instant small amount of &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; because my fine line were instantly less pronounced. Not GONE, mind you, but after one application anything noticable is a dramatic result. It feels wonderful, weightless, completely non-greasy. Very small amount, I can see I will need to reorder sooner than I expected. But that is because I want to use it twice a day. Most products I have to remind myself to use, this product I have to remind myself to only use it twice a day. It just feels that good!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok....but that&#x27;s just about it. I doubt I&#x27;ll be buying it again in the future.  It would have to do something tremendously in the next few days for me to buy it again!!  :D</li>
            <li> I love the consistency but the bottle is very thin and I ran out within 2 weeks. You should go back to the previous packaging</li>
            <li> Not a good item for me.  Like water.  Ordered 2 sent one back and threw the other way.&lt;br /&gt;No substance</li>
            <li> I only use this moisturizer.  It really renews your skin and is simply applied. I&#x27;ve been using it for six months. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, it does not work.</li>
            <li> Love it, works great!</li>
            <li> Amazing product this is my third bottle and can visually see my skin is tightening around my chin and cheeks, yeah 😊</li>
            <li> It is but product and works as expected though leave face skin little dry.</li>
            <li> This is ok just need to use more of it .</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it before I use my roller ball. It tightens your skin. When used with the roller ball, there is a significant reduction in skin pores and the texture of your skin. It becomes very smooth. Use alone, and the result is the same. Highly recommend !</li>
            <li> This product broke up the brown spots on my face; however, the size is too small.  It was gone in two weeks.  I will be looking for another product only because of the bottle size issue.</li>
            <li> I like the sensation in my skin, so soft. It&#x27;s great for use with dermoroller therapy. At least once per week.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin dry, didn&#x27;t work for me, would not reccomend. I want my money back</li>
            <li> I washed my face last night, and let the water on it, dry on its own. Once my face was completely dried, I put 4 drops of this serum on the palm of my hand and with my index finger, I started tracing my face with the product while ensuring that my problem areas were covered. I woke up this morning, and maybe I am still dreaming, but my face looked a bit plumped. I went to workout for about 2 hrs. and just got out of the shower, and guess what... my face still looks great. I will continue to monitor this and see how it goes. Thus far, it is great. ;-)</li>
            <li> Tried this because of so many reviews.this product was horrible,it did nothing.my father in law bought another brand and was amazing. Starting not to trust amazon and their vendors.</li>
            <li> It comes in a small bottle but can last a while. I see a difference in my face already and it&#x27;s been less than a week. I use it for acne scars not wrinkles. However I must say I see a glow and a more youthful look already. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> did not perform as advertised</li>
            <li> smells bad but I do believe it works and I use it every other day (when I remember)</li>
            <li> Cant tell the difference as of now.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and I use it daily with very satisfactory results. My skin appears  to be more radiant, clear.</li>
            <li> almost done 1 bottle and see no difference</li>
            <li> I like it but you don&#x27;t get much for your money.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does plump up those deep lines !</li>
            <li> I start to use it ,feel good</li>
            <li> Really love this product.  It goes on easily and a little goes a long way.  My skin feels better and it dries quickly.  It works well with my other cosmetics.</li>
            <li> After one week&#x27;s use, it appears to be working on the acne on both cheeks.  However, it is too early to determine if all evidence of pimples, etc. will be done away with using this product skin is clear when there was no acne visible.</li>
            <li> I only tried it a couple of times.  Can&#x27;t tell yet if it works.&lt;br /&gt;2 of the 5 boxes I ordered were frozen and cracked and leaked all over the place.</li>
            <li> i already left a product review....terrible, and misleading ad on website</li>
            <li> Want one product that gives you younger, more radiant skin.  Then get this one. It does everything you would hope and for me it has only taken two weeks. I will use it forever and  a little goes a long way.  I used it on my hands too so I will probably need more sooner than if you just use it on your face and neck.  My neck was showing the most age and now it is tight and I am 57 years old.  I have aged well but now I could easily be mistaken for 45. I could stop using makeup my skin looks so great.  The only reason I do is for the sun protection.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product a few days, and I can already feel the difference in my skin.  It is much softer and firmer.  I do not understand why people complain about the size of the bottle.  You don&#x27;t need much at all.</li>
            <li> The box was a little beat up within the shipping package, but the product inside was fine. I had never used Hyaluronic Serum before and didn&#x27;t know how it would affect my skin. After using for a couple of months along with a derma roller, I have noticed a difference in the appearance of my skin. It is smoother, softer, Less fine lines. I like this stuff very much and will use it again.</li>
            <li> I just received this item 5 days ago, and I&#x27;m already seeing results. I just turned 27 and thought I should take some extra measures to keep my skin looking healthy, but I didn&#x27;t expect this big of a difference. In the last 2 days, 4 of my friends all commented on how beautiful I looked, and asked if I had changed my makeup or hairstyle. But nope...the only change I made was using this product.</li>
            <li> After a little over a week of use I have not seen any changes in my skin but the product feels great.  I&#x27;m hoping it will reduce the size of my wrinkles by the time I finish the bottle</li>
            <li> Skin feels more supple and soft. Have only been using it for a few days, but can actually feel a difference.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for two weeks and don&#x27;t really see any changes as promised regarding increased firmness or less wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I used this stuff under my eyes, and on my eyelids. It really helped to moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, my eyes couldn&#x27;t take the vitamin C, and would water. I am going to try another without the C.&lt;br /&gt;I use this on the lines around my mouth, and on my neck.</li>
            <li> I think maybe it has helped the lines on my neck....I will be re-ordering soon as the price is pretty low.</li>
            <li> Love it !!!! I&#x27;ve been using it for about three weeks now and I&#x27;m starting to notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I used this product consistently for 2-3 weeks along with my other skin care regimen (face wash, toner, moisturizer) and didn&#x27;t notice any difference. I have fine lines around my eyes (a product of years of lifeguarding and squinting) and they&#x27;re still here. I didn&#x27;t even try to use this on my forehead...which is where I&#x27;m really expressive and have large expression lines.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks and Don&#x27;t see any visible difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Does not work and feels slimy.</li>
            <li> I like it and will order it again. I haven&#x27;t seen a big change but I&#x27;m sure it will take a gallon at my age.</li>
            <li> Already used this entirely.  love it.</li>
            <li> Very small bottle and it makes my face feel really dry after I put it on.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have not noticed any results- I mean that it made no difference whatsoever in the texture, appearance or elasticity.&lt;br /&gt;So I can really provide any review, other than to state that I will not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointing products.  The bottle is so small &amp; it had about 20 drops of product in ...if that.</li>
            <li> This product goes on smooth - no clumpiness on my dry skin. This is a non-oily product and feels wonderful. There is no odor or fragrance so is perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> this is awesome..love it..</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t see any improvement</li>
            <li> Wonderful, I will be buying more</li>
            <li> The cosmetic itself works but the package is HORRIBLE. I didn&#x27;t open it right away after I bought it (I actually bought 2 one for me and one for my mother.) By the time I opened the package, one of the bottle was empty because the bottle was broken at the bottom. And by that time I already passed the return date so I gave the bottle for my mom. Bottom line: Make sure you check it right away after you receive it.</li>
            <li> I just received the package and I was very disappointed with the size of the bottle compare to the box.</li>
            <li> This really seems to help keep the moisture in my face and keep it from getting dry in the harsh winter weather - also helps keep my skin feeling smooth throughout the year.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, that says it all</li>
            <li> Really nice serum, it&#x60;s nicely absorbs</li>
            <li> Awesome!  Is improving my face and neck skin daily!  Love it!  Just ordered 3 more bottles!</li>
            <li> I am at the last drops of my first bottle, and have already received the second bottle of this product.  So far, I am happy with the product and hopeful that it will improve the condition of my face and hand skin challenges.  Living in the California sun for over sixty years has created unwelcomed skin problems.  Though not a &#x27;sun worshiper,&#x27; I do love yard work and being outdoors.&lt;br /&gt;I have received compliments on the condition of my skin, and feel I am seeing steady improvement in decreasing tiny facial wrinkles.  I have just started applying the product to the back of my hands, experimenting with reducing the appearance of sunspots.  I look forward to further results and posting 5 STARS.</li>
            <li> Made my skin dry as hell, I thought it was supposed to do the opposite. Maybe I&#x27;m not using it right or something, but I don&#x27;t have time to play.</li>
            <li> I like the product. It is really good for my skin. I think it is an excellent product. Thank you</li>
            <li> Wow! I wish I knew about this product sooner, came across by accident. It&#x27;s made my face skin so smooth. It feels so good on my skin and I&#x27;m very sensitive to chemicals . This product is so clean, I&#x27;ve had no negative reaction to it which says a lot about this product!!! YQ</li>
            <li> Very nice serum, It was late,but really like it.&lt;br /&gt;I recomend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Just be sure you have time to wait for it.</li>
            <li> I used the product, forgot about it and I noticed in the mirror the next day that my skin looked different, and then recalled that I had used the serum the day before! I wasn&#x27;t hopefully looking for positive results, I had forgotten that I used it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a believer in both Hyaluronic Acid and vitamin C for skin, and this is a great way to get it.  The serum feels so good on my skin and I can see a tightening right away.  Can&#x27;t wait to see the long-term results.&lt;br /&gt;Wish there was a larger portion in the bottle, just so I don&#x27;t need to order so often.</li>
            <li> I really like this product...not sticky..skin looks better already after two days of use. I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I have not tried it yet, but very disappointed that when I received the product. a third of the bottle was gone-cap was not secure and the the bottle had product on it. I want to see if this product works and will use it-but I hope this comment will have someone check the packaging.</li>
            <li> I liked it for the two weeks I used it. Unfortunately, my cleaning person broke the bottle &amp; I didn&#x27;t get the chance to see results.</li>
            <li> this product burns my face&lt;br /&gt;I would not recmmend to no one&lt;br /&gt;It stinks awefully&lt;br /&gt;I just did not like at all.</li>
            <li> This serum feels great on my skin and I can tell my skin isn&#x27;t quite as dry. No oily/greasy feel after use.</li>
            <li> I had been using it for the last month, i have to say it is pretty good.  I can see a difference on my skin, it appears much brighter and had minimize some of the lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Just OK. Did not notice any difference.  Not worth the money. I prefer the OZ hyluronic acid for the price.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen a change yet. Have been using Mary Kay repair system, so am comparing the two. It will be interesting to see if the Ultima makes as much change as the Mary Kay does.</li>
            <li> I bought two. I received one bottle full and another bottle only has a half left. I do realize that screw of the cover is tilted, so the half was probably leaked out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m somewhat confused with this product as it didn&#x27;t come with much on the how to&#x27;s and what to expect from it, which is pretty much normal for any skin care product. I&#x27;m just wondering how long it takes to see results? Otherwise so far I like the product, but not sure if it&#x27;s supposed to leave a sticky film on your skin? I&#x27;m not saying this product is bad by any means, I&#x27;m saying I&#x27;m a bit confused as to how and what is all. I would say that I would recommend it if I knew more about it is all.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  Exactly what I wanted.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> This product had alcohol in it. Enough said.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product, love it.....</li>
            <li> I started using this product about two months ago and just ordered my second bottle. My mom and aunt have seen great result and are now hooked to it. The only reason I don&#x27;t give it five stars is because the smell is not the best.</li>
            <li> Tightens and firms skin.  Minimizes lines and pores.  I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it has some similar ingredients to another product that I love and has been discontinued.  It was packaged horribly and spilled, or something?  It actually looked like someone else had already used some of it and returned it.  I can understand why, because I&#x27;m not seeing or feeling any difference from using this product.  Bummed.</li>
            <li> I would give this product 10 stars if I could. Makes my skin glow. Love it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product mainly to get rid of age spots. I don&#x27;t look at all like my age but the dark spots tend to tell a different story.This product is very impressive. It definitely gets rid of age spot, dark spots. This product keeps me looking 20 years younger.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many products but this product is at the top of my list for effectiveness. I love the fact that it is a gel. The product stays in place right where it is needed. The cost is very reasonable and it works better than other very expensive products. Just goes to show you more expensive does not mean better. Actually this product does a much better job than many more expensive products hands down. I will definitely without hesitation reorder this product. In case you are wondering yes I am a man. Thank you</li>
            <li> This serum feels great going on, absorbs quickly and leaves your skin feeling very silky. Great product.</li>
            <li> At this point, after a month wearing it once a day, it seems to be working. I have been trying to think of other things that I am doing to change the appearance of my skin but nothing else would cause this much of a difference. The key is patience. I have ordered it again. Just a side note: it is recommended to be used twice a day so use your discretion. Also, consider the product you use over it. I have been using Oil of Olay Regenerist for years but switch every once in a while.</li>
            <li> Just as described and quick shipping! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Another produce that should have a disclaimer that it&#x27;s meant only for women in a specific age group.</li>
            <li> Did not see a noticeable change in skin while using this product.  I only used one bottle of it so maybe if I continued it would have shown an improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> The alcohol in this made my skin red and sensitive</li>
            <li> This item is really good and works great but....&lt;br /&gt;Item description said 4oz as of 11/19/2012 but it&#x27;s arrived with 0.5oz small bottle like sample.&lt;br /&gt;I returned because cost wise compare with others too expensive for 05oz bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad if it&#x27;s 4oz bottle I would give 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I started using this product the very day I received it. Within a week my face had broken out with \\&quot;pimples\\&quot;. I&#x27;m not a teenager - thank God-, so that is not the problem. I had not used any other different product on my face and I do not have a problem with breakouts (not even occasionally); so I have to assume it is this product. (But then again, we all know what assume usually means.) Anyway, I have quit using it; so hopefully my face will clear before the first of the year.</li>
            <li> Just received it today. Tried 3 drops on my face and felt smooth immediately.&lt;br /&gt;But for 15ml bottle, I don&#x27;t know how long it will last. The price $14.xxx, is for 15ml, not for 3.3 OZ (100ml). So the price is still expansive now. The good thing is, I got a chance to try it.</li>
            <li> I use this product every morning.The serum tightens the skin and makes it appear brighter and healthier. I noticed that it is better used with another moisturizer on top.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have any smell, absorbs very fast, doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts. Because of it&#x27;s liquid texture it goes away fast.&lt;br /&gt;One star less because of the price. Approximately $100 for 100 ml. I don&#x27;t understand why they write \\&quot;save $75\\&quot;, since you are paying the same price for 15 ml bottle as if you were buying a big bottle (which they don&#x27;t offer, btw).</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this serum! It leaves my skin silky smooth and glowing!</li>
            <li> I am a 42 year old mom.  My skin isnt bad for my age because I do TCA peels at home, once every 3 or 4 months.  But, since I dont use Botox, the fine lines and textural problems do tend to creep in!  I had tried other brands of hyaluronic acid before and not seen any results at all.  It was the same as applying water to my skin.  It got wet.  Then, it got dry, and changed nothing, except maybe dried out my skin even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed about this serum that was different was the texture of it.  It was a little thicker than other solutions I have tried.  I dont know if that is because it contains less \\&quot;aqua\\&quot; and more of the acid, or if it is because of the vitamin C in it.  The next thing I noticed was that after a few days of use, the fine lines were actually harder to see!  I have now used it for a week, and the lines are still just slightly diminished, but even more noticeable is the texture of my skin, which is smoother and \\&quot;dewy\\&quot;, you know, not oily, but just fresh and moist-looking.  I like it!  I cant wait to see what happens with continued use!&lt;br /&gt;For those who want to know how I use it:  I clean my face every morning with an astringent/salicylic acid cleanser for sensitive skin (like Clean &amp; Clear or Sea Breeze), then when my face is completely dry from that, I apply the serum.  Once that is totally absorbed into my skin, I apply a moisturizing sunscreen by Neutrogena.  I do the same things before bed as well.  Also, I apply the serum LIBERALLY immediately after doing my TCA peel, and it is extremely soothing to my stinging skin.  Feels wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two reasons I did not give 5 stars:  One, the whole \\&quot;Instant Lift\\&quot; thing is a joke.  That&#x27;s just NOT true and is very misleading.  Second is because they need to sell it in a larger bottle.  I use a lot of this, so a 2 oz size instead of a .05 oz would be great!!</li>
            <li> I can see a difference in my wrinkles. I wish I had know about hyaluronic acid years ago!</li>
            <li> Absolutly NON. This product looks water,did nothing for my skin after few months.NO GOOD&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it was effective</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any change. No difference in fine lines. Don&#x27;t have deep wrinkles but I don&#x27;t think this product would prevent them since I didn&#x27;t feel like it did much. Guess you get what you pay for sometimes.</li>
            <li> I purchased this serum to accompany my Derma Roller routine. I really like the texture and it doesn&#x27;t make my eyes water when I get too close to my eyes (which is often.) It&#x27;s a great price for the amount you get and I really like the way my face looks the following day.</li>
            <li> Not sure yet. Only used once for acne scarring. Will proceed every week and let you know. Thanks.</li>
            <li> This really felt good on my face. I know Hyaluronic Acid and Vitamin C is very good for your skin even though I did not see any difference in the wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Previously I complained that I had received a bottle of the 180 Pure Swiss Hyaluronic Acid that was obviously a returned item. However I had also ordered a second bottle of it with another order. It arrived in good condition. So I tried it, and I really like it...!! I&#x27;ve noticed an almost immediate improvement in the texture of my skin. I plan to reorder, and make it part of my &#x27;skin renewal&#x27; program. You won&#x27;t be disappointed in the product. It works ~</li>
            <li> still working with it.</li>
            <li> Great Product. Saw reduced winkle lines within 1/2 of the bottle. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> When I tried to open the cap, it came out with the seal attached to it. And ,now, I am not sure, if this is a real product in that box. The box looks a very cheap. Not happy and I have to return it.</li>
            <li> Goes on silky, leaves my skin feeling great &amp; not greasy.  Great price, great product!  Will purchase this again when i run out.</li>
            <li> I would have been much more likely to purchase this product again and rate it five stars if the bottles I received, were more than only HALF full. I do not know if this was a over sight during packaging or general practice. I will be happy to amend my rating if this is addressed.  The product seemed to be nice,but even using a few drops at a time - The first of two, half filled bottles did not last long enough to give a happy review.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product not knowing what to expect, and I can say it is great!  It is very concentrated so with only one drop is plenty for your face.  IT was shipped right away and very well packaged.  Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had the product long to rate it.  Right now I&#x27;m neutral.  Hard to say something when you haven&#x27;t had a chance to try it.</li>
            <li> It evened out my completion quickly! I used it morning and night. I wish I had a bigger bottle! :-)</li>
            <li> My beautiful daughter is the last person in the world that needs this but she asked for it.  I&#x27;m guessing she&#x27;s happy she received it but she hasn&#x27;t commented other than (when opening it)....THANKS MOM!</li>
            <li> A little goes along way. The bottle is small but I believe it will last some time. Tried more expensive products that did not work near as well as this product.&lt;br /&gt;Take a chance and give it a try. I bet you will love it.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for me...</li>
            <li> Worked on a smile line. Have seen improvement in skin texture. Only comment is packaging box was not sealed.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t notice any difference like so many others reported seeing.</li>
            <li> I had brought two bottle, this product didn&#x27;t work for me. Generally they say after 4 to 6 weeks you see the difference. I used both the bottles. Its waste of money. I had brought this after seeing so many 5 star review. Product made no difference to my skin even after finishing the two bottles.</li>
            <li> I was a new user to this product 6 months ago and really didn&#x27;t expect much.. Wow was I wrong ! My scowl was turning into a permanent river right between the eyes. Did this work the next day I put it on no, of course not.. But now I have visual proof it has worked to soften that that vertical crevasse.  I looked so crabby before and no its not completely gone But darn near close to it :)&lt;br /&gt;Like the other reviewers have said You put this on BEFORE you moisturize!!  This is not a moisturizer, It works underneath what ever cream you put on your face at night.. As my dermatologist reminded me the moisturizer that I put over the 180 Hyaluronic Acid Serum Should have peptides in it.</li>
            <li> Did not make any difference to my skin, just noticed a slight brightness in the first time of application after that my skin got back to normal condition. I think i wasted my money on this serum, i might look for another one in future.</li>
            <li> It looks like this serum does what was promised. No stickiness, no smell, no bad skin reactions (my skin is awfully sensitive)</li>
            <li> excellent for the price</li>
            <li> Had read about the hyaluronic  acid serum and was determined to give it a try. Was glad that I did. I will continue the use of the same . Very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I was using this product and it feels really good on my face but yesterday it was accidentally turned over on my bathroom counter I tried 2 save some but not much I was so upset that it happened.</li>
            <li> This really works well</li>
            <li> Love this serum.  The fine lines at the outside corner of my eyes and under my eyes just disappear with this serum.  However, when I stopped using it for a few days, the lines did come back.  I would like to continue with this serum, but it is very expenside. A bottle only lasts 1 month.</li>
            <li> I bought this serum for prevention of wrinkles. I use it everyday, but have not noticed any difference. Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m still in my 20s and don&#x27;t have any visible wrinkles? I&#x27;m not sure, but I wasn&#x27;t overly impressed by this. It does absorb quickly and is very light.</li>
            <li> This serum feels great going on and makes my face feel very smooth. There is no oily or sticky feeling after applying. I especially like that a little goes a long way, just a couple of drops does my whole face and neck. I am very satisfied with this product and will continue to use: )[[ASIN:B008CEDY5O Ultima Pure Swiss, Hyaluronic Acid Serum with Vitamin C, Anti-Aging, Anti-Wrinkle, Instant-Lift Solution]]</li>
            <li> Product arrived within 2 days. I have been using it night and day. It leaves my skin so soft. I&#x27;ve noticed that it has started to diminish my lines slowly.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, excellent customer service.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It takes only a few drops and spreads easily over my face. My face stays moist and wrinkles are not as noticeable. I would recommend this to everyone. I have sensitive skin and it does not cause any issues for me. I am ordering more.</li>
            <li> This is some great stuff...noticeable smooth skin results within 3 days...I love it.  I have very sensitive skin and this is one product that did not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered this serum , looking to try something new, and I been using it for a week I start to notice that my skin looks brighter I have some little blotchy areas on my cheeks for long time and wow they&#x27;re almost gone so I will keep using it and see what alse happens my face looks smoother do ..like it. ..thanks ..Laura B</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get to even try the c serum, because the glass bottle broke. I had to go back using the kind I already have. I really loved the feel on my fingers. Your bottle is beautiful, but too flimsy. Had to give it a 3, because I wouldn&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> Although the product appears to be doing what it is supposed to, the dropper does not work properly.  I don&#x27;t know if I just got a faulty one or they are all like this.  I have to run my finger over the dropper to get the product. I am afraid that I will not be able to get all the product out once I get towards the bottom and it&#x27;s a little pricey not to be able to get every last drop. It does make my face, neck and chest much softer and the lines are fading.  So 5 stars fr product, 3 forpackaging so I gave it a 4.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product one time, so I really don&#x27;t have much to type</li>
            <li> I like this product , after using it for 2 weeks I can see a difference, but I still would like to use for a few more weeks, before giving a complete opinion...Debbie</li>
            <li> Recieved on time enjoying the product</li>
            <li> Overall really pleased with this product.  The rubber squeeze seems nonfunctional, not a super glitch ... Why would I fuss over product not hitting the rubber yuck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure, this is the real product in that box, because it&#x27;s the worst product ever use, I waste my money</li>
            <li> I really loved the Ultima Pure Swiss Hyaluranic Acid Serum it really worked great on tightening the skin around my eyes.  I didn&#x27;t think it would work this good.  I am going to buy another bottle so my mom can try it.  The price was awsome to.  Keep up the great work &amp; you&#x27;ll be hearing from me again soon.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again,&lt;br /&gt;Joanne C</li>
            <li> I use this product before my night time cream and it keeps my skin very hydrated.I love it.&lt;br /&gt;It would be perfect if it comes in a bigger size.:)</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the performance of the product and would highly recommend it. I have a sensitive sense of smell and this product did not affect me.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! I could not wait till I got it! shipment was fast, and the product did everything it said it would do...I could feel something happening when I put it on my face....I will be ordering again!!!....The bottle was small, be it does not take much to put on your face, it goes far....If you look at the other products in the stores, you can spend a lot of money, and they do not do half of what this does...I have a shelf full of them!!!  I am Happy, Happy, Happy!</li>
            <li> This stuff actually works! Although I would recommend purchasing a larger bottle because it doesn&#x27;t last very long. I&#x27;m looking for larger quantities.</li>
            <li> I saw results the first time I used it.  I will be ordering again.&lt;br /&gt;And I will recommend them to my friends.</li>
            <li> Received a shattered ,thin glass vial ( yes it is that small) and soaking wet, sticky packaging. And where is the seller&#x27;s response?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I advise you make another choice.  Even if they valued their product enough to safely bottle and package it, the minuscule amount of product you&#x27;ll receive only makes you feel &amp;#34; taken&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The purchase was made because of recent articles in medical journals assuring us that a good, penetrating vitamin c serum and hyaluronic acid are the active ingredients even in the most expensive products. Peptide serums came in third. Timeless makes a great hyaluronic acid in an 8 oz glass bottle. The search for a real, effective vit C serum continues!</li>
            <li> this stuff is great! less lines around my eye&#x27;s! my skin looks so smooth, I definitely plan to order more!</li>
            <li> It is too soon to tell if I have less wrinkles but I can feel the difference already in the texture. So far so good.</li>
            <li> I just stared using this so I will have to update you. This product was highly recommended to me to reduce wrinkles!</li>
            <li> This product works well will my roller. Sizable product love that it has vitamin c. great product perfect serum for anti aging.</li>
            <li> I had read other reviews and hoped I&#x27;d see results like the others, however it was just okay...3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing exciting, not good, not bad, but certainly not worth recommending.</li>
            <li> This magical Hyaluronic Acid and Vitamin C, according to my dermatologist who is cash only and charges an exorbitant amount of money per visit, are the only two chemicals he&#x27;d recommend to people. He uses them himself and he doesn&#x27;t recommend any other cream/lotion for his patients (for their faces).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After he recommended this, I started trying to find Hyaluronic Acid products, but that was a few years ago and these products were very expensive. I was so happy and skeptical to find this particular item being sold for $20. It doesn&#x27;t specify the percentage of Hyaluronic Acid and Vitamin C, so it is a bit discerning, but I gave it a try anyway due to the cost. I&#x27;m satisfied with it. Although the content remains a mystery, the product does work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The contents are a bit jelly and not watery like most serums, but it actually works somewhat better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure which of the two ingredients, Vita-C or Hyaluronic Acid, is responsible for clearing acne, but it does help with that. I have adult acne, but when I&#x27;m on Hyaluronic Acid serums the acne is always somewhat controlled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. My husband is very anti-beauty products, but he WILL put this on himself, especially on scars. He&#x27;s just amazed at how hydrating this is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does bleach fabric though, so expect ruined bed sheets. It&#x27;s just the nature of Hyaluronic Acid and Vitamin Cs though, it&#x27;s not specific to this product.</li>
            <li> I have been north PA for three months. Here is drier than Shanghai, China. And also, because of the heat in house in winter time I am always looking for a hyaluronic acid serum for my skin. I love it! It really works!</li>
            <li> Good price; good product.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> After a few uses notice skin felt softer.</li>
            <li> still pending no change noted</li>
            <li> For me this product is amazing. I use it twice a day and it goes on light, non greasy, no residue and dries almost instantaneously! I am 22 and don&#x27;t have any big problem areas, just using to get a head start. I do however have expression lines across my forehead and 2 small fine lines between my eyebrows, but when I use this religiously I don&#x27;t even notice them, with or without makeup! I&#x27;d recommend to anyone :)</li>
            <li> Very good skin-care product. Noticed a positive difference right away, and it dries very quickly, enabling you to put a regular moisturizer on right away.</li>
            <li> I found absolutely nothing special about this product. Made no difference in my skin whatsoever. Seems to sit on top of the skin mostly. I stopped using it after a few days.</li>
            <li> It is nice and feels viscous and smooth on my face</li>
            <li> Ilove this but what you  have to pay for it it should be a biggere bottle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this item after the micro rollers i purchased at the same time. I see a little improvement, the liquid glides on smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily apprearance, it soaks into my poors really quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> This is great so far!  It isn&#x27;t greasy, it absorbs quickly and I am seeing a difference in the tightness of my face.  I will have to do another review, but I like it so far.</li>
            <li> I like this serum.  It is easy to use.  It disappears immediately into the skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for couple of weeks now . I noticed my dry areas on my face improved . I want to keep on using it , because dryness make my skin scaly. I wear my foundation now and looks much much better.</li>
            <li> very nice combo very good price</li>
            <li> Very small vial. Kind of pricy for what you get. I used it up and not sure what it did for my skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff works miracles.</li>
            <li> I loved the 1st bottle I ordered &amp; used every drop. I did notice that my skin looked healthier &amp; firmer, so I ordered a 2nd bottle. It only takes 3 drops to cover your face &amp; neck, so a little goes a long way. I did notice a small rash in 2 spots on my face after starting the 2nd bottle. I had also changed moisturizers, &amp; didn&#x27;t know which was causing it so I stopped using both products &amp; went back to plain old Oil of Olay. The spots went away so I started using the 180 again &amp; the spots came back the 2nd day. I haven&#x27;t used it since &amp; the spots have not returned. I really liked the 1st bottle, &amp; would still recommend at least trying this product yourself, maybe I just have extra sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12-4-14 I would like to update my review of this product. My original review said that I thought that this product gave me rash so I stopped using it. Well the rash on my face came back after I stopped using it &amp; continued to get bigger. I never figured out what caused the rash, but it has since gone away again. I&#x27;m going to give it a few more days &amp; will start using the 180 on my face again. I will also be ordering a 3rd bottle once I finish off this one. I have also changed my rating from 3 stars (because of the rash) to 5 stars because it really does work.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a week now and I love it!  My face looks plump and stays moisturized for most of the day.  Just follow the directions and make sure you put on your moisturizer a few minutes after you apply this.  I use raw shea butter (the white one) over this and Im good to go!!</li>
            <li> This was okay, just not want I needed.</li>
            <li> Did not remove the fine lines on the face.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I really notice a difference in my skin. However, I wish it was not in a glass bottle as I have dropped and broken the bottle a couple of times and wasted this amazing product!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell that this did anything for my skin, and it&#x27;s a bit pricey for the small amount I received.</li>
            <li> I have bought several different hyaluronic acid serum products before and this is the best so far. I really like the feeling when applying to the face. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> After hearing that both hyaluronic acid and topical vitamin C were good for firming skin and protecting it from free radicals, I started to look for a product.  I found this one and decided to try it, but waited until I finished the entire bottle to formulate my opinion.  It is a thick gel-like serum that penetrates into the skin quickly and absolutely begins to tighten and smooth.  I use it directly after cleansing my skin with either Cerave or Cetaphil.  I follow with at minimum some eye cream, but on dry winter days as we are having now I put a light moisturizer on my entire face.  I am 56, have always looked at least 10 years younger than my actual age which is in part the luck of the genetic draw.  Taking care of my skin and overall appearance has always been important to me, and I do not wish to go the route of chemical peels, botox, dermabrasion or mini-lifts.  One caveat:  I also use 0.05% tretinoin cream 3 times a week, but this product is a wonderful addition to my regimen.  I would recommend it to those who know that miracles do NOT come in a bottle.  As for the size:  it is just 15 ml/0.05 oz which amounts to one tablespoon of product; one bottle lasted me approximately 5 weeks.</li>
            <li> is it working yet? (this is what i ask myself every time i use this stuff) and i hate the consistency.  it feels globby</li>
            <li> Miracle in a bottle!  One drop covers my whole face/neck.  Skin is soft, pores reduced, wrinkles...eh?  Great product for the price &amp; it works as well or better than other pricey C products.</li>
            <li> Has a really good smell and I use it twice a day in the morning and t night before bed.</li>
            <li> Feels great on my face.  gives me a smooth texture.  Helps diminish fine lines and gives you a glow too.</li>
            <li> I cant believe I didn&#x27;t know about this product before.  This is the best product I have ever used on my face, Body, basically everywhere I have a scar or lines.  The line on my face filled out, cellulite is leaving and stretch marks are fading away.  I use it with a dermaroller every month 2 month and a half.  I just used it once and noticed a huge difference.  I love this product I just with it was a bigger bottle.  Fine lines leaving, laugh lines filled out.  excellent product.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Me llego a tiempo, todo bien hasta los momentos. buena calidad. apenas lo estoy probando, llevo usandolo desde hace pocos dias.</li>
            <li> I love this product; this is the second time I ordered it. Absorbs quickly, leaves the skin baby-soft to touch and feeling fresh and smooth. Will order it again and again.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not very useful.i don&#x27;t like it very much .the bottle is small , used so fast ,just so so.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works yet, but so far I like it.  My facialist said my skin looked good!!!</li>
            <li> Really is the BEST hyaluronic serum I&#x27;ve used.  My daughter has actually asked me why I look younger!</li>
            <li> Was expecting more dramatic results.</li>
            <li> very happy with seller and product</li>
            <li> This did not work well for me.  The price was good so I use it on my cuticles and it does a fine job.  Won&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li> I absolute love this product</li>
            <li> You can feel the difference on your skin when you apply the serum.Your make-up looks more nicer</li>
            <li> Product looks nice in a pretty bottle but it did not perform as it advertised.  I bought 2 bottles, one for me and one for my husband, and we are both disappointed.  Product made no difference to our skin even after finishing the whole bottle.  Seller contacted me and asked for my opinion. The wanted me to address any problems with them directly instead of posting negative feedback; however, consumers has the right to know how the product performs.  The worst part was the seller tried to offer other products free so I would not leave a negative feedback.</li>
            <li> Great product..thanks</li>
            <li> very good product will try again thank you</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t even last a week for the price I think I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Some noticeable improvement and applicwtion. Worth difference in higher price but again not alot in quantity.</li>
            <li> es un exelente producto lo recomoiendo altamente para retrasar el proceso de envejecimiento, mantiene una piel sana y suave, el producto viene en una presentacion de 15ml o 0.5 oz</li>
            <li> This product is like all the others I have tried--pretty good. I guess I expect miracles and it just don&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li> Works very well! Makes my skin feel very smooth. The product sometimes makes my skin feel tight, but I just put on mosturizer and it&#x27;s no problem. Really great, I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Just after a few application my skin started looking so much better and fresher. I would recommend this product to anybody.</li>
            <li> Not so good.  Very drying.  I thought this would be effective.  It was not.  I was disappointed.  Don&#x27;t make me say more.</li>
            <li> Think it  helps in conjunction with cream. Not sure. Didn&#x27;t use it long enough to see results. Smooth, would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately Hyaluronic Acid is the only thing that helps wrinkles,as they say in my country, good things come in small packages,I bought 48 hours ago and my face looks radiant.</li>
            <li> I never expect a product to work overnight or perform miracles on my emerging wrinkles.  I am 57 and my skin has held up remarkably but it is starting to show some signs of being 57 with marionette lines near my mouth and lines around my lips and my under eye area has bags.  This product helps hold moisture better than anything I have ever used.  I wash my face with Avalon Organics face wash, tone with Avalon toner and then put on the Ultima Pure Swiss Hyaluronic Acid  with Vit C.  Then I let that absorb into the skin while I get dressed.  Then I follow up with a Co-Q 10 cream and a DMEA cream mixed together.  My skin feels amazing all day with this treatment.  Starting with a base of Ultima hyaluronic acid serum is the key!</li>
            <li> The anti-aging serum is very easy to use - just squeeze the dropper bulb and fill the dropper and squeeze it on your skin and I just rubbed it gently on the parts of my face and neck that looked like it needed help.  The product gives your skin a very smooth young look - how did I go so long without this product.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to all.  It softens wrinkled skin, blemishes are diminished with it&#x27;s use, also.  It&#x27;s the best I have used.</li>
            <li> I liked the serum alot.  A small amount goes along way.  I am still trying to perfect a new skin care regimen and I have included this.  It is too soon to give a longer term results, and most people do not come back after using a product for very long to give you actual results.... I plan to come back and share my official results...  If you have sensitive skin,  this product is for you.  It leaves no redness or stinging or irritations from my couple of uses!  I plan to keep using... See you soon!</li>
            <li> Does not work, not true what they say about it.</li>
            <li> This serum makes my skin feel so soft and seems to fill in any wrinkles! It is extremely thick as it comes out but absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I love the way it makes my skin feel! I am using it for a little more then a week and I can see that my skin tone is already improved! I would most definitely recommend this to a friend!</li>
            <li> Love this product , love the price , absolutely fantastic fast results. don&#x27;t waste money and time on any other.</li>
            <li> Goes on nicely, face feels smoother to the touch</li>
            <li> Great product . This is a must have. Bottle too small needed a larger size</li>
            <li> I like the product, but it was not a 30 day supply to make an accurate assessment.</li>
            <li> Working good but need to be careful with sensitive skin, I had some allergic reaction</li>
            <li> Horrible horrible.  The smell of the product made me sick to stomach.  It smells like someone spit all over your face. I could stand it i washed it off after 5 minutes. I won&#x27;t even give this stuff away. It&#x27;s going start to the trash.</li>
            <li> Very nice product.  Went to have facial yesterday and esthetician said &amp;#34;your skin looks great&amp;#34;! Doesn&#x27;t get much better then that!!</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have always been a sun lover, and a smoker, so I had wrinkles. This product in just a few days has help reduce the wrinkles I have. Deep ones, and the fine ones... Love it&lt;br /&gt;Stacy</li>
            <li> My skin feels like silk with this product!</li>
            <li> After using this product for 3 days, I got nothing but an allergic reaction.  My eyes were almost swollen shut, burned feeling underneath my eyes, and now have a rash.  I don&#x27;t have sensative skin, and never had a problem with any other types of eye serums or creams.  I haven&#x27;t used this product for 4 days now, and the swelling is almost gone, but the burning feeling under my eyes is still there, as is the rash.  Worst product ever!</li>
            <li> With first use my skin felt softer.  After a week, the fine lines are less noticeable and my skin texture is much improved. For now, I plan to make this product a regular part of my daily skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!  Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product I have seen improvement in my skin and I am ordering again. Finally a product that works and this one does!</li>
            <li> It seems to be working.. However really need to get through my second jar to really see if the results are what I expect.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much. I have sensitive skin and this serum is gentle and I have seen a difference in tone and texture. I  have been using daily for two months. Price is another plus for this type of beauty product compared to other stores. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I hate the bottle!!!!!!! thin glass that does not balance well in the bath room is always a bad idea</li>
            <li> A product is very good!</li>
            <li> thank you very much. It is a good product</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this it is garbage</li>
            <li> The bottle looks cheaply made and the product does not do anything at all to my skin. When I tried to open the cap, it came out with the seal attached to it. No need to break the seal! I dont know if the product itself is a hoax, or if I got a duplicate item from the particular seller. I have had similar experiences with a MAC Studio fix powder that I got from Amazon on good discout and it turned out a duplicate (confirmed). I can see a trend here on products that show very high discounts. Like this particular serum say, original price was $89.89 and is being sold for $14.43 (84% discount). A huge joke!</li>
            <li> It made my face feel very soft. I don&#x27;t know if it worked, it came in a glass bottle and I dropped an broke it, am going to purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I Think this product is good.  Is the second time I order it.  I feel my sking more humid and supple.  However I&#x27;m 68 years and am realistic. I recomend it.</li>
            <li> This actually shows results very quickly. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I am 37 years old and people think i am still 29-30 tops.. Latley I have notices some fine lines.  I have been looking for a moisturizer that would last more than an hour or two and thought I&#x27;d try this as I heard hyaluronic acid was a great moisturizer. It certainly is a great moisturizer but I was also amazed to find that my small lines disappeared It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works but it sure feels good.  Yes, seems to fill in small wrinkles.  Makes me look weeks younger.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone. The price is great for the quality;but, wish it came in a larger size. Not a lot in bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Overall , this is  a great product and it did not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for a long time, and I was not able to see any changes in my skin. I feel like I&#x27;ve wasted my money...</li>
            <li> Definitely will buy again.  Cleared up acne and diminished lines.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid is remarkable for tightening the skin, or maybe what I am feeling is the plumping of the moisture kept inside the skin with this product. Either way, I like the fact that it does not make my face shiny. It penetrates completely within seconds and I do see an immediate response of my skin. It seems tacky at first, but distributing it across my face is easy, without tugging my skin like some other viscous products can do.</li>
            <li> It is good serum feels nice on the face  goes on easy</li>
            <li> Excellent product. It works well on my skin. I like it very much, just the price which is a little expensive.</li>
            <li> just the bottle is too small with the pricing&lt;br /&gt;hope they can offer buy more with lower price like a volume discount</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for a good two weeks and so far I do not see any difference to my 56 year old face.</li>
            <li> I think I like it! it leaves my skin smooth and soft to touch. I am in my 30-s and I live in So Cal, where sun does serious damage to skin. Plus aging. I have been looking for something to keep my skin feeling soft and nice. Hope I am not jinxing it, but this stuff makes  it feel and look better than it was before.</li>
            <li> I brought this because of the reviews!! I have been using this for a little over a month now and I don&#x27;t see a difference! I am 28 years old and have a few wrinkles on my forehead. Unfortunately the wrinkles are still there.. no change at all.. very disappointed!  I wish I could find a product that actually works!</li>
            <li> I find that this serum  gives instant results.  It really does plump the skin - my crow&#x27;s feet, etc., are almost non-existent due to the plumping effect. I can&#x27;t say what the effects are long-term as I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 weeks.  I did try a different brand of hyaluronic acid prior to this that I had a reaction to - I was so dissapointed because I loved the results with Hyaluronic acid and was worried I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use it.  Tried this out and thank goodness I have had no problem at all- just absolutely beautiful results.  So, as with all things, be sure to do a test before slathering it on because everyone&#x27;s skin is different. Hard lesson learned for me, lol.</li>
            <li> Love this cream.  I had gone to a cosmetician to have a derma roller session and used this product after the session to help soothe the effects of the derma roller after affects.  It worked wonders to soothe and make the skin fill less hot and inflamed.  So I would highly recommend this product for its soothing benefits.</li>
            <li> True, the bottle is quite small for what you get...but I was really impressed at how quickly my skin absorbed the serum and how soft and smooth my face looked in the morning. It would be awesome if the bottle were bigger. If you use it twice a day as recommended you&#x27;ll use quite a lot in a very short time.</li>
            <li> This one works alright.  Still looking for the product the really softens your wrinkles.  You need to use vitamin c cream on after you use this serum.</li>
            <li> I bought this two weeks ago and it&#x27;s absolutly amazing. I use it twice a week abs my skin is great, deffenetly worth buying. 😊</li>
            <li> seems like a good product.  never really saw any results at all after a month.  maybe need to use longer, for results - not sure.  is ok</li>
            <li> I have  used a lot of serums over the years and this is an excellent&lt;br /&gt;product at a good price.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product. It does everything it claims and makes your skin look so healthy, and glowing and beautiful. It is very good.</li>
            <li> I purchased the item based on the raved reviews it received. Unfortunately for me it wasn&#x27;t the same. After using the product for over a month, twice a day, half of the bottle is gone, I see no clear results....and I&#x27;m really bombed about it. I wish I could write something more positive.</li>
            <li> I like this product, I try everything on the market, but I do like this great price fast ship.  Will buy again</li>
            <li> MY  SKIN  IS  NICE  AND  REALLY  SMOOTH.  I  THINK  MY  SKIN  WILL  LOOK BETTER  AFTER  SOME  WEEKS. HOPE  SO !!!</li>
            <li> Have used only one-half bottle but so far, appears to be helping.  Will be able to tell more after I use it for awhile.</li>
            <li> This container was also broken making it impossible to try the product. This container was also made of glass and these contents also leaked out.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and helps skin to feel smoother after 1 use.  Will continue to use and hope it works as well on the lip wrinkles!</li>
            <li> have not used it very long but I like it. Time will tell. I use many other products so hard to say which ones are really doing the work.</li>
            <li> The serum feels so good on my skin and I can see a tightening right away.My skin is plump now, with a bit of that dewy look. I use it in the mornings and evenings after D&#x27;arsonval High frequency direct for Home Use.</li>
            <li> love how it makes my skin feel</li>
            <li> this is the bomb.  really makes your skin soft.</li>
            <li> Cannot see any difference as yet. I guess it will take some time. Goes on clear and it is somewhat like a gel. Easy to spread on face.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea &amp; nearly 50 year old sun abused skin. I love love love this product!!! I use prescription products all the time from my dermatologist, they are costly.  This product is affordable &amp; I saw immediate results! I had 2 awful pimples near my mouth, cleansed my skin &amp; applied this, by morning, they shrunk sooooo much, redness reduced, all with out the drying &amp; scaliness we all hate. This is a wonderful product! Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> In all fairness, I have only been using this product for a short time. So far, I have seen no visible positive results in my skin. I thought my &amp;#34;11&amp;#34; lines would soften and as of yet, no such luck. This product certainly doesn&#x27;t harm my skin, but there are no real positive signs of my skin improving thus far. I will continue to use this product with the hope of some real improvements in my skin. By the way. shipping and packaging were great! I would not hesitate to purchase from this company again due to the ease of doing business with them.</li>
            <li> It dried out my skin and after 1 week have stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anything I look older and my wrinkles are deeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a pleasing experience.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> My product did arrive and I have been using it for a little over a week.  It&#x27;s hard to rate a product like this until you have used it for about 30 days or more.  So far I have not seen any great changes in my skin but I have really great skin already.  I&#x27;m just trying to smooth out the wrinkles some.  I will continue using this product until it&#x27;s all gone and at that time, depending on the results, I will probably re- order.</li>
            <li> my face is tighter but it breaks my skin however i love it</li>
            <li> I did not feel this replenished my skin and it actually made my face very dry, red, and blotchy.  I would not recommend and will not buy in the future.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin look and feel smooth.  Noticed a difference after about a week or so.  Got what I wanted from the product.</li>
            <li> broke my face out, but great for someone with not so sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I loved the way my skin feels after using this product.  I liked it so much I purchased 5 more. One for each of my sisters visiting for a reunion.  I  wouldn&#x27;t purchase for them if I didn&#x27;t think they would benefit from using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deborah H.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for fine lines around the mouth, tried it for 8 days, 2 times per day as per the product instructions, and it did NOTHING at all. I have no facial wrinkles but these lines above my mouth, and thought I&#x27;d try 180 Ultima Pure Swiss given their claims \\&quot;This incredible serum will restore your skin&#x27;s elasticity, leaving it looking and feeling rejuvenated, supple, and smooth.\\&quot; Apparently, not if you are 40 or older according to \\&quot;Kate\\&quot; who provided a customer service reply to my email about the lack of any results for me.  When I shared this information with Amazon, they promptly refunded my purchase price, offering the great customer service they always do.  Hopefully my sharing this information will lead to a more accurate product description with age recommendations included so others like me won&#x27;t make the same mistake.</li>
            <li> Currently, I am using this with a skin roller.  Have not been doing it for very long but I think I am beginning to see some improvement in my skin.  It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feeling.  I like it so far.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, I am happy with how my face is looking. It goes very nicely and absorbs quickly so I can apply my moisturize right after. If you are undecided on buying this, you won&#x27;t be sorry if  you do.</li>
            <li> I am 74 years old and have always taken good care of my skin. However, there comes a time when wrinkles are inevitable. I am always trying new serums and moisturizers. I decided to give 180 a try and I am very pleased. I believe I have found a serum that truly works for me. Nothing will topically get rid of wrinkles but this serum greatly reduces wrinkles, fine lines and pores. I am very pleased and will become a loyal customer. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Excellent product! 4 stars instead of 5 because of cost for amount you get.</li>
            <li> Nice product. My skin feels smooth and firm. I had a couple acme scars and they faded away in a week! Not greasy at all and easy to wear make up or lotion very right over it. Happy with service also. I will definitely will reuse.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with this product. I read most of the reviews but I really did not see any changes on my  face except I noted a few whiteheads scattered on my face.</li>
            <li> One has to use this for much longer than the supply lasts to notice if there is an effect.  User should take a photo of themselves before starting to use this product to see if one can see or notice a difference.</li>
            <li> Does nothing, a waste.........</li>
            <li> Oh, this serum is soooo wonderful. When I apply it to may face, it feels nice and silky and moisturizing compared to other serums that make my face feel very dry after being absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for a great product.For me it works great.I used it only for 5 days and I can see great results.I am very happy with this product and I just ordered some for my sister.It is great,I am completely satisfied and I am not a very young person,so,with this words I can say that it works.I did not expect to be that good.It exceeded my expectations.Great job,I am completely satisfied,Regards,Maria</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have ordered this product.  Very satisfied and will keep ordering due to the results</li>
            <li> Not anything special.  The moisturizer is good, but no results at this point.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for nearly a year straight, morning and night.  Seems to make a big difference in my skin breakouts and the texture of my skin in general.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product.  I like the way it feels.  I do not think I have been using it long enough to see any results.</li>
            <li> For me, this product wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting nor did it perform as I had hoped.  After each use my face felt sticky and over time I saw no difference in the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> skip it, it leaves a thick film that hardens on your skin. i got this to use with a micro needle and they do not work well together. i had my compounding pharmacist make me some wrinkle cream and it seems to work much better and not get hard.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I use it everyday and I can see the difference in my skin. Fine lines have disappeared. All you need are a couple small drops along with my Retinol face cream. I&#x27;m very happy with the product. I would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> If you want  the youth secret to beautiful skin...this is it. I read that, tried it and I use it twice daily usually combined with ceremides. Diminishes fine lines and gives a youthful appearance. I am 55 and hooked. Love it</li>
            <li> works! noticed skin had a glow.</li>
            <li> Do not see what it advertises to do</li>
            <li> After a nice cleansing skin massage using a face brush, splash on a toner and dry.  then put this all over your face, eye areas and neck.  in about 7-8 minutes you can feel it tingling almost a litle burning--but doesn&#x27;t hurt.  That&#x27;s you&#x27;re skin&#x27;s way of saying &amp;#34;Well heck, it&#x27;s about time you did this&amp;#34;.  DEFINITELY WILL REORDER.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with the size of the bottle and although the serum is thicker than the usual HA product I usually use I saw absolutely no difference in my skin. I am sticking with my usual HA, I get much bigger bottle, cheaper and it does the same!</li>
            <li> I really be very disappointed it changed nothing.  ABSOLUTELY nothing happens. Its like A Water . I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this product and for such a reasonable price.  It is definitely a re-purchase.</li>
            <li> Very nice product-i use under my moisterizer</li>
            <li> There was a Difference but not much.</li>
            <li> This is one of the most amazing products I have ever used, and I have tried them all. The tone, clarity and feel of my skin is better after one month of using this product. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Good little product! Can&#x27;t say that it does anything more than anything else!</li>
            <li> I don’t feel I have enough criteria to mark any stars yet, but because I have not seen any results yet :( This is my evaluation which might change after some time.</li>
            <li> I finally started using this after having it for almost one year. The very first use, I noticed the difference. I&#x27;m African-American and 34 years old so my skin is still in great condition but this product has lightened my chicken pox scars from when I was 4 years old and the area under my eyes. I look lighter and younger.  Just fresher. I was about to be cheap and order another brand but this stuff is too good so I&#x27;ll stick with what is working and pay the higher price</li>
            <li> I love this serum and I use it for almost 3 years. I recommendo to family and friends.</li>
            <li> First time user and I found it light not thick. Also liked the fact when dry it was without a shine.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Pleased! ;)</li>
            <li> its a little pricey to be this small. I have yet to see any results but I do like the way my skin feels after applying it</li>
            <li> I have read that the skin condition improves using this product so I am looking forward to using it as directed</li>
            <li> When I received the serum, it was in a small padded shipping envelope. The item&#x27;s packaging was lightweight cardboard and had been smashed. The bottom of the glass bottle had broken off and the serum had leaked out and frozen to the inside of the envelope. There was no replacement option offered, and I received the item on a Friday and only had until Monday to return it, which is when the UPS pickup is scheduled for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I did end up receiving a full refund.</li>
            <li> I used it one night and seeing my face perfectly ok the next morning I decided to apply it again the following morning. Big mistake. By tea time I had blotches of reddened skin all over my face and neck. I applied cream with vitamins and sunscreen. My face was still red for one day, the second it was ok, but I decided not to use the product again until a week later. I mix it with my regular cream to ensure it wont burn so much.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s working a little on a very old face.  My face feels softer and a bit &amp;#34;healthier&amp;#34;.  It exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> My skin looks better and feels better.</li>
            <li> We love it, we did a lots of research before purchase and came up with a promising result. We are using it, and so far we are very happy with the result. We are very conscious about using a good stuff in our daily life.&lt;br /&gt;We would recommend this product from a reliable source.</li>
            <li> I like the effect of the serum on my skin but the quantity is very little. I used it twice a day, and it only lasted for less than a month.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see any difference between fine lines or skin tone from before to after using this product.  It doesn&#x27;t smell very nice, but I wouldn&#x27;t care about that except that it doesn&#x27;t seem to work.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days, so I&#x27;m going to complete the vial to see if it works &amp;#34;over time&amp;#34;, but my initial recommendation is try something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, they emailed me and asked me if I was satisfied.  And they said if I was not, to send a reply email instead of leaving a review here.  Apparently, you&#x27;re only supposed to leave reviews on Amazon.com for this particular company when they have a 5 star rating! (But I&#x27;m not into deception, so here it is anyway.)</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is absorbed quickly and leaves the skin tight and smooth. I use it twice a day ( morning and night) and a few drops are just enough for the whole face so the product will last for a while. Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I thought my face was looking older with more wrinkles after 4 days of use so I stopped using it already</li>
            <li> I bought the equivalent of this product for $100 from another source.  Doubted that this would be the same, but is as good if not better.  I will reorder.</li>
            <li> a great product at great price….I can actually see a difference in my skin. I will definitely keep using it.</li>
            <li> The smell is terrible, and it&#x27;s no useless to me.I wish I had never bought it. I don&#x27;t know if I should choose another one.</li>
            <li> Has noticeably reduced the size of my pores in just a week! I would highly recommend and definitely a good price!</li>
            <li> Feels wonderful on my skin. Have not yet seen results but too soon!</li>
            <li> This is a great item for after the derma roller. It DOES NOT sting and for me who has sensitive skin, that matters most.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this item and do not see any benefits.  It is listed as having a retail of $89.89 but was &amp;#34;on sale&amp;#34; for $13.32.  After researching the product, I found that the correct retail is approximately $14.99.  I feel that Amazon was deceitful when listing the price of this item.  Am disappointed.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product.  I bought 3 so that I wouldn&#x27;t run out.  The new design with dropper are so much better than that of the blue bottle.  It arrived as stated.  this is the 2nd time I have ordered and will continue to order.</li>
            <li> Yes, so far so good!  I like the &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; it has been giving to my face, especially in the morning.  I look better, I can tell it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> I thought from all the positive feedback this would be very moisturizing, but on my skin which is very nice but dry, it has done nothing.  I hate to leave negative feedback but feel I needed to for this.  Maybe my skin is just to thirsty and needs more.  This did not leave my skin feeling any different or with more moisture than anything else I&#x27;ve used.  I&#x27;m not impressed.  It goes on like an oil which I like, but within minutes it&#x27;s absorbed yet my skin doesn&#x27;t feel or look any different.  I will finish using it but will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to wait before posting a review. Yes, it does make a difference. There is no magic but still you will notice after 2 weeks that your skin feels incredibly soft, it shrinks the appearance of pores. Fine lines nearly disappeared once you apply. Don&#x27;t forget to apply your normal moisturizer cream for the day or night and this amplifies the effect.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend that product for sure.</li>
            <li> The serum itself is fine but it is pricier than the one sold by Watts. Also, the dropper did not touch the bottom so you have to stop using the dropper to be able to use all of the product. Not satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used any other serums before this but after reading these reviews and seeing the price I couldn&#x27;t pass it up. I am 23 years old andI generally have very sensitive skin, almost anything I apply on it irritates it. The first time I applied this on my skin I felt the instant hydration and lifting. It last a very long time and allows makeup to be applied very smoothly. I wouldn&#x27;t use it alone, generally underneath a moisturizer or cream. But definitely won&#x27;t go without this product. If you&#x27;re looking for younger and more hydrated skin, I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> smaller pores especially on the nose and face is more moisturized with lesser visible lines and wrinkles for small price</li>
            <li> I love this product. Excellent product for the money, I highly recommend this product for anti aging amongst other over priced items.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice any difference in my skin after using this product. I expected more from a product of this cost.</li>
            <li> Only been using a week. Noticed a reduction in spots and a change in skin texture. Will report more in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell the difference using it or not using it.  I was surprised that the container was almost empty too. Sort of tacky getting an empty bottle in a new order.</li>
            <li> I only put 3 stars at this time but I like how its easy to apply &amp; absorbs quickly but its too soon to comment on how it works.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> I really like this product and will be ordering more, has helped my sensitive skin quit a bit.  Thanks for such a great product.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this for myself and another family member. I have noticed improved skin smoothness, more even skin tone and will continue to use it !</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past six months and it works!  It is the only moisturizer I use at night, and my skin feels smooth and soft. In the morning I follow up with 50 spf cc cream from It Cosmetics and my skin, which tends to get oily, feels fresh and clean all day.</li>
            <li> Product works great.  Makes my face nice and plump vanishing any super fine lines instantly.  I just wish there was a bit more to the product so i don&#x27;t need to re-order as often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another note on the seller, great customer satisfaction.  My first bottle came defective and damaged.  They reached out to me, sent me a new one promptly no questions asked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m HAPPY all around.</li>
            <li> I have just started using Ultima Pure Swiss, and already have noticed a difference.  I love this product, and am excited to know the benefits of vitamin C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Marie</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother for Chtistmas and she loves it!  All I hear is &amp;#34; I like this and I want to order more of it.&amp;#34;  She is 76 and takes good care of her skin always.  If she likes it then it has to truly be a fantastic product.  I think I will get some for myself as well.  I&#x27;ll write my personal review later.  Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> The price was right compared to other products on the market.  It may appear to be a small amount.  However, it doesn&#x27;t take much for an application.  Instructions are easy to follow.  I&#x27;m not sure if the lines are disappearing on my face or not.  But then then again it has only been a couple of weeks.  I have gotten compliments on my skin which could be attributed to the Hyaluronic Acid Serum.</li>
            <li> Here is the review report actually written by my wife.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I have been using this serum for about a week. I put this serum on first thing in the morning after i wash my face,  Then, at the end of the day, I wash my face and put the serum on again before going to bed.  I put 3 drops in the palm of my hand, dab a finger in it and apply it to my face rubbing it in all over. 3 drops is plenty to spread around.  Give it about 5-10 minutes to completely dry.  You can now apply cream or makeup as you so desire.  As of about the sixth day, I really haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference on my face.  I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much to happen this soon anyway but perhaps over a considerably longer period of time I would see positive results and provide for updates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li> Love it. I really like that the bottle is colored glass because vitamin c loses its effectiveness when exposed to light.</li>
            <li> I have started to get all those little wrinkles between the mouth and nose and for some reason I really hate the look, along with thin lips. At the same time, my joints, especially my hips, have become very painful from cartilage loss, and apparently, hyaluronic acid loss, as well, which forms part of a fluid sac in the joints that also helps to cushion the bones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Research led me to hyaluronic acid (as well as gelatin supplements) as something that may help plump up the skin and make the joints function less painfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I have been using this product for little more that a month, I can tell that it is very pure (not a lot of &amp;#34;filler&amp;#34; ingredients) and may be helping with the lip area (I also take supplements). I&#x27;m hopeful with more time there will be more noticeable results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely helps (in tandem with HA lotion) to keep my skin from needing lotion all the time in the very dry winter environment of Denver. This is the first time I&#x27;ve been able to find long-term (as in 6-8 hours) relief from my skin drying out so much that it burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product, whether it works miracles or not, it does help my skin look better and stay moist. If my joints are helped in a few months, I&#x27;ll report back!</li>
            <li> I thought that this serum would be moisturizing, and it is not. I have very pale, sensitive, dry skin. Like another reviewer, it made my face red and tingly, and it totally dried out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;It did make my skin feel tighter as it dried, and afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;For the price, ($13 something), at least I wasn&#x27;t out of pocket too much.&lt;br /&gt;If you have similar dry sensitive skin, you might want to think twice before using this, or at least be prepared for a red face, some tingling, and to use a good moisturizer afterwards or mixed in.</li>
            <li> I honestly have noticed a difference.  Kinda strange since I am one of those people who try everything on the market to try to rid yself of wrinkles while getting smoother skin. I was shocked it worked so well. :)</li>
            <li> Yes, I like this stuff!  It feels very nice on the face, and all I use is 2 drops in the morning under my moisturizer or moisturizer/foundation depending on the time of year or activity.  I have noticed a decrease in the appearance of fine lines around my eyes.  This is the very first product I have ever been able to say that about.  The question is....if I stop using it, will they return?</li>
            <li> I HAVE NOT BEEN USING IT FOR VERY LONG - BUT IT SEEMS TO WORK . I WILL REORDER IT BEFORE I CAN RATE IT 5 STARS.</li>
            <li> does not begin to live up to description...does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.  would have returned but not worth the hassle.  would not recommend</li>
            <li> I saw a small difference</li>
            <li> Very fast delivary i hope i get good results</li>
            <li> I really like it. Is been a few days and I can already firm and tightness in my skin.</li>
            <li> nice effect made me order more , it was&#x27;t the first time and hopefully&lt;br /&gt;if the good effect increases with the scond order&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll buy more . I adviced my friend to try it and she order&lt;br /&gt;with me two of it.</li>
            <li> Immediately my skin felt tighter and softer.  Before I finished one bottle, others could even notice a reduction of fine lines!  I will keep using it.</li>
            <li> It has a nice soft texture. Feels oily when you put it on, but it sinks right in! I could notice a difference right away.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for a few days and I have not seen any visible changes.  I bought the product to use on the smile lines or folds on both sides of my mouth.  Perhaps this product works best on fine lines and I do not have any fine lines or wrinkles.  I will continue to use the product and will write another review if I see any changes.</li>
            <li> I am getting ready to reorder, I have found some wrinkle changes that aren&#x27;t there any more and I  will continue using this for awhile. I do wish that the bottles were a little larger. I have used this product for at least 4 weeks and I do see the difference in my skin. I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t started using this product yet but I was disappointed when I discovered, after placing the order, that it was only .5 oz. Most other similar products are a full ounce. Since price was what attracted me to this particular product I was disappointed when I realized that it actually is no less expensive than similar products.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin in the harsh NE winter.  I&#x27;ve been using this under my normal moisturizer and I notice my skin feels softer.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve lost any years, but, perhaps in the Spring, or when I&#x27;m done with the bottle, I will look years younger!</li>
            <li> Great product. works great, i also use it on my hands. Helps with fine lines on and around the eye area and mouth.</li>
            <li> Pretty inexpensive, but the quantity wasn&#x27;t as expected.  I didn&#x27;t see any real benefit so definitely would not re-purchase it.</li>
            <li> A bit sticky compared to Keihl&#x27;s product, but feels good once dry.  Have to use it for awhile to see if I get the results as advertised.</li>
            <li> I have been using this item for several days now, I am starting to see some improvement in my skin. I think with continued use the results will only get better.</li>
            <li> This serum is one of the best I&#x27;ve found in this price range. It helps retain moisture and &amp;#34;plump&amp;#34; fine lines around mouth, eyes and delicate areas. It feels luxurious going on and sinks in right away, leaving my skin feeling refreshed. Try mixing with a few drops of almond or even avocado oil for more intense moisture, which works like a charm in winter months. It is rather pricey though. I would give more stars if they offered a bulk purchasing option.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect this product to help a whole lot - but what a surprise to see that within 14 days my skin absolutely is smoother!  The fine lines around my lips have all but disappeared.  I am 56 years old, I wasn&#x27;t looking for a miracle, just a little help.  I got a lot more than I thought I would!  I had a problem with a bottle that was broken while shipping, the actual company contacted me for feedback and when I told them what happened, they sent me a replacement immediately, no questions asked.  I am going to have to stock up on this product, I do NOT want to run out of it!</li>
            <li> Like the feel of my skin after using it.</li>
            <li> Amazing!! Packaging was lovely! Thank you, I&#x27;m very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> This is my second time purchasing this product.  I will recommend this to every woman this really keeps you&#x27;re skin refresh and glowing.  The purpose of using this product is I dermer roll on my face, neck and arms.  After putting  on the serum make skin looks amazing.  I see the difference in a few days&lt;br /&gt; Five across the board for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using product; up to now it seems to be giving good results. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> Love this product!! Instant tightening... especially when coupled with a peel or microneedling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with my product</li>
            <li> Have been using this product twice daily with no visible results at all. Does not make my skin feel soft or vibrant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started using this product for a few weeks, but some of my fine lines seem to have decreased.  A little goes a long way. My guess is that a bottle would last about a month.  I look forward to seeing more results as time goes by.</li>
            <li> I love this serum. I can see results after just two weeks. Other people are starting to notice the improvement and ask what I am doing.  I especially like that it isn&#x27;t white and greasy like other products I&#x27;ve tried.  I can wear it any time and any where.  But best of all it works.</li>
            <li> Have been so happy with this product, I&#x27;ve ordered more.  I noticed a difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance in just 3 weeks.  Some of the tiny lines are gone and my skin feels great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maureen M.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel once I apply it.  Great product!  I will order more definitely</li>
            <li> I prefer serums over heavy creams. This feels so light on the skin and doesn&#x27;t make the skin oily or greasy. I think it is a good product. I have only being using it for 4 weeks but I already see an improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> Received as expected. Seller highly recommended. Tried this product for the first time today. It is a smooth, silky product that feels great on the skin. I used with a positive charge ion roller to ensure it went deep into the skin. My face feels smoother already. Looking forward to seeing the benefits of extended use.</li>
            <li> My mother is very happy and contented, not print clearly on the bottle, but Serum is very good, the result is excellent.</li>
            <li> I received this on the day that it was due to arrive....wrapped neatly in a bubble wrap. It is a very good serum. Really helps diminish fine lines and wrinkles and doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin like mine. I have skin that is allergic to many products and this works well without irritation and since I also have combination skin maybe it would cause breakouts but it does not....worth the money.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t stand up to my expectations. Did not see any difference. Will keep on seeking other manufactures for results that may produce more.</li>
            <li> I love the way the product makes my face feel. I have a lot of wrinkles so I think it will take more than using Pure Swiss for 2 weeks to see a difference.  I sure hope it works soon.</li>
            <li> I am a 50-year-old woman and I look ten years younger!! This stuff really works and I love, love, love it!!!</li>
            <li> this product leaves my skin feeling fresh &amp; silky.  I have not used it long enough to see anyvisible changes to my skin, but I love how it feels.&lt;br /&gt;I would certainly recommend this to a friend.  I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I HAVE ONLY USED PRODUCT FOR WEEK&lt;br /&gt;I DO SEE IMPROVEMENT IN MY SKIN&lt;br /&gt;OTHER FOLKS HAVE ALSO COMMENTED  ON HOW GOOD MY SKIN IS LOOKING&lt;br /&gt;I WILL PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT AGAIN</li>
            <li> This actually works. I just ordered my 2nd bottle. I would highly recommend this product. It not only fills the thin lines, but helped tremendously on the deep ones in the forehead and laugh lines. Amazing product!!!</li>
            <li> I bought hyralonic acid before from a salon.  It was 50.00 .  When I read the review on this I thought wow must be the same  .. I was so wrong this is the worst product I ever used on my face.  I&#x27;ll go back yo the salon and buy the right kind .  Not this crap</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed with this product.  The serum doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s absorbed into my skin and makes it feel really dry.  I stopped using it after one week. It was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> One of the best products on the market, and I like the product very much.  Excellent product to use daily.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I can tell a huge difference in my skin especially after using it with the micro needle roller.</li>
            <li> Did not notice one didifference, waste of money. Do not recommended buying. Makes face feel sticky.Low quality in comparison to others tried.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in my skin.  Glad I only spent a few bucks for this product.</li>
            <li> Pretty good product, noticed some difference in lines in my face, but expensive for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> works well however the product leaves a mask that peels</li>
            <li> Too small for the price.  I am gonna get a whole ton of Hyaluronic acid wholesale.  This bottle hardly lasted 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> The day the product was delivered, I dropped the bottle by accident. I only got to use the product once....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish that I could be more helpful to you.  Nicholas Morris....</li>
            <li> after two weeks of use i can feel and see a difference. my skin is softer and brighter. a product i will certainly buy again!</li>
            <li> can purchase the same or similar product at the drugstore or a department store.  Won&#x27;t purchase again.  I feel uncomfortable using products on my face that I&#x27;m not familiar with since I&#x27;ve had a life long battle with cystic acne.</li>
            <li> Very good product. It works just as promised. I don&#x27;t see a huge difference, but I take very good care if my skin. I love this product. Ultima really works. No redness or irritation. My skin feels soft and holds moisturizer better when Ultima is under it.</li>
            <li> The product contains very little content.  Expensive.  Cannot tell it did anything for my skin.  Switched to a different brand.</li>
            <li> I use this serum in the morning and night and my skin feels very soft and wrinkles are much less visible.</li>
            <li> This is the best eye gel I have used - you don&#x27;t start trying to wipe it off halfway through the day.  Noticeable difference around the eyes as well.</li>
            <li> Thank you for an excellent product!  It came on time and it was packaged very carefully! Thank you for this wonderful product! It is very gentle and makes putting on makeup reallye easy too!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to all!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  I love the way it makes my skin feel!  I would most definitely recommend this to a friend!</li>
            <li> the product is sold as 100 ml , when it arrived it had 15 ml ; I think this is a scam it has happened to other buyers .&lt;br /&gt;I will be returning product</li>
            <li> I ordered ULTIMA PURE SWISS HYALURONIC ACID + VITAMIN C and this is very effective! I use it both as topical and dermaroller serum. It has a lifting, plumping, firming, brightening and tightening effects! Im done with my 1st bottle and i am waiting for the delivery of my second one! Im gonna use this product again and again:)</li>
            <li> I see a difference after only 3 applications, Eye wrinkles are diminishing. I am very pleased with the applicator, it keeps the product in the bottle clean..</li>
            <li> This is the first product I used that actually delivers. It really works. I love it and I will be a regular user and will recommend it to all my friends and family.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I really like this.  Even though the amount is small, it does go a long way.  I have already reordered as I do seem to notice a difference in the lines around my eyes and they are less puffy.</li>
            <li> This feel really nice going on.  I&#x27;m not sure if it changes the healing time.  I know this is a anti-aging serum, but the it cost a lot if I use this everyday.  I use other serums after.</li>
            <li> Disappointed by yet another &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; in a bottle. I am a 45-year old pre-menopausal woman, with several fine wrinkles, a few deeper wrinkles, several dark spots, uneven skin tone, and most noticeably, quite a lot of sagging and loss of firmness. Of course it didn&#x27;t help that when I was a lot younger, I completely ignored sunscreen. I enjoyed applying the product to my skin, which has a tendency to be somewhat sensitive. The serum felt great while applying it. It glided on my skin smoothly, was cool to the touch, and there was no overwhelming scent or stinging. Once applied, the serum dried quickly and my skin actually felt refreshed and somewhat firmer, particularly in the chin area. Unfortunately, I did not experience any long-term improvement in the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> I did not realize that there was a dropper in the bottle and I accidentally dropped the bottle and broke it. This actually was my fault, because on the box it said to use the drops.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t feel like serum but water and the package appeared tampered with...not sure where...possibly in transit...With the way things are these days...could have been opened by the Post office or such...just saying</li>
            <li> I chose this product because I have been in search of something that would help smooth my wrinkles and improve my overall skin tone and, for the most part,  it has DELIVERED and I intend to continue using this serum.</li>
            <li> Great Product. Great Price. Fast Delivery .</li>
            <li> Best serum I have ever used, it doesn&#x27;t burn, even after I have the microneedle, I will purchase it again!</li>
            <li> I have recently turned 50 and was searching for something to help hide/repair the wrinkles around my eyes and mouth.  I could tell a difference immediately after trying this product.  After washing my face each morning, I dot the serum around my eyes and mouth area and then gently rub it in to the areas that need work.  Once it&#x27;s dried I use my regular moisturizer on my face.  I sometimes touch up with more dabs of this serum throughout the day.  I can tell such a great difference in my appearance and my husband even noticed (unprovoked) and asked if I had snuck off and gotten a face lift because I keep looking younger!!:)  I bought more of this product and have been using it now for months and still love it.  My face even looks much younger now before using the serum each morning - so I feel that it has repaired some damage.  The small serum bottle lasts me about a month.</li>
            <li> Bottle was not sealed properly so most of the product was gone before it got to me; felt it may have lost its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I had researched several products and selected this one based on all the evidence.  I was so excited to get it.  I used it once.  Put it in the cabinet.  The next day, I opened the cabinet and it fell on the floor and shattered.  I&#x27;ll  have to save up to try again someday...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judy</li>
            <li> Seems to be great, only have been using it for a week.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a week and can notice an improvement over all.  My skin is smoother and softer. The lines around my eyes have deminished.</li>
            <li> The bottle is about half used and I haven&#x27;t found any difference, but I fill I am just to old. At 75, I don&#x27;t look my age but I don&#x27;t think this will work for me, yet I will continue to use it. Thank You anyways.</li>
            <li> I am not sure whether or not this product has actually improved the appearance of my fine lines and wrinkles--but I do know my skin looks and feels more hydrated.  The product absorbs rapidly into the skin and makeup can be applied over it with no problem.</li>
            <li> I need more. I think I&#x27;m going to buy it in bulk and give it to my friends for christmas!</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer after toning.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Quick shipping and packaged well.  After only a week I can notice a tremendous difference in my skin.  The fine lines around my eyes and mouth have diminished greatly!  My skin feels tighter and looks brighter!</li>
            <li> I bought it for my mom. She said it&#x27;s very good, not too oily not too dry. Good for skin.</li>
            <li> started using the product. really works! Just feel bad the bottle broke when it hit my granite counter:( a little flimsy bottle so got to be careful when using it.</li>
            <li> I used this per the directions and there was no change in my face at all. I feel I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> This is another awesome product for next to nothing. It works, of course, and I recommend this to anyone who wants to improve their skin (face and neck).</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product. It automatically tighten my skin while still looking natural.</li>
            <li> Is a great product. Keep healthy skin face</li>
            <li> Just received it last week so far I like the way it feels on my face. I will give more feedback later.</li>
            <li> I did not notice any fantastic results. Maybe I&#x27;m just old!!</li>
            <li> I was not happy when the product came and it looked like it had been used. There was no seal on it and there was liquid missing. I did not feel like trying it after that.</li>
            <li> I love the product but did not pay attention to the size of the item.  It was the size stated in the ad but did not last as long as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> Great product, love how it makes my skin feel, it seems to drink it right up with no residue after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tested several different hyaluronic acids out there and 180 Pure Swiss has given me the best results out of them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE 2-17-15*** (6 MONTH UPDATE)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to update on products that give me great results so I can share with other amazon customers and the 180 Cosmetics Pure Swiss Hyaluronic Acid has given me AMAZING RESULTS, so I need to share this information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been seeing fine lines/crows feet for a couple years and I wanted to find a product that would help slow this process down and after much research I found this Vitamin C Hyaluronic acid to be the most liked and let me tell you IT REALLY WORKS. I&#x27;ve been using it about 6 months now and the fine lines at the sides of my eyes are less visible. I found a product that really does what it claims it will and I am ecstatic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YOU MUST TRY THIS PRODUCT, YOU WON&#x27;T BE SORRY!</li>
            <li> I have been using for only a few weeks and I can already tell a difference in my wrinkles and age spots, can&#x27;t afford a face lift and not so sure that would be the way to go anyway but this product is great and does what it says it does , thanks for  hope of having beautiful skin again and I&#x27;m 57 so I need the help lol</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel nice not sure if it&#x27;s &amp;#34;Pure&amp;#34; anything but it does make the skin feel nice &amp; claims to help lock in moisture after washing face or showering</li>
            <li> Very good price for a fine product....I will order again if price remains the same; pretty fast delivery as well. Still using serum but seems to &#x27;working&#x27; as anticipated.  Thanks to the seller for offering it at such a savings</li>
            <li> This serum makes my face feel smooth and I love the base it gives my makeup.  Try it...it&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
            <li> This is, by far, the best facial product I&#x27;ve ever tried.  Results are immediate, &amp;#34;crows feet&amp;#34; virtually disappear and skin looks fresh, clean and tight (not dry and tight).  Best results if you let it soak in and dry completely before &amp;#34;layering&amp;#34; with your favorite moisturizer.  Amazon offers the best price out there for this serum.  If finances allowed for it, I&#x27;d buy it in bulk.  Although size is small, very little goes a very long way.  I ordered two additional bottles after two days to take advantage of my PRIME trial.  Will definitely reorder.  This serum has re-written my routine.  Important to apply to clean face~ I prefer a mild micro-cleanser to open pores for maximum absorption.</li>
            <li> Very gentle serum and it didn&#x27;t break me out.  My skin looked clearer and brighter after each use!  Shipped quickly!</li>
            <li> Only been using it for a few weeks now but it seems to be working pretty well.  My 15 year old son, bless his heart, says, &#x27;Mom, you really don&#x27;t look as old as you really are, even my friends think you&#x27;re my sister.&#x27;</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product, in fact, have purchased a second bottle.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> This has really helped the skin around my eyes to look firmer and younger, plus its effects last all day.</li>
            <li> This felt nice but I don&#x27;t know if it worked.</li>
            <li> I loved the serum.  It worked as well as a product I bought from my local med spa.  My skin felt fresh and looked healthier.  (then the bottle fell out of my medicine cabinet onto my sink and broke) I was only able to use it for a little over a week and I am still upset I wasn&#x27;t able to finish the bottle.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is the slight smell when you massage it into your skin. Can&#x27;t really describe it but it&#x27;s not nasty but maybe a bit herbal? I do like the who easy and fast it absorbs through the skin and leaves my skin glowing and healthy.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t see a difference</li>
            <li> It works!  everything that is promised.  from a 71 year 0ld woman!</li>
            <li> This is one the best products that I have ever used it makes my skin soft and tightens the skin.</li>
            <li> This product made my skin dry and made it peel even though I used a regular moisturizer afterwards.  Maybe this is what it is supposed to do - it is acid, but I had to suspend use after several days.  I will use up the bottle - maybe using only every other day. But probably will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is the third product from 180 that I&#x27;ve tried. It goes on great, leaves my skin feeling great, has a light fragrance and makes my skin look amazing. My mom has been using my bottle and is experiencing similar results. I love the packaging the bottle and dropper top are super classy looking and, that is important to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li> I refrigerated it as per a recommendation from another reviewer. I saw a visible difference after a few uses but, it is just too expensive and complicated (using a refrigerated product, my refrigerator is nowhere near my bathroom) to become a part of my everyday regimen.</li>
            <li> As I have aged, my upper eyes have drooped to the point where the fold was so deep that you could not really see any of my eyelid.  After about ten days of putting one small drop in the folds of my eyelids, you can see my eyelids again!!  Think what it is doing for the rest of my face!  Great Stuff.</li>
            <li> This was great at first but after 10 days the breakouts began. I coupled it with md forte 111 cleanser which is awesome. I was looking for a light anti aging moisturizer to go with it. If you do not have acne issues I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have used one bottle of this magic stuff and have just ordered my second one. This serum, by far, is the best wrinkle serum that I have ever used. In the one month I have seen marked improved in my skin. It goes on so smoothly and feels like silk. Not heavy, not greasy. We&#x27;ll worth the price. I recommend this product to any woman over 40 who wants a great product.</li>
            <li> Amazon has refunded my money and I have ordered your product again.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived half full. I believe the dropper has a leak. Hopefully I&#x27;ll&lt;br /&gt;be able to give you a fine review once I&#x27;ve tried it for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;Thnaks</li>
            <li> I like the product, for it makes my facial skin very smooth when I put it on.  However, after it sinks into the skin, I&#x27;m back to normal. I put it on in the a.m. and the p.m. but it doesn&#x27;t do a lot of tightening for very long.  For a woman of 67, my face has few wrinkles in it, just some lose skin under the eyes.  My cheeks are smooth.  I  had hoped that this product would tighten up the skin under my eyes, but it doesn&#x27;t last long enough to matter.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of serums like this one.  They have become a standard part of my skin care regimen.  It seems to me that they do lessen fine lines and they do lighten daker spots.  I have been using them for many many months.  This one is relatively new to me but I like the feel of this serum.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s lighter...it just feels light when it&#x27;s applied.  I use mine only at night...I gently rub it into fine lines...not that I have that many...lol...and it just seems to give my skin a refreshed look.&lt;br /&gt;My thank you to the manufacturer for finding me and asking me if I would try it out...I do and these are my honest thoughts!</li>
            <li> I had never used this product before but was pleasantly surprised.  I use RetinA at night and I use the Hyaluronic serum during the day.  It really gets rid of all the dead skin that the RetinA leaves and makes my skin feeling smooth and soft.  It does not irritate my skin.  The RetinA can be very harsh, but I have used it a long time.  I plan on buying the 180 pure swiss hyaluronic with peptides also..&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this serum twice a day since receiving it and I&#x27;ve noticed no change on my skin.  I will finish this bottle but at this time there&#x27;s no reason to order it again.</li>
            <li> I love the style like serumwhat I meant to say is I like it very much the price is reasonable and it makes my face looks so soft until so soft I&#x27;m 48 years old and at my age I need this since my body does not produce this in my skin anymore. I will buy this product again</li>
            <li> Great product for your face!</li>
            <li> I have 70 year old skin so I&#x27;m not expecting miracles - but - did notice a difference after less than a week.  The sinking of the skin around the wrinkles has definitely &amp;#34;plumped up&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;m lucky as the gals in my family always looked good, even in old age, due to youthful skin.  I&#x27;m hoping to keep it that way but don&#x27;t want surgery, injections and other nonsense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 180 Hyaluronic acid serum seems to be helping.  Don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d pay almost a hundred bucks a bottle but as long as it&#x27;s under $20 here on Amazon I&#x27;m going to continue.</li>
            <li> So far I really like this serum. It makes a difference in the smoothness of your skin immediately. I don&#x27;t like the smell though. It smells nasty.</li>
            <li> Received this broken in the mail.  Requested and received replacement... ALSO received broken so I was never able to use.</li>
            <li> After purchasing this I read that vitamin C is not stable in a clear container.</li>
            <li> I thought the new bottle was supposed to be OPAQUE BLUE., clear bottles are considered garbage they won&#x27;t work because if any natural light touches the serum it ruins the active ingredients. The bottle is tiny, I might be able to spread it out very carefully and get 10 days of use out of it. Kinda expensive when u look at it in the long run.. This stuff takes 6 months of silt use to REALLY give your skin the full benefits. - all of this info about the clear bottle and how long it will take is  all credible- through Dr Oz</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and my face was less red after only one application.</li>
            <li> It arrived almost empty  a couple of drops left. Leaked out in the box..the few drops I tried were awesome.. It was not the packaging.. There seemed to be no damage except a soggy box of Hyalunic acid with a greasy outside and a few drops left. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t gotten any younger LOL.</li>
            <li> Great ptoduct smooth on skin...love it!</li>
            <li> Just like the name states, I found Ultima to feel &amp;#34;Pure&amp;#34; as it penetrated my skin. With so many crucial vitamins and anti-aging ingredients, this packs it in for the price. :-) Love that the serum is not sticky and penetrates quickly. Skin feels more hydrated and plumper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d heard that hyaluronic acid was good, so I tried it - and at the price, it wouldn&#x27;t bother me if it didn&#x27;t work...  Well, I&#x27;ve been using it for three weeks, and I LOVE it!  I don&#x27;t put it on several times per day (as the bottle suggests) - only when I&#x27;m going out.  And damn if I don&#x27;t look GREAT!  My face seems to &#x27;puff&#x27; out a little (in a good way) and the lines seem to be gone.  Don&#x27;t know if this is a permanent change - but hey, I&#x27;m okay with a quick fix when I want it!  This is, possibly, the best product I&#x27;ve ever found in the &#x27;fountain of youth&#x27; category...</li>
            <li> es primera vez que utilizo el producto lo uso tanto en las ma&amp;ntilde;anas como en las noches lo recomiendo para las mujeres que tenemos esas arruguitas en la cara</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful!  I have ben useing it on my sunn damaged face fo a bout 3 weeks and the areas of damage are almost gone.  Rough skin around rhe top of my ears and on my forehead are rapidly going away. Even age spots are receding.  Thanks, you have a great priduct that really works.</li>
            <li> I have used three bottles and after three bottles you would think I&#x27;d see improvement in my skin.  I liked the feel of the product while using the first bottle, but I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement.  Since there&#x27;s actually very little serum in the bottle, I thought I&#x27;d try a second.  Nothing...I was given a third bottle by a friend who didn&#x27;t like it and I used it too.  I&#x27;m moving on to a new and better product!!!  Sorry.  I am happy to hear that it works for some.</li>
            <li> I like the serum and how it feels on my face. I would reccomend this product to many other people.</li>
            <li> I use it with the derma roller and it seems to be working fine. Not sure how to rate it overall, but the ingredients are good for my skin.</li>
            <li> Saw no difference since using it.  It was just a waste of money. Been using it since I bought it with no results.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this product. I read the reviews prior to ordering and because it was on daily deals for a good price I decided to try it. One of the reviews said that the product was like water and that reviewer would be correct the consistency is very light it is very &amp;#34;water-like&amp;#34; in texture. The description read &amp;#34;minimizes fine lines and moisturizes skin&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ve been using the product for at least a week and I do see results. I&#x27;m pleased with the results. This is not the product to use if you want miraculous overnight changes. The change to my skin has been a healthy one it is firm and the consistency feels strengthened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just reordered in August! I really enjoy the product: 180 Cosmetics,  Hyaluronic Acid Serum + Vitamin C.</li>
            <li> I have been using this now for almost 2 weeks and I don&#x27;t see any change in the elasticity of my skin.  My skin under my eyes and my neck have not changed one bit. Matter of fact, it&#x27;s made it even more dry than it&#x27;s been before. I have ordered this due to all the good reviews it had, but trust me when I say this, I&#x27;m very aware of all the fine lines I have and I see absolutely no change yet. Very disappointing. One thing that&#x27;s been working excellent for me thus far is Nivea.  The moment I put it on, it relaxes the dry skin and makes it smoother immediately. I was just looking to tighten the skin with something other than a moisturizer, and that is why i purchased this product.  Hoping that trying out for 2 more weeks will have better results.  I  do use it morning and night.</li>
            <li> good serum, reccommend</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels after using this serum.  I have noticed a reduction in the fine lines around my eyes.  I follow this with my moisturizer and my skins feels much more hydrated.</li>
            <li> I have noticed this has improved the surface of my face. The skin is tighter and smoother with the pores on my nose are deminishing. Awesome!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any real difference over anything else I use. It shows a little improvement, but nothing to rave home about. If the ingredients are trully natural, then it would be a preference over chemical based products at least.</li>
            <li> Great product! It really works!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after reading about the benefits of Hyaluronic Acid Serum for anti-aging. I was skeptical after a few nights of using his product, but stuck with it to discover that I am finding results with a healthier skin appearance  and feel. My sin feels softer and smoother while using this product with my prior moisture oil. I can say that I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I have been using it and I just don&#x27;t see a difference at all, my skin looks  and feels the same</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few of the other Hyaluronic Acid skin care products and this one has worked the best for my skin.  I am glad I found 180 Pure Swiss.</li>
            <li> My Wife loves this product. I have bought 8 of these bottles. They are small 1/2oz (15ml)but a little goes a long way. My wife wants me to order more bottles in the next few months. One bottle last about 1 monthy of nightly use.</li>
            <li> I really feel like this stuff was cheap because it is not the real stuff.  The label on the bottle has already rubbed off, just from holding it to open the cap, and the serum seems like a viscous water.  Doesn&#x27;t smell or have any kind of acidic taste.  Feel like this was a waste of money. I also don&#x27;t see any sort of anti-aging going on.</li>
            <li> Good stuff!  It works well to improve skin condition.</li>
            <li> As a forty-something woman, I decided I needed to start taking better care of my skin.  I researched many options and found this to have great reviews and the approach I was looking for.  I have used it for a week and my skin feels great!! I use it nightly and will order it again.</li>
            <li> This is a good product and it worked as it should.  My only complaint is that it didn&#x27;t last long enough. . 2 1/2 wks, so I am not able to afford it twice a month.</li>
            <li> Too soon to see any results, I guess. Really hoping for some wrinkle reduction and tightening.i am using it as recommended.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product it works.</li>
            <li> Not any positive results that I can see.</li>
            <li> When the first item arrived it was a malfunctioned bottle like someone used it with half of the liquid inside. After complaining they sent me a knew one which came great the second time. So just started back using the product again.</li>
            <li> I used this today and it really perked up my complexion. It&#x27;s pretty fantastic. I usually order a different brand that costs less for more product, but in like that this has vitamin c. Great bargain and arrived fast.</li>
            <li> LOVE!!  Yes, it is a tiny bottle.  Yes, the serum is lightweight like a water-pack (like Korean hydrating masks).  But, you only need one drop to cover your entire face and neck. And, it truly does give you an immediate feeling of hydration, toning, tightening, lifting.  It absorbs like a dream, literally like water, but slightly thicker.  It has no smell at all.  I have zero skin sensitivity toward this product and I have sensitive skin.  No breakouts, no over-production of oil, no drying or cracking at all.  Just the feeling of pure hydration and healthy, happy skin!</li>
            <li> The product is too watery.  I&#x27;ve used other brands of  hyaluronic acid, and they have a thicker consistency than this.  I&#x27;ve finished a bottle and didn&#x27;t see much difference. I will definitely switch to the pure hyaluronic acid that I used before.</li>
            <li> I can see the different in my skin after 2 weeks usage. My skin feels more smooth and shine. A+</li>
            <li> Still too early to know of definitive or lasting results, but it feels light and non-greasy and I can put sunscreen on top for daytime.</li>
            <li> smooth skin in one week of use. awesome! But would like a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> I just give 2 stars because I have been using it since 3 months and I don&#x27;t really see a change....</li>
            <li> the product is way too watery and therefore hard to use because it runs down your fingers before you have a chance to get it on your skin.</li>
            <li> I love this! my face firms up like when i use grape extract facial peal. This is awesome and it last all day! This will be one of my permanent products.</li>
            <li> Works wonders, but I received product partially used in damaged box...was disappointed about used product.</li>
            <li> Loved the way it applies on the face and cools the skin.</li>
            <li> Really like the product.  At first, I had to use a lot more than I do now.  My face must have needed it desperately!</li>
            <li> After reading so many five-star reviews, I started out with high hopes, but for me, this product does the opposite of what I expected from those majority reviews and the description advertised.  Every day for three weeks I carefully followed all directions that came with the product.  In the first few days, although I was disappointed that my skin seemed drier, instead of smoother, I thought I should faithfully continue, in order to give the product a fair chance.  When my face became more dry, rough, and leathery--more wrinkly!--than ever before, I decided I should stop, as I feared the apparent damage might become permanent. Fortunately, when I went back to using Curel Ultra Healing lotion, my skin smoothness and softness was immediately restored to pre-180 Serum state, and I did not have to waste time with some application ritual nor go through the process and expense of reordering a tiny bottle of serum every couple of months. I am relieved that I did not pay so much for this product that I would bother to send it back for a refund, but this experience has lowered my confidence in positive customer reviews at Amazon. On the positive side, this product reminded me to pause, self-reflect, chuckle, and recalibrate my level of vanity.</li>
            <li> My wife has used this product for a week and likes it.</li>
            <li> received as promised, thank you</li>
            <li> I have been using this product as instructed by the manufacturer for 1 monrh. I see no difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product for the money!</li>
            <li> I use it in conjunction with a Derma Roller and can already see a reduction in fine lines.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a few weeks with no big difference</li>
            <li> Seems to work for tightening up the skin. Not really any better than some of the others on the market.</li>
            <li> This product really work!  After ordering one bottle and seeing wrinkles dissappear in just 2 weeks I had to order another.</li>
            <li> It all leaked out of the bottle when it arrived.</li>
            <li> Not thrilled with this product. It just seems to NOT help my facical problems at all.I am really disapointef.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost down with the jar (I&#x27;ve had it a month) and I don&#x27;t see any difference before or after using it.  Maybe it&#x27;s a long-term thing.</li>
            <li> Results are better than expected.  Very happy.</li>
            <li> it is still early to qualify it.</li>
            <li> I am using the serum with phytoceramides and in less than a month the results are amazing!  I am 67, and my sister is ordering the same product I use because lines on my face are disappearing!!!</li>
            <li> I have not had my order long enough to make a comment, other than it is smooth and tightens my skin.  I think it should be sold in a larger size to actually use it over an extended time.  I think this size might only last about a month, if that, as it is recommended to use on the entire face. Is there an exfoliating product to enhance the use of this skin serum?</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel nice.</li>
            <li> No noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> I feel my skin softer since I am using this product. Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> This serum leaves skin feeling incredibly soft, shrinks the appearance of pores.  Make-up glides on effortlessly over it.  This is a moisturizer, and while it certainly keeps skin supple all day, it also seems to provide some level of oil control.  My face feels as good at the end of the day as it does at the beginning.</li>
            <li> Too early to tell.  Very tiny bottle</li>
            <li> AMAZING product.  I didn&#x27;t think it would work as well as it did.  My skin is \\&quot;plump\\&quot; looking now, with a bit of that dewy look.  You can&#x27;t stop the march of time, but you can at least slow it down, and this product is a must have in my time-fighter toolbox.</li>
            <li> Amazing product!!! Cant get enough of it especially in the dry climate I live in!</li>
            <li> Very small amount for price. No results noted as compared to similar products.</li>
            <li> This producted did not really work for me as I hope, May try another type of hyaluronic  acid or a different product,</li>
            <li> This serum is not cheap and I looked fantastic until the bottle was empty.  I found something better so I will not be buying this one again.</li>
            <li> I have used more than half of the product and did not see any differences.&lt;br /&gt;If I uses it along, my skin would feel very dry. I have to use another facial cream over it.</li>
            <li> thanks to the seller.good quality.it&#x27;s a little dry skin, but it helps to moisturize:)I want a large volume.....buy more, I hope for a better offer</li>
            <li> I have a very difficult time finding products for my face that I&#x27;m not allergic to,  I took a chance on this.  I use it every morning, and maybe I shouldn&#x27;t use as much as I do, but hey, if it&#x27;s not broken, don&#x27;t fit it.  My facial skin appears to be glowing and I don&#x27;t notice the lines a much.  I also put in on my neck.  I am 54, and never have done a facial regiment, which I think it&#x27;s in my best interest to do, but with sensitive skin, it&#x27;s scarey do just put anything on your face.  So, in short, I love this product, it has a thickness to it it&#x27;s not watery, but it&#x27;s not paste either.  I like my glowing skin.</li>
            <li> This tightens your skin immediately. I have some fine lines chasing me into my thirties that terrify me. I put this on and magically they disappear. I&#x27;m sure with regular use the impact would be greater. Definitely a snake oil worth the price and inflated confidence.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this serum because I have very dry skin on my face. I was hoping it would add moisture and make my skin feel soft again. Since I started using it I have noticed a huge difference  in my skin. It has made my skin softer, and look younger. I would defintely recommend this to anyone looking for a Hyaluronic Acid Serum.</li>
            <li> I do like this serum, but it only came a 1/2 filled not full bottle😔 I was disappointed</li>
            <li> it really does do what people say on the other reviews. i really like it i use it before i apply my makeup and fine lines and over all skin texture just become so youthful. it soaks it so quit non greasy just so easy all u do is add a few drops and wow what a difference. in pictures my skin looks like its of a 15 yr old girl, amazing.</li>
            <li> I am 27 and really wanted to boost my skins vitality. I am terrified of wrinkles and want to keep my skin looking great forever. I was told by an esthetician friend of mine that the best defense is a good moisturizer, I found this product, read some reviews and gave it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot believe how well this serum works. I use it on my face and neck and immediately feel a tightness. My skin looks so much better under my foundation! I also have the WORST winter lips imaginable and have been a slave to my Chapstick. I rubbed this serum on my lips one time and it completely took care of the cracking and peeling in one day.&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy I found this and at such a good price. This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> I like it.  It makes my skin soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> nice produc ,  I use this with my Tria, o my spatula  galvanic, help to keep the skin firm, and radiant, an is my secon serum.love it.</li>
            <li> I will be getting more of this serum. It really helps your skin to look younger. I use it everyday and will continue to use..</li>
            <li> I can see an improvement after a week of use!</li>
            <li> I am almost 40 and have started noticing fine lines and wrinkles.  So far I haven&#x27;t noticed a real difference in lines/wrinkles but I do feel like my skin is getting smoother and maybe firmer.  I am going to continue to use it to give it more time.&lt;br /&gt;It is thick which means a little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> This serum leaves skin feeling incredibly soft, great for the pores. . Make-up glides on effortlessly over it. This is a moisturizer, and make skins soft. I have given this product to my mother and she loves it also.</li>
            <li> First time user; so far so good</li>
