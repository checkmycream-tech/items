            <li>I was sceptical,  but i cant believe it hasnt gain more popularity...</li>
            <li>I love Unwash.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair that tends to get oily quickly</li>
            <li>and I use about a quarter size to clean my hair.  </li>
            <li>I clean my scalp and then run my finger though my hair to distribute the Unwash.  </li>
            <li>This product line is wonderful but don&#x27;t be a sucker and pay $90 for the pack of 3.</li>
            <li>so far a better product for my fine curly hair.</li>

            <li>It can&#x27;t wait to see how it works on those hot humid days.</li>
            <li>I love the low poo shampooos!.  </li>
            <li>Only used wash so far and love it!</li>
            <li>switch between this and my purple shampoo, and I love the way unwash leaves the colour of my hair better than purple shampoo; it tones down any brassiness and looks so natural; and it eliminates one step in the shower which is another bonus!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel so soft and clean.</li>
            <li>but this Unwash leaves my hair feeling more natural and soft</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I received a sample size of Unwash in my Glossybox a few months ago and promptly fell in love!  </li>
            <li>So much easier to apply than wen.</li>
            <li>This did wonders for my hair, no frizz &amp; much shinier.</li>
            <li>Hair left very soft and feels clean</li>
            <li>i have rather sensitive skin, and these products are very soothing and the weekly treatment especially leaves my hair super soft!</li>
            <li>There is no worry about itchy scalp (even in winter) and it leaves my hair feeling very soft.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels light, not weighed down.</li>
            <li>Really took all product out of my hair, but Not dry, or squeaky</li>
            <li>So far this product is working well to eliminate friz caused by humidity.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>Using all three makes my hair feel far too oily feeling.</li>
            <li>so it was only a few dollars more that the salon set.  </li>
            <li>It feels weird when you&#x27;re washing your hair with it especially when your hair is super greasy because you dont think it will come out clean, but it does for me!</li>
            <li>and you really do need to wash less using this type of priduct.  </li>

            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t dry out my ends either.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural oils, so it&#x27;s not left limp and dried</li>
            <li> I wish this brand would come out with a dry shampoo because I just know it would rock my world too!</li>
            <li> I have used the Bio-Cleansing Conditioner a few days in a row and my hair is soft, shiny and does not feel weighed down at all.  </li>
            <li> There is not really a way to figure out which is the shampoo.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a bit expensive when you first see the cost</li>
            <li> If you can get past the price and the fact that it will not lather and to use a regular amount of this shampoo you will like what it does to your hair!</li>
            <li> I had less hair loss when combing out as the comb just slide through effortlessly.</li>
            <li> Still a little skeptic</li>
            <li> I bought a few samples from my hair salon</li>
            <li> I bought this product on Amazon and have been using it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to use this.  </li>
            <li> this is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> last week I tried my salon shampoo and was shocked at how my hair felt(almost like straw).</li>
            <li> so I was skeptical that this product wouldn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy.  </li>
            <li> The cleansing conditioner makes my hair look so dirty and oily.</li>
            <li> My experience with this product was extremely unpleasant.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s insanely overpriced!!!!</li>
            <li> It had a nasty coating on it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is insane.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> The cleansing conditioner makes my hair look so dirty and oily. I have tried it several times. The rinse and conditioner are okay but not great - definitely not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I received a sample size of Unwash in my Glossybox a few months ago and promptly fell in love!  I&#x27;ve since bought it here along with the once a week build up cleanser and masque.  My hair has never looked and felt so good, it&#x27;s shiny, soft, manageable and all around awesome.  I know this is pricey but you&#x27;re replacibg TWO products with one and you really do need to wash less using this type of priduct.  I go three days between washes now when I used to wash my hair daily!  I wish this brand would come out with a dry shampoo because I just know it would rock my world too!</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel so soft and clean. It feels like all the product is lifted. My hair feels light, not weighed down.</li>
            <li> Only used wash so far and love it! Hair left very soft and feels clean</li>
            <li> I never thought that I would use a product like this! I bought a few samples from my hair salon and I loved it. I bought this product on Amazon and have been using it for a few weeks.Still a little skeptic last week I tried my salon shampoo and was shocked at how my hair felt(almost like straw). I totally love this product!!!</li>
            <li> i have rather sensitive skin, and these products are very soothing and the weekly treatment especially leaves my hair super soft!</li>
            <li> I love this product but..Um..$90?  it&#x27;s cheaper to buy these separate. it was $70.00 for the &amp;#34;value pack&amp;#34; of all 3.. this is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty amazing!  I was going to wait until I had used all 3 products in the kit to write a review, but I just couldn&#x27;t.  I have used the Bio-Cleansing Conditioner a few days in a row and my hair is soft, shiny and does not feel weighed down at all.  I have fine hair that tends to get oily quickly so I was skeptical that this product wouldn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy.  Not to mention that my hair has never been this easy to comb out!  I have been trying to move away from traditional shampoo and conditioner for years but could never quite make the switch.  Unwash seems to be perfect for my hair and I&#x27;m so happy.  I can&#x27;t wait to try the Anti-Residue Rinse &amp; Hydrating Masque when needed.</li>
            <li> I have the conditioner that replaces shampoo and I love it. It feels weird when you&#x27;re washing your hair with it especially when your hair is super greasy because you dont think it will come out clean, but it does for me! And it doesn&#x27;t dry out my ends either.&lt;br /&gt;I switch between this and my purple shampoo, and I love the way unwash leaves the colour of my hair better than purple shampoo; it tones down any brassiness and looks so natural; and it eliminates one step in the shower which is another bonus!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t even need to add product to my hair before styling; as this gives me enough body as it doesn&#x27;t strip my hair of it&#x27;s natural oils, so it&#x27;s not left limp and dried out.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the price, IMO</li>
            <li> So far this product is working well to eliminate friz caused by humidity.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Got it in my Glossybox and bought all three products based on the wash conditioner.  So much easier to apply than wen. so far a better product for my fine curly hair. Does not leave it greasy, esp next day.  Anti-residue rinse is amazing.  Really took all product out of my hair, but Not dry, or squeaky Used the hydrating masque immediately after, and let it sit.  Rinses well, and hair was shiny, and amazing  Ab Fab!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using Wen for years and I still love it but this Unwash leaves my hair feeling more natural and soft like there is no product left in it like the Wen makes my hair feel.  I will definitely by this again.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft. It can&#x27;t wait to see how it works on those hot humid days.</li>
            <li> This product line is wonderful but don&#x27;t be a sucker and pay $90 for the pack of 3. That&#x27;s insanely overpriced!!!!</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin or breakout easily, use with caution.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to use this.  There is not really a way to figure out which is the shampoo.  There are times I would like to just shampoo my hair without the other two but nothing indicates….which one it is.  I wish there is a way to tell.  Using all three makes my hair feel far too oily feeling.</li>
            <li> This did wonders for my hair, no frizz &amp; much shinier. I had less hair loss when combing out as the comb just slide through effortlessly. After using the hair masque my daughter said it looked like I just colored my hair (which I&#x27;m way overdue for). I&#x27;m so thankful to have found this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get the positive reviews. My experience with this product was extremely unpleasant. After using it my shower walls were covered in what looked like Ajax. My hair looked gray (and I do not have gray hair) and dingy. It had a nasty coating on it. It looked dirtier after I used the product than before using it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is insane.  Its that good.  I was sceptical,  but i cant believe it hasnt gain more popularity...</li>
            <li> I love Unwash.  My curly, frizzie and crazy hair is easier to manage and looks healthy and shiny. Unwash is great!</li>
            <li> I love the low poo shampooos!.  Unwash cleans my scalp and hair.  There is no worry about itchy scalp (even in winter) and it leaves my hair feeling very soft.  THERE IS NO SUDS/LATHER with a low poo shampoo!  I have above shoulder curly hair and I use about a quarter size to clean my hair.  I clean my scalp and then run my finger though my hair to distribute the Unwash.  I leave it on while I continue with my shower and then rinse.  It&#x27;s a bit expensive when you first see the cost but I bought a salon low-poo shampoo and conditioner for about the same cast as the Unwash which doesn&#x27;t need a conditioner so it was only a few dollars more that the salon set.  Low-poo shampoos are great for curly hair!  If you can get past the price and the fact that it will not lather and to use a regular amount of this shampoo you will like what it does to your hair!</li>
