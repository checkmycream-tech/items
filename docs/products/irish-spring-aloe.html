            <li>Its a great body wash for keeping backne in check.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>It works well, smells good and lathers up real nice which is a bonus.</li>
            <li>The 2% salicylic acid concentration works well for me, and has been very effective in decreasing acne.</li>
            <li>The smell is very nice, too.</li>
            <li>Not quite great, but good.</li>
            <li>I tried this and loved it.</li>
            <li>; provides a good body wash with the benefit of some acne clearing/preventing properties.  </li>
            <li>: I use this body wash because it is a good wash</li>
            <li>Good scent too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Neutrogena 2% salicylic acid wash for years and have been very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I am VERY satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>Scent is not too powerful and great!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>amazing.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice too.</li>
            <li>Months after using just Phisoderm--which is also very effective but scent free, it is nice to have the added scent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful, smells great</li>
            <li>Has a very nice fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li>It is good for mild acne and you can use it all over (except face) if you bring it to the gym or whatever.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as effective as salicylic acid, but pretty good for soap that smells like it&#x27;s okay for a man to use.</li>
            <li>If one does, I certainly haven&#x27;t found it, but this body wash is a great start.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>with the scent, I&#x27;ll be buying more of this.</li>
            <li>I love this body wash.</li>
            <li>My sons love it.</li>
            <li>Even some of the scarring from problem zits that either returned more times than I can count or were the size of a Cadillac Escalade began to disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and we start seeing it in stores more often.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed I tend to not have as many breakouts after using this stuff.</li>
            <li>This is a great scent as well, fresh and clean smelling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not horrible, but it sort of smells like those strong air fresheners.</li>
            <li>Great stuff keeps skin clear.!</li>
            <li>I tried for the first time and bought these yesterday at a local drug store (ran out so did&#x27;t want to wait 2 days), they smell great and feels great on the skin.</li>
            <li>; at a fraction of the price.&lt;br /&gt;And it has a nice light clean smell not a fruity one.</li>
            <li>and it has worked great to keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li>This one is nice, because of the fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>It is a good body wash which lathers up very well and is easy on your skin.  </li>
            <li>I love the original but</li>
            <li>This body wash has a nice refreshing scent and keeps my body clear of blemishes.</li>
            <li>its just not for me, the fragrance is too light.</li>
            <li>What impressed me about this body wash is that it does not dry your skin out if you use it frequently.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a significant difference in it clearing up my skin, even with the 2% salicylic acid that&#x27;s in it.  </li>
            <li>However this can become costly showering more often when it is hot.  </li>
            <li>I have used neutrogena and phisoderm body washes in the past but this works the best</li>
            <li>Overall is a good body- wash.</li>
            <li>After using it my skin felt fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently on my second bottle and am overall impressed.</li>
            <li>I noticed an almost immediate improvement in my body acne albeit a somewhat mild one.</li>
            <li>wash is best for folks with normal to oily skin, as it has little skin moisturizers.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend the Panoxyl 10% bar which is good stuff, but only use once a day at first.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, the scent does not linger much after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a fresh scent also.</li>
            <li>best price I have ever paid for this was 2.99 so 5 dollars was not really a great price.</li>
            <li>This is just as effective and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>I am clean, I smell good all day, and my skin is as clear as can be expected.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel clean, clear and fresh.  </li>
            <li>This is a great body wash for men, I use it every day after a sweaty workout at the gym or after a hard days work.</li>
            <li>I actually like this product more than benzoyl peroxide soaps or washes.</li>
            <li>I have used this stuff since it first came out in the stores.  </li>
            <li>If you have more moderate to severe acne</li>
            <li>Used to be able to buy this locally, but cannot find it anywhere anymore.</li>
            <li>It proved excellent on oil, acne and grime but was unable to remove the rust from powertools.</li>
            <li>Will try the bar version next time but not an acne soap for sure.</li>
            <li>but I found this one seems to still leave skin smooth and comfortable, rather than dry and ashy.</li>
            <li>This body wash isn&#x27;t what I was looking for, the smell isn&#x27;t that pleasant, unlike other Irish spring products that have a stronger smell, which I perfer, its not a bad product</li>
            <li>Not bad but far from clearing skin!  </li>
            <li>It surely smells fresh and clean just like the regular Irish Spring without all the dyes.&lt;br /&gt;L.</li>
            <li>I saw this Irish Spring soap and had hopes that it would smell like Irish Spring, and do a good job.</li>
            <li>the Clear and Fresh Skin body wash does exactly that.  </li>
            <li>Given that a 15 ounce bottle of Irish Spring was, at the time I bought it, less costly than a 6 ounce bottle of Neutrogena, that&#x27;s a great savings!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent is fresh and clean but tends to not stick around for very long.</li>
            <li>It works really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Irish Spring Body Wash, Clear and Fresh Skin&amp;#34</li>
            <li>The sent is fresh and not overly masculine or feminine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a cure-all, but it does its job very well.</li>
            <li>It works really well if you have issues with acne and saves you a lot of time by just putting your acne treatment in your body wash.</li>
            <li>I Have very oily acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I find 2% salicylic acid to be an effective daily body wash for my back acne issues.  </li>
            <li>and it certainly doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts like so many other products do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a HUGE fan of the classic Irish Spring Body Wash, so I figured i&#x27;d give this a go.  </li>
            <li>I like the original Irish Spring scent.</li>
            <li>This one especially, make your body feel extremely clean.  </li>
            <li>Neutrogena&#x27;s body wash for acne tended to dry my skin out more with frequent use.</li>
            <li>Irish Spring&#x27;s product is cheaper, double the size and works better than Avon&#x27;s product for me.</li>
            <li>Bought several bottles and will buy several more.</li>
            <li>On top of my facial acne issues to boot, having it on the back is just adding insult to injury.</li>
            <li>Clears up the (b)acne decently.</li>
            <li>So far I am very satisfied.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am incredibly pleased and will continue to use this product for as long as Irish Spring produces it</li>
            <li>Scent lasting for 8 hrs is enough, I don&#x27;t need this strong of a smell longer than that.</li>
            <li>By the way, I tried Avon&#x27;s new acne clearing body wash, you&#x27;ll see it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It easily opens up and nearly half of one bottles content had leaked and was all over the box.</li>
            <li>While the Neutrogena smells basically just like soap, the Irish Spring has a pretty noticeably scent.</li>
            <li>but it actually works which is more than I can say for any of the other products I tried.</li>
            <li>I feel like this thing made me break out more than usual.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it on my face, its a little strong for my face.</li>
            <li>The price is far from realistic at nearly nine bucks for a 15 ounce bottle.  </li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t as strong or long lasting as the classic, it doesn&#x27;t wash off as easily, and it only lathers up about half as well.  </li>
            <li>I found the Irish Spring not only works just a good if not better than the Neutrogena Brand.  </li>
            <li>I have been using bodywashes for years to clear my skin.</li>
            <li>As a young dude.</li>
            <li>Gentle enough without the fabric bleaching issues found with benzoyl peroxide.  </li>
            <li>However, problem areas for adult acne still require medication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li>So far I have been using it for a week.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does not get rid of your back pimples completely and this has to be my third bottle worth of showers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, this has a very strong scent similar to Irish Spring bar soap, which I like but others may want a product with less scent.</li>
            <li>You can use it like you would an ordinary body wash and it will keep very mild acne at bay.  </li>
            <li>and I highly recommend those in a situation similar to mine</li>
            <li>I have tried lots of different acne body washes and body scrubs as I have severe back acne, and although none of the products really is a miracle cure, I have continued to use them because at least I believe they won&#x27;t cause acne unlike many soap products.</li>
            <li>Some people are very sensitive to it, and it can cause your skin to become red and irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does clear up breakouts and keep them from coming back.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for an anti-acne body wash with pretty much no success for a while now until I gave this a try.</li>
            <li>Sometimes with these products things have to get worse before they get better.</li>
            <li>My skin is a little bit clearer (not bad for only a week), and it smells like Irish Spring.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really have the fragrance strength of other body</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands, but while cheaper, they are also far more watered down, so the actual savings (in terms of number of uses per bottle) is not much.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t the worst body wash I&#x27;ve ever used, but i&#x27;m far from impressed and will not be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li>The breakouts I do get are less severe, and the body wash fights them away much faster than were</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just as thick as the Neutrogena, so you only need a small amount for effective results.</li>
            <li>As a person with rather oily skin, I very much appreciate the lack of excessive moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a HUGE fan of the classic Irish Spring Body Wash, so I figured i&#x27;d give this a go.  </li>
            <li> I like the original Irish Spring scent.</li>
            <li> This one especially, make your body feel extremely clean.  </li>
            <li> Neutrogena&#x27;s body wash for acne tended to dry my skin out more with frequent use.</li>
            <li> Irish Spring&#x27;s product is cheaper, double the size and works better than Avon&#x27;s product for me.</li>
            <li> Bought several bottles and will buy several more.</li>
            <li> On top of my facial acne issues to boot, having it on the back is just adding insult to injury.</li>
            <li> Clears up the (b)acne decently.</li>
            <li> So far I am very satisfied.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am incredibly pleased and will continue to use this product for as long as Irish Spring produces it</li>
            <li> Scent lasting for 8 hrs is enough, I don&#x27;t need this strong of a smell longer than that.</li>
            <li> By the way, I tried Avon&#x27;s new acne clearing body wash, you&#x27;ll see it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It easily opens up and nearly half of one bottles content had leaked and was all over the box.</li>
            <li> While the Neutrogena smells basically just like soap, the Irish Spring has a pretty noticeably scent.</li>
            <li> but it actually works which is more than I can say for any of the other products I tried.</li>
            <li> I feel like this thing made me break out more than usual.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it on my face, its a little strong for my face.</li>
            <li> The price is far from realistic at nearly nine bucks for a 15 ounce bottle.  </li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t as strong or long lasting as the classic, it doesn&#x27;t wash off as easily, and it only lathers up about half as well.  </li>
            <li> I found the Irish Spring not only works just a good if not better than the Neutrogena Brand.  </li>
            <li> I have been using bodywashes for years to clear my skin.</li>
            <li> As a young dude.</li>
            <li> Gentle enough without the fabric bleaching issues found with benzoyl peroxide.  </li>
            <li> However, problem areas for adult acne still require medication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li> So far I have been using it for a week.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not get rid of your back pimples completely and this has to be my third bottle worth of showers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, this has a very strong scent similar to Irish Spring bar soap, which I like but others may want a product with less scent.</li>
            <li> You can use it like you would an ordinary body wash and it will keep very mild acne at bay.  </li>
            <li> and I highly recommend those in a situation similar to mine</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of different acne body washes and body scrubs as I have severe back acne, and although none of the products really is a miracle cure, I have continued to use them because at least I believe they won&#x27;t cause acne unlike many soap products.</li>
            <li> Some people are very sensitive to it, and it can cause your skin to become red and irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does clear up breakouts and keep them from coming back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an anti-acne body wash with pretty much no success for a while now until I gave this a try.</li>
            <li> Sometimes with these products things have to get worse before they get better.</li>
            <li> My skin is a little bit clearer (not bad for only a week), and it smells like Irish Spring.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really have the fragrance strength of other body</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands, but while cheaper, they are also far more watered down, so the actual savings (in terms of number of uses per bottle) is not much.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t the worst body wash I&#x27;ve ever used, but i&#x27;m far from impressed and will not be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> The breakouts I do get are less severe, and the body wash fights them away much faster than were</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just as thick as the Neutrogena, so you only need a small amount for effective results.</li>
            <li> As a person with rather oily skin, I very much appreciate the lack of excessive moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , if you have a W4LGREEN5 near you, they sell it for the same price as Amazon, and occasionally on sale for less.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t last long because it doesn&#x27;t lather well.</li>
            <li> Sure enough, the zits started to become less frequent and less angry when they did appear.</li>
            <li> first, my bacne actually got worse.</li>
            <li> This soap clears it up almost immediately and when he uses any other soap the acne is back immediately.</li>
            <li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a few days and already noticed my back clearing up.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it is pretty difficult to find in stores, which is why I bought it here.</li>
            <li> other tip</li>
            <li> He won&#x27;t go for other brands now.</li>
            <li> A lot of the acne body washes will be overly drying on skin due to the salicylic acid</li>
            <li> I use it in conjunction with Physoderm, every other day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it would have the same effect all by itself, but it does help to maintain.</li>
            <li> My skin has improved extremely.</li>
            <li> out there are either obnoxiously expensive or smell way too much like flowers for a man&#x27;s taste.</li>
            <li> However, the price has been steadily creeping up to the point where it&#x27;s gotten quite expensive.</li>
            <li> Usually when I have a blemish appear, it&#x27;s when I&#x27;ve used other body washes or soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately prolonged use doesn&#x27;t seem to help my acne at all beyond that original change, it merely keeps it at the reduced level.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect and won&#x27;t totally fix your body acne</li>
            <li> get me wrong, I still have breakouts on my back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned this the hard way unfortuntely over the years</li>
            <li> I wish this wasn&#x27;t so hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers did not emphasized enough on this point but after using this body wash, I hate my body odor.</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with this product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great face wash for teens.  Same medication as the &amp;#34;face washes&amp;#34; at a fraction of the price.&lt;br /&gt;And it has a nice light clean smell not a fruity one.</li>
            <li> Soap smells the best.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It clears your skin and smells awesome. Unfortunately it is pretty difficult to find in stores, which is why I bought it here. Roll Tide.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Neutrogena 2% salicylic acid wash for years and have been very pleased with it. However, the price has been steadily creeping up to the point where it&#x27;s gotten quite expensive. I&#x27;ve tried other brands, but while cheaper, they are also far more watered down, so the actual savings (in terms of number of uses per bottle) is not much. Also, some have only a 1% concentration of salicylic acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Irish Spring version is the exception. It&#x27;s just as thick as the Neutrogena, so you only need a small amount for effective results. It has the same 2% salicylic concentration as Neutrogena. Given that a 15 ounce bottle of Irish Spring was, at the time I bought it, less costly than a 6 ounce bottle of Neutrogena, that&#x27;s a great savings!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside is the scent. While the Neutrogena smells basically just like soap, the Irish Spring has a pretty noticeably scent. It&#x27;s not horrible, but it sort of smells like those strong air fresheners. Fortunately, the scent does not linger much after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with the scent, I&#x27;ll be buying more of this. The 2% salicylic acid concentration works well for me, and has been very effective in decreasing acne. Note: if you&#x27;ve never used a salicylic acid-based soap before, try it once then wait a day to see if there&#x27;s a reaction. Some people are very sensitive to it, and it can cause your skin to become red and irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this is marketed as a body wash, I use it as a face wash. Works great.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than neutrogena but the same result. I bought the six pack and my only gripe is the lid of the bottle. It easily opens up and nearly half of one bottles content had leaked and was all over the box.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now. I put a gob of it on my wash cloth, lather it up, then apply to chest, back, arms or anywhere I need it. I don&#x27;t use it on my face, its a little strong for my face. It works well, smells good and lathers up real nice which is a bonus. Also, it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin. I actually like this product more than benzoyl peroxide soaps or washes. This is just as effective and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin. It also comes in a generous sized bottle for $4.00, how can you beat that?  This is a great body wash for men, I use it every day after a sweaty workout at the gym or after a hard days work. By the way, I tried Avon&#x27;s new acne clearing body wash, you&#x27;ll see it here on Amazon. Irish Spring&#x27;s product is cheaper, double the size and works better than Avon&#x27;s product for me. Plus Avon&#x27;s body wash smells like chemicals, yuk.</li>
            <li> I am an Irish Spring person.  This one especially, make your body feel extremely clean.  I love the original but the Clear and Fresh Skin body wash does exactly that.  It makes your skin feel clean, clear and fresh.  You cannot go wrong with this product. It&#x27;s excellent. it came on time and I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers did not emphasized enough on this point but after using this body wash, I hate my body odor.</li>
            <li> I get acne on my hips and this definitely has helped keep it under control.  It&#x27;s not some miracle that makes it go away to never return, but it has definitely reduced outbreaks.  Usually when I have a blemish appear, it&#x27;s when I&#x27;ve used other body washes or soap.</li>
            <li> I tried this and loved it. It does clear up breakouts and keep them from coming back. The smell is nice too. Overall is a good body- wash.</li>
            <li> This body wash isn&#x27;t what I was looking for, the smell isn&#x27;t that pleasant, unlike other Irish spring products that have a stronger smell, which I perfer, its not a bad product its just not for me, the fragrance is too light.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash. The scent remains on your body even after an hour of showering. This is the product I ever wanted that I never got.</li>
            <li> I have used this stuff since it first came out in the stores.  It is a good body wash which lathers up very well and is easy on your skin.  I use it on my chest and back for body acne.  It is good for mild acne and you can use it all over (except face) if you bring it to the gym or whatever. What impressed me about this body wash is that it does not dry your skin out if you use it frequently. Neutrogena&#x27;s body wash for acne tended to dry my skin out more with frequent use. You can use it like you would an ordinary body wash and it will keep very mild acne at bay.  It has a fresh scent also. If you have more moderate to severe acne I would recommend the Panoxyl 10% bar which is good stuff, but only use once a day at first. Panoxyl dries up acne and your skin.</li>
            <li> As a young dude. It works really well.&lt;br /&gt;It smells awesome and your body will smell so great you wont even need to use cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diffidently the best and my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;Also try to get a big bottle cuz it runs out quick.&lt;br /&gt;Also sometimes i can&#x27;t find it in walmart so i have to order from here.</li>
            <li> I like this body wash.  I find 2% salicylic acid to be an effective daily body wash for my back acne issues.  Gentle enough without the fabric bleaching issues found with benzoyl peroxide.  This one is nice, because of the fresh scent.  Months after using just Phisoderm--which is also very effective but scent free, it is nice to have the added scent.  I have tried the Neutrogena grapefruit scented body wash which I found nauseating.</li>
            <li> Used to be able to buy this locally, but cannot find it anywhere anymore. My son has problems with acne on his forehead and nose. This soap clears it up almost immediately and when he uses any other soap the acne is back immediately.</li>
            <li> I like the original Irish Spring scent. My sons love it. This is a great scent as well, fresh and clean smelling.</li>
            <li> Product is awesome, price is the best, availability isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and looks great. It just doesn&#x27;t last long because it doesn&#x27;t lather well.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Irish Spring Body Wash, Clear and Fresh Skin&amp;#34; provides a good body wash with the benefit of some acne clearing/preventing properties.  The sent is fresh and not overly masculine or feminine.  My girlfriend uses it when she comes over, which saves one extra bottle in the shower!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wash is best for folks with normal to oily skin, as it has little skin moisturizers.  As a person with rather oily skin, I very much appreciate the lack of excessive moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acne clearing and prevention is noticeable, but not miraculous.  I no longer get embarrassing occasional whiteheads on my arms and legs.  However, problem areas for adult acne still require medication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: I use this body wash because it is a good wash and it certainly doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts like so many other products do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a HUGE fan of the classic Irish Spring Body Wash, so I figured i&#x27;d give this a go.  The scent isn&#x27;t as strong or long lasting as the classic, it doesn&#x27;t wash off as easily, and it only lathers up about half as well.  I didn&#x27;t notice a significant difference in it clearing up my skin, even with the 2% salicylic acid that&#x27;s in it.  The price is far from realistic at nearly nine bucks for a 15 ounce bottle.  It isn&#x27;t the worst body wash I&#x27;ve ever used, but i&#x27;m far from impressed and will not be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a few days and already noticed my back clearing up. I hope the trend continues. The smell is very nice, too. Will probably re-order once I run out.</li>
            <li> I have been using bodywashes for years to clear my skin. Who knew that when puberty ended the breakouts could continue. For years I have had to settle with soaps that smell like chemicals or fruit. Recently I have been using the Dial bodywash with Triclosan. It isn&#x27;t as effective as salicylic acid, but pretty good for soap that smells like it&#x27;s okay for a man to use. I saw this Irish Spring soap and had hopes that it would smell like Irish Spring, and do a good job. So far I have been using it for a week. My skin is a little bit clearer (not bad for only a week), and it smells like Irish Spring. So far I am very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** UPDATE ** 7/24/13 **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this body wash for almost a year. I am VERY satisfied with it. I am clean, I smell good all day, and my skin is as clear as can be expected. It&#x27;s great to smell like a MAN again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other tip, if you have a W4LGREEN5 near you, they sell it for the same price as Amazon, and occasionally on sale for less.</li>
            <li> Love it! I&#x27;m having initial breakouts but probably a sign its working. Scent is not too powerful and great!</li>
            <li> This is the only body wash&lt;br /&gt;That works for my husband&#x27;s acne and we can&#x27;t find it anymore in stores. Bought several bottles and will buy several more. Seller couldn&#x27;t have been nicer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an anti-acne body wash with pretty much no success for a while now until I gave this a try. I&#x27;m currently on my second bottle and am overall impressed. I noticed an almost immediate improvement in my body acne albeit a somewhat mild one. That being said I wasn&#x27;t expecting any miracles here. Unfortunately prolonged use doesn&#x27;t seem to help my acne at all beyond that original change, it merely keeps it at the reduced level. The scent is fresh and clean but tends to not stick around for very long. It&#x27;s not perfect and won&#x27;t totally fix your body acne but it actually works which is more than I can say for any of the other products I tried.</li>
            <li> Hubby loves it! He won&#x27;t go for other brands now.</li>
            <li> Amazon, I won&#x27;t lie, I suffer from bacne. On top of my facial acne issues to boot, having it on the back is just adding insult to injury. All of the body washed by Neutrogena out there are either obnoxiously expensive or smell way too much like flowers for a man&#x27;s taste. This body wash cuts a swathe through my bacne like a Celtic warrior through his enemies and for the icing on the cake, it smells great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, my bacne actually got worse. If you&#x27;ve never used a body wash with salycic acid in it before, it may take some time for your skin to adjust. Sometimes with these products things have to get worse before they get better. I&#x27;ve learned this the hard way unfortuntely over the years so I wasn&#x27;t deterred from using the body wash to see how the effects would change over time. Sure enough, the zits started to become less frequent and less angry when they did appear. Even some of the scarring from problem zits that either returned more times than I can count or were the size of a Cadillac Escalade began to disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I still have breakouts on my back. No product is going to work miracles. If one does, I certainly haven&#x27;t found it, but this body wash is a great start. The breakouts I do get are less severe, and the body wash fights them away much faster than were I to not use it. It&#x27;s powerful, smells great and it works. It&#x27;s not a cure-all, but it does its job very well. I am incredibly pleased and will continue to use this product for as long as Irish Spring produces it and I highly recommend those in a situation similar to mine do the same; just be prepared to get through that initial phase of your skin adjusting to the acid.</li>
            <li> Great stuff keeps skin clear.!</li>
            <li> It proved excellent on oil, acne and grime but was unable to remove the rust from powertools.</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of different acne body washes and body scrubs as I have severe back acne, and although none of the products really is a miracle cure, I have continued to use them because at least I believe they won&#x27;t cause acne unlike many soap products. A lot of the acne body washes will be overly drying on skin due to the salicylic acid but I found this one seems to still leave skin smooth and comfortable, rather than dry and ashy. Also, this has a very strong scent similar to Irish Spring bar soap, which I like but others may want a product with less scent. I would consider this the only deodorizing acne body wash I have ever found as the rest don&#x27;t have a lingering scent.</li>
            <li> I tried for the first time and bought these yesterday at a local drug store (ran out so did&#x27;t want to wait 2 days), they smell great and feels great on the skin. The feature of avoid breakouts will help me, as I also get acne on my arms and back. Scent lasting for 8 hrs is enough, I don&#x27;t need this strong of a smell longer than that. If this continues to impress, I will buy via Amazon to save on store visits. :D</li>
            <li> Not quite great, but good. Clears up the (b)acne decently. I use it in conjunction with Physoderm, every other day and it has worked great to keep my skin clear. I&#x27;m not sure if it would have the same effect all by itself, but it does help to maintain. Good scent too.</li>
            <li> This body was does help and keep breakouts to a minimum. Has a very nice fresh fragrance. I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I feel like this thing made me break out more than usual.</li>
            <li> Its a great body wash for keeping backne in check.&lt;br /&gt; It doesn&#x27;t really have the fragrance strength of other body washes.&lt;br /&gt;It does not get rid of your back pimples completely and this has to be my third bottle worth of showers.&lt;br /&gt;The best price I have ever paid for this was 2.99 so 5 dollars was not really a great price. I paid about 5 dollars on amazon.</li>
            <li> I wish this wasn&#x27;t so hard to find in stores. It works really well if you have issues with acne and saves you a lot of time by just putting your acne treatment in your body wash. I hope this catches on and we start seeing it in stores more often.</li>
            <li> I Have very oily acne prone skin. In the summer my esthetician has me use a 2% Salicylic body wash.  However this can become costly showering more often when it is hot.  My skin has improved extremely. I found the Irish Spring not only works just a good if not better than the Neutrogena Brand.  It surely smells fresh and clean just like the regular Irish Spring without all the dyes.&lt;br /&gt;L. Goode&lt;br /&gt;Charlottesville, Va.</li>
            <li> This body wash has a nice refreshing scent and keeps my body clear of blemishes. I have used neutrogena and phisoderm body washes in the past but this works the best and it&#x27;s the cheapest too.</li>
            <li> This. stuff. is. amazing. After using it my skin felt fresh and smooth. Just wish it didnt smell like guys cologne... I&#x27;ve noticed I tend to not have as many breakouts after using this stuff. I love it!</li>
            <li> Not bad but far from clearing skin!  Will try the bar version next time but not an acne soap for sure.</li>
    </ol>
