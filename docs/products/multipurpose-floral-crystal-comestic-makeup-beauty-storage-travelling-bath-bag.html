            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect too much in terms of durability because of the price, but they were nice little bags that you could throw makeup in or could store hair accessories.  </li>

            <li>I know they aren&#x27;t the best in quality, but if you don&#x27;t abuse them too bad, they seem to serve their purpose.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I ordered these early enough, since they were coming from China and they took a really long time to be delivered.  </li>
            <li>Pretty enough but could not hold a lot of weight.</li>
            <li>Too small and cheaply made.</li>
            <li>This product suits me especially well as I go on frequent trips.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Too small and cheaply made. I guess you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> i like it because its lightweight and collapsible</li>
            <li> I bought this when it had a special offer of only $0.89. This product suits me especially well as I go on frequent trips. It&#x27;s extremely light and has holes on both sides to drain the water if you use this in the shower. I prefer putting toiletries in the bag instead of cosmetic makeup. It does have a strong smell when it first arrived but after awhile, the smell was gone. It is made out of pretty cheap material so don&#x27;t plan for this to last forever.</li>
            <li> I love this bag I thought it would be a little more crappy but is not is beautiful and I thank you and it&#x27;s inexpensive so thank you so much it&#x27;s a great bag I  used it my make up</li>
            <li> Functional and affordable. Ordered several to use and give as gifts</li>
            <li> It is exactly what is says it is!  The picture is accurate.</li>
            <li> Not the best quality but what can you expect when you don&#x27;t pay that much for an item</li>
            <li> they smell so bad but are cute and the  grandaughter can use them ....but don&#x27;t think I will be using them</li>
            <li> I got this to use a first aid kit to keep in the car. I used it for a trip we took and it worked great. Does seem thin and like the zipper will break easily though.</li>
            <li> Multi purpose is correct. I think they are great for camping, put your soap in them. Sincerely, a multipurpose item. Thank you.</li>
            <li> cute item will  use as stocking stuffers</li>
            <li> Awesome for the money!</li>
            <li> Pretty enough but could not hold a lot of weight. I found that out too soon.  It was holding a bag of jewelry beads. quite an embarrassing scene for me.</li>
            <li> Bought one of each color these are so great for keeping bathroom items for each member of he house!</li>
            <li> Eh. Very cheap plastic and only lasted one trip before ripping. I didn&#x27;t expect much for the price. If you&#x27;re looking for a one time use little travel bag, this is the bag for you. Order way before you need because shipping does take a while.</li>
            <li> I got my order, and was very please with the cosmetic bag, very nice, looks just like the picture!</li>
            <li> The seller is awesome! I highly recommend getting the product!</li>
            <li> We always do stocking stuffers in our office at work for Christmas, and we usually try to keep our items under a dollar each.  These little bags worked perfect for this.  At the time I purchased these, they were close to 50 cents each, so I bought several in each color.  I&#x27;m glad I ordered these early enough, since they were coming from China and they took a really long time to be delivered.  I didn&#x27;t expect too much in terms of durability because of the price, but they were nice little bags that you could throw makeup in or could store hair accessories.  I had a couple left over, so I gave them to my teenage nieces, and they throw makeup in them and put them in their backpacks.  I know they aren&#x27;t the best in quality, but if you don&#x27;t abuse them too bad, they seem to serve their purpose.</li>
            <li> Cheap looking and cheaply made, but that&#x27;s what I get for what I paid.</li>
            <li> I would not purchase this item again.  Looks very cheap.. I paid very little for them though.  You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This was a good buy for the price! i plan on using them for gift bags with make up or hygiene products inside!</li>
            <li> Its a simple bag. Not much room but perfect for a quick travel or going out bag. Pretty colors and not too flimsy.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for.  I just needed a small bag to carry and store supplies in and that&#x27;s what I got.</li>
            <li> With two doalafs. This bag is flimsy but can hold what u need to fit in a purse or your carry on suitcase.</li>
            <li> Very nice for the price. I wish I had ordered more. These will make great on the go/last minute travel bags!!!</li>
            <li> The bags were not the best quality.</li>
            <li> Did the job for packing a small amount of items! Great for taking quick overnight trips when you want convenience.</li>
            <li> It was nice but I had ordered 3 bags and it was supposed to be a variety of colors. But they were blue and I only got 2 and sent emails but never heard back.</li>
            <li> Actually very useful.  May order more.  Good size</li>
            <li> Not bad for what i paid ,i wasnt expecting much as far as quality but this serves many uses ,i use this when  i travel to carry my medication in and find to to be handy,i have no complaints would order more if needed,for the price you cant go wrong.</li>
