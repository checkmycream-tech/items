            <li>The quality isn&#x27;t bad and looks great in person.</li>

            <li> The quality isn&#x27;t bad and looks great in person.</li>
            <li> Only issue was quite a bit of grey hair</li>
            <li> The hair length was shorter than it says, plus mine was used obviously due to the fact that the hqir was half curled and stiff with hair spray also the hair is not the same length, there are so many broken strands.</li>
            <li> Her only complaint was that it had a few shorter strands of hair but not too much.</li>
            <li> Her hair is a bit thin and after the first comb out, there was a little shedding.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing about it is that the hair comes out, but not that much.</li>
            <li> Would the table clamps mess</li>
            <li> The only two problems i had with this is that the stand is wobbly and her hair gets really thin at the bottom.</li>
            <li> hair is uneven all around the head and ends are thin as hell!  </li>
            <li> it was 100% human hair as when I used my marcel the hair had a very bad odd smell.  </li>
            <li> my guess is all these other reviews are FAKE cuz these dolls suck!  </li>
            <li> I am a bit concerned about shedding seeing that she already has thin hair to begin with.</li>
            <li> after looking through the hair i found a spot of hair missing!!!!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this and will never buy from this company again!</li>

            <li> Would the table clamps mess my table up</li>
            <li> great for learning on, good quality not bad for school</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Looks better than the photo, great quality , the hair looks smooth and nice.  You can dye it, and curl it. The only bad thing about it is that the hair comes out, but not that much.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my manaquin head, great value,would buy again</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter so that she can practice hairstyles and curling techniques and it has done everything that she has needed it to!  Since the day she received it, we can&#x27;t put it away because she is always going back to try something new on it!</li>
            <li> Wonderful doll!!! Beautiful hair.  Only issue was quite a bit of grey hair and I&#x27;m not 100% it was 100% human hair as when I used my marcel the hair had a very bad odd smell.  But I&#x27;d definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> Purchased for my daughter who wants to go into cosmotology. Great&lt;br /&gt;for practicing braids and variuos hair styles. Also purchased the clamp&lt;br /&gt;at the same time.</li>
            <li> awesome she is incredibly helpful when I&#x27;m watching TV and I now I don&#x27;[t have my daughters make-up brush In my face</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loves this head. Now she can create to her hearts desire. Fast shipping; exactly as described.</li>
            <li> The hair length was shorter than it says, plus mine was used obviously due to the fact that the hqir was half curled and stiff with hair spray also the hair is not the same length, there are so many broken strands. I am very disappointed in this and will never buy from this company again!</li>
            <li> great Christmas gift for teens to experienment</li>
            <li> after looking through the hair i found a spot of hair missing!!!! it was a tad bit smaller than a dime! hair is uneven all around the head and ends are thin as hell!  this is one of the s***tiest mannequins ive ever bought!  my guess is all these other reviews are FAKE cuz these dolls suck!  MY MONEY SHOULD BE REFUNDED!</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied when the hair quality. I did tangle easily and just all around a great mannequin head. You&#x27;ll really get a &amp;#34;bang for your buck&amp;#34; if you decided to get this product :)</li>
            <li> Bought it for my 10 year old daughter and she really loves it.  She can practice with the curling iron and flat iron without damaging her own hair. Or her sister&#x27;s!  Just wish it took make up better.</li>
            <li> Overall, a good value for the price.  The hair is actually more coarse than I had anticipated, and it is uneven in length.</li>
            <li> Really great product! The only two problems i had with this is that the stand is wobbly and her hair gets really thin at the bottom.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom, who is a hair designer, to practice different modern and fashionable hair styles. She says that it is great for coloring and perm because it is all natural hair. Her only complaint was that it had a few shorter strands of hair but not too much.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product.  There were many knots in the hair.  I have only braided the hair 3 times and the hair is falling out.  I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it if i would have know the low quality.</li>
            <li> Finally a mannequin that works. I bought this for my 14 year old daughter and I&#x27;m very pleased with the piece. I&#x27;m not convinced that it&#x27;s 100% human hair because it does feel somewhat straw like but at least it&#x27;s brushable and can easily be played with. The multidirectional part makes it a pleasure when we do updos/braids etc. So much better than the synthetic one I purchased...</li>
            <li> Perfect! The hair is thick and long and it is perfect for practice. Love it!</li>
            <li> The hair is long and great for practicing braids.  My daughter thought it was &amp;#34;my dolly&amp;#34;, and she brought out her Barbie head so we could &amp;#34;play&amp;#34;.  Of course, mine is better because it has real hair.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Beautiful lady received on time I have hairstyles to create on her thanks very much.</li>
            <li> The quality isn&#x27;t bad and looks great in person. I purchased this mannequin to practice braids  and updos and it will work. Her hair is a bit thin and after the first comb out, there was a little shedding. As time goes on I&#x27;ll see how it holds up to styling. I am a bit concerned about shedding seeing that she already has thin hair to begin with.</li>
            <li> I order this for my mother, and she loves it! Very soft, very little to no shedding, and easy to handle, would very much recommend!</li>
