            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Absolutely in love with this eyeliner!</li>
            <li>This is the kind of gel eye liner that dries when you put it on.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have brushes off my own</li>
            <li>but it still works and is a nice product I would buy again</li>
            <li>it is really good but make sure to always cover the container.</li>
            <li>At first when I got this stuff I absolutely loved it!</li>
            <li>Looks great ;)</li>
            <li>It literally lasts all day and it is very smooth.</li>
            <li>This product is nice it makes a fine line and makes my eyes pop.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li>excellent product and last forever...</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t my favorite eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I love it :)</li>
            <li>so in love with these eyeliners ❤</li>
            <li>The brushes could have been of better quality</li>
            <li>i love it...</li>
            <li>But after awhile it started smearing on the top of my eye.</li>
            <li>but they seem okay.</li>
            <li>Very rich and creamy texture as well.</li>
            <li>They came in pretty good time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to apply with two options for brushes to use.</li>
            <li>Love it, goes on super smooth.</li>
            <li>but I used it and they go on smooth</li>
            <li>thought it was going to be a cheap make up because of its price</li>
            <li>but, there is nothing to complain about when your getting great quality for a low price!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use the brushes since I have my own</li>
            <li>Love this product it works really well !</li>
            <li>and it takes some work to get clean&amp; flexible again for reuse.</li>
            <li>colours are very good goes on smoothly no lumps.</li>
            <li>But it is worth the buy.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth the wait.  </li>
            <li>Might be better to use with different brushes, but I&#x27;m not that interested in working with this kind when I can just use my old eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Very well package and present, nice product.</li>
            <li>Better than Urban Decay liquid eyeliner and any pencil!</li>
            <li>but I love the flat brushes it came with</li>
            <li>But If you are willing to wait at least a month or two for an item, then this is a really good deal.</li>
            <li>The quality of the makeup is surprisingly good for the price, it lasts way longer than my old gel eyeliner and there&#x27;s a lot of it in each little container.</li>
            <li>It really does last, and it goes on so smooth compaired to some</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really use it.</li>
            <li>not so much on the bottom.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does run just a little..not as much as others though.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Totally water proof goes on silky smooth.</li>
            <li>It expired a whole year ago...</li>
            <li>Really wanted to experiment with the brown.</li>
            <li>The brown definitely plays up my hazel eyes when I wear it for a more natural look.</li>
            <li>The eyeliner doesn&#x27;t easily smudge and lasts long on your eyes.</li>
            <li>I like every other liner I&#x27;ve ever used better</li>
            <li>Rather than having to buy expensive ones that&#x27;s just as good as this product!</li>
            <li>Like but get dry easy and need to found the way to use it .</li>
            <li>Wow this gel eyeliner is intense!</li>
            <li>For a very cheap price you get 2 gel eyeliners and 2 small eye brushes.</li>
            <li>Package came with 2 jet black gels (well packaged in box) with fine liner brushes.</li>
            <li>I was also extremely excited to realize they didn&#x27;t just send me black-</li>
            <li>You just have to make sure you don&#x27;t leave a lot on the brush or it dries hard</li>
            <li>So firstly, this item will take a long time to get to you as it&#x27;s coming from China.</li>
            <li>Nice dark color, completely black.</li>
            <li>Both black and brown are nice and dark so only have to apply one coat.</li>
            <li>Large amt in containers as stated by another reviewer, so will last a long time.</li>
            <li>Be very careful applying, due to a light stain-like look...especially on lower lids.</li>
            <li>Only takes a small dab on the tiny brush, then use your artistic skills.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> one is truly long lasting on my upper lid...</li>
            <li> It lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so creamy and literally lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> I get compliments all day long about my winged liner.</li>
            <li> I have another gel eyeliner and it takes putting eyeshadow over it for it to dry.</li>
            <li> The only down side is the shipping time</li>
            <li> I will reorder once I&#x27;m on the 2nd gel since both are black.</li>
            <li> Only downside is how long the shipping takes, so I order a few in advance.</li>
            <li> The only problem is it gets a little dry even with the cap on</li>
            <li> product came in faster than expected.</li>
            <li> does what is expected .</li>
            <li> but a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Liner was too dark and not creamy.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I give it 5 Stars!</li>
            <li> i use the brown for my brows and the black for my winged liner</li>
            <li> Jet black, creamy but firm</li>
            <li> I wear this all day almost everyday and it stays!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s kinda hard to apply the eyeliner.</li>
            <li> And its really hard to take off at times.</li>
            <li> once it dries up there is no way to use it again, it will be hard as a rock</li>
            <li> This is seriously the creamiest eyeliner I have ever used, and I&#x27;ve used a lot of them.</li>
            <li> It is somewhat thin, meaning you have to use a lot of it at once in order to not have spaces in whatever line you&#x27;re drawing.</li>
            <li> It came 5 days late which was a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> you cannot go wrong at all with this product..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really difficult to remove when I wash my makeup off</li>
            <li> The brush isn&#x27;t bad</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Beautiful I waited over a month but I used it and they go on smooth and it&#x27;s perfect</li>
            <li> Very well package and present, nice product. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS. It looks perfect and it is so easy to apply. It is waterproof but you can remove it with makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I like every other liner I&#x27;ve ever used better but I love the flat brushes it came with they are great for using eye shadow to fill in brows. Liner was too dark and not creamy.</li>
            <li> Love this product it works really well ! It literally lasts all day and it is very smooth.</li>
            <li> I love it,  beautiful precision!</li>
            <li> product came in faster than expected. i love it! i use the brown for my brows and the black for my winged liner</li>
            <li> Great item at a great price. Lasts all day and stays put!</li>
            <li> They came in pretty good time. The brush isn&#x27;t bad but I don&#x27;t really use it. This is the kind of gel eye liner that dries when you put it on. I have another gel eyeliner and it takes putting eyeshadow over it for it to dry. It&#x27;s pretty good. It doesn&#x27;t look like there is a lot but a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> excellent product and last forever...</li>
            <li> It took a while to send, I understand that, but it didn&#x27;t come with the brushes. I don&#x27;t have brushes off my own so it&#x27;s kinda hard to apply the eyeliner.</li>
            <li> This product was incredible! It lasts all day long. It does not run or smudge. Better than Urban Decay liquid eyeliner and any pencil!</li>
            <li> It came 5 days late which was a disappointment.  But it is worth the buy.  As Well as the wait when it drys it does not smug it does not move and it took awhile to actually get it off when I was taking off my makeup so I will be buying another.</li>
            <li> For a very cheap price you get 2 gel eyeliners and 2 small eye brushes. The eyeliner doesn&#x27;t easily smudge and lasts long on your eyes. Shipping may take some time but it&#x27;s worth it. Rather than having to buy expensive ones that&#x27;s just as good as this product!</li>
            <li> Quality is great. Lasts all day. The only downside was waiting like a month for it to be delivered.</li>
            <li> The eyeliner stays on my waterline all day! It is great for making winged eyeliner with the angled brush that comes with it</li>
            <li> I have about 4 - 5 &amp;#34;long lasting&amp;#34; eyeliners in my make-up bag.&lt;br /&gt;This one is truly long lasting on my upper lid...not so much on the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;It does run just a little..not as much as others though.&lt;br /&gt;I love that it comes in 2 colors! The brown definitely plays up my hazel eyes when I wear it for a more natural look.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t my favorite eyeliner. It is somewhat thin, meaning you have to use a lot of it at once in order to not have spaces in whatever line you&#x27;re drawing. Might be better to use with different brushes, but I&#x27;m not that interested in working with this kind when I can just use my old eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Totally water proof goes on silky smooth. Both black and brown are nice and dark so only have to apply one coat. Brushes are very good quality for application.</li>
            <li> Love it, goes on super smooth. smears easily though!! Looks great ;)</li>
            <li> I love it :)&lt;br /&gt;I thought it was going to be a cheap make up because of its price but it meet my expectations&lt;br /&gt;Im so in love with these eyeliners ❤</li>
            <li> It was expired when I got it... It expired a whole year ago...</li>
            <li> NEVER GOT MY ORDER. BRIGHT THIS EARLIER IN EITHER OCTOBER OR NOVEMBER.  ITS NOW DECEMBER AND I STILL DONT HAVE IT.</li>
            <li> Love it! Timely arrival, great product, and awesome transaction!</li>
            <li> Love this eyeliner!!!  Worth the wait.  Jet black, creamy but firm gel that actually stays put until removed. Be very careful applying, due to a light stain-like look...especially on lower lids. Did not receive a brown gel??? Really wanted to experiment with the brown. Package came with 2 jet black gels (well packaged in box) with fine liner brushes. Would definitely recommend. Large amt in containers as stated by another reviewer, so will last a long time. Only takes a small dab on the tiny brush, then use your artistic skills. I will reorder once I&#x27;m on the 2nd gel since both are black.</li>
            <li> Love how well the colors show, great quality and the brushes are great.</li>
            <li> Stays on all day and night. For the price, great product.</li>
            <li> This product is nice it makes a fine line and makes my eyes pop. The only problem is it gets a little dry even with the cap on but it still works and is a nice product I would buy again</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh! This is seriously the creamiest eyeliner I have ever used, and I&#x27;ve used a lot of them. It also stays all day and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it. The only down side is the shipping time but if you order in advance then you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product. I use it to fill in my eyebrows from time to time.</li>
            <li> received two tubs. colours are very good goes on smoothly no lumps. does what is expected . comes with 2 brush as shown.</li>
            <li> I have yet to revise this item!!!</li>
            <li> I wear this all day almost everyday and it stays! It is so easy to apply with two options for brushes to use. The brushes could have been of better quality but, there is nothing to complain about when your getting great quality for a low price!</li>
            <li> Like but get dry easy and need to found the way to use it .</li>
            <li> it smears to under my eyes</li>
            <li> i looooooooveeee this eyeliner.. you cannot go wrong at all with this product.. it last all day no smears.. i love it... dont think about it just get it you wont regret it..</li>
            <li> At first when I got this stuff I absolutely loved it! But after awhile it started smearing on the top of my eye. And its really hard to take off at times.</li>
            <li> So firstly, this item will take a long time to get to you as it&#x27;s coming from China. But If you are willing to wait at least a month or two for an item, then this is a really good deal. The quality of the makeup is surprisingly good for the price, it lasts way longer than my old gel eyeliner and there&#x27;s a lot of it in each little container. It says on the label that it lasts 24 hours, and it actually does. Nice dark color, completely black. Very rich and creamy texture as well. I had to write this review because despite the wait time it is a really awesome eyeliner and people should know that.</li>
            <li> Absolutely in love with this eyeliner! It really does last, and it goes on so smooth compaired to some that I have paid a ton of money for. You just have to make sure you don&#x27;t leave a lot on the brush or it dries hard and it takes some work to get clean&amp; flexible again for reuse. I was also extremely excited to realize they didn&#x27;t just send me black- I also received brown!</li>
            <li> Wow this gel eyeliner is intense! It&#x27;s so creamy and literally lasts all day long. It&#x27;s really difficult to remove when I wash my makeup off but hey I&#x27;m not complaining! I don&#x27;t really use the brushes since I have my own but they seem okay. I get compliments all day long about my winged liner. Only downside is how long the shipping takes, so I order a few in advance. Other than that, I give it 5 Stars!</li>
            <li> it is really good but make sure to always cover the container. once it dries up there is no way to use it again, it will be hard as a rock</li>
