            <li>Love the citrus smell!</li>
            <li>Very pleased, but this is all subjective, make your own opinion.</li>
            <li>This does a fantastic job of cleaning and conditioning my beard but is also great for my skin underneath, and eliminates flakes.</li>
            <li>it worked AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>its been 1 week since I started using this product and the result is amazing.</li>
            <li>This product smelled amazing.  </li>
            <li>The smell is amazing and it lathers nice.</li>
            <li>I sure there are products just as good for a 1/3 of the price.</li>
            <li>I use it every shower and honestly I can&#x27;t tell if it makes any difference in my beard at all.</li>
            <li>received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>It suds nicely, and doesn&#x27;t take a ton of product to get the job done.  </li>
            <li>and it smells nice.</li>
            <li>but it seems to be working nicely for now.</li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t many choices for beard conditioners this is as good as any that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Feels great on the skin and washes clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so pleasant and easy to use</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome, and I would highly recommend it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product and quick shipping</li>
            <li>If you have a beard with an inch or more or growth ( and chances are, if you&#x27;re considering buying a shampoo specifically for beards, you probably do), you may find you have to use more than you&#x27;d like to get a good wash out of</li>
            <li>WOW what a great product!!</li>
            <li>If you want a great looking and great feeling soft healthy beard, buy this stuff.</li>
            <li>I considered calling up the company to ask them to describe the scent to make sure that I didn&#x27;t receive a defective bottle - that perhaps got some kind of tank cleaning agent was in it.</li>
            <li>By all means this is the best product i have used on my beard thus far.</li>
            <li>Still, this product is the best I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re looking for a great beard-wash that will leave your beard feeling stronger, softer and more full, this is it.</li>
            <li>After reading all the great reviews on the Beard Wash with (and this is the most important part to me) extra conditioning, I figured this would be perfect.</li>

            <li>have helped to keep my beard soft, clean, looking great and smelling great.</li>

            <li>If I felt that it was a better product</li>
            <li>I love this beard wash.</li>
            <li>It also made my beard seem easier to brush and more presentable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the stuff.</li>
            <li>I use shampoo and conditioner from target that is a quarter the price and works much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a beard ever since I&#x27;ve been able to grow one</li>
            <li>I like the wash my beard feels better and looks better.</li>
            <li>Very happy overall, will repurchase.</li>
            <li>but now he is in love with it and has requested more.</li>
            <li>He has mentioned that his beard isnt tangly any more</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this stuff.  </li>
            <li>My beard is much more manageable.  </li>
            <li>My beard is more manageable, doesn&#x27;t flake anymore</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got BETTER results with Beardsley.</li>
            <li>It also is better and getting rid of my beard dandruff.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>, so grooming has never been on the top of my list.</li>
            <li>I bought this beard shampoo for my boyfriend and we absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll fall in love with your man and his beard all over again.</li>
            <li>Glad I came across this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I like it and will probably buy more.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>truly is my favorite part of my morning routine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this more than the bear saver.</li>
            <li>and seven more words are required to submit</li>
            <li>and he said conditioner made for women&#x27;s hair works better.</li>
            <li>and he doesn&#x27;t mind it either. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>While the product seems to work \\&quot;ok</li>
            <li>Even after many months, it&#x27;s a smell that I just can&#x27;t get by...</li>
            <li>Does a better job of softening my beard than anything else I&#x27;ve tried plus my girlfriend loves the scent.</li>
            <li>and I love that they don&#x27;t test on animals.</li>
            <li>me a 10 Gallon bucket and in 2 weeks with evaporation and refills, should be able to forge you an iron sword or two.</li>
            <li>This beard wash was just okay.</li>
            <li>My tee tree shampoo works better and is cheaper.</li>
            <li>My studies have proven that 5 out of 5 women enjoyed the feeling of it on the inside of their thighs.</li>
            <li>Once you rinse your beard off, there is called forth from the neverworlds magical powers.</li>
            <li>In fact, I am typing this one handed, because I can&#x27;t stop touching my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>beard hairs more manageable</li>
            <li>/&gt;Regardless, the more I used it, the more stars I was taking away in my head.</li>
            <li>Then the 5th was better.</li>
            <li>After many Google searches, all signs seemed to point to Bluebeards.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better results with Dove Men+Care at 1/4th the cost.</li>
            <li>I love nuzzling into his beard right after a wash, it&#x27;s smells really good.  </li>
            <li>Like I said, it&#x27;s nice, it works well, but it smells more like something I&#x27;d use to clean a counter top with rather than a beard cleaner.</li>
            <li>It does seem to keep the skin underneath the beard clean and free of zits and sores and stuff, so I guess that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>It keeps the beard clean and conditions nicely.</li>
            <li>this stuff does a pretty good job as cleaning it without drying out my skin and beard, but it smells like dish detergent.</li>
            <li>This stuff is perfect for long, unruly beards.</li>
            <li>, it works pretty good and does make your bears softer.</li>
            <li>Pretty good stuff, it gets rid of the itch.</li>
            <li>This works great, and I live the lime scent it leaves.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t recommend this product compared to another beard wash, as I haven&#x27;t used any others, but I&#x27;d strongly recommend it for anyone who is still using Head &amp; Shoulders on their face.  :)</li>
            <li>As my beard grows longer it&#x27;s getting a bit frizzier and not as easy to control, so the claim that it would help fight frizz was appealing to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I can easily buy this from amazon now.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, lathers very well, smells like skittles which i think is great!</li>
            <li>Leaves my beard fresh and clean with a pleasant lime scent.  </li>
            <li>When paired with the conditioner I had a very soft beard that was much more attractive and easy to style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its great for you beard and face leaving it very refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li>Honestly I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, good price.</li>
            <li>so I figured it was worth a shot and to be honest...</li>
            <li>He said he liked the scent however I most certainly didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Lathers up better than the original.  </li>
            <li>the shampoo is easy on your face.</li>
            <li>Easy to Apply</li>
            <li>Easy to Rinse</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>It is strong citrus smell</li>
            <li>so you would be wise to invest in some sort of leave in conditioner, such as Honest Amish Beard Balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bluebeard&#x27;s is strong.</li>
            <li>Then I realized that the scent strongly reminded me of industrial floor cleaner, something you&#x27;d find in a janitor&#x27;s mop bucket.  </li>
            <li>you get used to the strong scent and</li>
            <li>the smell is nice and makes your beard feel noticeably softer after a few washes with leaves you with an incredible clean beard!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>just fine.</li>
            <li>I was super pleased with the care that the Shave Mart decided to package the bottle with.  </li>
            <li>Powers which turned my beard into an object worthy of the most embarrassing worship.</li>
            <li>This smells kind of citrusy and does a good job of cleaning and conditioning my long beard.</li>
            <li>Great scent and great foaming action to tackle the dirt and dust in my long goatee.</li>
            <li>rated it a 4/5 because i wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the smell.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of Blue-Beards products.</li>
            <li>Softens beard, smells great and can use multiple times per week without drying.</li>
            <li>Product leaves the beard feeling and smelling fantastic.</li>
            <li>This definitely leaves your beard feeling and smelling great.</li>
            <li>I use more than they say on thw bottle but worth the money.</li>
            <li>My beard feel fresh and look better than ever.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price when you take into account how many uses you will get out of it.</li>
            <li>Great smell, not too frothy, and it doesn&#x27;t even have an off-putting taste when some inevitably gets in your mouth when you wash your mustache.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and I would definitely recommend it to anyone!!!!!</li>
            <li>It works well and has a light citrus scent.</li>
            <li>My hubby is on his way to MANY wins, and hopefully will be national soon, and he uses this product.</li>
            <li>i stopped buying cheap shampoos and conditioners, they&#x27;re not made for beards and faces.</li>
            <li>That said, some guys out there obviously enjoy it,</li>
            <li>Trying this one and so far so good.</li>
            <li>Blue beards is a refreshing and good smelling conditioner that cleans my beard without over drying.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hubby&#x27;s beard smelling very fresh.</li>
            <li>story short, this product is true to its description - it cleans and conditions your beard and gives it a great smell.</li>
            <li>; I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s losing its nice fragrance while inside the bottle, maybe I was sent an older bottle, etc.</li>
            <li>I bought this and the Bluebeards Original Beard Saver.</li>
            <li>It was familiar, yet elusive.  </li>
            <li>Bluebeards Original Beard Saver.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if thats the best thing....</li>
            <li>and so I&#x27;m pretty pleased.</li>
            <li>leaves my beard and skin perfectly clean without drying it out</li>
            <li>, so I think it is also keeping my skin under the beard clean.  </li>
            <li>It will clean your beard.</li>
            <li>It will clean the hell out of your beard.</li>
            <li>Helps keep my beard clean and my skin from getting dandruff.</li>
            <li>This stuff keeps my beard squeaky clean and keeps the itches at bay.</li>
            <li>This smells like citrus and has a clean scent.</li>
            <li>Definitely do a good job of keeping my beard feeling soft and fresh.  </li>
            <li>This beard wash smells good, lasts a long time, and is easy to rinse out.</li>
            <li>The ones that do have some kind of positive effect don&#x27;t seem to do so consistently.  </li>
            <li>Overall good product.</li>
            <li>Keeps my beard nice and soft, no dryness or flakes after wash.</li>
            <li>Keeps the beard nice, soft, and manageable.</li>
            <li>and I have been able to grow it out longer much to my husband&#x27;s satisfaction.</li>
            <li>but I grow a full beard once in a while.</li>
            <li>Not worth the money can use good quality hair care products and get better results.</li>
            <li>I must say it smells fresh, clean, and unique.</li>
            <li>Makes he&#x27;s beard super soft and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing, Clean, Fresh, and no harsh smell.</li>
            <li>My beard is much softer, and very clean.  </li>
            <li>I feel that this new &amp;#34;extra conditioning agent&amp;#34; version does not lather as well as the older model, and it does not have as strong a smell (even though I liked the smell).  </li>
            <li>Luckily that smell went away after I rinsed.</li>
            <li>Shipped quick and works well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also been reading more and more that one should use the same shampoo and conditioner for their beard that they use for their head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really has to be rubbed in good to lather up which causes my beard to tangle more and loose more hairs then with normal hair shampoos.  </li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t seem to condition my beard any better than normal hair shampoo / soap does.</li>
            <li>I have kept a beard off and on for most of my life, and I have tended to use normal hair shampoo for the upkeep of my beard.  </li>
            <li>For a &amp;#34;extra conditioning shampoo&amp;#34; I feel it is more like normal conditioning...  </li>
            <li>Its better than normal  conditioner</li>
            <li>It smells strange when scrubbing into beard, but any lingering smell is good if you even notice it.</li>
            <li>I bought some beard oils from a different company and they just don&#x27;t compare with how clean and nice Bluebeards makes my beard feel.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised, and it smells like lime jello!</li>
            <li>Bluebeards Original was the first brand of beard wash I tried.</li>
            <li>Left my beard looking 10X better!</li>
            <li>A little pricey, but great results.</li>
            <li>Why not a nicer vanilla scent, or some other more pleasant masculine scent?   </li>
            <li>This product leaves my beard feeling extremely soft but I gave it four stars only because the smell is not so great.</li>
            <li>Based on the cost of the bottle, however, I don&#x27;t feel that it was worth it.</li>
            <li>The wash also works well for your entire face, and it conditions your skin nicely got shaving/cleaning up your cheeks and neck.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money and</li>
            <li>Helps with any itchiness and irritated skin around the beard and keeps the beard hair healthy, silky, and soft.</li>
            <li>Many Natural Ingredients&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not even worth $5.</li>
            <li>Worth the 2in1 product.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough nice things about this stuff, it has persuaded me to keep growing my beard with reckless abandon.</li>
            <li>It softens and conditions my beard, making it look fuller, and far more manageable.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>It only takes a couple of drops to get a nice foamy lather.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>It does just as it states, and is WELL worth the price.</li>
            <li>So if someone needs more foaming action to think it&#x27;s working, try that.</li>
            <li>It smells kinda of like licorice (which is not a bad thing), and made his beard soft and easy to brush thru.  </li>
            <li>and/or you significant other love citrus)!.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve run out, I do plan on trying other brands to see if there&#x27;s any one I&#x27;d be more satisfied with, but I wouldn&#x27;t rule out purchasing Bluebeards again.</li>
            <li>This beard wash made my face and beard feel so clean it became my favorite part of my daily shower.</li>
            <li>It smells better and foams better, and you use less of it.</li>
            <li>It lathers ok, but it kind of has a weird smell that makes me think this is, like, mostly dishwashing machine soap.</li>
            <li>As a bearded American I&#x27;ve tried different products this one is by far the best!</li>
            <li>But it really didn&#x27;t give me the full effect until i used about a quarter sized portion in the palm of my hand.</li>
            <li>Sent it back, return was easy!</li>
            <li>Many beard products have patchouli oil or other strong scents that I don&#x27;t care for.  </li>
            <li>I would recomend it, but i think its better if you just get the other two products by blue beard and just use a really good condition for your beard instead, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It really helps get the dirt and dead skin out from under his beard and keeps his beard looking great and smelling wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am still forced to use a conditioner, but otherwise this is by far one of the best beard shampoos</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product and my husband will never go back to regular face wash again!</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;d call this a very sound product and reccomend it to anyone with a beard.</li>
            <li>However, very gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li>Good size (8oz) for beards longer than 6 inches (I&#x27;ve used a little over 1/2 in a month)  </li>
            <li>My girlfriend for the first time loves to rub my beard.</li>
            <li>The first thing that turned me off from Bluebeards Beard Wash was the odor.</li>
            <li>I struggle to find anything to dislike about the wash because it does exactly what the product description states.</li>
            <li>after initially not liking the consistency, i got used to it and was able to work with it</li>
            <li>definitely glad to have bluebeards back!</li>
            <li>Within days my beard became softer and more relaxed, and has stayed this way with daily use of this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be getting more of this in the future!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed that it feels much softer!</li>
            <li>I love that, but the smell is gone minutes after you get out of the shower and the results are no different than if  you used Pert Plus for $2.  </li>
            <li>Bluebeard&#x27;s does exactly what it sets out to do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used numerous beard shampoos and this is probably my favorite...</li>
            <li>and it really makes the beard shine!</li>
            <li>He said that after the first use he felt a difference in his beard.</li>
            <li>He really enjoys the smell of it!</li>
            <li>I actually could say more, but just suggest you give it a try.  </li>
            <li>Like the reviews said, after the first use beard/facial dandruff disappeared.</li>
            <li>and I am now able to comb my beard so that \\&quot;most\\&quot; of the hairs are going in the same direction</li>
            <li>After a while though, the results I got at first petered away.  </li>
            <li>I was a bit hesitant at first about the price, $22 for an 8 oz.</li>
            <li>It makes the beard much softer and it leaves it smelling like fresh limes.</li>
            <li>Its my first time trying it</li>
            <li>This product absolutely does NOT work as advertised!</li>
            <li>The first bottle would have been a 5 star.</li>
            <li>I currently use (and love)</li>
            <li>The first time it hits my nose</li>
            <li>Upon extiting the shower after my first use, I noticed that my beard had never been rougher.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Half-way through the week I started repeating after the first rinse, and when I did it foamed-up a lot.</li>
            <li>I noticed that the hair actually seemed more stripped.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;blended with natural jojoba oils, to soften and smooth the wildest of beards.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>Got the original bluebeards last year and husband thought it was great, except it dried his beard out.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it actually helps my beard at all, but it sure makes me feel good.</li>
            <li>Kind of pricey for what it does, especially if the only difference between this and any other conditioner is the good smell.</li>
            <li>A great value for the serious beardsman.</li>
            <li>It does make the beard soft and clean and appears to help with styling the beard.</li>
            <li>The hairs are much softer to the touch, the beard is more manageable, and the gross beard-dandruff is gone.  </li>
            <li>but it doesnt feel like some kind of soft pillow of beard, but seems to work since my beard definitely doesn&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li>Has a little bit of a weird smell, but feels great and works great.</li>
            <li>It does what it is meant to do and positive results can visibly be seen and felt.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for high quality daily maintenance for your beard, you just can&#x27;t do better than this.</li>
            <li>Very quick shipping as this was a last minute Christmas gift.  </li>
            <li>One interior plastic bag and one large ziplock around the bottle ensured no leakage.  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;Thin, watery consistency that can make it hard to get a good lather.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for a few months and overall I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li>The effects were immediate: after only two or three days I can see a huge improvement.  </li>
            <li>Made it very wiry.</li>
            <li>plus it is very pricey.</li>
            <li>and I would absolutely agree.</li>
            <li>then I wouldn&#x27;t mind so much.</li>
            <li>I use this product daily now, and really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Makes my fiancés beard so much softer and tames it.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone who wants to grow their beard beyond stubble and not have an itchy face.  </li>
            <li>I was using hair conditioner on my beard and really didn&#x27;t like the smell so close to my mouth and nose.  </li>
            <li>This wash leaves my beard smelling fresh, feeling soft, and my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li>If you want to smooth out your beard save yourself A LOT of money and buy a container of L&#x27;oreal Total Repair 5 damage-erasing balm.</li>
            <li>and he really loves it</li>
            <li>Works really well, I assume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have a beard longer than 1/2&amp;#34; then a product like this is really a necessity.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m suprised in how fast I felt a difference.</li>
            <li>I find it works very well</li>
            <li>very satisfactory.&lt;br</li>
            <li>for the smell, I personally really like it.</li>
            <li>and it really leaves my face and beard</li>
            <li>feeling ready for the day ahead.</li>
            <li>I use it every day when I&#x27;m ready to shower.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my dad because his beard is REAL FRIZZY</li>
            <li>&#x27; REAL.</li>
            <li>I was also suspicious of this because it didn&#x27;t seem to foam up as much as I would expect for a shampoo-type product.</li>
            <li>and I find I&#x27;m not using it much at all.</li>
            <li>I also really like the scent</li>
            <li>Do really feel it cleans my beard.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really put into words how it felt except to compare it to a acne wash or astringent and how it strips all the oil from your skin.</li>
            <li>I really do think it is helping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a very wirey beard.</li>
            <li>only so that&#x27;s pretty cool.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure they watered down mine.</li>
            <li>good stuff, worth the price, might seem like not alot, but a little bit goes a long way, smells like lime</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve got a decent amount of facial hair, this makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not convinced this works any better than any other conditioner you might use that is intended for hair.  </li>
            <li>I would not recommend Bluebeards Original Beard Wash Extra Conditioning with Jojoba Oils.</li>
            <li>I started with the regular Bluebeards Original Beard Wash (in the blue bottle) and Bluebeards original beard saver lotion.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the scent of the Original Beard Wash without the extra conditioning</li>
            <li>Bigger bottle than the original.</li>
            <li>I had only moderate expectation and fir the first 2 or 3 days that I used the product, it was just OK.</li>
            <li>im currently at 11 months of beard growth so my beard is pretty long, i probably use more than i need to but it still lasted me a while.</li>
            <li>this will help with the early itching that comes probably in the first 2 weeks or so.  </li>
            <li>As far as the smell goes, if you want something that smells pretty</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>I decided to go back to Bluebeards since I grew to love the scent of the Beard Saver (I was a bit shocked at first thinking my beard would smell like lime candy, but it&#x27;s really great).</li>
            <li>It foams up more when you lather it in, although it still doesn&#x27;t foam nearly as much as a typical shampoo.</li>
            <li>It also has a slightly better smell to it, which is a bit less acidic/limey.</li>
            <li>bottle lasted me for more than a month and a half.</li>
            <li>A lot less bristle and a lot more softness and sheen.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been off of this product for more than a week, and my beard texture has improved to its previous acceptable level of roughness.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on the search for a decent beard shampoo for quite a while now and was hopeful when I bought this product.</li>
            <li>This product was purchased for an older man who decided to grow a beard.</li>
            <li>He is very into beard care and says that this helps his beard look more tame.</li>
            <li>Prior to using the Bluebeards original wash, he felt his skin was always super dry beneath his beard.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to all my friends, family, and you as well.</li>
            <li>Mine can get dry and rough, but this helps a great deal with a daily wash.  </li>
            <li>I work construction so my beard easily holds dust and other grime that is flying around.</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s beard is so soft now and it looks so much healthier.</li>
            <li>I got this for a fun birthday gift, since I had recently grown out a beard</li>
            <li>I am just a normal college student who loves to takes care of his beard.</li>
            <li>I get a faint smell of that nice lime, but it quickly starts to smell &amp;#34;off.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be loyal to this as long as my beard is around.</li>
            <li>The new 8 oz size keeps the bottle going longer.</li>
            <li>This was a new suggestion via Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Getting a good later from the wash is a bit hard</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get this shampoo to lather up much on the tips because there is too much hair and not enough face to rub it against to lather up.</li>
            <li>In fact, after using the wash I actually notice my beard is MORE frizzier and harder to control and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s been conditioned at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seems very natural.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use lasts a long time (you only need a drop)</li>
            <li>This did NOT make my beard soft!</li>
            <li>I had even used the regular Bluebeard&#x27;s Original Beard Wash, and it was the same story.  </li>
            <li>And he was pleased with it since he usually used just shampoo for his beard.</li>
            <li>I have used the original beard wash for years, this just seems to have some extra daily conditioner in it.  </li>
            <li>I used this stuff religiously and for the first couple days, I was amazed.  </li>
            <li>Recommended the product to several friends when I used the first bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it does soften the beard more to make up for it.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and cleans nicely without drying or stripping your beard.  </li>
            <li>My beard has become slightly softer, and I really enjoy the smell when applying it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had a short beard for a long time and recently decided to let it grow out beyond being able to use my beard trimmer&#x27;s highest setting to keep it tamed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While the bottle directions say you only need a small amount, I found the consistency to be a little thin and watery, and as someone with growth more than an inch long, it definitely took a good amount to get a good lather and wash out of it.</li>
            <li>Its got a clean scent and didn&#x27;t weigh my beard down like when I was using shampoo&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d personally prefer something that was a little more manly and non chemically smelling that lasted longer, but it wasn&#x27;t something that would turn me off to purchasing it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Been using Bluebeards products for over a year, and my beard has been soft and manageable since then.</li>
            <li>Not an appealing scent in the least in my opinion.</li>
            <li>have a pretty long beard.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing natural about it, so if that&#x27;s something you&#x27;re concerned about, it may not be for you.</li>
            <li>Keeps my beard soft and well conditioned.  </li>
            <li>He really enjoys this product and this is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased it.</li>
            <li>I am careul to read ingredients on products because I prefer natural ones.</li>
            <li>Just a tiny bit, maybe a dime size amount will do my whole beard.</li>
            <li>Leaves my beard shiny, soft and it doesn&#x27;t get out of control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bluebeards conditioner worked very well, I can see a big difference.  </li>
            <li>If you buy this expecting it to control your beard by making it soft and manageable, forget it.  </li>
            <li>It really did last for quite a while</li>
            <li>It leaves my beard soft and feeling wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Frequent cat calls from women, rapid muscle growth, raging confidence, and an erection that lasts up to 4 hrs.</li>
            <li>My beard is so stroke-ably soft.</li>
            <li>Keeps my beard soft as well.  </li>
            <li>My beard, while naturally luxurious, was taken up a notch by this glorious product.</li>
            <li>Still searching for something that will make my beard supremely soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Slightly chemically scent&lt;br /&gt;Scent doesn&#x27;t last very long&lt;</li>
            <li>That got me thinking that maybe the formula is way off, and there&#x27;s too much lime and not enough oil and aloe.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pretty expensive, but it&#x27;s a good product and probably will buy again.</li>
            <li>Leaves his beard soft, easy to comb through and a little bit shiny!</li>
            <li>After using the standard Bluebeard Beard Wash for years while I kept a trim \\&quot;Will Riker\\&quot; beard, I grew out my beard to a \\&quot;Full Galifianakis\\&quot; and noticed it getting a bit dry.</li>
            <li>In fact, I think going back and forth between this and other shampoos provided better results, but I have nothing to back that up.</li>
            <li>I had a light amount of the dreaded &amp;#34;beard-druff&amp;#34; before using this product due to using regular shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>This size bottle will last a LONG time because it takes just a little drop to create a nice lather.</li>
            <li>It does smell good and yes, it does soften your beard a little, but no more than going out and buying a shampoo with conditioners off the supermarket shelf.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t rate this one star because it didn&#x27;t make my beard hairs fall out, but I can&#x27;t give it any more than two because I can go and buy a decent bottle of shampoo and conditioner for less than half the price I paid for this 8 oz.</li>
            <li>It definitely cleans the beard and softens it a bit, but I don&#x27;t see a very big difference between this and good soap or shampoo, or at least enough to justify</li>
            <li>Moved into a new house in a new town that has super hard water.</li>
            <li>However for the price I expected a little more.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve both noticed a new softness to his goatee since he started using Blue Beard.</li>
            <li>The product is simple to apply and definitely makes my beard much softer after use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for a few days and so far it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s worth $20 to me.</li>
            <li>You can achieve the same or much better results by using a common hair conditioner.  </li>
            <li>A friend reported the same problem and thought it was simply too much conditioner which caused matting.</li>
            <li>Makes even short beards soft!</li>
            <li>I have tried this and the other original Bluebeards beard wash (blue bottle) and I prefer the white bottle formula.</li>
            <li>You need a quarter sized amount at least to make it suds up and work...smells good as far as I&#x27;m concerned, but it feels acidic on my hairs, I&#x27;m not sure how to describe it....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to keep buying the Beard Saver and probably try a few other Bluebeard products because I love the smell</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying this stuff is worthless, it still smelled amazing and kept my beard just as clean as shampoo.  </li>
            <li>right after use my beard feels softer, but an hour later it&#x27;s back to dry and scratchy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not noticing any softness or taming of my facial hair so far.</li>
            <li>if you have soft facial hair it will give you the sense of continued softness.</li>
            <li>I had battled beard dandruff my entire adult life.</li>
            <li>While I haven&#x27;t kept track of exactly long it took, it did take him a long time to go through the first bottle.</li>
            <li>Slightly foamy, slightly smelly with only a hint of the aloe that gives it some of its magical power.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried quite a few products to attempt to soften my very coarse and thick beard, and most don&#x27;t do much.  </li>
            <li>The price might seem a bit on the high side, but 8 oz will last you a long time.</li>
            <li>facial hair is very \\&quot;wiry\\&quot; and rough</li>
            <li>the weak stuff you put in a Prius either,but the high octane stuff that goes in a Lamborghini), rock climbing in a jeep, the courage of Marcus Lutrell, championship wrestling, monster trucks, big tattoos, Rambos headband, poker games, arm wrestling, steroids, the super bowl, Pontiac GTO judge,and just a hint of citrus all combine into one manly smell.</li>
            <li>I got this mostly as a &amp;#34;beard softener&amp;#34;, to make my scraggles less scraggly, but I&#x27;m never really sure if it&#x27;s doing anything for that.  </li>
            <li>I used to have to keep it fairly short due to the fact that the skin would get itchy and flake under my beard if I grew it out too much.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed many people on here have complained about the chemically scent, and while I agree it does have a slight chemical scent, I wouldn&#x27;t compare it to household cleaners like others have in their reviews.</li>

            <li> smells great (very lightly lime scented) and picks up a nice lather.</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> Love the citrus smell!</li>
            <li> Very pleased, but this is all subjective, make your own opinion.</li>
            <li> This does a fantastic job of cleaning and conditioning my beard but is also great for my skin underneath, and eliminates flakes.</li>
            <li> it worked AMAZING.  </li>
            <li> its been 1 week since I started using this product and the result is amazing.</li>
            <li> This product smelled amazing.  </li>
            <li> The smell is amazing and it lathers nice.</li>
            <li> I sure there are products just as good for a 1/3 of the price.</li>
            <li> I use it every shower and honestly I can&#x27;t tell if it makes any difference in my beard at all.</li>
            <li> received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> It suds nicely, and doesn&#x27;t take a ton of product to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> and it smells nice.</li>
            <li> but it seems to be working nicely for now.</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t many choices for beard conditioners this is as good as any that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Feels great on the skin and washes clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so pleasant and easy to use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome, and I would highly recommend it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great product and quick shipping</li>
            <li> If you have a beard with an inch or more or growth ( and chances are, if you&#x27;re considering buying a shampoo specifically for beards, you probably do), you may find you have to use more than you&#x27;d like to get a good wash out of</li>
            <li> WOW what a great product!!</li>
            <li> If you want a great looking and great feeling soft healthy beard, buy this stuff.</li>
            <li> I considered calling up the company to ask them to describe the scent to make sure that I didn&#x27;t receive a defective bottle - that perhaps got some kind of tank cleaning agent was in it.</li>
            <li> By all means this is the best product i have used on my beard thus far.</li>
            <li> Still, this product is the best I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re looking for a great beard-wash that will leave your beard feeling stronger, softer and more full, this is it.</li>
            <li> After reading all the great reviews on the Beard Wash with (and this is the most important part to me) extra conditioning, I figured this would be perfect.</li>
            <li> Smells great, doesn&#x27;t affect my asthma and leaves my beard smooth and clean</li>
            <li> have helped to keep my beard soft, clean, looking great and smelling great.</li>
            <li> Will buy more</li>
            <li> If I felt that it was a better product</li>
            <li> I love this beard wash.</li>
            <li> It also made my beard seem easier to brush and more presentable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the stuff.</li>
            <li> I use shampoo and conditioner from target that is a quarter the price and works much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a beard ever since I&#x27;ve been able to grow one</li>
            <li> I like the wash my beard feels better and looks better.</li>
            <li> Very happy overall, will repurchase.</li>
            <li> but now he is in love with it and has requested more.</li>
            <li> He has mentioned that his beard isnt tangly any more</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this stuff.  </li>
            <li> My beard is much more manageable.  </li>
            <li> My beard is more manageable, doesn&#x27;t flake anymore</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got BETTER results with Beardsley.</li>
            <li> It also is better and getting rid of my beard dandruff.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> , so grooming has never been on the top of my list.</li>
            <li> I bought this beard shampoo for my boyfriend and we absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll fall in love with your man and his beard all over again.</li>
            <li> Glad I came across this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I like it and will probably buy more.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> truly is my favorite part of my morning routine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this more than the bear saver.</li>
            <li> and seven more words are required to submit</li>
            <li> and he said conditioner made for women&#x27;s hair works better.</li>
            <li> and he doesn&#x27;t mind it either. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> While the product seems to work \\&quot;ok</li>
            <li> Even after many months, it&#x27;s a smell that I just can&#x27;t get by...</li>
            <li> Does a better job of softening my beard than anything else I&#x27;ve tried plus my girlfriend loves the scent.</li>
            <li> and I love that they don&#x27;t test on animals.</li>
            <li> me a 10 Gallon bucket and in 2 weeks with evaporation and refills, should be able to forge you an iron sword or two.</li>
            <li> This beard wash was just okay.</li>
            <li> My tee tree shampoo works better and is cheaper.</li>
            <li> My studies have proven that 5 out of 5 women enjoyed the feeling of it on the inside of their thighs.</li>
            <li> Once you rinse your beard off, there is called forth from the neverworlds magical powers.</li>
            <li> In fact, I am typing this one handed, because I can&#x27;t stop touching my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> beard hairs more manageable</li>
            <li> /&gt;Regardless, the more I used it, the more stars I was taking away in my head.</li>
            <li> Then the 5th was better.</li>
            <li> After many Google searches, all signs seemed to point to Bluebeards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better results with Dove Men+Care at 1/4th the cost.</li>
            <li> I love nuzzling into his beard right after a wash, it&#x27;s smells really good.  </li>
            <li> Like I said, it&#x27;s nice, it works well, but it smells more like something I&#x27;d use to clean a counter top with rather than a beard cleaner.</li>
            <li> It does seem to keep the skin underneath the beard clean and free of zits and sores and stuff, so I guess that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> It keeps the beard clean and conditions nicely.</li>
            <li> this stuff does a pretty good job as cleaning it without drying out my skin and beard, but it smells like dish detergent.</li>
            <li> This stuff is perfect for long, unruly beards.</li>
            <li> , it works pretty good and does make your bears softer.</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff, it gets rid of the itch.</li>
            <li> This works great, and I live the lime scent it leaves.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t recommend this product compared to another beard wash, as I haven&#x27;t used any others, but I&#x27;d strongly recommend it for anyone who is still using Head &amp; Shoulders on their face.  :)</li>
            <li> As my beard grows longer it&#x27;s getting a bit frizzier and not as easy to control, so the claim that it would help fight frizz was appealing to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I can easily buy this from amazon now.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, lathers very well, smells like skittles which i think is great!</li>
            <li> Leaves my beard fresh and clean with a pleasant lime scent.  </li>
            <li> When paired with the conditioner I had a very soft beard that was much more attractive and easy to style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its great for you beard and face leaving it very refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li> Honestly I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, good price.</li>
            <li> so I figured it was worth a shot and to be honest...</li>
            <li> He said he liked the scent however I most certainly didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Lathers up better than the original.  </li>
            <li> the shampoo is easy on your face.</li>
            <li> Easy to Apply</li>
            <li> Easy to Rinse</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> It is strong citrus smell</li>
            <li> so you would be wise to invest in some sort of leave in conditioner, such as Honest Amish Beard Balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bluebeard&#x27;s is strong.</li>
            <li> Then I realized that the scent strongly reminded me of industrial floor cleaner, something you&#x27;d find in a janitor&#x27;s mop bucket.  </li>
            <li> you get used to the strong scent and</li>
            <li> the smell is nice and makes your beard feel noticeably softer after a few washes with leaves you with an incredible clean beard!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> just fine.</li>
            <li> I was super pleased with the care that the Shave Mart decided to package the bottle with.  </li>
            <li> Powers which turned my beard into an object worthy of the most embarrassing worship.</li>
            <li> This smells kind of citrusy and does a good job of cleaning and conditioning my long beard.</li>
            <li> Great scent and great foaming action to tackle the dirt and dust in my long goatee.</li>
            <li> rated it a 4/5 because i wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the smell.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Blue-Beards products.</li>
            <li> Softens beard, smells great and can use multiple times per week without drying.</li>
            <li> Product leaves the beard feeling and smelling fantastic.</li>
            <li> This definitely leaves your beard feeling and smelling great.</li>
            <li> I use more than they say on thw bottle but worth the money.</li>
            <li> My beard feel fresh and look better than ever.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price when you take into account how many uses you will get out of it.</li>
            <li> Great smell, not too frothy, and it doesn&#x27;t even have an off-putting taste when some inevitably gets in your mouth when you wash your mustache.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I would definitely recommend it to anyone!!!!!</li>
            <li> It works well and has a light citrus scent.</li>
            <li> My hubby is on his way to MANY wins, and hopefully will be national soon, and he uses this product.</li>
            <li> i stopped buying cheap shampoos and conditioners, they&#x27;re not made for beards and faces.</li>
            <li> That said, some guys out there obviously enjoy it,</li>
            <li> Trying this one and so far so good.</li>
            <li> Blue beards is a refreshing and good smelling conditioner that cleans my beard without over drying.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hubby&#x27;s beard smelling very fresh.</li>
            <li> story short, this product is true to its description - it cleans and conditions your beard and gives it a great smell.</li>
            <li> ; I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s losing its nice fragrance while inside the bottle, maybe I was sent an older bottle, etc.</li>
            <li> I bought this and the Bluebeards Original Beard Saver.</li>
            <li> It was familiar, yet elusive.  </li>
            <li> Bluebeards Original Beard Saver.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if thats the best thing....</li>
            <li> and so I&#x27;m pretty pleased.</li>
            <li> leaves my beard and skin perfectly clean without drying it out</li>
            <li> , so I think it is also keeping my skin under the beard clean.  </li>
            <li> It will clean your beard.</li>
            <li> It will clean the hell out of your beard.</li>
            <li> Helps keep my beard clean and my skin from getting dandruff.</li>
            <li> This stuff keeps my beard squeaky clean and keeps the itches at bay.</li>
            <li> This smells like citrus and has a clean scent.</li>
            <li> Definitely do a good job of keeping my beard feeling soft and fresh.  </li>
            <li> This beard wash smells good, lasts a long time, and is easy to rinse out.</li>
            <li> The ones that do have some kind of positive effect don&#x27;t seem to do so consistently.  </li>
            <li> Overall good product.</li>
            <li> Keeps my beard nice and soft, no dryness or flakes after wash.</li>
            <li> Keeps the beard nice, soft, and manageable.</li>
            <li> and I have been able to grow it out longer much to my husband&#x27;s satisfaction.</li>
            <li> but I grow a full beard once in a while.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money can use good quality hair care products and get better results.</li>
            <li> I must say it smells fresh, clean, and unique.</li>
            <li> Makes he&#x27;s beard super soft and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing, Clean, Fresh, and no harsh smell.</li>
            <li> My beard is much softer, and very clean.  </li>
            <li> I feel that this new &amp;#34;extra conditioning agent&amp;#34; version does not lather as well as the older model, and it does not have as strong a smell (even though I liked the smell).  </li>
            <li> Luckily that smell went away after I rinsed.</li>
            <li> Shipped quick and works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also been reading more and more that one should use the same shampoo and conditioner for their beard that they use for their head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really has to be rubbed in good to lather up which causes my beard to tangle more and loose more hairs then with normal hair shampoos.  </li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t seem to condition my beard any better than normal hair shampoo / soap does.</li>
            <li> I have kept a beard off and on for most of my life, and I have tended to use normal hair shampoo for the upkeep of my beard.  </li>
            <li> For a &amp;#34;extra conditioning shampoo&amp;#34; I feel it is more like normal conditioning...  </li>
            <li> Its better than normal  conditioner</li>
            <li> It smells strange when scrubbing into beard, but any lingering smell is good if you even notice it.</li>
            <li> I bought some beard oils from a different company and they just don&#x27;t compare with how clean and nice Bluebeards makes my beard feel.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised, and it smells like lime jello!</li>
            <li> Bluebeards Original was the first brand of beard wash I tried.</li>
            <li> Left my beard looking 10X better!</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but great results.</li>
            <li> Why not a nicer vanilla scent, or some other more pleasant masculine scent?   </li>
            <li> This product leaves my beard feeling extremely soft but I gave it four stars only because the smell is not so great.</li>
            <li> Based on the cost of the bottle, however, I don&#x27;t feel that it was worth it.</li>
            <li> The wash also works well for your entire face, and it conditions your skin nicely got shaving/cleaning up your cheeks and neck.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the money and</li>
            <li> Helps with any itchiness and irritated skin around the beard and keeps the beard hair healthy, silky, and soft.</li>
            <li> Many Natural Ingredients&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not even worth $5.</li>
            <li> Worth the 2in1 product.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough nice things about this stuff, it has persuaded me to keep growing my beard with reckless abandon.</li>
            <li> It softens and conditions my beard, making it look fuller, and far more manageable.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> It only takes a couple of drops to get a nice foamy lather.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> It does just as it states, and is WELL worth the price.</li>
            <li> So if someone needs more foaming action to think it&#x27;s working, try that.</li>
            <li> It smells kinda of like licorice (which is not a bad thing), and made his beard soft and easy to brush thru.  </li>
            <li> and/or you significant other love citrus)!.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve run out, I do plan on trying other brands to see if there&#x27;s any one I&#x27;d be more satisfied with, but I wouldn&#x27;t rule out purchasing Bluebeards again.</li>
            <li> This beard wash made my face and beard feel so clean it became my favorite part of my daily shower.</li>
            <li> It smells better and foams better, and you use less of it.</li>
            <li> It lathers ok, but it kind of has a weird smell that makes me think this is, like, mostly dishwashing machine soap.</li>
            <li> As a bearded American I&#x27;ve tried different products this one is by far the best!</li>
            <li> But it really didn&#x27;t give me the full effect until i used about a quarter sized portion in the palm of my hand.</li>
            <li> Sent it back, return was easy!</li>
            <li> Many beard products have patchouli oil or other strong scents that I don&#x27;t care for.  </li>
            <li> I would recomend it, but i think its better if you just get the other two products by blue beard and just use a really good condition for your beard instead, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It really helps get the dirt and dead skin out from under his beard and keeps his beard looking great and smelling wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am still forced to use a conditioner, but otherwise this is by far one of the best beard shampoos</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product and my husband will never go back to regular face wash again!</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;d call this a very sound product and reccomend it to anyone with a beard.</li>
            <li> However, very gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li> Good size (8oz) for beards longer than 6 inches (I&#x27;ve used a little over 1/2 in a month)  </li>
            <li> My girlfriend for the first time loves to rub my beard.</li>
            <li> The first thing that turned me off from Bluebeards Beard Wash was the odor.</li>
            <li> I struggle to find anything to dislike about the wash because it does exactly what the product description states.</li>
            <li> after initially not liking the consistency, i got used to it and was able to work with it</li>
            <li> definitely glad to have bluebeards back!</li>
            <li> Within days my beard became softer and more relaxed, and has stayed this way with daily use of this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be getting more of this in the future!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed that it feels much softer!</li>
            <li> I love that, but the smell is gone minutes after you get out of the shower and the results are no different than if  you used Pert Plus for $2.  </li>
            <li> Bluebeard&#x27;s does exactly what it sets out to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used numerous beard shampoos and this is probably my favorite...</li>
            <li> and it really makes the beard shine!</li>
            <li> He said that after the first use he felt a difference in his beard.</li>
            <li> He really enjoys the smell of it!</li>
            <li> I actually could say more, but just suggest you give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Like the reviews said, after the first use beard/facial dandruff disappeared.</li>
            <li> and I am now able to comb my beard so that \\&quot;most\\&quot; of the hairs are going in the same direction</li>
            <li> After a while though, the results I got at first petered away.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant at first about the price, $22 for an 8 oz.</li>
            <li> It makes the beard much softer and it leaves it smelling like fresh limes.</li>
            <li> Its my first time trying it</li>
            <li> This product absolutely does NOT work as advertised!</li>
            <li> The first bottle would have been a 5 star.</li>
            <li> I currently use (and love)</li>
            <li> The first time it hits my nose</li>
            <li> Upon extiting the shower after my first use, I noticed that my beard had never been rougher.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Half-way through the week I started repeating after the first rinse, and when I did it foamed-up a lot.</li>
            <li> I noticed that the hair actually seemed more stripped.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;blended with natural jojoba oils, to soften and smooth the wildest of beards.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> Got the original bluebeards last year and husband thought it was great, except it dried his beard out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it actually helps my beard at all, but it sure makes me feel good.</li>
            <li> Kind of pricey for what it does, especially if the only difference between this and any other conditioner is the good smell.</li>
            <li> A great value for the serious beardsman.</li>
            <li> It does make the beard soft and clean and appears to help with styling the beard.</li>
            <li> The hairs are much softer to the touch, the beard is more manageable, and the gross beard-dandruff is gone.  </li>
            <li> but it doesnt feel like some kind of soft pillow of beard, but seems to work since my beard definitely doesn&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li> Has a little bit of a weird smell, but feels great and works great.</li>
            <li> It does what it is meant to do and positive results can visibly be seen and felt.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for high quality daily maintenance for your beard, you just can&#x27;t do better than this.</li>
            <li> Very quick shipping as this was a last minute Christmas gift.  </li>
            <li> One interior plastic bag and one large ziplock around the bottle ensured no leakage.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;Thin, watery consistency that can make it hard to get a good lather.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few months and overall I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> The effects were immediate: after only two or three days I can see a huge improvement.  </li>
            <li> Made it very wiry.</li>
            <li> plus it is very pricey.</li>
            <li> and I would absolutely agree.</li>
            <li> then I wouldn&#x27;t mind so much.</li>
            <li> I use this product daily now, and really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Makes my fiancés beard so much softer and tames it.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who wants to grow their beard beyond stubble and not have an itchy face.  </li>
            <li> I was using hair conditioner on my beard and really didn&#x27;t like the smell so close to my mouth and nose.  </li>
            <li> This wash leaves my beard smelling fresh, feeling soft, and my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> If you want to smooth out your beard save yourself A LOT of money and buy a container of L&#x27;oreal Total Repair 5 damage-erasing balm.</li>
            <li> and he really loves it</li>
            <li> Works really well, I assume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have a beard longer than 1/2&amp;#34; then a product like this is really a necessity.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m suprised in how fast I felt a difference.</li>
            <li> I find it works very well</li>
            <li> very satisfactory.&lt;br</li>
            <li> for the smell, I personally really like it.</li>
            <li> and it really leaves my face and beard</li>
            <li> feeling ready for the day ahead.</li>
            <li> I use it every day when I&#x27;m ready to shower.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dad because his beard is REAL FRIZZY</li>
            <li> &#x27; REAL.</li>
            <li> I was also suspicious of this because it didn&#x27;t seem to foam up as much as I would expect for a shampoo-type product.</li>
            <li> and I find I&#x27;m not using it much at all.</li>
            <li> I also really like the scent</li>
            <li> Do really feel it cleans my beard.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really put into words how it felt except to compare it to a acne wash or astringent and how it strips all the oil from your skin.</li>
            <li> I really do think it is helping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a very wirey beard.</li>
            <li> only so that&#x27;s pretty cool.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure they watered down mine.</li>
            <li> good stuff, worth the price, might seem like not alot, but a little bit goes a long way, smells like lime</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got a decent amount of facial hair, this makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not convinced this works any better than any other conditioner you might use that is intended for hair.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend Bluebeards Original Beard Wash Extra Conditioning with Jojoba Oils.</li>
            <li> I started with the regular Bluebeards Original Beard Wash (in the blue bottle) and Bluebeards original beard saver lotion.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the scent of the Original Beard Wash without the extra conditioning</li>
            <li> Bigger bottle than the original.</li>
            <li> I had only moderate expectation and fir the first 2 or 3 days that I used the product, it was just OK.</li>
            <li> im currently at 11 months of beard growth so my beard is pretty long, i probably use more than i need to but it still lasted me a while.</li>
            <li> this will help with the early itching that comes probably in the first 2 weeks or so.  </li>
            <li> As far as the smell goes, if you want something that smells pretty</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I decided to go back to Bluebeards since I grew to love the scent of the Beard Saver (I was a bit shocked at first thinking my beard would smell like lime candy, but it&#x27;s really great).</li>
            <li> It foams up more when you lather it in, although it still doesn&#x27;t foam nearly as much as a typical shampoo.</li>
            <li> It also has a slightly better smell to it, which is a bit less acidic/limey.</li>
            <li> bottle lasted me for more than a month and a half.</li>
            <li> A lot less bristle and a lot more softness and sheen.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been off of this product for more than a week, and my beard texture has improved to its previous acceptable level of roughness.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the search for a decent beard shampoo for quite a while now and was hopeful when I bought this product.</li>
            <li> This product was purchased for an older man who decided to grow a beard.</li>
            <li> He is very into beard care and says that this helps his beard look more tame.</li>
            <li> Prior to using the Bluebeards original wash, he felt his skin was always super dry beneath his beard.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to all my friends, family, and you as well.</li>
            <li> Mine can get dry and rough, but this helps a great deal with a daily wash.  </li>
            <li> I work construction so my beard easily holds dust and other grime that is flying around.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s beard is so soft now and it looks so much healthier.</li>
            <li> I got this for a fun birthday gift, since I had recently grown out a beard</li>
            <li> I am just a normal college student who loves to takes care of his beard.</li>
            <li> I get a faint smell of that nice lime, but it quickly starts to smell &amp;#34;off.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be loyal to this as long as my beard is around.</li>
            <li> The new 8 oz size keeps the bottle going longer.</li>
            <li> This was a new suggestion via Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Getting a good later from the wash is a bit hard</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get this shampoo to lather up much on the tips because there is too much hair and not enough face to rub it against to lather up.</li>
            <li> In fact, after using the wash I actually notice my beard is MORE frizzier and harder to control and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s been conditioned at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seems very natural.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use lasts a long time (you only need a drop)</li>
            <li> This did NOT make my beard soft!</li>
            <li> I had even used the regular Bluebeard&#x27;s Original Beard Wash, and it was the same story.  </li>
            <li> And he was pleased with it since he usually used just shampoo for his beard.</li>
            <li> I have used the original beard wash for years, this just seems to have some extra daily conditioner in it.  </li>
            <li> I used this stuff religiously and for the first couple days, I was amazed.  </li>
            <li> Recommended the product to several friends when I used the first bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it does soften the beard more to make up for it.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and cleans nicely without drying or stripping your beard.  </li>
            <li> My beard has become slightly softer, and I really enjoy the smell when applying it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a short beard for a long time and recently decided to let it grow out beyond being able to use my beard trimmer&#x27;s highest setting to keep it tamed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While the bottle directions say you only need a small amount, I found the consistency to be a little thin and watery, and as someone with growth more than an inch long, it definitely took a good amount to get a good lather and wash out of it.</li>
            <li> Its got a clean scent and didn&#x27;t weigh my beard down like when I was using shampoo&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d personally prefer something that was a little more manly and non chemically smelling that lasted longer, but it wasn&#x27;t something that would turn me off to purchasing it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Been using Bluebeards products for over a year, and my beard has been soft and manageable since then.</li>
            <li> Not an appealing scent in the least in my opinion.</li>
            <li> have a pretty long beard.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing natural about it, so if that&#x27;s something you&#x27;re concerned about, it may not be for you.</li>
            <li> Keeps my beard soft and well conditioned.  </li>
            <li> He really enjoys this product and this is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased it.</li>
            <li> I am careul to read ingredients on products because I prefer natural ones.</li>
            <li> Just a tiny bit, maybe a dime size amount will do my whole beard.</li>
            <li> Leaves my beard shiny, soft and it doesn&#x27;t get out of control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bluebeards conditioner worked very well, I can see a big difference.  </li>
            <li> If you buy this expecting it to control your beard by making it soft and manageable, forget it.  </li>
            <li> It really did last for quite a while</li>
            <li> It leaves my beard soft and feeling wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Frequent cat calls from women, rapid muscle growth, raging confidence, and an erection that lasts up to 4 hrs.</li>
            <li> My beard is so stroke-ably soft.</li>
            <li> Keeps my beard soft as well.  </li>
            <li> My beard, while naturally luxurious, was taken up a notch by this glorious product.</li>
            <li> Still searching for something that will make my beard supremely soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Slightly chemically scent&lt;br /&gt;Scent doesn&#x27;t last very long&lt;</li>
            <li> That got me thinking that maybe the formula is way off, and there&#x27;s too much lime and not enough oil and aloe.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pretty expensive, but it&#x27;s a good product and probably will buy again.</li>
            <li> Leaves his beard soft, easy to comb through and a little bit shiny!</li>
            <li> After using the standard Bluebeard Beard Wash for years while I kept a trim \\&quot;Will Riker\\&quot; beard, I grew out my beard to a \\&quot;Full Galifianakis\\&quot; and noticed it getting a bit dry.</li>
            <li> In fact, I think going back and forth between this and other shampoos provided better results, but I have nothing to back that up.</li>
            <li> I had a light amount of the dreaded &amp;#34;beard-druff&amp;#34; before using this product due to using regular shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> This size bottle will last a LONG time because it takes just a little drop to create a nice lather.</li>
            <li> It does smell good and yes, it does soften your beard a little, but no more than going out and buying a shampoo with conditioners off the supermarket shelf.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t rate this one star because it didn&#x27;t make my beard hairs fall out, but I can&#x27;t give it any more than two because I can go and buy a decent bottle of shampoo and conditioner for less than half the price I paid for this 8 oz.</li>
            <li> It definitely cleans the beard and softens it a bit, but I don&#x27;t see a very big difference between this and good soap or shampoo, or at least enough to justify</li>
            <li> Moved into a new house in a new town that has super hard water.</li>
            <li> However for the price I expected a little more.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve both noticed a new softness to his goatee since he started using Blue Beard.</li>
            <li> The product is simple to apply and definitely makes my beard much softer after use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a few days and so far it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s worth $20 to me.</li>
            <li> You can achieve the same or much better results by using a common hair conditioner.  </li>
            <li> A friend reported the same problem and thought it was simply too much conditioner which caused matting.</li>
            <li> Makes even short beards soft!</li>
            <li> I have tried this and the other original Bluebeards beard wash (blue bottle) and I prefer the white bottle formula.</li>
            <li> You need a quarter sized amount at least to make it suds up and work...smells good as far as I&#x27;m concerned, but it feels acidic on my hairs, I&#x27;m not sure how to describe it....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to keep buying the Beard Saver and probably try a few other Bluebeard products because I love the smell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying this stuff is worthless, it still smelled amazing and kept my beard just as clean as shampoo.  </li>
            <li> right after use my beard feels softer, but an hour later it&#x27;s back to dry and scratchy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not noticing any softness or taming of my facial hair so far.</li>
            <li> if you have soft facial hair it will give you the sense of continued softness.</li>
            <li> I had battled beard dandruff my entire adult life.</li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t kept track of exactly long it took, it did take him a long time to go through the first bottle.</li>
            <li> Slightly foamy, slightly smelly with only a hint of the aloe that gives it some of its magical power.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few products to attempt to soften my very coarse and thick beard, and most don&#x27;t do much.  </li>
            <li> The price might seem a bit on the high side, but 8 oz will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> facial hair is very \\&quot;wiry\\&quot; and rough</li>
            <li> the weak stuff you put in a Prius either,but the high octane stuff that goes in a Lamborghini), rock climbing in a jeep, the courage of Marcus Lutrell, championship wrestling, monster trucks, big tattoos, Rambos headband, poker games, arm wrestling, steroids, the super bowl, Pontiac GTO judge,and just a hint of citrus all combine into one manly smell.</li>
            <li> I got this mostly as a &amp;#34;beard softener&amp;#34;, to make my scraggles less scraggly, but I&#x27;m never really sure if it&#x27;s doing anything for that.  </li>
            <li> I used to have to keep it fairly short due to the fact that the skin would get itchy and flake under my beard if I grew it out too much.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed many people on here have complained about the chemically scent, and while I agree it does have a slight chemical scent, I wouldn&#x27;t compare it to household cleaners like others have in their reviews.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would recommend both of these products to anyone that wants to tame their wiry beard.</li>
            <li> The only reason I rate this one 4 stars is because the conditioner seems to be non existent and no apparent difference between this and the regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> I think some of this less positive reviews come from people who have neglected their beards and then expected an instant movie-star quality beard.</li>
            <li> A little really does go a long way.  </li>
            <li> it conditions well, but not much more different from a very conditioner.</li>
            <li> Only need a drop so this will last quite a long time.</li>
            <li> If you have a big bushy beard it may not last as long.</li>
            <li> It has vastly reduced the amount of dry flaky skin, but cant get rid of it or moisturize enough.</li>
            <li> Regular shampoos would leave my beard feeling coarse, stringy, and dry out the skin in my face.</li>
            <li> I am not one of those guys that&#x27;s been using this product long enough to comment on the change of quality, but I&#x27;ll chime in anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The 8 oz size will last a long time, too.</li>
            <li> live in the woods on a mountain and have been known to go a few days without a shower</li>
            <li> Bluebeards helped with the dry skin and itchiness, softened my beard and definitely gave it some fullness.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the high premium you&#x27;re paying for it, as compared with other typical hair shampoos and conditioners on the market.</li>
            <li> Work most days out in the Nevada desert, so my face is constantly blasted by wind and dust.</li>
            <li> Being a female, I am not sure how coarse beards usually are, but his beard hairs seem really rather coarse to me, and to him, he tells me.</li>
            <li> This product actually makes my beard feel stripped and rough.</li>
            <li> The product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> do recommend the product, however, as long as you use it as directed.</li>
            <li> The scent is a bit like that of a household lime scented cleaner, but it does not stick around long, allowing any beard oil to match with</li>
            <li> He sports a goatee about 11\\&quot; long.</li>
            <li> Again, this is minor since the smell doesn&#x27;t linger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My beard is about 8&amp;#34; long and this bitch can soak up some shampoo.</li>
            <li> It leaves my beard soft and tame.</li>
            <li> Originally found this beard wash randomly online</li>
            <li> He has a very long curly beard.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product for very long</li>
            <li> The skin underneath my beard is not flaky and dry anymore.  </li>
            <li> Works well on dry skin.</li>
            <li> He said that it didn&#x27;t help his dry skin, but I think it did.</li>
            <li> It smells like PineSol or some household cleaner, and it leaves my hair dry and somewhat \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; afterwards.</li>
            <li> Helps eliminate dry skin under your beard.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Helps with dry skin and itchiness&lt;</li>
            <li> I have dry skin in the winter</li>
            <li> My skin remained as dry as if I wasn&#x27;t using the product at all.</li>
            <li> I noticed a big difference after only a few days of using it</li>
            <li> /&gt;This did not live up to its claims, and I could not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Since I have Recieved it I have not had a single  beard tangle or ingrown hair.</li>
            <li> A little definitely goes a long way.</li>
            <li> (if you should choose to buy this stuff) is that it is very different than your typical shampoo.</li>
            <li> And last but not least, my acne seemed worse.</li>
            <li> That is simply not a true statement for several of us here.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like when you have just a little soap left</li>
            <li> A little bit of product will work for even the bushiest facial landscape.</li>
            <li> Now thirty-six years into life I discover that there is a difference between the hair on my head (what little is left) and the hair on my face.  </li>
            <li> Only need to use a little bit</li>
            <li> as far as cleaning my beard but nothing revolutionary in the least.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t mind the fake lime smell so much if the product actually worked.</li>
            <li> careful what you put on your beard, not all hair products are designed for your face.</li>
            <li> If this was $5 and not $22 I&#x27;d probably keep getting it, but the MASSIVE premium is not justified.</li>
            <li> For $20 this is not what I expected AT ALL.    </li>
            <li> I did not know what to expected when I ordered this.  </li>
            <li> I usually wet my beard in the shower put the beard wash in then comb it while the beard wash is in my beard</li>
            <li> It smells like a combination of nascar, automatic machine gun fire, a chuck Norris roundhouse kick, the sweat from a navy seal team, heavy weight lifting, muscle cars, Rudy Ruettigers only quarterback sack, gasoline(not</li>
            <li> Has no real smell.</li>
            <li> Even with that, there is absolutely no indication of any oils or conditioning agents.</li>
            <li> I also think that some guys don&#x27;t have quite the rough beard that they think they do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It made my thick and curly beard soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> This wash is pricey given the size but a little bit goes a very long way and this stuff lasts quite a long time.</li>
            <li> Now I can grow my beard as long as I want (its halfway down my chest now).  </li>
            <li> I accidentally used on what little hair I have left, and it did seem to work like any other conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> No more flaking dry skin under my facial hair.</li>
            <li> Bluebeards did help soften my facial hair and make it easier to tame.</li>
            <li> Keeps the itching down and helps control the dry skin under the beard.</li>
            <li> For a very long time I have just used shampoo, bars of natural soap, or my wife&#x27;s expensive shampoo to wash my facial hair.</li>
            <li> noticed less dry skin and beard dander, with continued use.</li>
            <li> feedback is watered down product of poor quality and very overpriced.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I gave 4 stars because i do plan to try other brands to compare.</li>
            <li> but I would only wash it ever other day with just a small portion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried other products like baby shampoo, moisturizer, etc.</li>
            <li> i won&#x27;t use anything else on my beard other than Bluebeards.</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews before deciding to buy this and was unsure about the scent as this wash contains lime.</li>
            <li> As with the other Bluebeard products I use on my beard, I started using this in September.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not found any other product like this - it helps to condition and soften ones beard.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> It was a requested gift for one son and since the other son has a beard as well, I purchased two.  </li>
            <li> I plan on trying other brands, but this is my review of Bluebeards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> other problem I had with it was the consistency.</li>
            <li> Have been using this stuff for a couple of months, but have not really noticed any difference from the shampoo I was previously using.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but a little bit really does go a long way.</li>
            <li> I was pretty desperate when dry skin and acne began forming underneath my beard.</li>
            <li> major complaint is that after using this for a little over two weeks now I haven&#x27;t noticed any change.</li>
            <li> At least it makes the bottle last longer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only complaint...</li>
            <li> This product may not be for everyone, but at that price it&#x27;s not worth paying to find out.</li>
            <li> Cuts down on itch, and helps the hair itself.</li>
            <li> and you sit down like a girl when you pee, then use your girlfriends or wife&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> Agreed with other reivews - the scent can be a little off putting at times.  </li>
            <li> I used what would amount to the size of a quarter to a half dollar amount.</li>
            <li> feels smoother, fuller and less scratchy.  </li>
            <li> , I think I bought it about 2 months ago and still have about half of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve found the scent to be a bit overpowering and even a bit distasteful - enough to not use the product regularly.  </li>
            <li> While the scent wasn&#x27;t what I&#x27;d hoped it&#x27;d be, I typically found that I could no longer smell it after rinsing it out of my beard anyway.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Beard has been bothering me less, doesn&#x27;t appear to me as unruly</li>
            <li> It did cut down on the dryness of my skin and the amount of beard dandruff, for a little while.  </li>
            <li> It does slightly soften your beard but it also dries it out a little.</li>
            <li> very minor complaint is the smell.</li>
            <li> I use just a little bit (about 3/4 the size of a dime in the palm of my hand) while showering.  </li>
            <li> Just a little dab on the finger</li>
            <li> I wish the bottle was a little cooler looking for my shower though.</li>
            <li> This product made my face under my beard itchy red and painful and for the next few days dry and flaky as well.</li>
            <li> It does not feel like it is harsh on the hair at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll wash my face, apply this and let sit for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Smells like green penny candy that your grandma has at her house.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*not of course to be confused with an adjective of blue...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s stiff price-tag.</li>
            <li> Since I started growing my beard, I have searched for a product that could tame it.</li>
            <li> When going by their instructions to \\&quot;Place a small amount of Bluebeards on the tips of fingers and massage into beard and face.\\&quot;, it generates little to no foamy lather.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way with my very thick beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Skin on my face, especially under my short kept beard was drying and flaking badly.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my beard-growing husband and we were annoyed that it did not live up to any part of its claim.</li>
            <li> In any case, I do like the smell - though it is a bit overpriced for the small amount you get.</li>
            <li> This is the 4th or 5th bottle we&#x27;ve gone through in the past couple years.</li>
            <li> I usually just keep a chin goatee</li>
            <li> I gave it a chance over time, despite the fact of the critical reviews and it failed.</li>
            <li> On the directions it states to use a small amount poured over your fingers and massage it into your face and neck.</li>
            <li> If worried try the small bottle, that&#x27;s what I did.</li>
            <li> As a beard wearer and enthusiast, and someone who&#x27;s been growing a longer beard for the past couple years, I&#x27;ve been wanting to give beard shampoos a try to see if they&#x27;d help at all soften and straighten my unrulier-the-longer-it-gets beard.</li>
            <li> You do NOT need to use this daily unless you work in a filthy environment, such as a forging operation or a coal mine.</li>
            <li> Probably not on company&#x27;s fault, but has to do with the level of hard water here.&lt;br /&gt;Give</li>
            <li> This is not a product placement negative review scam ad bulls</li>
            <li> Working it into my thick, manly, face locks it was unimpressive.</li>
            <li> I used this crap after running out of Bear Buddy to try new products and this is just some lime juice chemical s</li>
            <li> SERIOUSLY AVOID.</li>
            <li> and it lathers up like crazy with a little bit of massaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He said that it has dried it out so bad - he even complained about that after each use.</li>
            <li> Not happy with it</li>
            <li> made my beard dandruff problem worse.</li>
            <li> It lays at weird angles and looks ragged.</li>
            <li> Also dries out the hair horribly bad.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> and it was annoying to use my hair shampoo for just my beard,</li>
            <li> I tested this crap and damages hair...do not buy.</li>
            <li> and so I hate to shave.</li>
            <li> How disappointing!!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> no justice and leaves a horrible scent.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This beard wash smells good, lasts a long time, and is easy to rinse out. The price is the only thing that holds it back from 5 stars. I&#x27;m not sure if it actually helps my beard at all, but it sure makes me feel good.</li>
            <li> Amazing, Clean, Fresh, and no harsh smell.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! the smell is nice and makes your beard feel noticeably softer after a few washes with leaves you with an incredible clean beard!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Got the original bluebeards last year and husband thought it was great, except it dried his beard out.  Trying this one and so far so good.</li>
            <li> Has worked great for me.  I will continue buying for my beard.</li>
            <li> Softens beard, smells great and can use multiple times per week without drying. Sold.</li>
            <li> this stuff kicks butt. I have had it for a week and have been very pleased. Since I have Recieved it I have not had a single  beard tangle or ingrown hair. The skin underneath my beard is not flaky and dry anymore.  My girlfriend for the first time loves to rub my beard. she has already gone online and bought a back up set so I cant ever run out.</li>
            <li> Great scent and great foaming action to tackle the dirt and dust in my long goatee. Feels great on the skin and washes clean. Scent is a bit like a bathroom cleaner - but likely the lime scent that I am smelling. In any case, I do like the smell - though it is a bit overpriced for the small amount you get. I would recommend this product to my friends!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure they watered down mine. It&#x27;s like when you have just a little soap left so you add water to get it all...  Or its by design, but not for this price. Not recommended.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my beard feeling extremely soft but I gave it four stars only because the smell is not so great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not convinced this works any better than any other conditioner you might use that is intended for hair.  I do like the smell, and it does seem to condition my beard.  I accidentally used on what little hair I have left, and it did seem to work like any other conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  Kind of pricey for what it does, especially if the only difference between this and any other conditioner is the good smell.</li>
            <li> Yaaaar! That&#x27;s a lather matey!</li>
            <li> This did NOT make my beard soft! At all! Made it very wiry. Not happy with it what so ever. It&#x27;s like washing you&#x27;re face with window cleaner. I will probably never buy this again.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, lathers very well, smells like skittles which i think is great! I gave 4 stars because i do plan to try other brands to compare. plus it is very pricey. Overall good product.</li>
            <li> I never mind the smell of this shampoo. It is strong citrus smell but it doesnt leave you smelling like citrus all day, just when youre in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasted me almost a year, I had a 4-5&amp;#34; beard but I would only wash it ever other day with just a small portion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful what you put on your beard, not all hair products are designed for your face.</li>
            <li> Been using Bluebeards products for over a year, and my beard has been soft and manageable since then.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a couple of weeks, my beard is softer than ever! Will buy more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the search for a decent beard shampoo for quite a while now and was hopeful when I bought this product. The first thing that turned me off from Bluebeards Beard Wash was the odor. Another review mentioned the fact that it smells like bathroom cleaner and I would absolutely agree. He said he liked the scent however I most certainly didn&#x27;t. Not an appealing scent in the least in my opinion. Luckily that smell went away after I rinsed. Another thing to know (if you should choose to buy this stuff) is that it is very different than your typical shampoo. When going by their instructions to \\&quot;Place a small amount of Bluebeards on the tips of fingers and massage into beard and face.\\&quot;, it generates little to no foamy lather. I used what would amount to the size of a quarter to a half dollar amount. It seemed to do o.k. as far as cleaning my beard but nothing revolutionary in the least. Lastly the price of $19 + shipping costs are a bit steep for what you get. If I felt that it was a better product then I wouldn&#x27;t mind so much. I would not recommend Bluebeards Original Beard Wash Extra Conditioning with Jojoba Oils. My search for a quality beard shampoo continues...</li>
            <li> A great value for the serious beardsman. Product leaves the beard feeling and smelling fantastic. A little bit of product will work for even the bushiest facial landscape. The new 8 oz size keeps the bottle going longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few months and overall I&#x27;m happy with it. The smell is awesome, limey and not flowery or too soapy. However for the price I expected a little more. It definitely cleans the beard and softens it a bit, but I don&#x27;t see a very big difference between this and good soap or shampoo, or at least enough to justify it&#x27;s stiff price-tag. In fact, I think going back and forth between this and other shampoos provided better results, but I have nothing to back that up. At least it makes the bottle last longer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, this product is true to its description - it cleans and conditions your beard and gives it a great smell. But don&#x27;t expect any long-term improvements to your beard from using the beard wash alone.</li>
            <li> The product is simple to apply and definitely makes my beard much softer after use. I wish they made a bigger Bottle of this packaged with the wash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a reorder, that should say it all!</li>
            <li> I love this beard wash. I use it every day. Its great for you beard and face leaving it very refreshed and clean. The smell of the wash is very pleasant. I struggle to find anything to dislike about the wash because it does exactly what the product description states. 5/5 stars, I would recommend anyone with a beard to try this wash.</li>
            <li> If you are growing a beard or planning on growing one, that beard wash is one of the essentials that you&#x27;ll need.&lt;br /&gt;facial hair needs care just &amp;#34;if not more&amp;#34; like your hair.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re looking for a great beard-wash that will leave your beard feeling stronger, softer and more full, this is it. i use it every couple of days (bar soap in between), and it does a great job. smells great (very lightly lime scented) and picks up a nice lather. highly recommend</li>
            <li> Great for the beard, but too pricey.  I sure there are products just as good for a 1/3 of the price.</li>
            <li> This beard wash smells amazing! Leaves his beard soft, easy to comb through and a little bit shiny! He loves it!</li>
            <li> Great product. Makes even short beards soft!</li>
            <li> I have only ever bought this for my boyfriend from a local apothecary and decided to order over Amazon in a pinch.  My boyfriend uses this stuff about two to three times a week and has been for almost eight months.  Prior to using the Bluebeards original wash, he felt his skin was always super dry beneath his beard.  Now he claims he can&#x27;t imagine growing and maintaing his beard without Bluebeards.  I was super pleased with the care that the Shave Mart decided to package the bottle with.  One interior plastic bag and one large ziplock around the bottle ensured no leakage.  Great service and I will no doubt buy this again over Amazon.</li>
            <li> I am not one of those guys that&#x27;s been using this product long enough to comment on the change of quality, but I&#x27;ll chime in anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a pretty long beard. I regularly use beard oil and I take good care of it, but I probably only shampoo it once or twice a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now this stuff does a pretty good job as cleaning it without drying out my skin and beard, but it smells like dish detergent. There&#x27;s nothing natural about it, so if that&#x27;s something you&#x27;re concerned about, it may not be for you.</li>
            <li> good stuff, worth the price, might seem like not alot, but a little bit goes a long way, smells like lime</li>
            <li> Not the best conditioner but the shampoo is easy on your face. I Would buy this product again. Works well on dry skin.</li>
            <li> Flakes before, no flakes after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thought it might have been dandruff, tried every known dandruff product to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought this stuff and the flakes went away after two applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works.</li>
            <li> after trying a different brand (and not finishing their bottle) i came back to bluebeards. after initially not liking the consistency, i got used to it and was able to work with it just fine. 1 bottle lasted me about 4 months. im currently at 11 months of beard growth so my beard is pretty long, i probably use more than i need to but it still lasted me a while. definitely glad to have bluebeards back!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my bf and he loved it</li>
            <li> Smells like turpintine, never got the desired effect.</li>
            <li> It lathers ok, but it kind of has a weird smell that makes me think this is, like, mostly dishwashing machine soap. And it doesn&#x27;t seem to condition my beard any better than normal hair shampoo / soap does.</li>
            <li> This stuff in wonderful. I had struggled with occasional itchiness, dryness, flaking, and shagginess of my beard. This beard wash made my face and beard feel so clean it became my favorite part of my daily shower. It smells strange when scrubbing into beard, but any lingering smell is good if you even notice it. It lathers well, and leaved my face feeling refreshed under my beard. It also made my beard seem easier to brush and more presentable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I have shaved my beard for now, but plan to use this again when I grow it back.</li>
            <li> This stuff is perfect for long, unruly beards. It keeps the beard clean and conditions nicely. Has a very pleasant odor to it. Love the stuff.</li>
            <li> I have tried this and the other original Bluebeards beard wash (blue bottle) and I prefer the white bottle formula. It foams up more when you lather it in, although it still doesn&#x27;t foam nearly as much as a typical shampoo. It also has a slightly better smell to it, which is a bit less acidic/limey. Although I didn&#x27;t mind the smell of the blue bottle, but I would prefer the white over it. I use it every shower and honestly I can&#x27;t tell if it makes any difference in my beard at all. Honestly I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the high premium you&#x27;re paying for it, as compared with other typical hair shampoos and conditioners on the market. Once my two bottles run out I will probably just switch back to regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> WOW what a great product!! As a bearded American I&#x27;ve tried different products this one is by far the best! The customer service also gets 5 stars I received a email after my purchase from the owners to thank me for buying I&#x27;d like to thank them for a excellent product</li>
            <li> This product was purchased for an older man who decided to grow a beard. I purchased the product ahead of time as a gift so it went beyond the time limit to return.&lt;br /&gt;The feedback is watered down product of poor quality and very overpriced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few products to attempt to soften my very coarse and thick beard, and most don&#x27;t do much.  The ones that do have some kind of positive effect don&#x27;t seem to do so consistently.  I had even used the regular Bluebeard&#x27;s Original Beard Wash, and it was the same story.  This stuff is different.  Within days my beard became softer and more relaxed, and has stayed this way with daily use of this stuff.  I use just a little bit (about 3/4 the size of a dime in the palm of my hand) while showering.  Yes, it doesn&#x27;t lather up like you would expect a soap or shampoo to do, but it works.  I&#x27;ll be getting more of this in the future!</li>
            <li> This definitely leaves your beard feeling and smelling great. I think some of this less positive reviews come from people who have neglected their beards and then expected an instant movie-star quality beard. If you&#x27;re looking for high quality daily maintenance for your beard, you just can&#x27;t do better than this.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband for a Christmas present. He has a very long curly beard. He said that it has dried it out so bad - he even complained about that after each use. We have stopped using it.</li>
            <li> Keeps my beard nice and soft, no dryness or flakes after wash. It&#x27;s awesome, and I would highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle lasted me for more than a month and a half.</li>
            <li> I use this product daily now, and really enjoy it. My beard has become slightly softer, and I really enjoy the smell when applying it. Based on the cost of the bottle, however, I don&#x27;t feel that it was worth it. I will try something else in the future.</li>
            <li> This does a fantastic job of cleaning and conditioning my beard but is also great for my skin underneath, and eliminates flakes.</li>
            <li> Makes my fiancés beard so much softer and tames it.</li>
            <li> Read all reviews and thought I&#x27;d try it. This product actually makes my beard feel stripped and rough. I thought the conditioner would help the feel and look of my beard but it did the opposite. I use shampoo and conditioner from target that is a quarter the price and works much better.</li>
            <li> The price might seem a bit on the high side, but 8 oz will last you a long time. I&#x27;ve been using Bluebeard&#x27;s for two months now, and I (and my wife) can see and feel a noticeable difference. My beard is softer, and my younger son likes to sit in my lap and play with my beard. The wash also works well for your entire face, and it conditions your skin nicely got shaving/cleaning up your cheeks and neck. A great product that justifies the cost!</li>
            <li> I have had a beard for 15 years.  I used to have to keep it fairly short due to the fact that the skin would get itchy and flake under my beard if I grew it out too much.  I tried other products like baby shampoo, moisturizer, etc. but nothing seemed to work.  This wasn&#x27;t a phase that I could wait out... I tried that.  I even went to a dermatologist after the flaking wouldn&#x27;t go away after  months.  Then I discovered bluebeards on Amazon.com.  I started with the regular Bluebeards Original Beard Wash (in the blue bottle) and Bluebeards original beard saver lotion.  They worked wonders.  Eventually I switched to this version of the wash with Extra Conditioning agents.  I eventually dropped the beard saver from my routine and still have no problems.  Now I can grow my beard as long as I want (its halfway down my chest now).  I recommend this to anyone who wants to grow their beard beyond stubble and not have an itchy face.  This stuff works wonders and has a pleasant lime smell (great if you and/or you significant other love citrus)!.</li>
            <li> This bottle lasted my boyfriend months! And he was pleased with it since he usually used just shampoo for his beard. He said that it didn&#x27;t help his dry skin, but I think it did. And it smells pleasant.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. I&#x27;ve had a beard ever since I&#x27;ve been able to grow one and I&#x27;ve always had an issue with flakes and dandruff on my face. Problem solved.</li>
            <li> Smells great, doesn&#x27;t affect my asthma and leaves my beard smooth and clean</li>
            <li> A must if you have a beard!!!</li>
            <li> Agreed with other reivews - the scent can be a little off putting at times.  I&#x27;ve purchased multiple products from this brand and they do vary from bottle to bottle in terms of smell - I prefer the scent of the Original Beard Wash without the extra conditioning</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this stuff! He is very into beard care and says that this helps his beard look more tame. I&#x27;ve also noticed that it feels much softer! Very nice product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Never tried this before. Read all of the reviews, and took it at face value.  Should not have.  It did nothing to soften my beard.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have kept a beard off and on for most of my life, and I have tended to use normal hair shampoo for the upkeep of my beard.  Now thirty-six years into life I discover that there is a difference between the hair on my head (what little is left) and the hair on my face.  This product leaves my skin refreshed and definitely improves the beard itself.  The hairs are much softer to the touch, the beard is more manageable, and the gross beard-dandruff is gone.  The effects were immediate: after only two or three days I can see a huge improvement.  I can&#x27;t recommend this product compared to another beard wash, as I haven&#x27;t used any others, but I&#x27;d strongly recommend it for anyone who is still using Head &amp; Shoulders on their face.  :)</li>
            <li> Keeps my beard soft and well conditioned.  It is well worth the money and a little goes a long way.  This bottles lasts me almost through the winter.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I like the wash my beard feels better and looks better. Getting a good later from the wash is a bit hard I use more than they say on thw bottle but worth the money.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  It&#x27;s quite pricey, but I will buy it again.  Fortunately, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Got this for the boyfriend. He&#x27;s a beard guy. He really enjoys this product and this is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased it. I recommend this product. Fast shipping, good price.</li>
            <li> i won&#x27;t use anything else on my beard other than Bluebeards. leaves my beard and skin perfectly clean without drying it out</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my husbands unruley beard....it worked AMAZING.  It smells kinda of like licorice (which is not a bad thing), and made his beard soft and easy to brush thru.  It suds nicely, and doesn&#x27;t take a ton of product to get the job done.  Very happy overall, will repurchase.</li>
            <li> the product smells great, it has a nice lime scent. it conditions well, but not much more different from a very conditioner. The product goes a long way. I would recomend it, but i think its better if you just get the other two products by blue beard and just use a really good condition for your beard instead, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my brother as sort of a gag gift but now he is in love with it and has requested more. He has mentioned that his beard isnt tangly any more and it smells nice.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle.  Its got a clean scent and didn&#x27;t weigh my beard down like when I was using shampoo&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Seemed like hand soap. My beard was about 3-4 inches. Used for about a week, did not notice any difference! Sent it back, return was easy!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this stuff. Helps with any itchiness and irritated skin around the beard and keeps the beard hair healthy, silky, and soft. I love nuzzling into his beard right after a wash, it&#x27;s smells really good.  This is the 4th or 5th bottle we&#x27;ve gone through in the past couple years.</li>
            <li> Smells good. Keeps the beard nice, soft, and manageable. The 8 oz size will last a long time, too. Will definitely continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my boyfriend.I give this a 5 star rating because it makes his beard so soft.other than the pinesol smell,which I happen to like,its a great product</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this stuff.  I was using hair conditioner on my beard and really didn&#x27;t like the smell so close to my mouth and nose.  This smells kind of citrusy and does a good job of cleaning and conditioning my long beard.</li>
            <li> Product is basically non-scented which is wonderful for a beard.  A little goes a long way and cleans nicely without drying or stripping your beard.  Have not had any zits or ingrown hairs since I started using this either, so I think it is also keeping my skin under the beard clean.  Will definitely order this product again.</li>
            <li> The search for a good beard wash that can do it all is over for me. For a very long time I have just used shampoo, bars of natural soap, or my wife&#x27;s expensive shampoo to wash my facial hair. Not anymore! I am careul to read ingredients on products because I prefer natural ones. I read the other reviews before deciding to buy this and was unsure about the scent as this wash contains lime. I must say it smells fresh, clean, and unique. It smells great to me and I do not notice any sort of \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; smell as another reviewer noted. This wash leaves my beard smelling fresh, feeling soft, and my skin moisturized. It does not feel like it is harsh on the hair at all. It leaves my beard feeling great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Easy to Apply&lt;br /&gt;+ Easy to Rinse&lt;br /&gt;+ Awesome Scent&lt;br /&gt;+ Many Natural Ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Kinda spendy for the size (tho not a con to me because this stuff is awesome)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;_Bottom Line_ Yes, I would recommend this to a friend and I will also continue using it. This wash is pricey given the size but a little bit goes a very long way and this stuff lasts quite a long time.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hubby&#x27;s beard smelling very fresh.</li>
            <li> its been 1 week since I started using this product and the result is amazing. My beard feel fresh and look better than ever. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Excellent wash. Pleasant lime scent, not overpowering. Been using this wash for almost 2 years now. Best beard wash I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> You will notice the uniqueness of this shampoo immediately.  I have an unmanageable beard and this is what the doctor ordered.</li>
            <li> Does the beard no justice and leaves a horrible scent.  Also dries out the hair horribly bad.</li>
            <li> Has a little bit of a weird smell, but feels great and works great.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome!  I love that, but the smell is gone minutes after you get out of the shower and the results are no different than if  you used Pert Plus for $2.  If this was $5 and not $22 I&#x27;d probably keep getting it, but the MASSIVE premium is not justified.</li>
            <li> Two problems with this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It doesn&#x27;t work&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The price and size is a total scam&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I bought this for my beard-growing husband and we were annoyed that it did not live up to any part of its claim. For the price I felt like I was ripped off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  If you want to smooth out your beard save yourself A LOT of money and buy a container of L&#x27;oreal Total Repair 5 damage-erasing balm. You can find it in any shampoo aisle for around $5. It actually makes your beard softer and smells better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> Bluebeard&#x27;s does exactly what it sets out to do. It will clean your beard. It will clean the hell out of your beard. You do NOT need to use this daily unless you work in a filthy environment, such as a forging operation or a coal mine. It will strip every last bit of moisture out of your beard so you would be wise to invest in some sort of leave in conditioner, such as Honest Amish Beard Balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend the product, however, as long as you use it as directed. Don&#x27;t overdo it. Bluebeard&#x27;s is strong.</li>
            <li> Just a tiny bit, maybe a dime size amount will do my whole beard. This stuff lathers up like nothing else I have ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daily regimen is a wash/condition with this product and some bay Lime conditioning oil. Leaves my beard shiny, soft and it doesn&#x27;t get out of control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty expensive, but it&#x27;s a good product and probably will buy again.</li>
            <li> Works great for the problem I have had for years with a flaking beard.  Results observed after only the second application.</li>
            <li> got it for my boyfriend. He loves it</li>
            <li> Pricey, but worth it. My fiance has purchased this beard wash two or three times already and will continue to do so. Paired with Honest Amish Beard Balm he has a nice beard! It looks and feels good to touch, whereas before it felt scruffy. He recommends this product to others with beards.</li>
            <li> Lathers up better than the original.  Good size (8oz) for beards longer than 6 inches (I&#x27;ve used a little over 1/2 in a month)  Beard def. feels smoother, fuller and less scratchy.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Since I started growing my beard, I have searched for a product that could tame it. FINALLY, I have found it. It made my thick and curly beard soft and manageable. The scent is a bit like that of a household lime scented cleaner, but it does not stick around long, allowing any beard oil to match with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing this product for the lifetime of my beard (until I die).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used numerous beard shampoos and this is probably my favorite...it smells great and it really makes the beard shine!</li>
            <li> This product made my face under my beard itchy red and painful and for the next few days dry and flaky as well. made my beard dandruff problem worse. if your problem is beard dandruff avoid this stuff.</li>
            <li> Bluebeards conditioner worked very well, I can see a big difference.  My beard is much more manageable.  Easy to use</li>
            <li> Again, got this for my husband and he really loves it and it keeps him from using my shampoo..... Smells great! Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I had a light amount of the dreaded &amp;#34;beard-druff&amp;#34; before using this product due to using regular shampoo and conditioner. This product definitely helped moisturize my skin and soften up my facial hair. However, i was using a conditioning oil along with this to help with the overall health of my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rated it a 4/5 because i wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the smell.</li>
            <li> As with the other Bluebeard products I use on my beard, I started using this in September. My beard is more manageable, doesn&#x27;t flake anymore and I have been able to grow it out longer much to my husband&#x27;s satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money can use good quality hair care products and get better results. Save your money, your welcome.</li>
            <li> I like the scent. For a &amp;#34;extra conditioning shampoo&amp;#34; I feel it is more like normal conditioning...  It really has to be rubbed in good to lather up which causes my beard to tangle more and loose more hairs then with normal hair shampoos.  Since my beard is over 9 inches I can&#x27;t get this shampoo to lather up much on the tips because there is too much hair and not enough face to rub it against to lather up. I have been using this shampoo for over 2 week now and still not sold on it, may or may not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Best beard wash around!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend when he was growing out his beard. He said that after the first use he felt a difference in his beard. It was smoother and not so course feeling. The smell is a lime/citrusy type scent but I don&#x27;t think it is too overpowering at all. He really enjoys the smell of it! This size bottle will last a LONG time because it takes just a little drop to create a nice lather. Definitely worth the price when you take into account how many uses you will get out of it.</li>
            <li> Works really well, I assume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I got this for a fun birthday gift, since I had recently grown out a beard and it was annoying to use my hair shampoo for just my beard, so my wife purchased this after seeing reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems to work well but it doesnt feel like some kind of soft pillow of beard, but seems to work since my beard definitely doesn&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li> If you buy this expecting it to control your beard by making it soft and manageable, forget it.  It does smell good and yes, it does soften your beard a little, but no more than going out and buying a shampoo with conditioners off the supermarket shelf.  Of course, that&#x27;s just my opinion based on using the product for 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> The product smells alright, but it almost seemed to make the beard rougher...</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! Helps keep my beard clean and my skin from getting dandruff. Seems very natural. Great smell, not too frothy, and it doesn&#x27;t even have an off-putting taste when some inevitably gets in your mouth when you wash your mustache. Will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got a decent amount of facial hair, this makes a huge difference. Cuts down on itch, and helps the hair itself.</li>
            <li> This was a new suggestion via Amazon.  I have used the original beard wash for years, this just seems to have some extra daily conditioner in it.  Bigger bottle than the original.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a few days and so far it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s worth $20 to me. It&#x27;s not even worth $5. It smells like PineSol or some household cleaner, and it leaves my hair dry and somewhat \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; afterwards. I&#x27;m not noticing any softness or taming of my facial hair so far. For $20 this is not what I expected AT ALL.    Edit: Sent the product back for a return after 2 days of use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not found any other product like this - it helps to condition and soften ones beard.  Women like that.</li>
            <li> This stuff keeps my beard squeaky clean and keeps the itches at bay. I typically only use when I get itchy.</li>
            <li> My beard has gotten a lot thicker since using this product...excellent</li>
            <li> I tried this then Beardsley to see if I could save money with Beardsley and get the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got BETTER results with Beardsley. It smells better and foams better, and you use less of it. It also is better and getting rid of my beard dandruff.</li>
            <li> Seems to work great and smells great.</li>
            <li> This Beard wash is really good.  I actually can&#x27;t say enough about it.  I bought some beard oils from a different company and they just don&#x27;t compare with how clean and nice Bluebeards makes my beard feel.  I actually could say more, but just suggest you give it a try.  Worth the 2in1 product.  I don&#x27;t have to use my wife&#x27;s conditioner anymore.</li>
            <li> This product definitely delivers. After reading what it could do I ordered it and I have not been disappointed. Like the reviews said, after the first use beard/facial dandruff disappeared. I am a witness! This is a great product and I would definitely recommend it to anyone!!!!!</li>
            <li> Really good beard wash. The Pert Plus for beards. Can&#x27;t live without it! Bluebeards Original makes the best products on the market. If you want a great looking and great feeling soft healthy beard, buy this stuff.</li>
            <li> For that manly beard.  Great product that keeps your manliness in tact.</li>
            <li> This stuff works good. Keeps the itching down and helps control the dry skin under the beard. Also helps soften the beard.</li>
            <li> This is the second bottle I have ordered from Amazon.  This works great, and I live the lime scent it leaves.  My beard is much softer, and very clean.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> This product works! I noticed a big difference after only a few days of using it and I like the way it smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a short beard for a long time and recently decided to let it grow out beyond being able to use my beard trimmer&#x27;s highest setting to keep it tamed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My facial hair is very \\&quot;wiry\\&quot; and rough and once I started to let it grow out, it started to stick out in all different directions. I tried washing it and using a few different conditioners (my wife&#x27;s conditioners for her hair) to try and soften it up, but nothing seemed to do much. This product has helped a lot and I am now able to comb my beard so that \\&quot;most\\&quot; of the hairs are going in the same direction and it doesn&#x27;t look like a \\&quot;white-trash, birds-nest beard\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in the woods on a mountain and have been known to go a few days without a shower, so grooming has never been on the top of my list. I wanted to grow my beard out, but I don&#x27;t want to look like Jeremiah Johnson coming out of the mountains, this product has worked great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this product about a week after I starting to use the [[ASIN:B000V8IBXE All-natural Moustache, Mustache Wax Beard Gloss]]. I think the combo of this wash and the beard wax has made for softer facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend both of these products to anyone that wants to tame their wiry beard.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  My beard is cleaner, softer, and smells nicer than ever before!  If you have a beard longer than 1/2&amp;#34; then a product like this is really a necessity.</li>
            <li> This product smelled amazing.  Other than that though I wasn&#x27;t blown away by it.  It did cut down on the dryness of my skin and the amount of beard dandruff, for a little while.  I used this stuff religiously and for the first couple days, I was amazed.  After a while though, the results I got at first petered away.  I&#x27;m not saying this stuff is worthless, it still smelled amazing and kept my beard just as clean as shampoo.  I was a bit hesitant at first about the price, $22 for an 8 oz. bottle, but I figured why not.  It really did last for quite a while, I think I bought it about 2 months ago and still have about half of the bottle.  A little really does go a long way.  Overall, I&#x27;d call this a very sound product and reccomend it to anyone with a beard.</li>
            <li> Great product and quick shipping</li>
            <li> I bought this beard shampoo for my boyfriend and we absolutely love it. It really helps get the dirt and dead skin out from under his beard and keeps his beard looking great and smelling wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, before you ask your man to shave his beard, try getting him this stuff. It makes the beard much softer and it leaves it smelling like fresh limes. You&#x27;ll fall in love with your man and his beard all over again.</li>
            <li> I use it every morning and night on my course and curly beard. I work construction so my beard easily holds dust and other grime that is flying around. Blue beards is a refreshing and good smelling conditioner that cleans my beard without over drying. There really is a big difference between using something like this and a regular hair conditioner.</li>
            <li> Glad I came across this stuff.  Definitely do a good job of keeping my beard feeling soft and fresh.  Mine can get dry and rough, but this helps a great deal with a daily wash.  If you are just starting out growing your beard this will help with the early itching that comes probably in the first 2 weeks or so.  Good for the skin and good for your hair.  Bought myself a 2nd bottle.  I&#x27;ll be loyal to this as long as my beard is around.</li>
            <li> Its a very good product that does work. I like it and will probably buy more. Its better than normal  conditioner and I&#x27;m suprised in how fast I felt a difference.</li>
            <li> I did not know what to expected when I ordered this.  I find it works very well and it meets my needs very satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely reorder this when I have used it all.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough nice things about this stuff, it has persuaded me to keep growing my beard with reckless abandon. It softens and conditions my beard, making it look fuller, and far more manageable.</li>
            <li> right after use my beard feels softer, but an hour later it&#x27;s back to dry and scratchy. if you have soft facial hair it will give you the sense of continued softness.</li>
            <li> It leaves my beard soft and tame. I usually wet my beard in the shower put the beard wash in then comb it while the beard wash is in my beard works great and takes the tangles out!</li>
            <li> I got both the regular shampoo from these guys and this one with conditioner. The only reason I rate this one 4 stars is because the conditioner seems to be non existent and no apparent difference between this and the regular shampoo. I am still forced to use a conditioner, but otherwise this is by far one of the best beard shampoos so it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. I&#x27;ve been using it daily for about a year now and I&#x27;m just now buying my third bottle of it. It&#x27;s expensive, but a little bit really does go a long way. Just a little dab on the finger and it lathers up like crazy with a little bit of massaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the smell, I personally really like it. It smells like lime to me and once it&#x27;s washed off, it doesn&#x27;t linger. It leaves my beard soft and feeling wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect this to keep your beard from being frizzy though. It makes it softer overall, but it doesn&#x27;t help hold it in place. You&#x27;ll need some beard saver or something for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This truly is my favorite part of my morning routine. It&#x27;s so pleasant and easy to use and it really leaves my face and beard feeling ready for the day ahead. I highly recommend this product to all my friends, family, and you as well.</li>
            <li> After using this product your beard will look like it was cut from the mane of a unicorn, and groomed by Paul Mitchell himself. As far as the smell goes, if you want something that smells pretty and you sit down like a girl when you pee, then use your girlfriends or wife&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner cause this is not for you. This product smells like a man. It smells like a combination of nascar, automatic machine gun fire, a chuck Norris roundhouse kick, the sweat from a navy seal team, heavy weight lifting, muscle cars, Rudy Ruettigers only quarterback sack, gasoline(not the weak stuff you put in a Prius either,but the high octane stuff that goes in a Lamborghini), rock climbing in a jeep, the courage of Marcus Lutrell, championship wrestling, monster trucks, big tattoos, Rambos headband, poker games, arm wrestling, steroids, the super bowl, Pontiac GTO judge,and just a hint of citrus all combine into one manly smell. Side effects may include some or all of the following. Frequent cat calls from women, rapid muscle growth, raging confidence, and an erection that lasts up to 4 hrs. All jokes aside, it works pretty good and does make your bears softer.</li>
            <li> I bought this and the Bluebeards Original Beard Saver. I&#x27;ve used this more than the bear saver. This product is a good beard and neck wash. I use it every day when I&#x27;m ready to shower. I&#x27;ll wash my face, apply this and let sit for a few minutes. It does make the beard soft and clean and appears to help with styling the beard. I usually just keep a chin goatee but I grow a full beard once in a while. I haven&#x27;t used this product for very long but it seems to be working nicely for now.</li>
            <li> Use this twice a week and it has an awesome smell. Only need a drop so this will last quite a long time.</li>
            <li> Smells like green penny candy that your grandma has at her house. It does slightly soften your beard but it also dries it out a little. However, very gentle on your skin. Helps eliminate dry skin under your beard. It only takes a couple of drops to get a nice foamy lather. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price. works great and softens your beard like a pro. and seven more words are required to submit</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dad because his beard is REAL FRIZZY LIKE FRO&#x27; REAL. and he said conditioner made for women&#x27;s hair works better.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he likes it.  Many beard products have patchouli oil or other strong scents that I don&#x27;t care for.  This smells like citrus and has a clean scent.</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t many choices for beard conditioners this is as good as any that I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s easy to use lasts a long time (you only need a drop) If you have a big bushy beard it may not last as long.</li>
            <li> My beard is so stroke-ably soft. Exactly as advertised, and it smells like lime jello! Would definately recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I got this for my hubby as a present, and he tells me that it&#x27;s aces. While I haven&#x27;t kept track of exactly long it took, it did take him a long time to go through the first bottle. He sports a goatee about 11\\&quot; long. Being a female, I am not sure how coarse beards usually are, but his beard hairs seem really rather coarse to me, and to him, he tells me. We&#x27;ve both noticed a new softness to his goatee since he started using Blue Beard. Approved by hubby and his 11\\&quot; goatee!</li>
            <li> This shampoo was purchased for my boyfriend. He has used it daily since purchase. It works well and has a light citrus scent. I like the smell and he doesn&#x27;t mind it either. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> While the product seems to work \\&quot;ok but not amazing\\&quot; to me, I&#x27;ve found the scent to be a bit overpowering and even a bit distasteful - enough to not use the product regularly.  Others have tried to describe the scent as lemon Gatorade, or lemon candy, and it took me a bit to put my thumb on the scent myself... It was familiar, yet elusive.  Then I realized that the scent strongly reminded me of industrial floor cleaner, something you&#x27;d find in a janitor&#x27;s mop bucket.  I considered calling up the company to ask them to describe the scent to make sure that I didn&#x27;t receive a defective bottle - that perhaps got some kind of tank cleaning agent was in it. I was also suspicious of this because it didn&#x27;t seem to foam up as much as I would expect for a shampoo-type product. After reading others&#x27; descriptions, I&#x27;m assuming that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s supposed to be.  Why not a nicer vanilla scent, or some other more pleasant masculine scent?   Even after many months, it&#x27;s a smell that I just can&#x27;t get by... and I find I&#x27;m not using it much at all.</li>
            <li> Like I said, it&#x27;s nice, it works well, but it smells more like something I&#x27;d use to clean a counter top with rather than a beard cleaner.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to us by a friend, and my husband loves this stuff! It arrived perfectly on time, very quick. I will continue to buy this product!</li>
            <li> ZERO STARS! Waste of money. I tested this crap and damages hair...do not buy. SERIOUSLY AVOID. I gave it a chance over time, despite the fact of the critical reviews and it failed. I was very disappointed. Use Beard Buddy. It does what it is meant to do and positive results can visibly be seen and felt. I used this crap after running out of Bear Buddy to try new products and this is just some lime juice chemical s*** cleaner. THE DETAILS AT ONE POINT SAID WITH JOJOBA OIL, BUT THE ACTUAL BOTTLE NEVER SAID ANYTHING IN THE INGREDIENTS. This is not a product placement negative review scam ad bulls***. I do not work for any of these sellers or companies. I am just a normal college student who loves to takes care of his beard. Later everybody..</li>
            <li> Bluebeards has a wonderful scent,  and produces a great lather. A small amount goes a long way with my very thick beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed less dry skin and beard dander, with continued use. When paired with the conditioner I had a very soft beard that was much more attractive and easy to style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is the price, I also wish there were bigger bottles.</li>
            <li> The 2013 world champion facial hair grower says he uses this product. My hubby is on his way to MANY wins, and hopefully will be national soon, and he uses this product. It does just as it states, and is WELL worth the price.</li>
            <li> I got this mostly as a &amp;#34;beard softener&amp;#34;, to make my scraggles less scraggly, but I&#x27;m never really sure if it&#x27;s doing anything for that.  It does seem to keep the skin underneath the beard clean and free of zits and sores and stuff, so I guess that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> I will probably make this a regular regime from now on.  Its my first time trying it and I do see a need for it.  The smell is amazing and it lathers nice. Only complaint... I wish the bottle was a little cooler looking for my shower though.</li>
            <li> Have been using this stuff for a couple of months, but have not really noticed any difference from the shampoo I was previously using.</li>
            <li> Love this product! No longer do I worry about beard dandruff.  Keeps my beard soft as well.  Only need to use a little bit so 8oz actually lasts longer than I thought it would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I am not a bearded woman but I assume it would work just as well on a woman with a beard.  Nowhere on the bottle did I see anything saying for men only so that&#x27;s pretty cool.</li>
            <li> I rated this with 4 stars as I am not the user of the product but gave it to my sons.  It was a requested gift for one son and since the other son has a beard as well, I purchased two.  Very quick shipping as this was a last minute Christmas gift.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Does a better job of softening my beard than anything else I&#x27;ve tried plus my girlfriend loves the scent. I was initially put off by the price but this 8 oz bottle has lasted me for over 4 months now and I&#x27;ve still got a lot left.</li>
            <li> This product absolutely does NOT work as advertised! You can achieve the same or much better results by using a common hair conditioner.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> The first bottle would have been a 5 star. The second bottle was not as pictured on the site. The bottle and the product were different and it did not work the same on my beard. How disappointing!! Recommended the product to several friends when I used the first bottle. I will not purchase or recommend it again since I started using the second bottle. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> I currently use (and love) Bluebeards Original Beard Saver. As anyone with a beard knows you need to take proper care of it, and the Beard Saver alone isn&#x27;t going to cut it. I decided to go back to Bluebeards since I grew to love the scent of the Beard Saver (I was a bit shocked at first thinking my beard would smell like lime candy, but it&#x27;s really great). After reading all the great reviews on the Beard Wash with (and this is the most important part to me) extra conditioning, I figured this would be perfect. As my beard grows longer it&#x27;s getting a bit frizzier and not as easy to control, so the claim that it would help fight frizz was appealing to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very minor complaint is the smell. The first time it hits my nose I get a faint smell of that nice lime, but it quickly starts to smell &amp;#34;off.&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s losing its nice fragrance while inside the bottle, maybe I was sent an older bottle, etc. But it doesn&#x27;t smell that great. Again, this is minor since the smell doesn&#x27;t linger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My major complaint is that after using this for a little over two weeks now I haven&#x27;t noticed any change. In fact, after using the wash I actually notice my beard is MORE frizzier and harder to control and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s been conditioned at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t rate this one star because it didn&#x27;t make my beard hairs fall out, but I can&#x27;t give it any more than two because I can go and buy a decent bottle of shampoo and conditioner for less than half the price I paid for this 8 oz. bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember, ratings are like opinions and beards - they&#x27;re all different. This may be the perfect product for you and your beard. It simply isn&#x27;t for me and mine. I&#x27;m going to keep buying the Beard Saver and probably try a few other Bluebeard products because I love the smell and I love that they don&#x27;t test on animals. But the Beard Wash will stay off my list of things to bother with.</li>
            <li> Moved into a new house in a new town that has super hard water. Skin on my face, especially under my short kept beard was drying and flaking badly. It has vastly reduced the amount of dry flaky skin, but cant get rid of it or moisturize enough. Probably not on company&#x27;s fault, but has to do with the level of hard water here.&lt;br /&gt;Give me a 10 Gallon bucket and in 2 weeks with evaporation and refills, should be able to forge you an iron sword or two.</li>
            <li> This beard wash was just okay. My tee tree shampoo works better and is cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have a massive beard. I have tried numerous different shampoos, conditioners, etc.  to no avail. By all means this is the best product i have used on my beard thus far. Let it be known that facial grows in different ways and can be composed of several different types of hair. I, however, have a very coarse beard, so this product may not be for you. On the directions it states to use a small amount poured over your fingers and massage it into your face and neck. But it really didn&#x27;t give me the full effect until i used about a quarter sized portion in the palm of my hand. My beard is about 8&amp;#34; long and this bitch can soak up some shampoo. So you just rub it in and rinse it out and it feels very nice. A lot less bristle and a lot more softness and sheen. My studies have proven that 5 out of 5 women enjoyed the feeling of it on the inside of their thighs. But i digress, if you have a bristly coarse beard like me, try this stuff out.</li>
            <li> this keeps the flaking away and cleans the hairs and skin with lime. you get used to the strong scent and shen i don&#x27;t have it around i actually miss the smell of it. i stopped buying cheap shampoos and conditioners, they&#x27;re not made for beards and faces.</li>
            <li> I adore Bluebeard*. My beard, while naturally luxurious, was taken up a notch by this glorious product. It exited its container quietly, nay, silently, the power within not obvious as it sat in my damp hand. Working it into my thick, manly, face locks it was unimpressive. Slightly foamy, slightly smelly with only a hint of the aloe that gives it some of its magical power. Once you rinse your beard off, there is called forth from the neverworlds magical powers. Powers which turned my beard into an object worthy of the most embarrassing worship. My beard now controls me, and I am forever it its power. In fact, I am typing this one handed, because I can&#x27;t stop touching my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*not of course to be confused with an adjective of blue... well, nevermind. Keeping G rated here, kids.</li>
            <li> After using the standard Bluebeard Beard Wash for years while I kept a trim \\&quot;Will Riker\\&quot; beard, I grew out my beard to a \\&quot;Full Galifianakis\\&quot; and noticed it getting a bit dry. This updated wash keeps my beard softer and has become a standard part of my régime (I alternate between the beard wash and Dr. Bronner&#x27;s liquid soap).</li>
            <li> I wanted to like it, but, when I use this shampoo, my beard misbehaves. It lays at weird angles and looks ragged. A friend reported the same problem and thought it was simply too much conditioner which caused matting. I don&#x27;t know, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> You need a quarter sized amount at least to make it suds up and work...smells good as far as I&#x27;m concerned, but it feels acidic on my hairs, I&#x27;m not sure how to describe it....it feels like its instantly washed away any oils in my beard....I am not sure if thats the best thing....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money, use your wife&#x27;s good shampoo</li>
            <li> WOULD NOT PURCHASE AGAIN...</li>
            <li> Originally found this beard wash randomly online and it&#x27;s been one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made. My husband&#x27;s beard is so soft now and it looks so much healthier. I&#x27;m so glad that I can easily buy this from amazon now. It&#x27;s a great product and my husband will never go back to regular face wash again! I also really like the scent, it&#x27;s very pleasant.</li>
            <li> I use Bluebeards all the time, and I do like it.  I feel that this new &amp;#34;extra conditioning agent&amp;#34; version does not lather as well as the older model, and it does not have as strong a smell (even though I liked the smell).  I&#x27;m not sure if it does soften the beard more to make up for it.</li>
            <li> Leaves my beard fresh and clean with a pleasant lime scent.  Helps prevent skin flaking and ingrown hairs.  Softens up the beard hair, gets noticeable after regular use.  Don&#x27;t expect miracles, however.  Still searching for something that will make my beard supremely soft and manageable.  Still, this product is the best I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this stuff. Makes he&#x27;s beard super soft and smells amazing. A little definitely goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Best beard wash on the market! Love the citrus smell!</li>
            <li> Shipped quick and works well. I work in a sandy environment and use this at the end of the day to help remove all the dirt and oils that tend to appear after wearing sunscreen</li>
            <li> Great smell. A little pricey, but great results. If worried try the small bottle, that&#x27;s what I did. Very pleased, but this is all subjective, make your own opinion.</li>
            <li> As a beard wearer and enthusiast, and someone who&#x27;s been growing a longer beard for the past couple years, I&#x27;ve been wanting to give beard shampoos a try to see if they&#x27;d help at all soften and straighten my unrulier-the-longer-it-gets beard. Bluebeards Original was the first brand of beard wash I tried. I plan on trying other brands, but this is my review of Bluebeards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I definitely noticed a difference using a shampoo specifically created for beards over regular shampoo. Bluebeards did help soften my facial hair and make it easier to tame. Regular shampoos would leave my beard feeling coarse, stringy, and dry out the skin in my face. Bluebeards helped with the dry skin and itchiness, softened my beard and definitely gave it some fullness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problems I have with it are for one, the scent. I&#x27;ve noticed many people on here have complained about the chemically scent, and while I agree it does have a slight chemical scent, I wouldn&#x27;t compare it to household cleaners like others have in their reviews. While the scent wasn&#x27;t what I&#x27;d hoped it&#x27;d be, I typically found that I could no longer smell it after rinsing it out of my beard anyway. I&#x27;d personally prefer something that was a little more manly and non chemically smelling that lasted longer, but it wasn&#x27;t something that would turn me off to purchasing it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other problem I had with it was the consistency. While the bottle directions say you only need a small amount, I found the consistency to be a little thin and watery, and as someone with growth more than an inch long, it definitely took a good amount to get a good lather and wash out of it. If you have a beard with an inch or more or growth ( and chances are, if you&#x27;re considering buying a shampoo specifically for beards, you probably do), you may find you have to use more than you&#x27;d like to get a good wash out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Softens coarse beard hairs&lt;br /&gt;Makes beard hairs more manageable&lt;br /&gt;Helps with dry skin and itchiness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slightly chemically scent&lt;br /&gt;Scent doesn&#x27;t last very long&lt;br /&gt;Thin, watery consistency that can make it hard to get a good lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a good product. The advantages of using it definitely outweigh the short list of cons. Now that I&#x27;ve run out, I do plan on trying other brands to see if there&#x27;s any one I&#x27;d be more satisfied with, but I wouldn&#x27;t rule out purchasing Bluebeards again.</li>
            <li> I had battled beard dandruff my entire adult life. I use this product 3 times a week and am no longer bothered by dandruff.</li>
            <li> Do really feel it cleans my beard. Has no real smell.</li>
            <li> Left my beard looking 10X better! No more flaking dry skin under my facial hair. It smells good too! Thank you Bluebeards 👍</li>
            <li> Smells very good, works well with club and mustache wax.</li>
            <li> Eight washes in ten days. If it hasn&#x27;t worked in that amount of time, it never will.  Upon extiting the shower after my first use, I noticed that my beard had never been rougher. I figured it would just take additional washes for all of those softening ingredients to take effect.  I found the fragrance very pleasant, but I can see how some might percieve it as a cleaner-type odor. A lot of lime in there. I should note that I did not have a problem with any beard dandruff before, and still don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Half-way through the week I started repeating after the first rinse, and when I did it foamed-up a lot. So if someone needs more foaming action to think it&#x27;s working, try that. Even with that, there is absolutely no indication of any oils or conditioning agents. While massaging my beard I noticed that the hair actually seemed more stripped. I can&#x27;t really put into words how it felt except to compare it to a acne wash or astringent and how it strips all the oil from your skin. That got me thinking that maybe the formula is way off, and there&#x27;s too much lime and not enough oil and aloe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, the more I used it, the more stars I was taking away in my head. The back reads: \\&quot;blended with natural jojoba oils, to soften and smooth the wildest of beards.\\&quot;  That is simply not a true statement for several of us here.  I also think that some guys don&#x27;t have quite the rough beard that they think they do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been off of this product for more than a week, and my beard texture has improved to its previous acceptable level of roughness.  Work most days out in the Nevada desert, so my face is constantly blasted by wind and dust. I&#x27;ve been rinsing it with water only, but am going to try something suggested by another bearded friend of mine. He washes with the same conditioner he uses for his head. I&#x27;ve also been reading more and more that one should use the same shampoo and conditioner for their beard that they use for their head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This did not live up to its claims, and I could not recommend it. That said, some guys out there obviously enjoy it, so caveat emptor...$20+ is a lot for a shampoo that might not do anything for you.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin in the winter and so I hate to shave. The problem, though, is when I don&#x27;t shave my beard gets all itchy. I saw the reviews for this stuff so I figured it was worth a shot and to be honest...I really do think it is helping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beard has been bothering me less, doesn&#x27;t appear to me as unruly and so I&#x27;m pretty pleased.</li>
            <li> I have a very wirey beard. I had only moderate expectation and fir the first 2 or 3 days that I used the product, it was just OK. Then after the 4th time I started noticing a difference. Then the 5th was better. The hair of my beard is now defintely softer and doesn&#x27;t stick out all over th eplace. I&#x27;d say give this a try but be patient and give it a week or so to get going.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about to start my second bottle. Pretty good stuff, it gets rid of the itch. I still have a bit of beard dandruff but I think that I need to change my balm</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Blue-Beards products. I&#x27;ve been growing my beard out for about 2 years now, ever since I got out of the Marines, but I still do lots of hiking/hunting/outdoors things and this beard wash (and their beard cream) have helped to keep my beard soft, clean, looking great and smelling great. My wife loves the way it makes my beard feel and smell, so that&#x27;s a plus!</li>
            <li> I was pretty desperate when dry skin and acne began forming underneath my beard. After many Google searches, all signs seemed to point to Bluebeards. I have no idea why. I wouldn&#x27;t mind the fake lime smell so much if the product actually worked. My beard was not softer. My skin remained as dry as if I wasn&#x27;t using the product at all. And last but not least, my acne seemed worse. This product may not be for everyone, but at that price it&#x27;s not worth paying to find out. I&#x27;ve had better results with Dove Men+Care at 1/4th the cost.</li>
