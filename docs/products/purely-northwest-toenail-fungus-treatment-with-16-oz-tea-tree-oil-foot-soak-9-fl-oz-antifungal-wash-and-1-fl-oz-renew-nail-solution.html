            <li>its the only thing that has helped my husband with his foot fungus and almost completely cured it great product</li>

            <li>This product is worth every penny</li>
            <li>I love the fact it treats the entire foot</li>
            <li>I still have 2/3 of the bottle of nail treatment left and most of the bottle of the wash.</li>
            <li>Wish it was a bigger size but will order more if needed.</li>
            <li>the first five days</li>
            <li>In just 2 days I could feel I was winning the war and getting my foot back</li>
            <li>but I knew the salts from Pure Nothwest also helped.</li>
            <li>The synergistic effect of the three product used together daily is truly amazing in treating nail fungus and overall foot health.  </li>
            <li>I really like the foot soak.</li>
            <li>I caught my nail fungus before it did any real damage to my nail</li>
            <li>Company seems very knowledgeable.</li>
            <li>Really like the foot soak after being on my feet all day.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really say much in terms of how well it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bee VERY soothing to my feet</li>
            <li>am very hopeful for this product when reading the reviews.</li>
            <li>The skin on my feet is smoother, and it seems that much of the toenail fungus is on its way to growing out.</li>
            <li>It clear my nails of the yellow appereance, and now they look more normal.</li>
            <li>Good for small buy didn&#x27;t clear my fungus</li>
            <li>The Tee Tree Epsom Salts, Cleanser &amp; Toe Nail Fungus brought me major relief from severe eczema on my right foot.  </li>
            <li>I have mild cases of nail fungus on two of my toes on my left foot.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have only used this product for exactly 3 days</li>
            <li>smell is a little strong but it doesn&#x27;t matter the products are working.</li>
            <li>The fungus was originally from the tip of my toes to over halfway down the nail.</li>
            <li>I plan to continue the treatment and hope to eventually be completely rid of the fungus.</li>
            <li>I use it two times a day when I&#x27;m home and don&#x27;t have to go to work because it makes my feet feel so soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li>and I hope to complete clear up my nails.</li>
            <li>Another follow-up will be given to this product in a few months on whether my issue of dry, cracked blistery feet is cured or way better.</li>
            <li>This product does have an odor to it, not exactly pleasant, but not terrible.</li>
            <li>After coming back from a family vacation in Vegas, I removed my toe nail polish to find the white tip of my nail seeping deeper down the right side than normal.</li>
            <li>I would not use the Epson salt on a daily basis, since it will dry your ski too much.</li>
            <li>In fact, the foot soak is very relaxing, and I plan to use it even after I stop with the other 2 products in the set.</li>
            <li>and I can now see three new pink toenails growing</li>

            <li> and I can now see three new pink toenails growing</li>
            <li> I am only giving it a 1 star as I have not been on it long enough.</li>
            <li> so I suppose it would take much long to see similar results if you had it for longer than a week.</li>
            <li> The nail is cut funky due to where the fungus was growing but other than that, it&#x27;s clear of fungus!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been using it for long (two weeks) but already noticing a difference.  </li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s only on about 1/4 of one toe and 1/3 of the other.</li>
            <li> Also I have tried various other treatments with no help.</li>
            <li> system is different than other products on the market.  </li>
            <li> Within 3 days my feet are not as dry, cracked and blistery...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been following this system for a little over a month</li>
            <li> not just the nail, which guarantees the fungus won&#x27;t spread to other places!</li>
            <li> Still have not seen much of a change on my bad big toe..</li>
            <li> I apply the topics treatment typically once a day, though sometimes twice.</li>
            <li> I started the three part toenail fungus for about a little over a week, then I got company</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> blisters and peeling skin have dried up and my feet looks healthier.  </li>
            <li> I had to cut the bad part multiple times as the nail grew out since the whiteness still was present.</li>
            <li> I did see a small improvement.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it works.</li>
            <li> Then they became brittle and started developing white patches and looked pretty awful.</li>
            <li> Not effective whatsoever</li>
            <li> Seriously hurting limping for months of agony the Emu Oil worked in just 1 hour</li>
            <li> , I filed my nail quite thin and the TEA tree oil seamed to make it dissolve</li>
            <li> One thing that I will complain about is the Tea Tree oil foot soak and in fact all the products are so small you have to keep buying thing, thus making it really expensive for those that have a bad case of toe nail fungus.</li>
            <li> Cleared my toenails somewhat, but soaking feet and applying product twice a day proved to be unrealistic for me.</li>
            <li> Such a terrible feeling!</li>
            <li> My husband says he can&#x27;t even tell anything is wrong with my toenails.</li>
            <li> I have tried  laser treatment and it helped them to not look so bad</li>
            <li> The worst part is the smell!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I think it is a good product.i have run out of the foot soak. I have re ordered&lt;br /&gt;But have not received it yet.  Thank You</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! This is my 5th day using this product and I already see improvements! I love the fact it treats the entire foot not just the nail, which guarantees the fungus won&#x27;t spread to other places! Awesome products!</li>
            <li> Love the soak! Very soothing and smells wonderfully light!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been using it for long (two weeks) but already noticing a difference.  Excellent customer service from.</li>
            <li> Cleared my toenails somewhat, but soaking feet and applying product twice a day proved to be unrealistic for me.</li>
            <li> I started the three part toenail fungus for about a little over a week, then I got company and I just couldn&#x27;t keep up with it so now I will start over again, I do like the product.  I did see a small improvement.  Does the Tea Tree Bath soak come in a larger bag.  I am only giving it a 1 star as I have not been on it long enough.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works. One bag is definitely not enough if you follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> Not effective whatsoever and I used this everday per instructions. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect combo stay committed use every day do not skip the day and you will be very happy and satisfied this is some good powerful stuff</li>
            <li> I have already seen the difference, the product is very effective and I would recommend it any of my friend toenail problems.</li>
            <li> When my big toenails started developing a yellow tinge, I thought it was just staining from nail polish. Then they became brittle and started developing white patches and looked pretty awful. I had to keep them painted to hide the discoloration, but they were so brittle that the edges were constantly chipping and snagging on my blankets. Such a terrible feeling! I&#x27;ve been using these products for about two months now, and there is a HUGE improvement in the appearance and strength of my toenails. The fungus was originally from the tip of my toes to over halfway down the nail. Now it&#x27;s only on about 1/4 of one toe and 1/3 of the other. The discoloration has improved dramatically. My husband says he can&#x27;t even tell anything is wrong with my toenails. Best of all, my nails aren&#x27;t constantly breaking. They look smoother and healthier. Honestly, I have only used the soak a couple of times. I use the wash in the shower, using a nail brush to make sure it gets under the nails and in all the crevices. I apply the topics treatment typically once a day, though sometimes twice. I think if I used it according to the instructions, I would have had even better results. I wish I had taken a before and after picture. I plan to continue the treatment and hope to eventually be completely rid of the fungus. This product does have an odor to it, not exactly pleasant, but not terrible. I&#x27;ve just never been a fan of the odor of tea tree oil. It&#x27;s worth it for the results I&#x27;ve gotten though!</li>
            <li> I have been using the three part Tea Tree Oil foot care system as directed for the last three weeks. The results have been great. My toes are showing lots of improvement. While the toenails have not come back around yet, the color of them as cleared up.</li>
            <li> its the only thing that has helped my husband with his foot fungus and almost completely cured it great product</li>
            <li> After coming back from a family vacation in Vegas, I removed my toe nail polish to find the white tip of my nail seeping deeper down the right side than normal. I knew I had picked up fungus while on that trip and bought this kit with one day shipping immediately. I started using it on July 25th and it took awhile before I noticed all the abnormal growth was gone. I had to cut the bad part multiple times as the nail grew out since the whiteness still was present. But just this week I noticed no presences of fungus. I really like the foot soak. I use it two times a day when I&#x27;m home and don&#x27;t have to go to work because it makes my feet feel so soft and refreshed. I&#x27;m on my third bag! I still have 2/3 of the bottle of nail treatment left and most of the bottle of the wash. I&#x27;m going to use this kit for 3 months to make sure the fungus is gone and then continue with the soak because I love it SO much! I&#x27;m attaching a photo of my toe that I took this morning. The nail is cut funky due to where the fungus was growing but other than that, it&#x27;s clear of fungus! This stuff works and I love that it&#x27;s natural. I caught my nail fungus before it did any real damage to my nail so I suppose it would take much long to see similar results if you had it for longer than a week.</li>
            <li> I have used this product and in 3 days I have seen a big difference. You must follow the instructions as written which are straightforward and easy to understand.  Within 3 days my feet are not as dry, cracked and blistery...blisters and peeling skin have dried up and my feet looks healthier.  Tea Tree oil has a strong smell but it is a pleasant and aromatic smell. Another follow-up will be given to this product in a few months on whether my issue of dry, cracked blistery feet is cured or way better.</li>
            <li> Have used most of the 3 part treatment and seen no change.</li>
            <li> Giving this product a try. So far so good. Will report back in 30 days. Company seems very knowledgeable. I&#x27;m also ordering a foot basin to use with the Tea Tree Oil Bath Salts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;vee been using this for about a 2 weeks, following the instructions given, and I must say I do see a difference in my toe nails (my toe nails were a bit yellow and brownish), my feet feel smoother too...all im waiting for is for my new toenails to grow in :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a little strong but it doesn&#x27;t matter the products are working.</li>
            <li> A month of this product has relaxed my feet and helped with the dryness.</li>
            <li> Good natural product.  Really works!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it after a working day, it make feel so goood, relaxed and fell fresh my foot. So I am sleeping whit a feeling of cooling and freshing every night. I love it.</li>
            <li> It is a great product for the price.</li>
            <li> Great toe nail product! Works as described!</li>
            <li> Really like the foot soak after being on my feet all day. Customer service is impeccable would recommend highely.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my BF and it seems to be working wonders on his feet. His feet and toenails are getting better each day. Routine is key though. You can&#x27;t skip a step.</li>
            <li> Used it for over a month never seen any improvement on my nail. It did however stopped the itching, redness and even the peeling on the skin.</li>
            <li> I love these products. The tea tree oil salts eliminate the death skin on my feets and leave me a good feelings after using it. It is also helping me with my toenail fungus. It clear my nails of the yellow appereance, and now they look more normal. I need to continue using it and I hope to complete clear up my nails. I also use oregano oil to complement the treatment.</li>
            <li> Still have not seen much of a change on my bad big toe.. But I have only been putting on the nail treatment once a day.. Need to get on doing it twice a day.. One thing that I will complain about is the Tea Tree oil foot soak and in fact all the products are so small you have to keep buying thing, thus making it really expensive for those that have a bad case of toe nail fungus. That is why I downgraded to 2 stars.</li>
            <li> I have had a toenail fungus on 5 toes for almost 10 years from a nail salon. I have tried  laser treatment and it helped them to not look so bad but in time it came back with a vengeance. Also I have tried various other treatments with no help. I have used this 3 step process for about a month and my toenails look great. I know the fungus isn&#x27;t gone and I have to continue the process till my my toenails grow out, but I can wear sandals for the first time in many years. Give it a try. It really works.</li>
            <li> Effective product if you follow directions correctly.  It takes time to see progress, however, it does work.</li>
            <li> This product works great! I have only been using for about 10 days and I have noticed remarkable improvement. I will continue to use it even after it has cleared up to prevent future  problems especially if having pedicures done!</li>
            <li> Very good Product&amp;#60; i have used it for over a month it works. I would not use the Epson salt on a daily basis, since it will dry your ski too much.</li>
            <li> This product works great and does what it says it will do. Wish it was a bigger size but will order more if needed. Great bargain as well.</li>
            <li> Great Products...Super pleased with the outcome of my feet &amp; glade I purchased this set!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been battling toenail fungus for over two years and have tried various products (Kerasal, PurNail, Fungi Nail).  At one point my doctor wanted to put me on Lamisil but I refused because of the side effects on the liver.  I&#x27;ve been following this system for a little over a month and my toenails are making a rapid come back.  There is a drastic improvement in my nails and I can now see three new pink toenails growing in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first five days I followed the system as per the instructions.  I washed my feet in the shower with the Antifungal wash in the morning and applied the Renew Nail Treatment once in the morning before work, and once in the evening before bed.  The best part of the system is the Tea Tree Foot Soak, it is like a little piece of heaven on your feet.  It makes the nails and skin on your feet feel soft clean and healthy.  The instructions want you to soak your feet daily, but after five days I started soaking my feet 3-4 times a week instead of daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This system is different than other products on the market.  It doesn&#x27;t just target toenail fungus but treats the entire foot.  The synergistic effect of the three product used together daily is truly amazing in treating nail fungus and overall foot health.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Good for small buy didn&#x27;t clear my fungus</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working on my toes.  This product is worth every penny</li>
            <li> The Tee Tree Epsom Salts, Cleanser &amp; Toe Nail Fungus brought me major relief from severe eczema on my right foot.  In just 2 days I could feel I was winning the war and getting my foot back but what you also need to do is buy Emu Oil from Koras  Naturals as the oil will replenish what the salt cleansers kill.  Seriously hurting limping for months of agony the Emu Oil worked in just 1 hour 15 min but I knew the salts from Pure Nothwest also helped. Buy these products if you have eczema the itching will stop there is hope to get your skin back.</li>
            <li> I guess it works OK, I filed my nail quite thin and the TEA tree oil seamed to make it dissolve and I didn&#x27;t like wearing a band aid on my nail ALL the time. The worst part is the smell!!!</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for exactly 3 days so I can&#x27;t really say much in terms of how well it&#x27;s working. I WILL however update this and see how it turned out. I have mild cases of nail fungus on two of my toes on my left foot. I bought this product along with 100% tea tree oil to add to the soak even though it already contains it. It&#x27;s bee VERY soothing to my feet and it feels fantastic. I also have been wearing sandals every day except two days a week (the days that I am at work).&lt;br /&gt;I am very hopeful for this product when reading the reviews. Wish me me luck!</li>
            <li> Works well!  I&#x27;ve been using the product for about 3 weeks now - trying to keep up the multi-step routine as best I can - and I&#x27;ve noticed great results.  The skin on my feet is smoother, and it seems that much of the toenail fungus is on its way to growing out. Even the lady who does my pedicures noticed and asked if I was taking &amp;#34;medicine.&amp;#34;  I was a bit hesitant to use the product because I feared that nothing could eliminate stubborn toenail fungus except some type of pill, but this remedy has been a welcomed find.  In fact, the foot soak is very relaxing, and I plan to use it even after I stop with the other 2 products in the set.</li>
