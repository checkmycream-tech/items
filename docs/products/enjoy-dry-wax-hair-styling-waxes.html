            <li>While on Amazon one day, I searched for the Enjoy line and was thrilled to find it!  </li>

            <li>This stuff is the best dry hair wax you can find.</li>
            <li>Once i scraped of the top layer and discarded it, it seemed to be fine.</li>
            <li>I spike my hair and it&#x27;s easy to get it to stay up.</li>
            <li>Gave it a try and quickly returned to the store to purchase the remaining jars!  </li>
            <li>I ENJOY MY HAIR</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t enjoy it at all</li>
            <li>Great item and thanks for the fast shipping</li>
            <li>Best hair product ever, particularly for people like me who have short, fine hair.</li>
            <li>Even though I have a drawer full of waxes, gels, pomades, etc.</li>
            <li>Well made and quickly shipped.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t have to use very much!</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and straight.  </li>
            <li>but well worth it.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon - you&#x27;ve given me the ability to continue having &amp;#34;great hair days&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li>so i went for it and it was exactly as it was before</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty over powering.</li>
            <li>and this is the first time ordering through Amazon.</li>
            <li>The best product out there if you have thick coarse hair!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice to use on my daughter to keep her &amp;#34;fly-aways&amp;#34; down.</li>
            <li>, this is by far my most favorite and the one I use nearly every single day!  </li>
            <li>As my hair grows longer, it starts to curl, and with this product it keeps it nice and tight all day.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a unique hair product that is exactly what it describes then look no further.</li>
            <li>Love the other products though.</li>
            <li>had been exposed to high heat.  </li>
            <li>I first came across this product in the clearance section of my local national chain beauty supply/cosmetics store.  </li>
            <li>the delivery from My Beauty Center was super.</li>
            <li>it seemed like it was either old</li>
            <li>The top layer of the product was off colored and a bit different than it usually is.</li>
            <li>It holds my hair all day long and you don&#x27;t have to use much product at all.  </li>
            <li>Product offers all day holding strength even in the most ridiculous weather conditions, and yet it&#x27;s still pliable several hours later.</li>
            <li>it also smelled a little funny.</li>

            <li> My hair went flat within an hour.</li>
            <li> It will last you a long time.  </li>
            <li> the retailer I buy from said the company is changing to smaller jars (2.1 ounce) and only slightly decreasing the price.  </li>
            <li> It works well, but made my hair look dry.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find in any of the salons where I live.  </li>
            <li> - I had finally found a product that would hold my thick hair all day long.  </li>
            <li> Rough up your hair a bit for a beachy look &amp; feel!</li>
            <li> The hold works and the wax takes a little of work to get on.</li>
            <li> It may be a little difficult to completely wash out</li>
            <li> This product was to heavy for my hair.  </li>
            <li> It is a little hard to get out after you use it,</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair and like to make it messy.  </li>
            <li> Have to use very little!</li>
            <li> Put a very small amount in the palm of your hand and some on  your fingertips, run your hands together, and work thru your hair.</li>
            <li> I have recommended to a few friends, co workers and random people that ask for the name</li>
            <li> Product is very hard.</li>
            <li> Leaves a sticky yuck film in hair that is difficult to wash out.  </li>
            <li> I ended up not using it because of the unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed to hear from store personnel that the product was being discontinued from their lines</li>

            <li> Get it while you can... the retailer I buy from said the company is changing to smaller jars (2.1 ounce) and only slightly decreasing the price.  So you&#x27;ll be paying more per ounce.</li>
            <li> I ENJOY MY HAIR VIA THIS BRAND EVERY DAY.  It&#x27;s all about staying stocked up at a great price!!!</li>
            <li> Product is very hard. Must be warmed up with blow dryer to even put on hands.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and straight.  This product was to heavy for my hair.  My hair went flat within an hour.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t enjoy it at all (see what I did there?).  Leaves a sticky yuck film in hair that is difficult to wash out.  Not for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best dry hair wax you can find. Works great to hold, not oily, and if someone touches your hair like the ladies always wanting to run their fingers through it - it doesn&#x27;t get on your hands or theirs. Well made and quickly shipped.</li>
            <li> Love this product..only hair wax I use!! Great, fast delivery also.</li>
            <li> This product is the best product I can find for my hair.  I have used it for many years.  It is hard to find in any of the salons where I live.  I have really thick hair and like to make it messy.  This does the job! It holds my hair all day long and you don&#x27;t have to use much product at all.  It will last you a long time.  It is a little hard to get out after you use it, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> I first came across this product in the clearance section of my local national chain beauty supply/cosmetics store.

I was very disappointed to hear from store personnel that the product was being discontinued from their lines - I had finally found a product that would hold my thick hair all day long.

Thanks, Amazon - you&#x27;ve given me the ability to continue having &amp;#34;great hair days&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son who has been buying it from s salon for several years, but paying a bunch for it. I can tell you that it lasts forever because I had to make my son throw his last jar away after five years. I&#x27;ve tried it once or twice myself, and it is a great product.</li>
            <li> My son loves the product, only we paid for one size and were shipped a much smaller one. amazon did credit me. Just a bit of a hassle.</li>
            <li> Remember this is a wax. I personally love this</li>
            <li> Great item and thanks for the fast shipping</li>
            <li> Product works excellent I&#x27;ve gotten this same product from my salon found it cheaper on here so i went for it and it was exactly as it was before holds hair well keeps it pliable throughout the day. anyone who styles their hair should consider it.</li>
            <li> Best. Wax. Ever. &amp;#60;---- from my boyfriend</li>
            <li> The hold works and the wax takes a little of work to get on. However, the scent smells like plastic and it&#x27;s pretty over powering. I ended up not using it because of the unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I was in Calif and I needed a product for my hair....I visited Planet beauty at the Spectrum Mall, in Irvine, and the store associate recommended Enjoy!!! He gave me a sample and now I am all about it!!! Great product, and the delivery from My Beauty Center was super.</li>
            <li> It works well, but made my hair look dry. Love the other products though.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the bomb! I spike my hair and it&#x27;s easy to get it to stay up. It&#x27;s also nice to use on my daughter to keep her &amp;#34;fly-aways&amp;#34; down. It lasts forever and you don&#x27;t have to use very much! Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Perfect for traveling.</li>
            <li> hair stays in place and has a non-greasy look</li>
            <li> This is my staple. I have yet to use another product like it. It really is a very nice hardwax without petroleum. It&#x27;s a nice bees wax consistency with just a touch of scent. Best on the market.</li>
            <li> I been using this hair product for about 3yrs now, and I been completely satisfied. As my hair grows longer, it starts to curl, and with this product it keeps it nice and tight all day. It may be a little difficult to completely wash out but I don&#x27;t have a problem with it. I have recommended to a few friends, co workers and random people that ask for the name and I&#x27;m happy to do so.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this wax!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, have been using it for years. Best for semi-long hair 3+ inches. Gives a great look without being too shiny.</li>
            <li> Have to use very little!</li>
            <li> I received product on time, no problems!</li>
            <li> Product offers all day holding strength even in the most ridiculous weather conditions, and yet it&#x27;s still pliable several hours later. I&#x27;ve purchased this product on several different occasions and I plan on continuing this trend for the foreseeable future. If you&#x27;re looking for a unique hair product that is exactly what it describes then look no further.</li>
            <li> Best hair product ever, particularly for people like me who have short, fine hair. Put a very small amount in the palm of your hand and some on  your fingertips, run your hands together, and work thru your hair. Rough up your hair a bit for a beachy look &amp; feel!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years now... The best product out there if you have thick coarse hair!</li>
            <li> For my wife and she has been using the product for sometime and this is the first time ordering through Amazon. Good price and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I regularly use this product and this time there was something off about it.  The top layer of the product was off colored and a bit different than it usually is. it also smelled a little funny. it seemed like it was either old had been exposed to high heat.  Once i scraped of the top layer and discarded it, it seemed to be fine.</li>
