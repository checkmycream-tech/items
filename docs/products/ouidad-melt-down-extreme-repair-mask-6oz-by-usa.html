            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, detangles perfectly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the results, though.</li>
            <li>The mask is supposed to feel warm when you apply it to your hair, but I haven&#x27;t experienced that.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>i love ouidad</li>
            <li>I love the way that my hair looks after applying this.</li>
            <li>I wish I never had to wash it out :)</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love, isn&#x27;t the word for this product.</li>
            <li>I just love this product.  </li>
            <li>Im buying it again for sure.</li>
            <li>Really great product I sometimes can feel the warming nothing intense though.</li>
            <li>It smells great and it is very hydrating.</li>
            <li>I love how sleek and polished my hair looks when I use this mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I wish it came in a squeeze tube, but otherwise it&#x27;s lovely.</li>
            <li>MY FAVORITE PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My curls have never looked better.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Hopefully it will earn that fifth star...sooo excited!</li>
            <li>It has a light scent that&#x27;s not too overpowering.</li>
            <li>i received the package quickly and was as promised</li>
            <li>It has sooo much slip, it makes detangling SUPERRR easy and it smells ahhmazzingggg.</li>
            <li>I love my natural hair and all, but dayyyyummm...</li>
            <li>By far my favorite hair product,</li>
            <li>My hair is always super soft and easy to detangle after I use this product.</li>
            <li>Dang, I wish Ouidad would quit coming up with awesome and expensive new products, because I just love almost everything she releases.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time this morning</li>
            <li>My stylist recommended this for my dry hair and I have to say it has worked great to out moisture back into my hair</li>
            <li>As the other reviewer stated, it does seem to lather like a shampoo, and I don&#x27;t feel any warm sensation either.</li>
            <li>Regardless, this is a fantastic deep treatment and conditioner.</li>
            <li>and this really helps.</li>
            <li>so i gave it 2 stars because i love all their other products-</li>
            <li>After using this product, I mostly had a frizzy mess.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product once a week for a little more than a month (it came with my November CurlBox subscription) and I like it.</li>
            <li>I am in the process of transitioning from chemical dependency to natural hair and had a really cute curl pattern across the entire back of my head.</li>
            <li>it actually felt more dry-</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very soft and I can tell its healthier</li>
            <li>My hair has NEVERRRR felt so soft after putting a product in it in my LIFE!</li>
            <li>and wow! I have 4b curls</li>
            <li>but this one doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel soft-</li>
            <li>And that is saying a lot as I am a natural hair product junkie.</li>
            <li>and wow what a change.  </li>
            <li>My hair was shiny,  soft and my curls were to die for.  </li>
            <li>I was very excited when I saw the results some were getting using Ouidad Melt Down Extreme Repair Mask, but I was verrry hesitant when I saw the price.</li>
            <li>I use it every other week and always have a back-up jar ready to go!  </li>
            <li>The six ounce jar is costly, but even with using it weekly and as a leave-in, I think I will be able to make the jar last a long time, at least 3 months or so.</li>

            <li> I also &amp;#34;co-wash&amp;#34; my hair with conditioner between shampoos, and I use a dime-sized dab of this Mask as a leave-in treatment that I comb through soaking wet hair, and then style as usual with the Rake &amp; Shake technique and Ouidad&#x27;s Heat &amp; Humidity gel.</li>
            <li> I swim everyday</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed in this product especially since the company claims to be curl experts.</li>

            <li> Smells great and works as advertised!</li>
            <li> i love ouidad products- but this one doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel soft- it actually felt more dry- so i gave it 2 stars because i love all their other products-</li>
            <li> i received the package quickly and was as promised</li>
            <li> I love the way that my hair looks after applying this. As the other reviewer stated, it does seem to lather like a shampoo, and I don&#x27;t feel any warm sensation either. But after smoothing it into the hair, my curls look like loose waves. I wish I never had to wash it out :)</li>
            <li> This stuff will make your hair feel like silk!</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner.  I have 4b/4c hair and after I use this mask I can literally feel the strength its given my hair strands.  I use it every other week and always have a back-up jar ready to go!  I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  I use it once a week and it&#x27;s great for my almost-waist-length 3C/4A curls.</li>
            <li> Love, isn&#x27;t the word for this product. I was very excited when I saw the results some were getting using Ouidad Melt Down Extreme Repair Mask, but I was verrry hesitant when I saw the price. My gosh I love my natural hair and all, but dayyyyummm...lol. When I saw it for $31 on Amazon I had to jump on it. My hair has NEVERRRR felt so soft after putting a product in it in my LIFE! And that is saying a lot as I am a natural hair product junkie. It has sooo much slip, it makes detangling SUPERRR easy and it smells ahhmazzingggg. I am following the directions to apply it at least twice a week and I will give a product update as soon as I am done with the entire jar. Hopefully it will earn that fifth star...sooo excited!</li>
            <li> I just love this product.  I used it for the first time this morning and wow! I have 4b curls and I&#x27;ve never seen my curl pattern as defined as I did today.  I left it in my hair for 15min and wow what a change.  My hair was shiny,  soft and my curls were to die for.  It smells amazing, detangles perfectly and it gave my hair life again.  Im buying it again for sure.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product once a week for a little more than a month (it came with my November CurlBox subscription) and I like it. The mask is supposed to feel warm when you apply it to your hair, but I haven&#x27;t experienced that. I did notice that it applies with what looks like a lather, almost like shampoo. I&#x27;m happy with the results, though. I use it to deep condition, placing a plastic cap on my head and sitting under the dryer for at least 20 minutes. My hair is always super soft and easy to detangle after I use this product. It has a light scent that&#x27;s not too overpowering. I currently have some breakage that I&#x27;m hoping this product will help stop and repair, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any results yet. Otherwise, I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Really great product I sometimes can feel the warming nothing intense though. After rinsing and applying a leave in and letting my hair air dry it&#x27;s very soft and I can tell its healthier it is also color treated.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed in this product especially since the company claims to be curl experts. I am in the process of transitioning from chemical dependency to natural hair and had a really cute curl pattern across the entire back of my head. After using this product, I mostly had a frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended this for my dry hair and I have to say it has worked great to out moisture back into my hair</li>
            <li> Dang, I wish Ouidad would quit coming up with awesome and expensive new products, because I just love almost everything she releases. This one is a winner. It smells great and it is very hydrating. I use this after every shampoo, which is once or twice a week. I also &amp;#34;co-wash&amp;#34; my hair with conditioner between shampoos, and I use a dime-sized dab of this Mask as a leave-in treatment that I comb through soaking wet hair, and then style as usual with the Rake &amp; Shake technique and Ouidad&#x27;s Heat &amp; Humidity gel. I love how sleek and polished my hair looks when I use this mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the jar packaging and I wish it came in a squeeze tube, but otherwise it&#x27;s lovely. The package says that it warms on your hair, which I haven&#x27;t personally noticed. Regardless, this is a fantastic deep treatment and conditioner. The six ounce jar is costly, but even with using it weekly and as a leave-in, I think I will be able to make the jar last a long time, at least 3 months or so.</li>
            <li> MY FAVORITE PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;I have 3C (ish) hair, with ~A LOT~ of heat damage and this really helps. My curls have never looked better. They&#x27;re silky and they retain lots of shine. By far my favorite hair product,</li>
            <li> I love this product. I swim everyday so I use this to strengthen my hair from the chlorine. I am using this product every weekend. My curls are moisturized using this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Very little goes a long way!</li>
