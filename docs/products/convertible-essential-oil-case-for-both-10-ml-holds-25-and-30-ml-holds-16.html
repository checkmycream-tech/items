            <li>Good Deal for the oney</li>
            <li>Well made I am very pleased by this product.</li>
            <li>I really love this case!</li>
            <li>Perfect to keep oils in my son&#x27;s bedroom and also for throwing in all my first aid and sickness oils for trips.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that you can adjust the dividers.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nicely padded case that is easy to transport.</li>
            <li>I love the color and the size and portability.</li>
            <li>Love these cases.</li>
            <li>and I love having them all in one spot and the fact I can bring it wherever I go because it&#x27;s so compact.</li>
            <li>And the adjustable divider inside will fit Doterra or YL oils, just switch out for the one you want.  </li>
            <li>The delivery was fine and the packaging was adequate.</li>
            <li>It is very sturdy and I love it.</li>
            <li>Perfect size for small 5-10 ml bottles!</li>
            <li>I ordered one of these directly from the Plant Therapy website, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Like it very much.</li>
            <li>I store most of my essential oils in this case.  </li>
            <li>However, it does hold as many bottles of essential oils as it claimed, so</li>
            <li>smaller than I thought but ok</li>
            <li>It was much easier this way.  </li>
            <li>Will fit larger with the convertable inside.</li>
            <li>but it really holds a considerable amount of vials.</li>
            <li>The Velcro is a little tricky to get inside but once in place it holds all bottles snugly and securely.</li>
            <li>I am sure I can&#x27;t cram 25 bottle in this little tiny bag.</li>
            <li>works goods  far</li>
            <li>I dislike how you have to struggle with getting the divider inside to get it straight to insert your essential oils.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how the inside dividers were made.  </li>
            <li>But if the inside of the case were a different color than the bottle dividers, such as black &amp; red, it would make assembly much easier.  </li>

            <li> If I had realized how small it was, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have paid as much as I did.  </li>
            <li> What I finally did was put several of my oil bottles into the center slots, to hold the insert open.  </li>
            <li> Due to its flexibility it holds various size bottles at one time.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the insert is a little tricky to install, because it has several little velcro strips on it, and you have to get them all in the right places.  </li>
            <li> the dividers are loose and they don&#x27;t hold the bottles in place.</li>
            <li> I was expecting something of value having spent $15.00.</li>
            <li> I expected something else, but they are plastic pieces you have to put together.  </li>
            <li> I put the center parts together and have had no problems.  </li>
            <li> Instead I got this tiny little case that was not worth it.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> The detentions are not right.</li>
            <li> I like the size and that you can hold at least 20 bottles of essential oils.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t do that with a case where they lie down.  </li>
            <li> The pouch takes up so much less room than the box I was using before, and it is also portable when I need to carry my oils somewhere, whether it is to a friend&#x27;s, or just to another room in my house.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little tricky figuring out the inserts</li>
            <li> A little tricky getting the velcro in, but once it&#x27;s in, it&#x27;s staying.  </li>
            <li> The case appears a little small</li>
            <li> I was stunned at how small this is.  </li>
            <li> perhaps it doesn&#x27;t matter that it is so small.  </li>
            <li> It is small but it carries what I need</li>
            <li> Well, while you are trying to attach one, the other ones get attached in the wrong places.  </li>
            <li> Instead I had to criss-cross thin pieces of plastic.</li>
            <li> I am truly sorry I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> The worst part is trying to put it together on the inside with the strips of black dividers.</li>
            <li> page can&#x27;t be displayed notice.&amp;#34; Very sad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother with it you will be very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is the worst product I have purchased off Amazon.</li>

            <li> I store most of my essential oils in this case.  It&#x27;s nice that you can adjust the dividers.  This also fits the 15 ml bottles, so you can mix and match 5 ml and 15ml.  It&#x27;s a nicely padded case that is easy to transport.</li>
            <li> The case appears a little small but it really holds a considerable amount of vials. It is very sturdy and I love it.</li>
            <li> I was stunned at how small this is.  If I had realized how small it was, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have paid as much as I did.  However, it does hold as many bottles of essential oils as it claimed, so perhaps it doesn&#x27;t matter that it is so small.  Otherwise it is great.  The dividers are flimsy, but they work.</li>
            <li> The detentions are not right. This was suppose to be taller. Instead I got this tiny little case that was not worth it.</li>
            <li> Good Deal for the oney</li>
            <li> I ordered one of these directly from the Plant Therapy website, and I love it.  The only complaint I have is that the insert is a little tricky to install, because it has several little velcro strips on it, and you have to get them all in the right places.  Well, while you are trying to attach one, the other ones get attached in the wrong places.  What I finally did was put several of my oil bottles into the center slots, to hold the insert open.  Then I started in one corner of the pouch, and added each bottle as I pushed the corresponding divider into place.  It was much easier this way.  The pouch takes up so much less room than the box I was using before, and it is also portable when I need to carry my oils somewhere, whether it is to a friend&#x27;s, or just to another room in my house.</li>
            <li> works goods  far and recievedi na timely fashion!!</li>
            <li> The velcro can be tricky when initially installing but otherwise fits multi-sized bottles.  Great purple color!</li>
            <li> I like the size and that you can hold at least 20 bottles of essential oils. I dislike how you have to struggle with getting the divider inside to get it straight to insert your essential oils.</li>
            <li> Like it very much. Due to its flexibility it holds various size bottles at one time. Great for traveling</li>
            <li> This is the worst product I have purchased off Amazon. I was expecting something of value having spent $15.00. This is not usable at all. I am truly sorry I made this purchase. Don&#x27;t bother with it you will be very disappointed. I was expecting a case that I could put both 10 ml and 30 ml bottles in at the same time. I was expecting something much bigger. I am sure I can&#x27;t cram 25 bottle in this little tiny bag. The delivery was fine and the packaging was adequate. The product was not. I did not contact the seller because I can&#x27;t find out how to do that on the website. It just takes me to a &amp;#34;this page can&#x27;t be displayed notice.&amp;#34; Very sad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for small 5-10 ml bottles! Will fit larger with the convertable inside. The Velcro is a little tricky to get inside but once in place it holds all bottles snugly and securely. Recommend this bag for holding essential oils!</li>
            <li> Well made I am very pleased by this product.</li>
            <li> It is small but it carries what I need</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how the inside dividers were made.  I expected something else, but they are plastic pieces you have to put together.  They work well actually, but I thought it would be the cloth material.  I love the color and the size and portability.</li>
            <li> was I suppose to have Velcro strips? no Velcro in mine.  I put the center parts together and have had no problems.  Didn&#x27;t know I should have had Velcro.</li>
            <li> the dividers are loose and they don&#x27;t hold the bottles in place.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for it. Thought the insides between the bottles would be padded. Instead I had to criss-cross thin pieces of plastic. No return address inside or out and no phone number to request a return label and refund.</li>
            <li> great case but had a lot of difficulty putting the insert in.</li>
            <li> smaller than I thought but ok</li>
            <li> I like the product.  But if the inside of the case were a different color than the bottle dividers, such as black &amp; red, it would make assembly much easier.  Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Love these cases. It&#x27;s a little tricky figuring out the inserts but over all it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I really love this case! It holds all my oils and I love having them all in one spot and the fact I can bring it wherever I go because it&#x27;s so compact.</li>
            <li> This case is much smaller than you&#x27;d think. The worst part is trying to put it together on the inside with the strips of black dividers. There are no instructions, either, to tell you how to put it together. I finally gave up trying to do that.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome case.  Perfect to keep oils in my son&#x27;s bedroom and also for throwing in all my first aid and sickness oils for trips.  Love it! And the adjustable divider inside will fit Doterra or YL oils, just switch out for the one you want.  A little tricky getting the velcro in, but once it&#x27;s in, it&#x27;s staying.  I don&#x27;t like cases where the oils lay on their sides.  When I&#x27;m applying oils to my kids&#x27; backs or feet, I unscrew all the tops I&#x27;m using, and put them sititng in the case so they don&#x27;t spil.  Can&#x27;t do that with a case where they lie down.  Perfect size.  Great case!</li>
