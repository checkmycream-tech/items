    <ol>
            <li>To all my bald brothers out there, don&#x27;t get suckered--baby your dome with nothing but the best!</li>
            <li>Extemely impressed.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Ultimately, I hold Amazon accountable and will never again make the assumption that I&#x27;m doing the best I can by not comparison-shopping.</li>
            <li>The best thing I like about</li>
            <li>This is the best moisture gel I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving my head for over 20 years now and have used a ton of difference moisturizers and lotions in an effort to fight dryness, and this is one of the best - if not THE best - moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used!  </li>
            <li>after shaving and cleaning my head I apply a generous glob of this wonderful gel.  </li>
            <li>Excellent item would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>and this stuff is great...</li>
            <li>A GREAT product for a bald head.  </li>
            <li>This gel works great.</li>
            <li>It is a great parody</li>
            <li>it is a great moisturizer for after shaving.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great and does what it&#x27;s described to do.  </li>
            <li>Great Product.</li>
            <li>This was a great stocking stuffer for the bald man/men in your life.</li>
            <li>and I bet it would do just as good a job without feeling like you&#x27;ve just poured battery acid over your skull.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
            <li>Works really good.</li>
            <li>Make my head and skin feel good.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I was delighted to find this on Amazon as a Prime product.</li>
            <li>well and feels good to my scalp</li>
            <li>a good moisturizer..</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>Great product, easy ordering and my husband has a beautiful shiny head</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the most moisturizing or that the smell is great.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>and it felt kind of greasy going on.  </li>
            <li>It did help to calm the irritation, but I was much more impressed with the &amp;#34;L&#x27;Oreal</li>
            <li>It is very soothing and makes my head feel awesome.</li>
            <li>Leaves my head smooth and feels good.</li>
            <li>I use this for my whole head when I shave, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>I love bald guyz moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay,  just don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s moisturizing my head.</li>
            <li>It could be better.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more when this runs out.</li>
            <li>and you know how we love shiny things. :)</li>
            <li>my sister gave me a tube of this as a joke, but i love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to wear it more.  </li>
            <li>like it has many fragrance in it.</li>
            <li>Meh, probably me, but this stuff is just OK.  </li>
            <li>Gotta be better product for dolts like me.  </li>
            <li>Works fantastic!  </li>
            <li>it is not greasy and goes on very clean</li>
            <li>Nice and cool, I had no burning</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>I find that this really does not do a good job of moisturizing my head or face.</li>
            <li>It also washes off easily.</li>
            <li>Strong recommendation.</li>
            <li>Its perfect for head and face, especially after being in the sun or right after a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far so good with this.</li>
            <li>I use this gel one or two days in a row, and I&#x27;m good to go for several more months.  </li>
            <li>Surprisingly, she not only supported but encouraged it--thinks I appear more distinguished and &#x27;cooler&#x27; sporting the aryan style.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t find this product where I live any more, was glad to find it again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, moisturizes well, dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t flake.  </li>
            <li>this stuff is really great for a shaved head like mine..keeps it from getting dry and flaky...</li>
            <li>My dad is hard to shop for and this was a great &amp;#34;filler&amp;#34; for the stocking !</li>
            <li>Great Quality, as expected.</li>
            <li>It feels cool when applying on my scalp and it does not burn.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product, but...as much as I liked it, it&#x27;s kind of expensive.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad product</li>
            <li>It dries quickly, feels soothing and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, but most local drug stores don&#x27;t have it.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your scalp cool and smelling good and does not allow head to dry out.</li>
            <li>And it dries very quickly and absolutely does not leave a film or a greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>He thought it was funny!</li>
            <li>The only thing I liked about it was the smell.</li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, I shave my head with Aveeno shave gel and a Schick Quattro razor.</li>
            <li>This one was all right</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this moisture gel even though I can obtain the same luster with a mixture of other products but this stuff is light not greasy and effective</li>
            <li>You will find a really satisfying moisturizing effect for face or head that Bald Guyz can simply not deliver.</li>
            <li>In 2010, I purchased my first tube at a Walgreens.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s exactly why I buy this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It does not burn (as some have suggested) and initially it gives a feeling and look of healthy moisture.  </li>
            <li>Very soothing to bald heads, even from chemo</li>
            <li>This product really does not do the job it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy, it dries fast, it moisturizes and seems to heal too.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Nothing really stands out.  </li>
            <li>but like I said there just really isn&#x27;t anything that stands out about this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product for my brothers in baldness!</li>
            <li>But something in it is much like alcohol</li>
            <li>He shaves his head every day and that can be very drying, but this keeps it from peeling.</li>
            <li>Right I think its good but not great.  </li>
            <li>I kept breaking out with most other lotions and gels yet have to use something else</li>
            <li>This product was good enough initially for me to purchase a second tube</li>
            <li>I normally shave about every 3rd or 4th day (or special occasions, I&#x27;m retired).  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Just keep in mind to apply it fast since it does indeed dry up quickly.  </li>
            <li>It was worth the time and effort to source it via the internet when it couldn&#x27;t be found in the local high street stores.</li>
            <li>It is only worth throwing out.</li>
            <li>my scalp rarely gets irritated, and I keep this gel on hand for those occasional times.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve been using clear aloe vera (from Wal Mart).</li>
            <li>in 15 seconds it absorbs completely leaving you moisturized but</li>
            <li>This product soothed my scalp, and eliminated the irritation completely.  </li>
            <li>I wish it was in walgreens near me.  </li>
            <li>Thanks guys, I&#x27;ll definitely be picking up some of the Bald Guyz sunscreen for this summer.</li>
            <li>I need to compare prices to other products to see if this is even worth it.</li>
            <li>If I do not have an open cut I have only felt a slight tingle, which actually feels kinda nice.  </li>
            <li>I should mention that I have an extremely dry scalp due to eczema and this may be fine for someone with oily or combination skin.</li>
            <li>This quick dry effect is listed as a feature as your head doesn&#x27;t stay oily looking or wet</li>
            <li>I started shaving my head around 2010, and initially found my scalp to be sensitive and irritated.  </li>
            <li>Everything about this product is OK, not great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only did I never hear back but went back to the offer ( I should have printed it out) only to see that it had been changed in some very duplicitous language.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of Moisture gel for the scalp either they burn like hot fire or they leave a greasy mess but not Bald Guys Gel.  </li>

            <li> Everything about this product is OK, not great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only did I never hear back but went back to the offer ( I should have printed it out) only to see that it had been changed in some very duplicitous language.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of Moisture gel for the scalp either they burn like hot fire or they leave a greasy mess but not Bald Guys Gel.  </li>
            <li> I tried this stuff twice (just to be sure) and each time it caused a horrible burning sensation for several minutes that quickly left me with a headache after the burning (more or less) subsided.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I have a tough scalp though since I shave everyday.  </li>
            <li> These parts of my body still feel dry  after applying this product and my face especially feels even dryer.</li>
            <li> For some unknown reason, my local CVS and my local Wal-Mart stopped stocking this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this product as long as its available.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for two weeks now and have had no such incidence of the extreme burning that people talked about.  </li>
            <li> but it took a while to dry</li>
            <li> and now I start my day with a dollup on my scalp every a.m. to eliminate a chronic dry scalp condition.  </li>
            <li> Makes my head feel really dry when it dries out.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores &amp; my husband can&#x27;t  live without.</li>
            <li> It feels weird at first, but I like how my head shines brighter than my future.</li>
            <li> A little dab covers my entire scalp.  </li>
            <li> The bottle lasts a long time as well, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Great product which I would miss terribly if I could no longer get it.</li>
            <li> Goes on wet feeling and</li>
            <li> I shave my head roughly every other day and the Bald Guyz is a life saver.</li>
            <li> Yes, it moisturizes \\&quot;as advertised\\&quot;, but you could use any other moisturizer on the market</li>
            <li> I have not tried any other product for soothing and smoothing my scalp.</li>
            <li> I am bald and shave my head about every other day.  </li>

            <li> Ouch! I tried this stuff twice (just to be sure) and each time it caused a horrible burning sensation for several minutes that quickly left me with a headache after the burning (more or less) subsided. Yes, it moisturizes \\&quot;as advertised\\&quot;, but you could use any other moisturizer on the market and I bet it would do just as good a job without feeling like you&#x27;ve just poured battery acid over your skull. Just because you&#x27;re bald doesn&#x27;t mean you need to use products that target bald guys--in my experience, a lot of them are a rip-off: overpriced at best, inferior (like Bald Guyz Moisture Gel) at worst. Anyway, after trying this crap, I&#x27;ve sworn off using anything but natural products if I can help it. I now use [[ASIN:B0016AV5G6 Lily Of The Desert - Aloe Vera Gelly, 12 fl oz gel]] and this stuff is great... not only does it moisturize without chemicals, but it helps heal your skin. It dries quickly, feels soothing and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue. And it&#x27;s 99% organic. To all my bald brothers out there, don&#x27;t get suckered--baby your dome with nothing but the best!</li>
            <li> my boy is 42 and I gave it to him for Christmas.  He thought it was funny!</li>
            <li> I use this for my whole head when I shave, it&#x27;s great. Couldn&#x27;t find this product where I live any more, was glad to find it again. It arrived before time quoted as well.</li>
            <li> It feels weird at first, but I like how my head shines brighter than my future.</li>
            <li> Written from the male family members. Extemely impressed.  Use on both face and head. Non greasy.  Leaves your skin feeling moisturised, but not shiny.  Factor 15 a bonus. It was worth the time and effort to source it via the internet when it couldn&#x27;t be found in the local high street stores.</li>
            <li> The product itself? No problem. It&#x27;s what I wanted - I&#x27;ve used it before and it&#x27;s good stuff. My problem is that I was billed $24.99 + for a $5.50 product. What I&#x27;d ordered was a 3-pak of the item but I received only one tube. I wrote  the seller (HEC Distribution) to inform them that they had mis-filled the order and that they owed me two tubes of Moisture Gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only did I never hear back but went back to the offer ( I should have printed it out) only to see that it had been changed in some very duplicitous language. Life&#x27;s complex, and I don&#x27;t have the time to chase these shysters down. What I did do was to go to a non-Amazon site and ordered 5 tubes at $5.50 ea + $5.20 in shipping (total $32.70). I received that order within a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, I hold Amazon accountable and will never again make the assumption that I&#x27;m doing the best I can by not comparison-shopping.</li>
            <li> Before I bought this I read the reviews about the burning.  I have been using this product for two weeks now and have had no such incidence of the extreme burning that people talked about.  If I happen to cut myself that day shaving there is a slight tingle when I put on the gel but never anything I would consider burning or \\&quot;battery acid\\&quot;.  If I do not have an open cut I have only felt a slight tingle, which actually feels kinda nice.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this product from a local store, but they recently stopped carrying it.  I love bald guyz moisturizer.  Leaves your scalp cool and smelling good and does not allow head to dry out.</li>
            <li> Works really good. Very soothing to bald heads, even from chemo</li>
            <li> A GREAT product for a bald head.  Goes on wet feeling and in 15 seconds it absorbs completely leaving you moisturized but ZERO grease.  Its perfect for head and face, especially after being in the sun or right after a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY recommended.</li>
            <li> I find that this really does not do a good job of moisturizing my head or face. These parts of my body still feel dry  after applying this product and my face especially feels even dryer. I mention this because the Bald Guyz tube says the product can be used for head or face. And after using my electric razor on my neck, I felt a stinging sensation after applying Bald Guyz. I would recommend that you try St. Ives Timeless Skin which I have been using for years. You will find a really satisfying moisturizing effect for face or head that Bald Guyz can simply not deliver. Update: I reduced the star rating from 2 to 1 star. This product really does not do the job it is supposed to do. The only thing I liked about it was the smell. It is only worth throwing out.</li>
            <li> For the Bald people out there. I kept breaking out with most other lotions and gels yet have to use something else the skin dries out. So far so good with this. It has no detectible odor and just a little dab covers the head. It also washes off easily. I&#x27;ve ordered extra ones to have.</li>
            <li> This stuff does the job, I suppose, but it&#x27;s a bit greasy.  I bought 3 different kinds of &#x27;head lotions&#x27; to try because I was tired of m head hurting after I shaved it.  This one was all right but it took a while to dry and it felt kind of greasy going on.  It did help to calm the irritation, but I was much more impressed with the &amp;#34;L&#x27;Oreal Paris Men&#x27;s Expert Comfort Max SPF 15 Anti-Irritation After Shave Lotion&#x27;.  Your mileage may vary.</li>
            <li> Began using this a couple of years ago and now I start my day with a dollup on my scalp every a.m. to eliminate a chronic dry scalp condition.  Love this stuff, but most local drug stores don&#x27;t have it.  Amazon always does.</li>
            <li> I started shaving my head around 2010, and initially found my scalp to be sensitive and irritated.  This product soothed my scalp, and eliminated the irritation completely.  It is not greasy, it dries fast, it moisturizes and seems to heal too.  A little dab covers my entire scalp.  At this point (2014) my scalp rarely gets irritated, and I keep this gel on hand for those occasional times.  I use this gel one or two days in a row, and I&#x27;m good to go for several more months.  I normally shave about every 3rd or 4th day (or special occasions, I&#x27;m retired).  I could not find this in my local drug stores, so Amazon saved the day.  In 2010, I purchased my first tube at a Walgreens.  I have not tried any other product for soothing and smoothing my scalp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay,  just don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s moisturizing my head. Soaks in and still feels a  little dry. It could be better.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores &amp; my husband can&#x27;t  live without. It.</li>
            <li> This gel works great. Make my head and skin feel good. Nice and cool, I had no burning what so ever. I will be ordering more when this runs out.</li>
            <li> Great product, easy ordering and my husband has a beautiful shiny head and you know how we love shiny things. :)</li>
            <li> The best thing I like about Bald Guys Moisture Gel is that it does not burn my scalp.  I have tried a lot of Moisture gel for the scalp either they burn like hot fire or they leave a greasy mess but not Bald Guys Gel.  It feels cool when applying on my scalp and it does not burn.  So if you a product that moisturize your scalp without a burn then get Bald Guys Moisture Gel.</li>
            <li> I am bald and shave my head about every other day.  This is after shave moisturizer.  And it dries very quickly and absolutely does not leave a film or a greasy feeling.  That&#x27;s exactly why I buy this stuff.  I wish it was in walgreens near me.  They used to carry it but not anymore so I always order form Amazon (and whatever seller they are using).  It is a great parody and I even mix it with sunscreen for daytime SPF protection.  Strong recommendation.</li>
            <li> Great Quality, as expected.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, but...as much as I liked it, it&#x27;s kind of expensive.  I haven&#x27;t used this for some time.  (I&#x27;ve been using clear aloe vera (from Wal Mart).</li>
            <li> my sister gave me a tube of this as a joke, but i love it.  it is a great moisturizer for after shaving.  it is not greasy and goes on very clean</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this moisture gel even though I can obtain the same luster with a mixture of other products but this stuff is light not greasy and effective I will continue to recommend this product, I will continue to use&lt;br /&gt;this product as long as its available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Satisfied Customer (way 2 go)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bald Guyz for several years. For some unknown reason, my local CVS and my local Wal-Mart stopped stocking this product. I can only assume they weren&#x27;t moving enough of the product (shrug). Anyway, I was delighted to find this on Amazon as a Prime product. Ordered three bottles of it on my last order. I shave my head roughly every other day and the Bald Guyz is a life saver. No splotches, bumps, or irritation. It is very soothing and makes my head feel awesome. I use it on my face as well. Great product which I would miss terribly if I could no longer get it. Thanks Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit: just want to add that I have never experienced any burning sensation from this product, unlike some other I have used. For what it&#x27;s worth, I shave my head with Aveeno shave gel and a Schick Quattro razor.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great and does what it&#x27;s described to do.  The bottle lasts a long time as well, a little goes a long way.  Just keep in mind to apply it fast since it does indeed dry up quickly.  The first time I used it I had a slight sting but nothing bad and I&#x27;ve never felt it since.  I&#x27;m sure I have a tough scalp though since I shave everyday.  Thanks guys, I&#x27;ll definitely be picking up some of the Bald Guyz sunscreen for this summer.</li>
            <li> Great Product. I continue to use the Bald Guyz products. Although it is hard to find in the store. Thank You.</li>
            <li> I need to compare prices to other products to see if this is even worth it. Everything about this product is OK, not great. Nothing really stands out.  I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the most moisturizing or that the smell is great. While the smell isn&#x27;t bad this product seems a little watered down. Even when I squeeze the tube the liquid runs between my fingers (imagine squeezing water from a tube). I wish it had a little thicker consistency. It&#x27;s not a bad product but like I said there just really isn&#x27;t anything that stands out about this product.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisture gel I have ever used. Leaves my head smooth and feels good. No smell not sticky.</li>
            <li> Right I think its good but not great.  I&#x27;ll have to wear it more.  It goes and well and feels good to my scalp but it dries out some after a few hours.  Makes my head feel really dry when it dries out.  I need something that lasts a bit longer.  I will update after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  Provides healing after razor burn, and moisturizing.  I would highly recommend this product for my brothers in baldness!</li>
            <li> This product was good enough initially for me to purchase a second tube however I have come to realize that it was definitely drying my scalp.  It does not burn (as some have suggested) and initially it gives a feeling and look of healthy moisture.  But something in it is much like alcohol and it dries your scalp.  This quick dry effect is listed as a feature as your head doesn&#x27;t stay oily looking or wet but it definitely dried my scalp.  I should mention that I have an extremely dry scalp due to eczema and this may be fine for someone with oily or combination skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff works like a charm to keep my husbands bald head from peeling in the summer and winter! Can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.&lt;br /&gt;If you shave your head this stuff&lt;br /&gt;is a must.  It cools your bean&lt;br /&gt;off after a shave!</li>
            <li> i bought it for my husband, but it smells so ugly.seems like it has many fragrance in it. and it feels bad in quality. never buy again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my head for over 20 years now and have used a ton of difference moisturizers and lotions in an effort to fight dryness, and this is one of the best - if not THE best - moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used!  It&#x27;s cheap, moisturizes well, dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t flake.  Love it!</li>
            <li> this stuff is really great for a shaved head like mine..keeps it from getting dry and flaky...a good moisturizer..superb...easy to use</li>
            <li> This was a great stocking stuffer for the bald man/men in your life. My dad is hard to shop for and this was a great &amp;#34;filler&amp;#34; for the stocking !</li>
            <li> Use it everyday.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this gel.  He shaves his head every day and that can be very drying, but this keeps it from peeling.</li>
            <li> Meh, probably me, but this stuff is just OK.  Gotta be better product for dolts like me.  I will find it--your experience and suggestions I welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bald by choice (kinda): I Run hot, am starting to thin faintly on the crown, but am lazy and, moreover, disinclined to cling desperately to vestiges of past me.  This proved more difficult than I imagined as vanity is a demanding mistress.  Then the impetus arrived: Temps hovered in the 90s, my patience (oxymoron) expired, I finally said, &#x27;.... it&#x27;, told my wife I was shaving my head.  Surprisingly, she not only supported but encouraged it--thinks I appear more distinguished and &#x27;cooler&#x27; sporting the aryan style.</li>
            <li> after shaving and cleaning my head I apply a generous glob of this wonderful gel.  It&#x27;s smooth and refreshing.  And, I have ordered more,too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Larry</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this stuff anywhere except on Amazon.  I go through about a tube every eight weeks.  Works fantastic!  I can&#x27;t find anything that comes close.  Thank you Amazon.</li>
            <li> Excellent item would recommend to anyone.</li>
