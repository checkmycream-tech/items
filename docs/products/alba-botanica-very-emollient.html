            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Happened more than once to both myself and my husband.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I completely LOVE this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>After doing lots of research on what is and isn&#x27;t safe for kids in regards to sunscreen ingredients</li>
            <li>Love this sunscreen, but so do the bumble bees</li>
            <li>This one is just okay for my family.  </li>
            <li>Favorite kids sunscreen.</li>
            <li>In general, this is a great product and the smell is quite nice  </li>
            <li>Rubs in quickly and does a great job protecting my 3-year old&#x27;s relatively fair skin.  </li>
            <li>suncreen rubs in easily, has a nice scent and offers great protection for everyone in the family.</li>
            <li>I love the scent and the easy application.  </li>
            <li>This great natural sunscreen!</li>
            <li>But most of them are fine.</li>
            <li>It worked even better then the name brand chemical filled stuff my sister purchased to use that day.</li>
            <li>While I love how it applies easily and smoothly, it stings the eyes.</li>
            <li>Goes on and absorbs in brilliantly, not white or chalky and smells so good!  </li>
            <li>Goes on easily.  </li>
            <li>Goes on easy-</li>
            <li>It rubs in really easy and doesn&#x27;t feel too greasy.  </li>
            <li>It rubs in easily and leaves my children well protected.</li>
            <li>She never gets a tan and it glides on easily and like a body cream.  </li>
            <li>As others note, it is smooth/creamy and applies easily.  </li>
            <li>Just used this product for an 8-day vacation in Hawaii, so it was subjected to lots of strong sunlight, ocean and pool water, sweat, sand, etc.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve received one or two tubes that have arrived where the product is kind of separated instead of creamy and consistent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it every sunny day on my twins since before their first birthday and have never had a reaction of any kind.  </li>
            <li>I like that it does not have any of the &amp;#34;bad stuff&amp;#34; in it, but mostly I like how easy and quick it is to put on.</li>
            <li>The product in the tube was smooth and went on easily.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is really easy to spread, its scent is light and it doesn&#x27;t include the litany of &amp;#34;no no&amp;#34; ingredients.  </li>
            <li>It said tear free.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Smells fantastic (sort of melon-like)--that&#x27;s why I get the kids version</li>
            <li>It smells nicely and does the job at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>The scent is light.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t sticky and it was super easy to rub in leaving no sign of sunblock.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>The scent is light and pleasant overall.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen is priced perfectly for an all natural product which is what drew me to it initially.</li>
            <li>In fact, I came across alba sunscreen in Hawaii and it helped clean up my skin a ton.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just right and easy to rub on to the skin.</li>
            <li>Smells good and fewer chemicals than many other sunscreens.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s better than Neutrogena Pure</li>
            <li>This has been such a great find for the hot summer months of Texas.</li>
            <li>I really wanted the lavender stuff which I love and have used for 7 years.  </li>
            <li>I bought this kind for my 4 year old son.</li>
            <li>I used last year&#x27;s version and loved it.</li>
            <li>Super for both me and my boys.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite sunscreens, particularly for the price.</li>
            <li>New favorite toddler sun screen.</li>
            <li>This stuff works, doesn&#x27;t plug pores, smells mild and fresh.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth which makes applying it to wiggly infants and toddlers much easier.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite of any kid brand I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>After trying so many natural and &amp;#34;baby friendly&amp;#34; sunscreens this tops them all.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff for sensitive baby skin.</li>
            <li>It also rubs in pretty easily, which is nice on a squirming 2 year old and 10 month old.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little oilier than I would like, but it&#x27;s still very effective and not opaque.</li>
            <li>This stuff has a great texture and smell (which is not strong at all)  </li>
            <li>Even when we&#x27;ve applied it right before she goes out</li>
            <li>and they said \\&quot;The main difference between these two products is that our Alba Botanica® Kids Sunscreen SPF 45 is tear free and has some fragrance.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Had good ingredients and as natural as possible for sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Great for my active 3 year old.</li>
            <li>I have not tried this exact sunscreen, but I have used the Alba Botanica Sport Sunscreen spf 45 a lot and love it, and noticed that it has the exact same ingredients (plus fragrance).  </li>
            <li>it.his skin is soft and smooth now and still well protected from the sun.</li>
            <li>Thanks Alba!</li>
            <li>For quick 1 hour trips to the pool or playing outside, this would be fine.</li>
            <li>Kids were pretty well sunburned at the end of the day, even after using it every 2 hours.  </li>
            <li>The Alba Botanica Kids SPF 45 Very Emollient Sunscreen, 4 Ounce Tube is different from the other Alba brands in that it is very emollient, easily applied, and has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>I feel better knowing that I am not putting harsh chemicals on my children as they enjoy the water this summer.</li>
            <li>Nice and natural but for face i only put it under eyes and below, or it&#x27;ll drip into them and burn away.</li>
            <li>The whole family has experienced red stinging eyes after this sunscreen gets wet.</li>
            <li>I am generally a loyal Alba customer but until this issue is fixed I can&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li>the typical store bought kind for our two week trip to Florida.</li>
            <li>Rubs in easily without leaving any white residue.  </li>
            <li>easy to rub in and no white residue&lt;br</li>
            <li>It went on easily, rubbed in easily, no white residue.</li>
            <li>The rest of his body was fine, but his face turned red and</li>
            <li>I ended up going back to aveeno and his eyes were fine.  </li>
            <li>My whole family has used it for years.  </li>
            <li>I specifically bought it for faces, as I have a very freckly redhead.  </li>
            <li>I  switched to Alba Very Emollient</li>
            <li>My eye really hurts when it goes into my eye by sweating.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, this review is for the children&#x27;s very emollient sublock in the purple tube.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this for kids and adults alike!</li>
            <li>The formula is creamy and rubs in really well.</li>
            <li>The only thing that almost made me rate it four stars was that it has a mild odor that doesn&#x27;t seem very &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Holds up in the water, and the price is decent.</li>
            <li>Decent price.  </li>
            <li>it seems to adequately protect her milky white skin.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I like that the SPF factor is high since this is for a child.</li>
            <li>Recommend this highly...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite SPF for my little ones.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle on my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>As far as protecting from the sun, it seems to do well on the whole family.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find it ran into our eyes and burned as someone else did, and my two toddlers and infant have never complained when we have rubbed it on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a long day, if I get any in my eyes it stings (but that would be true for any sunscreen)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wish they made bigger bottles, because a family of 5 can go through this pretty fast.  </li>
            <li>We used it primarily for her face using other products for the rest of her.</li>
            <li>We live in FL and the summer sun is unforgiving-</li>
            <li>The new improved version comes out in clumps and water.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re thrilled to finally have a product that doesn&#x27;t cause skin irritation and dry patches with regular use.</li>
            <li>Chose the kids version because the lavender scent of the adult version didn&#x27;t seem right at the beach, but the scent of the kids version is actually nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update ...</li>
            <li>If it gets near the eyes it BURNS!</li>
            <li>The first two hours he had it on, his eyes were burning and blood shot red.  </li>
            <li>Alba&#x27;s ingredients are pretty natural too which is a big plus for me.</li>
            <li>Whatever \\&quot;water resistance\\&quot; it professes to have, it runs when you sweat, and it burns your eyes like holy hell, even if you put it nowhere near your eye sockets.  </li>
            <li>No crying.</li>
            <li>Natural ingredients are plus too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never seen any skin issues post use on my sensitive daughter.</li>
            <li>For a kid sunscreen I would expect something far milder.</li>
            <li>Lately I have read that some sunscreens have ingredients in them that are more harmful than helpful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will say that even the sensitive skin sunscreen will burn children if applied after they have had sun exposure, though I have not have that happen with this brand.</li>
            <li>I have seen my friends spray their kids with sensitive skin Banana Boat sunscreen after hours in the sun</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin looking white and is very moisturizing for a sunscreen.</li>
            <li>This affordable and natural sunblock is my product of choice for my toddler daughter who loves the outdoors.  </li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>Rubs in clear too, although it takes a little work because the cream is so rich.</li>
            <li>when we lived in California you could buy this at any major retailer.</li>
            <li>meaning it didn&#x27;t meet an FDA test for claiming broad spectrum protection.  </li>
            <li>Suddenly it smelled like old cola.</li>
            <li>my whole family got burnt after some time at the beach when it didn&#x27;t happen with some other brands.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;OK for rest of body - if you don&#x27;t swim much or if sun not a hot tropical summer one.</li>
            <li>I have tried several safe sunscreens only to have a thick white paste, this one goes on well and does not leave a white residue.</li>
            <li>Initially, recommendations for sunscreens without certain potentially dangerous ingredients drew me toward this product, but I really enjoyed using it.  </li>
            <li>The poor quality of the cream, doesn&#x27;t allow it to absorb and spread easily on the skin, resulting in missed spots, resulting in sunburn.</li>
            <li>But I think that thick consistency also helps ensure that you get a sufficient layer to provide adequate</li>
            <li>It is very thick and creamy, which makes it a bit harder to apply that a more watery lotion.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> We made sure to follow the directions and reapplied every 80 minutes.</li>
            <li> stay away from the cheap sunblock!  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t leave that greasy feel that most sunblocks leave.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and love how it is not chalky or oily.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, great protection and smells sososoooo yummy.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth!</li>
            <li> and we love</li>
            <li> This works great and smells really good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We love this product as it has no parabens or pthalates.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is my favorite for both my kids and myself.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Happened more than once to both myself and my husband.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I completely LOVE this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> After doing lots of research on what is and isn&#x27;t safe for kids in regards to sunscreen ingredients</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen, but so do the bumble bees</li>
            <li> This one is just okay for my family.  </li>
            <li> Favorite kids sunscreen.</li>
            <li> In general, this is a great product and the smell is quite nice  </li>
            <li> Rubs in quickly and does a great job protecting my 3-year old&#x27;s relatively fair skin.  </li>
            <li> suncreen rubs in easily, has a nice scent and offers great protection for everyone in the family.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and the easy application.  </li>
            <li> This great natural sunscreen!</li>
            <li> But most of them are fine.</li>
            <li> It worked even better then the name brand chemical filled stuff my sister purchased to use that day.</li>
            <li> While I love how it applies easily and smoothly, it stings the eyes.</li>
            <li> Goes on and absorbs in brilliantly, not white or chalky and smells so good!  </li>
            <li> Goes on easily.  </li>
            <li> Goes on easy-</li>
            <li> It rubs in really easy and doesn&#x27;t feel too greasy.  </li>
            <li> It rubs in easily and leaves my children well protected.</li>
            <li> She never gets a tan and it glides on easily and like a body cream.  </li>
            <li> As others note, it is smooth/creamy and applies easily.  </li>
            <li> Just used this product for an 8-day vacation in Hawaii, so it was subjected to lots of strong sunlight, ocean and pool water, sweat, sand, etc.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve received one or two tubes that have arrived where the product is kind of separated instead of creamy and consistent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it every sunny day on my twins since before their first birthday and have never had a reaction of any kind.  </li>
            <li> I like that it does not have any of the &amp;#34;bad stuff&amp;#34; in it, but mostly I like how easy and quick it is to put on.</li>
            <li> The product in the tube was smooth and went on easily.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is really easy to spread, its scent is light and it doesn&#x27;t include the litany of &amp;#34;no no&amp;#34; ingredients.  </li>
            <li> It said tear free.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Smells fantastic (sort of melon-like)--that&#x27;s why I get the kids version</li>
            <li> It smells nicely and does the job at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> The scent is light.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t sticky and it was super easy to rub in leaving no sign of sunblock.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> The scent is light and pleasant overall.  </li>
            <li> This sunscreen is priced perfectly for an all natural product which is what drew me to it initially.</li>
            <li> In fact, I came across alba sunscreen in Hawaii and it helped clean up my skin a ton.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just right and easy to rub on to the skin.</li>
            <li> Smells good and fewer chemicals than many other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s better than Neutrogena Pure</li>
            <li> This has been such a great find for the hot summer months of Texas.</li>
            <li> I really wanted the lavender stuff which I love and have used for 7 years.  </li>
            <li> I bought this kind for my 4 year old son.</li>
            <li> I used last year&#x27;s version and loved it.</li>
            <li> Super for both me and my boys.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite sunscreens, particularly for the price.</li>
            <li> New favorite toddler sun screen.</li>
            <li> This stuff works, doesn&#x27;t plug pores, smells mild and fresh.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth which makes applying it to wiggly infants and toddlers much easier.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite of any kid brand I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> After trying so many natural and &amp;#34;baby friendly&amp;#34; sunscreens this tops them all.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff for sensitive baby skin.</li>
            <li> It also rubs in pretty easily, which is nice on a squirming 2 year old and 10 month old.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little oilier than I would like, but it&#x27;s still very effective and not opaque.</li>
            <li> This stuff has a great texture and smell (which is not strong at all)  </li>
            <li> Even when we&#x27;ve applied it right before she goes out</li>
            <li> and they said \\&quot;The main difference between these two products is that our Alba Botanica® Kids Sunscreen SPF 45 is tear free and has some fragrance.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Had good ingredients and as natural as possible for sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Great for my active 3 year old.</li>
            <li> I have not tried this exact sunscreen, but I have used the Alba Botanica Sport Sunscreen spf 45 a lot and love it, and noticed that it has the exact same ingredients (plus fragrance).  </li>
            <li> it.his skin is soft and smooth now and still well protected from the sun.</li>
            <li> Thanks Alba!</li>
            <li> For quick 1 hour trips to the pool or playing outside, this would be fine.</li>
            <li> Kids were pretty well sunburned at the end of the day, even after using it every 2 hours.  </li>
            <li> The Alba Botanica Kids SPF 45 Very Emollient Sunscreen, 4 Ounce Tube is different from the other Alba brands in that it is very emollient, easily applied, and has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I feel better knowing that I am not putting harsh chemicals on my children as they enjoy the water this summer.</li>
            <li> Nice and natural but for face i only put it under eyes and below, or it&#x27;ll drip into them and burn away.</li>
            <li> The whole family has experienced red stinging eyes after this sunscreen gets wet.</li>
            <li> I am generally a loyal Alba customer but until this issue is fixed I can&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> the typical store bought kind for our two week trip to Florida.</li>
            <li> Rubs in easily without leaving any white residue.  </li>
            <li> easy to rub in and no white residue&lt;br</li>
            <li> It went on easily, rubbed in easily, no white residue.</li>
            <li> The rest of his body was fine, but his face turned red and</li>
            <li> I ended up going back to aveeno and his eyes were fine.  </li>
            <li> My whole family has used it for years.  </li>
            <li> I specifically bought it for faces, as I have a very freckly redhead.  </li>
            <li> I  switched to Alba Very Emollient</li>
            <li> My eye really hurts when it goes into my eye by sweating.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, this review is for the children&#x27;s very emollient sublock in the purple tube.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this for kids and adults alike!</li>
            <li> The formula is creamy and rubs in really well.</li>
            <li> The only thing that almost made me rate it four stars was that it has a mild odor that doesn&#x27;t seem very &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Holds up in the water, and the price is decent.</li>
            <li> Decent price.  </li>
            <li> it seems to adequately protect her milky white skin.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I like that the SPF factor is high since this is for a child.</li>
            <li> Recommend this highly...</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite SPF for my little ones.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle on my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> As far as protecting from the sun, it seems to do well on the whole family.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find it ran into our eyes and burned as someone else did, and my two toddlers and infant have never complained when we have rubbed it on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a long day, if I get any in my eyes it stings (but that would be true for any sunscreen)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish they made bigger bottles, because a family of 5 can go through this pretty fast.  </li>
            <li> We used it primarily for her face using other products for the rest of her.</li>
            <li> We live in FL and the summer sun is unforgiving-</li>
            <li> The new improved version comes out in clumps and water.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re thrilled to finally have a product that doesn&#x27;t cause skin irritation and dry patches with regular use.</li>
            <li> Chose the kids version because the lavender scent of the adult version didn&#x27;t seem right at the beach, but the scent of the kids version is actually nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update ...</li>
            <li> If it gets near the eyes it BURNS!</li>
            <li> The first two hours he had it on, his eyes were burning and blood shot red.  </li>
            <li> Alba&#x27;s ingredients are pretty natural too which is a big plus for me.</li>
            <li> Whatever \\&quot;water resistance\\&quot; it professes to have, it runs when you sweat, and it burns your eyes like holy hell, even if you put it nowhere near your eye sockets.  </li>
            <li> No crying.</li>
            <li> Natural ingredients are plus too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen any skin issues post use on my sensitive daughter.</li>
            <li> For a kid sunscreen I would expect something far milder.</li>
            <li> Lately I have read that some sunscreens have ingredients in them that are more harmful than helpful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will say that even the sensitive skin sunscreen will burn children if applied after they have had sun exposure, though I have not have that happen with this brand.</li>
            <li> I have seen my friends spray their kids with sensitive skin Banana Boat sunscreen after hours in the sun</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin looking white and is very moisturizing for a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This affordable and natural sunblock is my product of choice for my toddler daughter who loves the outdoors.  </li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> Rubs in clear too, although it takes a little work because the cream is so rich.</li>
            <li> when we lived in California you could buy this at any major retailer.</li>
            <li> meaning it didn&#x27;t meet an FDA test for claiming broad spectrum protection.  </li>
            <li> Suddenly it smelled like old cola.</li>
            <li> my whole family got burnt after some time at the beach when it didn&#x27;t happen with some other brands.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;OK for rest of body - if you don&#x27;t swim much or if sun not a hot tropical summer one.</li>
            <li> I have tried several safe sunscreens only to have a thick white paste, this one goes on well and does not leave a white residue.</li>
            <li> Initially, recommendations for sunscreens without certain potentially dangerous ingredients drew me toward this product, but I really enjoyed using it.  </li>
            <li> The poor quality of the cream, doesn&#x27;t allow it to absorb and spread easily on the skin, resulting in missed spots, resulting in sunburn.</li>
            <li> But I think that thick consistency also helps ensure that you get a sufficient layer to provide adequate</li>
            <li> It is very thick and creamy, which makes it a bit harder to apply that a more watery lotion.</li>
            <li> I usually buy less toxic sunscreens and this fit the bill.  </li>
            <li> The latter is key for little kids when you are lathering them up completely -- every second counts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was this area or somewhere else on Amazon, but I did purchase this very product.</li>
            <li> product is not sensitive enough for baby skin.  </li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t feel this sunscreen lasted as long as others in the same category.  </li>
            <li> The ones with weird texture don&#x27;t smell different and seem to work fine, but the texture is not what it should be.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen rubbed in easily and didn&#x27;t cause a burning sensation around the eyes of our children which seemed common with nearly every other sunscreen that we&#x27;ve tried in the past.  </li>
            <li> I used this on myself and children all day long at a water park.</li>
            <li> I reapply when we are out for long periods and we have never had even a hint of a sunburn.</li>
            <li> Low toxin level compared to other brands of sunscreen.</li>
            <li> And it does not leave a white layer on the skin like other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> We still use it, but only from the nose down, and I would not buy it again.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I was just naive, but I used this kids sunscreen on my 9 month old.  </li>
            <li> We had been using Neutrogena sun block for years , but then this summer my son&#x27;s skin started getting some rough patches.</li>
            <li> It is very close to the spray, but the spray is thin to prevent clogging in the pump and the tube is thicker in substance because you squeeze it onto your hands.</li>
            <li> little goes a long way</li>
            <li> We keep trying other  kinds but end up buying this again, as nothing else seems to work as well.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like other sunscreens and it&#x27;s at all goopy or slimy.</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy this product and other products from Alba.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is pretty expensive, but seems to justify the price.  </li>
            <li> the stores that carry alba botanica only have a small portion of the product line, and not this one.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been trying out numerous healthy sunscreens for our kids because of all the issues surrounding parabens and other nasty chemicals found in traditional sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Works well, isn&#x27;t full of chemicals, doesn&#x27;t smell like a dirty beach.</li>
            <li> 4 y/o protected, no sun burns whatsoever, other moms over there asked me how I was preventing him from burning on the 97F sun.</li>
            <li> There was never a single complaint from her about any stinging in her eyes and she had no sun burn.</li>
            <li> We used this for a week at the beach, in July, and neither of us got even a little bit pink.</li>
            <li> And we saved at least 40% from buying it at our local store.</li>
            <li> My only negative is if you are going in an area of bugs/insects, do not use it as it attracts them like flies.</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple kinds of suncreens that have the least amount or no chemicals-</li>
            <li> This is supposed to be less toxic than typical brands like Banana Boat.</li>
            <li> Please note there is no true water resistant sun screen, so protection will lessen with sweating or swimming.</li>
            <li> all have had some kind of challenge whether it be the packaging(spray bottles that fail to work) or the consistency of the lotion being too thick and difficult to rub in.  </li>
            <li> The issue is particularly bad in very hot weather when we are sweaty.</li>
            <li> A little grease.</li>
            <li> however if you what to put on your kids the spray is a little easier to apply to wiggly kids.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pale.  </li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s pale.  </li>
            <li> But I cannot get past the smell.</li>
            <li> I know there are not many chemicals in grooming products, but over the years they mount up.  </li>
            <li> - Don&#x27;t waste your money!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of very few brands that I will put on my kids.</li>
            <li> Now we live in the Midwest and it&#x27;s impossible to find...</li>
            <li> very pale with freckles</li>
            <li> I hardly reapply throughout the day so it is miraculous.</li>
            <li> I have no idea as to what they mean by \\&quot;improved\\&quot; version.</li>
            <li> It is SO tough to rub on and rub in and even then it&#x27;s not effective against sunburn.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen is not to thick or too thin-</li>
            <li> Our genes combined to make the palest of pale kids (sorry, buddy).  </li>
            <li> Very thick and pasty.  </li>
            <li> We lost a parent to skin cancer, so we are serious about our sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Care is requited when putting it on a face, so it is not ideal for kids.  </li>
            <li> just read Consumer Reports (June 2012), which unfortunately said that the \\&quot;Sport\\&quot; version of this sunscreen \\&quot;failed the wavelength test,\\&quot;</li>
            <li> However, they tend to be very hard to spread, which is particularly annoying for kids who are trying to escape you and get into the pool.</li>
            <li> Maybe its because it&#x27;s so lotiony, but he managed to rub it in his eyes and cried in pain, while his eyes watered like crazy.  </li>
            <li> Stinks.</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I hate stinky stuff.</li>
            <li> But the minute the kids start sweating/swimming, it gets in their eyes and they are miserable.  </li>
            <li> The chemicals are terrible for you.  </li>
            <li> These are some of the worst ingredients you could put on a child&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> This world is insane.</li>
            <li> It was awful and I will never make that mistake again.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has terrible eczema and this doesn&#x27;t bother her skin, eyes and doesn&#x27;t streak.&lt;br</li>
            <li> AWFUL!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff works, doesn&#x27;t plug pores, smells mild and fresh.  My whole family has used it for years.  We keep trying other  kinds but end up buying this again, as nothing else seems to work as well.  Like any sunscreen, you need to remember to re apply about every 4 hours for best protection.  We lost a parent to skin cancer, so we are serious about our sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Seems to work well, and smells delicious.  But the minute the kids start sweating/swimming, it gets in their eyes and they are miserable.  I thought they were just whining, but then I used it on my face.  Five minutes later and I wanted to scream from the pain.  Whatever \\&quot;water resistance\\&quot; it professes to have, it runs when you sweat, and it burns your eyes like holy hell, even if you put it nowhere near your eye sockets.  I specifically bought it for faces, as I have a very freckly redhead.  We still use it, but only from the nose down, and I would not buy it again.  Nature&#x27;s Gate Aqua Block Kid&#x27;s Block works just as well, and stays put.  No crying.</li>
            <li> Our favorite sunscreen for the price. Rubs in well. Good sun protection. No sketch ingredients.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is priced perfectly for an all natural product which is what drew me to it initially. After using it I couldn&#x27;t be more happy. It goes on smooth which makes applying it to wiggly infants and toddlers much easier. Just ordered my second tube!</li>
            <li> Easy application and great feel afterwards. Hydrates and protects without feeling greasy or sweating off</li>
            <li> Very nice and moisturizing. Natural ingredients are plus too.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. And we saved at least 40% from buying it at our local store. I&#x27;ve never seen any skin issues post use on my sensitive daughter. I use it too and no problems either. In fact, I came across alba sunscreen in Hawaii and it helped clean up my skin a ton.</li>
            <li> I used this on myself and children all day long at a water park. We made sure to follow the directions and reapplied every 80 minutes. It worked even better then the name brand chemical filled stuff my sister purchased to use that day. It wasn&#x27;t sticky and it was super easy to rub in leaving no sign of sunblock.&lt;br /&gt;Very very pleased with this product. I do want to add to keep this away fron children&#x27;s eyes. If it gets near the eyes it BURNS! I will buy a seperate product for the face.</li>
            <li> We have been searching for a sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t irritate our children&#x27;s faces and finally found one in this product!  This sunscreen rubbed in easily and didn&#x27;t cause a burning sensation around the eyes of our children which seemed common with nearly every other sunscreen that we&#x27;ve tried in the past.  The scent is light and pleasant overall.  We&#x27;re thrilled to finally have a product that doesn&#x27;t cause skin irritation and dry patches with regular use.</li>
            <li> Do not use this sunscreen on your baby!  Maybe I was just naive, but I used this kids sunscreen on my 9 month old.  It said tear free.  Maybe its because it&#x27;s so lotiony, but he managed to rub it in his eyes and cried in pain, while his eyes watered like crazy.  His forehead and under his eyes got red and blotchy like he had an alergic reaction.  The rest of his body was fine, but his face turned red and irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is not sensitive enough for baby skin.  Don&#x27;t do it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was this area or somewhere else on Amazon, but I did purchase this very product. I don&#x27;t like it, as it gives a prickingy itching feeling and makes my eyes water also oily greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> This product made my kids eyes and nose very red, puffy, and irritated.</li>
            <li> stay away from the cheap sunblock!  The chemicals are terrible for you.  This stuff has a great texture and smell (which is not strong at all)  It&#x27;s one of very few brands that I will put on my kids.</li>
            <li> I have used this sunblock for years. I don&#x27;t know how &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; it is but it smells great and it doesn&#x27;t leave that greasy feel that most sunblocks leave.</li>
            <li> I like how easy this is to rub in! Doesn&#x27;t leave white film on skin.</li>
            <li> Fantastic sunscreen that I feel safe using on my daughter and love the spray option!.  Love the smell and love how it is not chalky or oily.</li>
            <li> I have tried several safe sunscreens only to have a thick white paste, this one goes on well and does not leave a white residue.</li>
            <li> A little grease. I see my dougther face brighting after she applies it.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is so easy to apply and smells so good. My husband, daughter and I all love it!</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen.  I&#x27;m a redhead.  It&#x27;s gentle on my sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve never had a burn.  Super for both me and my boys.</li>
            <li> While I love how it applies easily and smoothly, it stings the eyes. My son who is 2 can&#x27;t tolerate it on his face, and I can&#x27;t on my face either. The issue is particularly bad in very hot weather when we are sweaty. I am generally a loyal Alba customer but until this issue is fixed I can&#x27;t recommend this product. For a kid sunscreen I would expect something far milder.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, great protection and smells sososoooo yummy. Rubs in clear too, although it takes a little work because the cream is so rich.</li>
            <li> I purchased this only because it wasn&#x27;t on the list that contains harmful ingredients. So I want to believe it but it&#x27;s too watery. I keep telling my two year-old  son that I can&#x27;t control it and my son laughs a lot.</li>
            <li> love it! Goes on smooth!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! This has been such a great find for the hot summer months of Texas. I feel better knowing that I am not putting harsh chemicals on my children as they enjoy the water this summer.</li>
            <li> I did not get what I ordered.  I really wanted the lavender stuff which I love and have used for 7 years.  Instead, I got a no-flavor stuff that is not what I ordered.  No explanation, either.  It did come in the time advertised, but why the switch in product?</li>
            <li> I thought I would try a different brand of sunscreen besides the typical store bought kind for our two week trip to Florida. I bought this kind for my 4 year old son. The first two hours he had it on, his eyes were burning and blood shot red.  I ended up going back to aveeno and his eyes were fine.  The lotion was also runny. I was a bit disappointed.  I ended up using it for myself but not on my face and I did not burn.</li>
            <li> We threw this sunscreen out.  Once you sweat or swim it will get into your eyes and burn them.  It&#x27;s not even good for adults let alone kids.&lt;br /&gt;If you have a child, find a different sunscreen - there are tons of no tear versions out there.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my daughter, but I&#x27;ve also used it for myself. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like other sunscreens and it&#x27;s at all goopy or slimy. It has a nice texture. The only thing that almost made me rate it four stars was that it has a mild odor that doesn&#x27;t seem very &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Excellent sunscreen. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have not tried this exact sunscreen, but I have used the Alba Botanica Sport Sunscreen spf 45 a lot and love it, and noticed that it has the exact same ingredients (plus fragrance).  I asked Alba if they were the same and they said \\&quot;The main difference between these two products is that our Alba Botanica® Kids Sunscreen SPF 45 is tear free and has some fragrance.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Cannot stand the smell of this product. It stays strong all day.&lt;br /&gt;Does not feel greasy, which is good. But I cannot get past the smell.</li>
            <li> We had been using Neutrogena sun block for years , but then this summer my son&#x27;s skin started getting some rough patches. I  switched to Alba Very Emollient and we love it.his skin is soft and smooth now and still well protected from the sun. Alba&#x27;s ingredients are pretty natural too which is a big plus for me. The price is also comparable to brands like Neutrogena. I highly recommend this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I bought both the Alba Botanical Kids tube and spray to use on my granddaughter for a recent two week trip to Las Vegas and Hawaii. We went to the pool daily. The product in the tube was smooth and went on easily. We used it primarily for her face using other products for the rest of her. There was never a single complaint from her about any stinging in her eyes and she had no sun burn.</li>
            <li> Smells good and fewer chemicals than many other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Living in Florida I have tried several sunscreens. Lately I have read that some sunscreens have ingredients in them that are more harmful than helpful. I switched to this brand and tried several different varieties of Alba. The Alba Botanica Kids SPF 45 Very Emollient Sunscreen, 4 Ounce Tube is different from the other Alba brands in that it is very emollient, easily applied, and has a pleasant smell. It is very close to the spray, but the spray is thin to prevent clogging in the pump and the tube is thicker in substance because you squeeze it onto your hands. The sunscreen is not to thick or too thin- it&#x27;s just right and easy to rub on to the skin. I will continue to buy this product and other products from Alba.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviews said they had problems with this. Please note there is no true water resistant sun screen, so protection will lessen with sweating or swimming. I didn&#x27;t find it ran into our eyes and burned as someone else did, and my two toddlers and infant have never complained when we have rubbed it on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that even the sensitive skin sunscreen will burn children if applied after they have had sun exposure, though I have not have that happen with this brand. I have seen my friends spray their kids with sensitive skin Banana Boat sunscreen after hours in the sun and they screamed and cried because they said it burned their skin, but we took into account they also had been in the sun all day and their skin was irritated from sun exposure.</li>
            <li> Does not sting! Goes on easily.  New favorite toddler sun screen.</li>
            <li> Great for my active 3 year old. Spreads easy and smells good. Had good ingredients and as natural as possible for sunscreen. Holds up in the water, and the price is decent.</li>
            <li> This product smells great and is very easy to spread. I like that the SPF factor is high since this is for a child. Also, it is still effective when it goes in the water.</li>
            <li> Smells great and keeps my kids skin sunburn proof! Love that!</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen I&#x27;ve seen and the price is very good.</li>
            <li> This works great and smells really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it is not tear-free.  My eye really hurts when it goes into my eye by sweating.  Care is requited when putting it on a face, so it is not ideal for kids.  There are multiple products, that I know (including badger, aveeno etc.), which are essentially tear-free.</li>
            <li> Recommend this highly...its a great product for children and adults...however if you what to put on your kids the spray is a little easier to apply to wiggly kids.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product based on a recommendation of a friend.  It is pretty expensive, but seems to justify the price.  Very fair skin in our family- no one burned after days at the pool.  Goes on easy- no complaints from the kids.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pale.  My husband&#x27;s pale.  Our genes combined to make the palest of pale kids (sorry, buddy).  Suffice it to say that we use a lot of sunscreen.  This is by far my favorite of any kid brand I&#x27;ve tried.  It rubs in really easy and doesn&#x27;t feel too greasy.  My son has never gotten a burn when slathered in this, even when in and out of the water and sand on the beach.  He&#x27;s never been bothered by it in his eyes.  The scent is nice as well.</li>
            <li> Great covering sunblock, and my daughter and I loved the smell. We used this for a week at the beach, in July, and neither of us got even a little bit pink. Thanks Alba!</li>
            <li> As far as protecting from the sun, it seems to do well on the whole family. No sunburns yet, and we are a very fair family. It also rubs in pretty easily, which is nice on a squirming 2 year old and 10 month old. However, it doesn&#x27;t seem resistant to sweat or water. The whole family has experienced red stinging eyes after this sunscreen gets wet.</li>
            <li> This was my second purchase of Alba sunscreen and wanted to try another version.  In general, this is a great product and the smell is quite nice  My only negative is if you are going in an area of bugs/insects, do not use it as it attracts them like flies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years &amp; my kids never get burned. I hardly reapply throughout the day so it is miraculous. The scent is pleasant too. I hate stinky stuff.</li>
            <li> This product page has several totally different items listed on it. Each alba botanica sunscreen product should have its own page. Otherwise how are customers going to know what product they are reading reviews for??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this review is for the children&#x27;s very emollient sublock in the purple tube. We love this product as it has no parabens or pthalates. It is very thick and creamy, which makes it a bit harder to apply that a more watery lotion. But I think that thick consistency also helps ensure that you get a sufficient layer to provide adequate protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back when we lived in California you could buy this at any major retailer. Now we live in the Midwest and it&#x27;s impossible to find... the stores that carry alba botanica only have a small portion of the product line, and not this one. So I&#x27;m very happy to be able to purchase it from Amazon. We&#x27;ve received one or two tubes that have arrived where the product is kind of separated instead of creamy and consistent. But most of them are fine. The ones with weird texture don&#x27;t smell different and seem to work fine, but the texture is not what it should be.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is my favorite for both my kids and myself.  After trying so many natural and &amp;#34;baby friendly&amp;#34; sunscreens this tops them all.  It smells wonderful, and goes on great.  Rubs in easily without leaving any white residue.  Highly recommend this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Creamy, feels great, smells great. I love it.</li>
            <li> easy to put on ... nice fragrance</li>
            <li> Irritated my kids eyes</li>
            <li> Rubs in quickly and does a great job protecting my 3-year old&#x27;s relatively fair skin.  Decent price.  Try it out.</li>
            <li> BEST all natural sunscreen I&#x27;ve found.  Not greasy, not zinc-oxide-y, no burns.  Smells like watermelon.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been trying out numerous healthy sunscreens for our kids because of all the issues surrounding parabens and other nasty chemicals found in traditional sunscreens. However, they tend to be very hard to spread, which is particularly annoying for kids who are trying to escape you and get into the pool. This is the first one that has excellent consistency, my kids like it, and it even smells good. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is a great sunscreen. I wore it for 3 hours and didn&#x27;t get burnt. Its moisturizing rather than sticky sunscreens. I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> This great natural sunscreen! It rubs in easily and leaves my children well protected.</li>
            <li> Smells and feels great, but always stings my eyes.</li>
            <li> This is the only sunscreen I will let touch my face! Works well, isn&#x27;t full of chemicals, doesn&#x27;t smell like a dirty beach. Don&#x27;t believe the label - it isn&#x27;t just for kid-folk.</li>
            <li> Avoid putting on face! Will eventually get into your eyes. Happened more than once to both myself and my husband. Great for rest of body though. May try the one specifically for face. Low toxin level compared to other brands of sunscreen. I&#x27;ll buy this again.</li>
            <li> This is supposed to be less toxic than typical brands like Banana Boat. I love it, it has a good scent. And if it is better for my body, I&#x27;m all for this one!</li>
            <li> I like that it protects without toxic chemicals.  I know there are not many chemicals in grooming products, but over the years they mount up.  I avoid them when i can.  This has a nice feel and smell.</li>
            <li> Overpriced, especially when the product seemed to &amp;#34;turn bad&amp;#34; after only a couple months.  Suddenly it smelled like old cola. We threw it away.</li>
            <li> Works great and absorbs quickly. Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin looking white and is very moisturizing for a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to rub in and no white residue&lt;br /&gt;Decent score on EWG&lt;br /&gt;Smells fantastic (sort of melon-like)--that&#x27;s why I get the kids version specifically&lt;br /&gt;Very moisturizing without being greasy at all--I use it on my face too&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pale with freckles and I haven&#x27;t had any burning, but I also haven&#x27;t put it to the test since I avoid lots of sun time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;?&lt;br /&gt;After a long day, if I get any in my eyes it stings (but that would be true for any sunscreen)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this for kids and adults alike!</li>
            <li> This affordable and natural sunblock is my product of choice for my toddler daughter who loves the outdoors.  Even when we&#x27;ve applied it right before she goes out it seems to adequately protect her milky white skin.  She never gets a tan and it glides on easily and like a body cream.  It smells nicely and does the job at a reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> Very good sunscreen.  It&#x27;s a little oilier than I would like, but it&#x27;s still very effective and not opaque.</li>
            <li> I completely LOVE this sunscreen.  After doing lots of research on what is and isn&#x27;t safe for kids in regards to sunscreen ingredients I came across this product.  Goes on and absorbs in brilliantly, not white or chalky and smells so good!  I&#x27;ve been using it every sunny day on my twins since before their first birthday and have never had a reaction of any kind.  I reapply when we are out for long periods and we have never had even a hint of a sunburn. I&#x27;m stocking up for our family trip to Cabo for Christmas!</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple kinds of suncreens that have the least amount or no chemicals-all have had some kind of challenge whether it be the packaging(spray bottles that fail to work) or the consistency of the lotion being too thick and difficult to rub in.  But, I have finally found a winner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This suncreen rubs in easily, has a nice scent and offers great protection for everyone in the family.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite SPF for my little ones. The scent is light. It doesn&#x27;t irritate their eczema. The formula is creamy and rubs in really well.</li>
            <li> Just used this product for an 8-day vacation in Hawaii, so it was subjected to lots of strong sunlight, ocean and pool water, sweat, sand, etc.  Results?  No sunburn.  Initially, recommendations for sunscreens without certain potentially dangerous ingredients drew me toward this product, but I really enjoyed using it.  As others note, it is smooth/creamy and applies easily.  I even used it on my face daily, instead of my regular moisturizer (which only has SPF 15), where it didn&#x27;t feel heavy/oily.  Chose the kids version because the lavender scent of the adult version didn&#x27;t seem right at the beach, but the scent of the kids version is actually nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update ... just read Consumer Reports (June 2012), which unfortunately said that the \\&quot;Sport\\&quot; version of this sunscreen \\&quot;failed the wavelength test,\\&quot; meaning it didn&#x27;t meet an FDA test for claiming broad spectrum protection.  Per CR, the UVB protection is great, but the UVA protection is just \\&quot;fair.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> These are some of the worst ingredients you could put on a child&#x27;s skin. Ginkgo biloba and glutamate? Wow. This world is insane. Do some research and see what ingredients like this can do to your nervous system.</li>
            <li> We have been using this sunscreen since my oldest child was a baby, around 10 years ago.  I love the scent and the easy application.  I wish they made bigger bottles, because a family of 5 can go through this pretty fast.  I just started a subscribe &amp; save account for this product after purchasing a different sunscreen for kids.  It was awful and I will never make that mistake again.  (Kiss My Face Sunscreen for Kids - Don&#x27;t waste your money!)</li>
            <li> My daughter has terrible eczema and this doesn&#x27;t bother her skin, eyes and doesn&#x27;t streak.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s better than Neutrogena Pure</li>
            <li> I like that it does not have any of the &amp;#34;bad stuff&amp;#34; in it, but mostly I like how easy and quick it is to put on. The latter is key for little kids when you are lathering them up completely -- every second counts. And it does not leave a white layer on the skin like other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen, but so do the bumble bees</li>
            <li> Love this stuff for sensitive baby skin. And it smells great!</li>
            <li> This one is just okay for my family.  I usually buy less toxic sunscreens and this fit the bill.  However, I don&#x27;t feel this sunscreen lasted as long as others in the same category.  We live in FL and the summer sun is unforgiving- my whole family got burnt after some time at the beach when it didn&#x27;t happen with some other brands.  I also did not like the smell either.  For quick 1 hour trips to the pool or playing outside, this would be fine.</li>
            <li> good sunscreen for kids</li>
            <li> Brought to our trip to Brazilian coast, perfect! Kept my fair skin 4 y/o protected, no sun burns whatsoever, other moms over there asked me how I was preventing him from burning on the 97F sun. Not sticky, no signs of irritation or allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> Favorite kids sunscreen. LIghtweight, smells nice.</li>
            <li> AWFUL! Don&#x27;t buy it. I used last year&#x27;s version and loved it. It went on easily, rubbed in easily, no white residue. The new improved version comes out in clumps and water. It&#x27;s as though it separates in the tube. It is SO tough to rub on and rub in and even then it&#x27;s not effective against sunburn. The poor quality of the cream, doesn&#x27;t allow it to absorb and spread easily on the skin, resulting in missed spots, resulting in sunburn. I have no idea as to what they mean by \\&quot;improved\\&quot; version.</li>
            <li> loooove!!! works awesome and is so smooth and fragrance free!! will buy again!!!</li>
            <li> Hmmm....didn&#x27;t work.  Kids were pretty well sunburned at the end of the day, even after using it every 2 hours.  Very thick and pasty.  Stinks.</li>
            <li> Not water proof. Nice and natural but for face i only put it under eyes and below, or it&#x27;ll drip into them and burn away. I tried diving underwater with open eyes to get it out so burning will stop, but then it showed me its waterproof desires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK for rest of body - if you don&#x27;t swim much or if sun not a hot tropical summer one.</li>
            <li> Very Nice!  This is a soothing, creamy sunscreen.  I feel very comfortable wearing it.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is really easy to spread, its scent is light and it doesn&#x27;t include the litany of &amp;#34;no no&amp;#34; ingredients.  One of my favorite sunscreens, particularly for the price.</li>
