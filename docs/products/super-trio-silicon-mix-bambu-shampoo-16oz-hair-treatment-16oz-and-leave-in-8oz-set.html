            <li>I have used Crece Pelo for 3 years and decided to make a change to see how good this product really is due to so many good reviews given by others.</li>

            <li>most shampoos aren&#x27;t really made for my hair.</li>
            <li>I use lukewarm- cool temperature water to rinse the conditioning cream.</li>

            <li>EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR IT</li>
            <li>I only used the leave in which I do love the scent and the way my hair feels after its applied.</li>
            <li>I love Dominican hair products especially this line.</li>
            <li>my daugther is 4 in a hlf years old and i been looking for a great conditioner and leave in that would detangle her hair without her crying and leave it moisturize...</li>
            <li>Its so amazing even for black women .</li>
            <li>All I&#x27;m gonna say is that this product has SAVED my dry brittle split end filled hair!</li>
            <li>A women loves to have nice , long , soft , silky hair .</li>
            <li>it defines my curls, leaves them very shiny and my hair is well moisturized.  </li>
            <li>This trio was very drying to my hair.</li>
            <li>mayb tii much alcohol...</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair (Dominican Roots)</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>and im getting ready to detangling it</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li>Highly highly recommend</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s creamy (not runny) but not thick</li>
            <li>Nice, thick, moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair so silky and soft!</li>
            <li>Makes your hair super soft, especially after a deep conditioning.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this trio since my hair is always on hot weather being I live here in Puerto Rico so my hair is dry and brittle.</li>
            <li>With this product, I need to wash only once, regardless of how much product I have in my hair to start.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>had ti mix with conditioner to not waste it.</li>
            <li>Make your natural hair, and weave soft.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>But this one leaves my hair really soft and shiny after I straightened it.</li>
            <li>and it still smells the same way and very manageable</li>
            <li>Feels soft, makes the hair grow faster and also restores.</li>
            <li>I am so in love going to definetly buy it again and will not use anything else I even spent so much money in the Wen product and was not satisfied with When</li>
            <li>Only problem is for the shampoo to come in such a large bottle, the leave-in conditioner should be in a comparable size but the products leave my hair soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I finally tried a new hair stylist and she washed my hair with this product.  </li>
            <li>This product is not greasy and offers moisture, though it evaporates quickly so it doesn&#x27;t make my hair wet and can be used on dry hair.</li>
            <li>Was having trouble with frizzy hair and the very first time I used the product it made my hair feel like silk</li>
            <li>my natural hair feels like fluffy clouds and when i use it on my weave its like new!</li>

            <li> I decided to try this trio since my hair is always on hot weather being I live here in Puerto Rico so my hair is dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> With this product, I need to wash only once, regardless of how much product I have in my hair to start.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> had ti mix with conditioner to not waste it.</li>
            <li> Make your natural hair, and weave soft.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> But this one leaves my hair really soft and shiny after I straightened it.</li>
            <li> and it still smells the same way and very manageable</li>
            <li> Feels soft, makes the hair grow faster and also restores.</li>
            <li> I am so in love going to definetly buy it again and will not use anything else I even spent so much money in the Wen product and was not satisfied with When</li>
            <li> Only problem is for the shampoo to come in such a large bottle, the leave-in conditioner should be in a comparable size but the products leave my hair soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I finally tried a new hair stylist and she washed my hair with this product.  </li>
            <li> This product is not greasy and offers moisture, though it evaporates quickly so it doesn&#x27;t make my hair wet and can be used on dry hair.</li>
            <li> Was having trouble with frizzy hair and the very first time I used the product it made my hair feel like silk</li>
            <li> my natural hair feels like fluffy clouds and when i use it on my weave its like new!</li>
            <li> , I use this on my daughter&#x27;s hair daily with some water to help keep the juicy wet curly look.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the investment and money.</li>
            <li> For my hair, when dry, it doesn&#x27;t provide any hold.</li>
            <li> I was going through a period where my hair was dry and frizzy and no matter what I tried nothing would work.  </li>
            <li> It can never avoid frizzing when its left down.</li>
            <li> It did leave my hair soft and manageable, but a bit dull.</li>
            <li> The leave-in should be used sparingly and applied with wet hands so that your hair doesn&#x27;t gunk up.</li>
            <li> You can wet your hair in the morning and have it look like it was just treated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll only continue to use it (a small amount) on my weaves.</li>
            <li> My hair was very dry and dull and the Silicon Mix brought back the life to my hair!</li>
            <li> When damp, it provides slight hold.     </li>
            <li> Leaves hair heavy.  </li>
            <li> The leave it conditioner wasn&#x27;t heavy or oily.</li>
            <li> It even keeps frizzy hair tame between washings.</li>
            <li> I have lots of thick hair, so I use a little less than a palmful.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if that was done during shipping, but no spillage occurred.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> my natural hair feels like fluffy clouds and when i use it on my weave its like new!</li>
            <li> I bought this on the advice of my hair dresser.  It is excellent especially if you have dry, over processed hair.&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I use this line on my hair. I absolutely love it. The entire set does wonders for my hair: smells good, softens it, and makes the frizz go away. It also makes it look full of volume. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong. This does miracle to your hair or human hair wigs. I love the three in one deal. It is another must have!</li>
            <li> I usually always order this brand but this batch smelled so bad like dirty feet had to throw away gross</li>
            <li> I purchased this combo set and I&#x27;m so glad I tried it.  I&#x27;ve added these products to my beauty regimen and, therefore, they have become staple products.      The shampoo is nice and conditioning.   I felt that my hair was thoroughly cleansed without being stripped.  This shampoo provides tons of suds, if you like that.  Make sure that your hair has been thoroughy saturated with water before applying.  I have lots of thick hair, so I use a little less than a palmful.  With this product, I need to wash only once, regardless of how much product I have in my hair to start. I didn&#x27;t experience tangles, but that may be attributed to my technique, more than any product I use. Smells great.    The conditioner is top-notch.  Nice, thick, moisturizing.  Either to rinse out or leave in. It all depends on what you are trying to obtain with your conditioner.  For rinsing out, it&#x27;s a great instant conditioner as well as a detangler.  It works as a deep conditioner, too.  My hair is soft and shiny.  As a leave-in (styling aid) it defines my curls, leaves them very shiny and my hair is well moisturized.  Doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or tacky.  One of the best conditioners I&#x27;ve tried.    Leave-In is nice too.  I use it as a hairdressing to refresh my style.  It&#x27;s creamy (not runny) but not thick and I use it on my ends.  This product is not greasy and offers moisture, though it evaporates quickly so it doesn&#x27;t make my hair wet and can be used on dry hair. For my hair, when dry, it doesn&#x27;t provide any hold. When damp, it provides slight hold.     These products perform well together and do a fine job of giving me healthy feeling hair that looks good and smells good.</li>
            <li> Anyone who has had a Dominican blow out know about these product and prices. love this set at a great price. lightning fast shipper!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  I was going through a period where my hair was dry and frizzy and no matter what I tried nothing would work.  I finally tried a new hair stylist and she washed my hair with this product.  What a huge difference!  I ordered this product from healthlink and received it before the date that was promised.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Great buy</li>
            <li> Was having trouble with frizzy hair and the very first time I used the product it made my hair feel like silk I am so in love going to definetly buy it again and will not use anything else I even spent so much money in the Wen product and was not satisfied with When but your product made me super happy thank you</li>
            <li> I really love this product!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! It makes my hair so silky and soft! My hair was very dry and dull and the Silicon Mix brought back the life to my hair! And it smells amazingggggggg! Love it!! Can&#x27;t live without it! :)</li>
            <li> Bought to restore some virgin hair I ruined..sadly it didn&#x27;t completely restore it and that&#x27;s okay but it helped a great deal. I have 4c hair...and the regular &amp; leave in conditioners do nicely on it...since the shampoo has sodium laureth sulfate I&#x27;ll only continue to use it (a small amount) on my weaves.</li>
            <li> EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR IT&lt;br /&gt;SMOOTH AND SHINE HAIR&lt;br /&gt;I WILL BUY IT AGAIN&lt;br /&gt;REALLY GOOD PRICE&lt;br /&gt;THANKS</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful. Also my hair feels great when using this product. I would highly recommend this product to everyone. The leave in conditioner is wonderful too, use a small amount.</li>
            <li> This trio was very drying to my hair. I like the original. This formula was just wau ti drying...mayb tii much alcohol...not sure but its horrible. ..had ti mix with conditioner to not waste it.</li>
            <li> Very good conditioner</li>
            <li> These products are really good for all hair tropes and for people who do a lot of stuff to their hair (i.e. chemicals, dyes). Smells good.</li>
            <li> she is in love with these products</li>
            <li> Make your natural hair, and weave soft. It brings your weave back to life, and it smells great. Good product for hair growth too</li>
            <li> I chose these products because of the reviews, but I did not find it to be as wonderful as I expected. I have used it twice and believe I may have an allergy to an added ingredient. My eyes got red and blurry. I did not care for the scent as well. It did leave my hair soft and manageable, but a bit dull.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this trio since my hair is always on hot weather being I live here in Puerto Rico so my hair is dry and brittle. I have used Crece Pelo for 3 years and decided to make a change to see how good this product really is due to so many good reviews given by others. I only used the leave in which I do love the scent and the way my hair feels after its applied. I will advise later on when I use the shampoo and treatment!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love the stuff!  My hair is so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome! Makes your hair super soft, especially after a deep conditioning. Four stars because my conditioner was opened and spilled in the box but Amazon quickly replaced it.</li>
            <li> A women loves to have nice , long , soft , silky hair . And bamboo is such a great ingredient for our hair . I just love this product . Its so amazing even for black women . Its great for roller set or rap . I can&#x27;t break away from it .</li>
            <li> I have purchased the Leave-in conditioner in the past and this is the first time I got the trio and was really impressed with the amazing results.  Your hair becomes very shinny, maneagable and it smells very pleasant.  I highly recommend the Bamboo Trio!!!!  Even Koalas will enjoy these babies!!!</li>
            <li> Bought for my sister and she loves it.  There was some leakage on one bottle.</li>
            <li> I love Dominican hair products especially this line. Smells amazing and leaves hair feeling really soft.</li>
            <li> Nice products and it leaves me and my daughter&#x27;s hair smelling AMAZING!!! Only problem is for the shampoo to come in such a large bottle, the leave-in conditioner should be in a comparable size but the products leave my hair soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair (Dominican Roots) most shampoos aren&#x27;t really made for my hair. But this one leaves my hair really soft and shiny after I straightened it. Definitely will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negative(Reason for the 4 stars): The conditioner bottle was cracked on the top side. Not sure if that was done during shipping, but no spillage occurred.</li>
            <li> Love it! Smells good too! All 3 products, great deal!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again for sure and have told many people about it.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s ok.  Nothing spectacular.  Can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s made a difference in my hair.  Don&#x27;t like the leave in.  Leaves hair heavy.  Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought it, and I love it. Smell so good!!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> All I&#x27;m gonna say is that this product has SAVED my dry brittle split end filled hair! Highly highly recommend</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product to restore over-processed hair to a soft and shiny state. The shampoo is great, and the Nutritive treatment is nothing less than awesome. The leave-in should be used sparingly and applied with wet hands so that your hair doesn&#x27;t gunk up. It even keeps frizzy hair tame between washings. You can wet your hair in the morning and have it look like it was just treated.</li>
            <li> It worked better than I thought. It made my hair very soft and clean and very light. The leave it conditioner wasn&#x27;t heavy or oily. It&#x27;s didn&#x27;t leave any great residue.</li>
            <li> Smells pretty good. Works great.</li>
            <li> Great product for virgin extensions nice smell! Great price for combo set! Best shampoo ever! Wouldn&#x27;t reccomend anything else! :)</li>
            <li> Great for my hair and my daughters hair. Its the best shampoo, conditioner and leave in I have purchased. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> my daugther is 4 in a hlf years old and i been looking for a great conditioner and leave in that would detangle her hair without her crying and leave it moisturize... after trying nurmerous amount of conditioners and leave in i had honestly found the PERFECT match for her hair.... the conditioner is smells great once i apply it in her hair and im getting ready to detangling it, i thought i would of been their for 40mins and she has very thick hair and when i wash it, it tends to knot up but not this time i got done within 10mins. after i left the silicon mix conditioner in her hair for about 15mins with a plastic cap i rinsed it out and applied the bambu leave in and the same thing same color as the conditioner i honestly though that it would of been liquidy like the others that i came across but boy was i wrong this time around. its thick it smells great and again i combed right thru her hair.its 4days later since i washed her hair and it still smells the same way and very manageable im very very VERY please with this product... any one hesitate to try it dont be you will NOT BE DISAPPOINTED I PROMISE</li>
            <li> Best product I ever used. Highly recommended! I have been using for over 4 months now, and my hair is totally different. Feels soft, makes the hair grow faster and also restores. Will be buying again and again.</li>
            <li> My daughter has fine curly hair but I can never find a product to keep it moist. It can never avoid frizzing when its left down. So I thought I would try these products and I absolutely love the shampoo, you can definitely feel the silicon in it. It lathers wonderfully and leaves the hair feeling better than the condition ironically. The deep conditioning cream is really nice too. I use lukewarm- cool temperature water to rinse the conditioning cream. It works even better if you have time to leave the cream in hair and wrap the hair with warm towel or even sit under dryer with a plastic cap on too and the rinse with cool water to help lock in the moisture.  I love the leave-in moisturizing conditioner too, I use this on my daughter&#x27;s hair daily with some water to help keep the juicy wet curly look.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the investment and money.</li>
            <li> the smell is really great and the conditioner makes my extensions super silky and soft when left to overnight , luvvvvvv it!</li>
            <li> Not only does it smell great, but it brings life and bounce back into hair. With that said, try it for yourselves.</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves hair so soft</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t give me that Awesome hair that people raved about.  The smell was good and my hair felt light, but the texture was off.  So, I will not purchase again.  And when the shipment came it the conditioner had spilled out of the container..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m speechless. The best product I&#x27;ve ever used in my life. My hair now is soooo much better, and soft and shiny and doesn&#x27;t fall anymore.  My hair is really healthy. I recommend :)</li>
