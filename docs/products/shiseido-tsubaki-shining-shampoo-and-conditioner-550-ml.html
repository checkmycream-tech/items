            <li>Absolutely love this set!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even express how much I love this shampoo and conditioner!  </li>

            <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>I have never had so many compliments on how shiny my hair is!</li>
            <li>I officially LOVE this Tsubaki shining set!</li>
            <li>The smell is nice, the quality is nice, but it&#x27;s nothing exceptional when you factor in the price.  </li>
            <li>Nice, smooth with a beautiful smell.</li>
            <li>Also makes nice and silky love it!</li>
            <li>Considering you get two huge bottles, it&#x27;s a great value and</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner smells are amazing.</li>
            <li>All I can say is AMAZING RESULTS.</li>
            <li>smells nice too.</li>
            <li>upside to this is that my hair does not expand and get poufy, which it has the tendency to do on its own.</li>
            <li>but with this one, I&#x27;ve been using for like 2 weeks straight and its still awesome.  </li>
            <li>Has a nice shine to it too.  </li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>These products are doing a nice job for me in this sense.</li>
            <li>Smells so nice and makes hair feel nice.</li>
            <li>Nice size for the price too</li>
            <li>Makes your hair feel really nice.</li>
            <li>The two work well together because the Tsubaki smooths my ends really nicely without being oily.</li>
            <li>I has a really nice softening, smoothing effect without oiliness.  </li>
            <li>Shiseido Tsubaki Shining Shampoo and Conditioner are really nice.  </li>
            <li>It lathers well and the bottle itself is rather nice with a quality pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so nice</li>
            <li>smells nice.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product after reading some great reviews on Amazon and a couple of beauty review sites.</li>
            <li>These products have rich texture and smells great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a great scent and my hair stays clean between uses.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very nice, smells clean and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>The product smells good, has a very attractive packaging and has left my hair shinier than it has been in a while.</li>

            <li>Thats it, very good to use, I really like the stuff.</li>
            <li>Also the fragrance is light and smells so good.  </li>
            <li>It perhaps a bit too nice smell for a guy :)  </li>
            <li>The packaging is so attractive that is beautiful enough to be part of your bath room décor.</li>

            <li>This shampoo make my hair very smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very light floral smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li>Amazing on my color treated, fine, damaged hair.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I do have to say that my hair started to tangle more, but it&#x27;s nothing I can&#x27;t brush through.</li>
            <li>I had never tried this brand of shampoo and conditioner before, but love it.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo,  very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>And it smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a nice light smell.  </li>
            <li>I love the shampoo, the conditioner I think</li>

            <li>I just think considering the price, it would do more.</li>
            <li>Only because nothing is perfect</li>
            <li>Just love it.</li>

            <li>Glad I found this, and I will probably be ordering it again.</li>
            <li>It also smells sophisticated and not too fruity.</li>
            <li>The scent is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I wanted a shampoo that would make my hair look &amp; smell nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>I used to buy tea tree shampoo but the Shiseido shampoo that uses camellia flowers is much better for the hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>And it does make my hair look refreshed and healthy.</li>
            <li>I also love the fragrance and the pump dispensers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo and conditioner..</li>

            <li>I love the shampoo.</li>

            <li>I love these Shiseido shampoo and conditioner as much as I love their skin care products.</li>
            <li>More importantly, they effectively alleviate the dryness of chemically treated hair.</li>
            <li>i Wish it REALLY gave a shine!!!!</li>
            <li>My hair has no frizz and is smooth and very easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>The products smell wonderful and the conditioner is rich and leaves your hair silky soft and easy to style.</li>
            <li>or it does as it promises, but it smells super nice.</li>
            <li>Allows it to dry very beautiful and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>and it really makes hair clean, shine and the conditioner is great.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t honestly say this is better than the ( higher quality) stuff I can get at the drug store.</li>
            <li>Somehow, the conditioner from this set is able to smooth it all out without even brushing.</li>
            <li>other reviewers point out, the product smells great!</li>
            <li>Combing my hair has never been so easy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on how shiny and clean my hair looks.</li>

            <li>I am noticing that this shampoo and conditioner combination is keeping my hair frizz free and shiny.</li>
            <li>also gives my hair a smooth touch.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft, it looks shiny and feels really good.</li>
            <li>This is great for straight hair not so much for curly</li>
            <li>Overall very nice, keeps my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>It smells great, but I&#x27;ll probably try out some of the other brand&#x27;s sets to see if I like it better.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s very important because they pretty spendy.  </li>
            <li>Has a very pleasant smell and so far has not dried out my hair</li>
            <li>I then let my hair dry and the next morning my hair smells great and looks great.</li>
            <li>But if you have long, straight hair, this would be great for you!</li>
            <li>makes my hair nice and soft!!</li>
            <li>I am not disappointed.</li>

            <li>I got these as a Christmas present from my boyfriend and this is the best shampoo/conditioner I have used in my entire life.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mildly color treated.</li>
            <li>its far better than some costly shampoos available in the market.</li>
            <li>Anyway, the company was quick to respond and handle my problem.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the Japanese version of this product and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>Shiseido Tsubaki leaves my hair super shiny and silky.</li>

            <li>The incremental results do not earn a repurchase from me, especially when there are many shampoos out there which have provided better results.</li>
            <li>Leave my hair so soft, very easy to brush and anti frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;Cant</li>
            <li>say my hair shine is so visible but happy with the result.&lt;br /&gt;Smell is not so heavy, its flower smell and clean</li>
            <li>The shampoo is good too, but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s any better than what I was using before.</li>
            <li>I was pretty excited to try this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>It cleans my fine hair and leaves it very shiny.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and easily weighted down by product, and gets greasy at the scalp pretty easily.</li>
            <li>I have very think hair and it makes my hair really smooth</li>
            <li>The size is HUGE and the pump dispenser is really convenient.  </li>
            <li>It seemed like the perfect shampoo for thick, straight hair.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair shiny, smooth and it feels so soft and light.</li>
            <li>definitely worth the cost.</li>
            <li>I will probably continue to use the conditioner but not the shampoo just because I rarely need to shampoo.</li>
            <li>I think this shampoo and conditioner would be really nice for someone with coarse curly hair.</li>
            <li>Feels gentler than most shampoos and leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Sure, it&#x27;s tangle-free and smooth right out of the shower, but the silkiness last for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Of course, shipped prime and got the product right on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that tends to get greasy (I live in a tropical climate too).</li>
            <li>my expectation for the set right on the mark the shampoo and coditioner makes my hair feel light and very soft.</li>
            <li>my son reccommended this to me and it is exactly the right product for my hair.</li>
            <li>I can see shining effect right after the first use.</li>
            <li>Not as half good as the one I used in China..</li>
            <li>This leave my hair feeling soft, tangle-free, and strong.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair so soft and easy to brush</li>
            <li>By far my absolute favorite shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Great smell and a little goes a long way bi love the way my hair feels.</li>
            <li>makes your hair very soft, tangle free and manageable.</li>
            <li>Leaves it feeling very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>and it makes my hair smooth, soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>I have tried many shampoos here in America, I think its too  chemically strong and damage my hair like a steel wool,unlike Japanese shampoo it leaves my hair soft and bouncy..</li>
            <li>Shipping is fast too!</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was my skincare products, so I stopped using them to see if my skin would improve.</li>
            <li>And it really does bring out the shine!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone willing to spend in this price-point.</li>
            <li>Only 4 stars because she was hoping for more volume</li>
            <li>and I just used it again for the first time in about 7 years</li>
            <li>The smell is nice, makes no real difference in your hair though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more the next time.</li>
            <li>This is the best, first message scalp with water and only apply a small amount, like 1 TBLE spoon each and just message in and rinse.</li>
            <li>I normally love Shiseido hair products but this one is a bit different.</li>
            <li>There are much better shampoos out there for the same price or cheaper.</li>
            <li>I have to use the two conditioner products because the Tsubaki does not work well enough for static.</li>
            <li>My friend said that my hair was the first thing he noticed when he saw me.</li>
            <li>I noticed the difference in my hair upon the first use.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair really soft and free of frizz.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo rinses cleanly and the conditioner made my coarse-but-fine hair very soft and touchable.  </li>
            <li>After using this duo, I can&#x27;t say that my hair is significantly shinier, nor can I say that my hair feels soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used the conditioner so far, but it is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my girlfriend&#x27;s hair feeling clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>The price on these two (they are a better price if bought as a set) is really reasonable and I have already purchased my next two bottles.  </li>
            <li>I live in the Phoenix area, and keeping hair moisturized here is problematic even in winter especially since I don&#x27;t do any special treatments for my hair (it is super dry and very hot most times).</li>
            <li>I bought this duo because I heard that it makes hair very shiny (&amp;#34;halo-like&amp;#34;) and that it tends to improve its texture.</li>
            <li>the product itself has a pleasant smell that&#x27;s a bit hard to describe, but isn&#x27;t at all overpowering.</li>
            <li>I have virgin hair (no color, perm, etc), and most shampoos dry my hair out a lot.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair super soft and shiney</li>
            <li>My hair always got dry at the ends, but now it looks healthy all the way through.</li>
            <li>Overall, I definitely recommend these to anybody out there who is looking for that shampoo/conditioner to fall in love with!</li>
            <li>If you have bleached hair like me, Tsubaki conditioners from Shiseido are the only thing that will make your hair silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>My hair always is silky smooth the next day.</li>
            <li>Does make my hair shiny and very moisturized</li>
            <li>It really hydrates my hair well without making it oily, leaving my hair shiny and silky.</li>
            <li>Really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t really notice any added shine to my hair, it&#x27;s a reasonably priced shampoo and conditioner set.</li>
            <li>My hair is very processed as well.</li>
            <li>This duo really smooths my hair and adds shine.</li>
            <li>Plus it make my hair very shiny.</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li>The shipment was fast, it arrived with</li>
            <li>but I find it is isn&#x27;t very moisturizing for my type hair.  </li>
            <li>I don;t understand how my girlfriend could like this bottle so much.</li>
            <li>A very generous&lt;br /&gt;size</li>
            <li>Left my hair smooth and shinny.</li>
            <li>Besides the quality of the product, packaging is very convenient.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very noticeable when she pumps some on it in the morning.</li>
            <li>Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t have a smell.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really hold a curl or have much body.  </li>
            <li>Hair is nice, shiny and moisturized which was noticed by few hair stylists I went to this year.  </li>
            <li>my hair is soft and shiny!!!</li>
            <li>This shampoo is fine but it kind of makes my hair feel a little dry.  </li>
            <li>I had trouble figuring out if this was just as great on my hair type which is: Blonde, curly, and normal thickness (I&#x27;m caucasian).</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to anyone who wants to improve their hair quality.</li>
            <li>If your hair is fine, it would probably weigh it down but for my thick, dry hair it is so perfect!  </li>
            <li>To use occasionally it works great but as far as everyday I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li>I replaced my Suave Natural Infusion Awapuhi Anti-Breakage Shampoo &amp; Conditioner with the new Shiseido set and noticed a difference right away.  </li>
            <li>However, since I currently live in a climate that isn&#x27;t very humid, my hair probably wouldn&#x27;t be prone to expansion</li>
            <li>I wish I could say it worked well for my hair, but the feeling that the shampoo is simply placing gunk on my hair vs. actually cleaning it means I&#x27;m still on the look-out for a better hair care product.</li>
            <li>Left my hair smooth and soft, and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Okay, so I actually brought this product for my husband, who is Japanese.</li>
            <li>I had to use high end salon brands for whatever reason to get my desired bouncy, shiny hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>After first use my hair was super soft and gave me crazy volume, smells good too.</li>
            <li>My first 2 weeks of using it and so far my hair feels soft.</li>
            <li>American products just aren&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li>You really only need to use a small amount of each to get good coverage.</li>
            <li>It also gets dried out to where it feels like straw by most shampoos and conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>The fragrance is like exotic flowers but is not overpowering and you only notice a hint of smell once your hair is dry.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is going to a friend with a super dry scalp.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very soft, shiny and the frizz</li>
            <li>After that first month, however, I noticed that my skin was starting to react and my scalp began feeling itchy.</li>
            <li>I tried this product for the first time last night.  </li>
            <li>But the shampoo does jsut enough to makes my hair soft, straight and manageable!</li>
            <li>But to be honest it&#x27;s pretty mediocre.</li>
            <li>Even though it provided such promising results when I first started using it, I have to stop using the rest of the product because it caused my skin to break out and turn red.</li>
            <li>This shampoo allowed my long, tangled hair to be brushed very easily while when letting it air dry doesn&#x27;t take out the waves in my hair.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very soft, it&#x27;s not too heavy and the smell is EXTREMELY light -</li>
            <li>and now with using for 2 weeks, washing only every other day, I have shine, a normal weight and light waves,</li>
            <li>/&gt;Except for Pureology all other products that I have tried usually had a wonderful conditioner, but a shampoo that would leave my hair feeling dried out or &amp;#34;fried&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>and my hair is shining, moisturewise it could be a little better, but I will definitely repurchase it.</li>
            <li>I like that the shampoo isn&#x27;t super foamy or sudsy like some other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Make the hair soft and straight, I&#x27;m Asian, by the way.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and shiny after I used them.</li>
            <li>I would caution anyone with sensitive skin to avoid this product.</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and sleek to the touch</li>
            <li>make my hair shine and soft.</li>
            <li>Makes hair feel soft and look shiny.</li>
            <li>The shampoo cleanses without drying out your hair, and the conditioner made my hair really soft.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like any natural product, i.e flowers or something, but it smells natural.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>Shieseido has so far blown them all away.</li>
            <li>I wash my hair every day and I used to buy hair products regularly and very often,</li>
            <li>Twenty year old here-</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t curl like it naturally does</li>
            <li>It even helps keep it soft after drying.</li>
            <li>My mother who has straight hair that stays short and is dyed, loves this set too.</li>
            <li>First of all, the smell of fresh sweet apples is heavenly - not chemically or fake at all...</li>
            <li>This product is actually made in Japan so, that explains the high quality!  </li>
            <li>My hair immediately felt soft and looked shiny.</li>
            <li>My Japanese wife really likes this stuff.</li>
            <li>While I was in Tokyo I used Shiseido shampoo that the hotel offers its guests.</li>
            <li>I was surprised I can have it through Amazon..</li>
            <li>I was using Nexxus prior to trying this one and while I really had no problems with Nexxus</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner leave my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>However, maybe TOO soft.  </li>
            <li>My hair is thick and this shampoo worked magic on making it silky soft.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just your average shampoo/conditioner that does the job, but nothing extraordinary.</li>
            <li>My hair would usually get oily a day after washing, but since I&#x27;ve started using this, I&#x27;ve been able to go a couple days without (I still shower daily, mind you).</li>
            <li>it also doesn&#x27;t become super greasy the day after either, like with my previous shampoo.</li>
            <li>Try this if you want long straight hairstyle.</li>
            <li>It smells like a freshly cut green apple with a hint of a soft floral note.  </li>
            <li>This left my hair smooth and shiny, but less than 8 hours later my scalp was so oily!</li>
            <li>I recently went from hair that had to be washed everyday to a more dry scalp</li>
            <li>I have really long strawberry blonde hair and since using this combo I have noticed that it has really enhanced my hairs&#x27; shine.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner is not really soften my hair that much .</li>
            <li>After only one or two washes, my hair is soft, shiny, and fuller.</li>
            <li>barely any hair loss.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is quite mild but still not enough for everyday use.</li>
            <li>My hair is super thick and naturally wavy.</li>
            <li>I have read other reviews where they say it made their hair very greasy</li>
            <li>Things either make it dried out and straight or don&#x27;t let it shine naturally.</li>
            <li>My hair is normally thick and pretty frizzy, but this product helped smooth it out and tame the frizz.</li>
            <li>The smell first reminded me a little bit of the chemical used during perming but that may be because my hair was permed using shiseido products and the shampoo</li>
            <li>I live in a very dry climate.  </li>
            <li>It tends to get oily fast, but this combination doesn&#x27;t make it oily or weigh it down.</li>
            <li>Had high hopes for this combo due to all the rave reviews and hype.</li>
            <li>I have very long, thick, fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have used the Shiseido skin care line in the past and like the products very much.</li>

            <li> have tried many shampoos and conditioners before, most of them being luxury products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Glad I found this, and I will probably be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> It also smells sophisticated and not too fruity.</li>
            <li> The scent is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I wanted a shampoo that would make my hair look &amp; smell nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I used to buy tea tree shampoo but the Shiseido shampoo that uses camellia flowers is much better for the hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> And it does make my hair look refreshed and healthy.</li>
            <li> I also love the fragrance and the pump dispensers.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I love the shampoo.</li>
            <li> The smell is great; it just requires more to get a good lather, especially with thicker hair.</li>
            <li> I love these Shiseido shampoo and conditioner as much as I love their skin care products.</li>
            <li> More importantly, they effectively alleviate the dryness of chemically treated hair.</li>
            <li> i Wish it REALLY gave a shine!!!!</li>
            <li> My hair has no frizz and is smooth and very easy to manage.  </li>
            <li> The products smell wonderful and the conditioner is rich and leaves your hair silky soft and easy to style.</li>
            <li> or it does as it promises, but it smells super nice.</li>
            <li> Allows it to dry very beautiful and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> and it really makes hair clean, shine and the conditioner is great.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t honestly say this is better than the ( higher quality) stuff I can get at the drug store.</li>
            <li> Somehow, the conditioner from this set is able to smooth it all out without even brushing.</li>
            <li> other reviewers point out, the product smells great!</li>

            <li> Overall very nice, keeps my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> It smells great, but I&#x27;ll probably try out some of the other brand&#x27;s sets to see if I like it better.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s very important because they pretty spendy.  </li>
            <li> Has a very pleasant smell and so far has not dried out my hair</li>
            <li> I then let my hair dry and the next morning my hair smells great and looks great.</li>
            <li> But if you have long, straight hair, this would be great for you!</li>

            <li> I got these as a Christmas present from my boyfriend and this is the best shampoo/conditioner I have used in my entire life.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mildly color treated.</li>
            <li> its far better than some costly shampoos available in the market.</li>
            <li> Anyway, the company was quick to respond and handle my problem.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the Japanese version of this product and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> Shiseido Tsubaki leaves my hair super shiny and silky.</li>
            <li> Used twice already hair feel smooth love it so far</li>
            <li> The incremental results do not earn a repurchase from me, especially when there are many shampoos out there which have provided better results.</li>
            <li> Leave my hair so soft, very easy to brush and anti frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;Cant</li>
            <li> say my hair shine is so visible but happy with the result.&lt;br /&gt;Smell is not so heavy, its flower smell and clean</li>
            <li> The shampoo is good too, but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s any better than what I was using before.</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to try this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> It cleans my fine hair and leaves it very shiny.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and easily weighted down by product, and gets greasy at the scalp pretty easily.</li>
            <li> I have very think hair and it makes my hair really smooth</li>
            <li> The size is HUGE and the pump dispenser is really convenient.  </li>
            <li> It seemed like the perfect shampoo for thick, straight hair.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair shiny, smooth and it feels so soft and light.</li>
            <li> definitely worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I will probably continue to use the conditioner but not the shampoo just because I rarely need to shampoo.</li>
            <li> I think this shampoo and conditioner would be really nice for someone with coarse curly hair.</li>
            <li> Feels gentler than most shampoos and leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Sure, it&#x27;s tangle-free and smooth right out of the shower, but the silkiness last for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Of course, shipped prime and got the product right on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that tends to get greasy (I live in a tropical climate too).</li>
            <li> my expectation for the set right on the mark the shampoo and coditioner makes my hair feel light and very soft.</li>
            <li> my son reccommended this to me and it is exactly the right product for my hair.</li>
            <li> I can see shining effect right after the first use.</li>
            <li> Not as half good as the one I used in China..</li>
            <li> This leave my hair feeling soft, tangle-free, and strong.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair so soft and easy to brush</li>
            <li> By far my absolute favorite shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Great smell and a little goes a long way bi love the way my hair feels.</li>
            <li> makes your hair very soft, tangle free and manageable.</li>
            <li> Leaves it feeling very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> and it makes my hair smooth, soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> I have tried many shampoos here in America, I think its too  chemically strong and damage my hair like a steel wool,unlike Japanese shampoo it leaves my hair soft and bouncy..</li>
            <li> Shipping is fast too!</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was my skincare products, so I stopped using them to see if my skin would improve.</li>
            <li> And it really does bring out the shine!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone willing to spend in this price-point.</li>
            <li> Only 4 stars because she was hoping for more volume</li>
            <li> and I just used it again for the first time in about 7 years</li>
            <li> The smell is nice, makes no real difference in your hair though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying more the next time.</li>
            <li> This is the best, first message scalp with water and only apply a small amount, like 1 TBLE spoon each and just message in and rinse.</li>
            <li> I normally love Shiseido hair products but this one is a bit different.</li>
            <li> There are much better shampoos out there for the same price or cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have to use the two conditioner products because the Tsubaki does not work well enough for static.</li>
            <li> My friend said that my hair was the first thing he noticed when he saw me.</li>
            <li> I noticed the difference in my hair upon the first use.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair really soft and free of frizz.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo rinses cleanly and the conditioner made my coarse-but-fine hair very soft and touchable.  </li>
            <li> After using this duo, I can&#x27;t say that my hair is significantly shinier, nor can I say that my hair feels soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the conditioner so far, but it is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my girlfriend&#x27;s hair feeling clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> The price on these two (they are a better price if bought as a set) is really reasonable and I have already purchased my next two bottles.  </li>
            <li> I live in the Phoenix area, and keeping hair moisturized here is problematic even in winter especially since I don&#x27;t do any special treatments for my hair (it is super dry and very hot most times).</li>
            <li> I bought this duo because I heard that it makes hair very shiny (&amp;#34;halo-like&amp;#34;) and that it tends to improve its texture.</li>
            <li> the product itself has a pleasant smell that&#x27;s a bit hard to describe, but isn&#x27;t at all overpowering.</li>
            <li> I have virgin hair (no color, perm, etc), and most shampoos dry my hair out a lot.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair super soft and shiney</li>
            <li> My hair always got dry at the ends, but now it looks healthy all the way through.</li>
            <li> Overall, I definitely recommend these to anybody out there who is looking for that shampoo/conditioner to fall in love with!</li>
            <li> If you have bleached hair like me, Tsubaki conditioners from Shiseido are the only thing that will make your hair silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My hair always is silky smooth the next day.</li>
            <li> Does make my hair shiny and very moisturized</li>
            <li> It really hydrates my hair well without making it oily, leaving my hair shiny and silky.</li>
            <li> Really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t really notice any added shine to my hair, it&#x27;s a reasonably priced shampoo and conditioner set.</li>
            <li> My hair is very processed as well.</li>
            <li> This duo really smooths my hair and adds shine.</li>
            <li> Plus it make my hair very shiny.</li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.</li>
            <li> The shipment was fast, it arrived with</li>
            <li> but I find it is isn&#x27;t very moisturizing for my type hair.  </li>
            <li> I don;t understand how my girlfriend could like this bottle so much.</li>
            <li> A very generous&lt;br /&gt;size</li>
            <li> Left my hair smooth and shinny.</li>
            <li> Besides the quality of the product, packaging is very convenient.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very noticeable when she pumps some on it in the morning.</li>
            <li> Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t have a smell.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really hold a curl or have much body.  </li>
            <li> Hair is nice, shiny and moisturized which was noticed by few hair stylists I went to this year.  </li>
            <li> my hair is soft and shiny!!!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is fine but it kind of makes my hair feel a little dry.  </li>
            <li> I had trouble figuring out if this was just as great on my hair type which is: Blonde, curly, and normal thickness (I&#x27;m caucasian).</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to anyone who wants to improve their hair quality.</li>
            <li> If your hair is fine, it would probably weigh it down but for my thick, dry hair it is so perfect!  </li>
            <li> To use occasionally it works great but as far as everyday I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I replaced my Suave Natural Infusion Awapuhi Anti-Breakage Shampoo &amp; Conditioner with the new Shiseido set and noticed a difference right away.  </li>
            <li> However, since I currently live in a climate that isn&#x27;t very humid, my hair probably wouldn&#x27;t be prone to expansion</li>
            <li> I wish I could say it worked well for my hair, but the feeling that the shampoo is simply placing gunk on my hair vs. actually cleaning it means I&#x27;m still on the look-out for a better hair care product.</li>
            <li> Left my hair smooth and soft, and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I actually brought this product for my husband, who is Japanese.</li>
            <li> I had to use high end salon brands for whatever reason to get my desired bouncy, shiny hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> After first use my hair was super soft and gave me crazy volume, smells good too.</li>
            <li> My first 2 weeks of using it and so far my hair feels soft.</li>
            <li> American products just aren&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li> You really only need to use a small amount of each to get good coverage.</li>
            <li> It also gets dried out to where it feels like straw by most shampoos and conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The fragrance is like exotic flowers but is not overpowering and you only notice a hint of smell once your hair is dry.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is going to a friend with a super dry scalp.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair very soft, shiny and the frizz</li>
            <li> After that first month, however, I noticed that my skin was starting to react and my scalp began feeling itchy.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for the first time last night.  </li>
            <li> But the shampoo does jsut enough to makes my hair soft, straight and manageable!</li>
            <li> But to be honest it&#x27;s pretty mediocre.</li>
            <li> Even though it provided such promising results when I first started using it, I have to stop using the rest of the product because it caused my skin to break out and turn red.</li>
            <li> This shampoo allowed my long, tangled hair to be brushed very easily while when letting it air dry doesn&#x27;t take out the waves in my hair.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair very soft, it&#x27;s not too heavy and the smell is EXTREMELY light -</li>
            <li> and now with using for 2 weeks, washing only every other day, I have shine, a normal weight and light waves,</li>
            <li> /&gt;Except for Pureology all other products that I have tried usually had a wonderful conditioner, but a shampoo that would leave my hair feeling dried out or &amp;#34;fried&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> and my hair is shining, moisturewise it could be a little better, but I will definitely repurchase it.</li>
            <li> I like that the shampoo isn&#x27;t super foamy or sudsy like some other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Make the hair soft and straight, I&#x27;m Asian, by the way.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and shiny after I used them.</li>
            <li> I would caution anyone with sensitive skin to avoid this product.</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and sleek to the touch</li>
            <li> make my hair shine and soft.</li>
            <li> Makes hair feel soft and look shiny.</li>
            <li> The shampoo cleanses without drying out your hair, and the conditioner made my hair really soft.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like any natural product, i.e flowers or something, but it smells natural.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> Shieseido has so far blown them all away.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every day and I used to buy hair products regularly and very often,</li>
            <li> Twenty year old here-</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t curl like it naturally does</li>
            <li> It even helps keep it soft after drying.</li>
            <li> My mother who has straight hair that stays short and is dyed, loves this set too.</li>
            <li> First of all, the smell of fresh sweet apples is heavenly - not chemically or fake at all...</li>
            <li> This product is actually made in Japan so, that explains the high quality!  </li>
            <li> My hair immediately felt soft and looked shiny.</li>
            <li> My Japanese wife really likes this stuff.</li>
            <li> While I was in Tokyo I used Shiseido shampoo that the hotel offers its guests.</li>
            <li> I was surprised I can have it through Amazon..</li>
            <li> I was using Nexxus prior to trying this one and while I really had no problems with Nexxus</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner leave my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> However, maybe TOO soft.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick and this shampoo worked magic on making it silky soft.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just your average shampoo/conditioner that does the job, but nothing extraordinary.</li>
            <li> My hair would usually get oily a day after washing, but since I&#x27;ve started using this, I&#x27;ve been able to go a couple days without (I still shower daily, mind you).</li>
            <li> it also doesn&#x27;t become super greasy the day after either, like with my previous shampoo.</li>
            <li> Try this if you want long straight hairstyle.</li>
            <li> It smells like a freshly cut green apple with a hint of a soft floral note.  </li>
            <li> This left my hair smooth and shiny, but less than 8 hours later my scalp was so oily!</li>
            <li> I recently went from hair that had to be washed everyday to a more dry scalp</li>
            <li> I have really long strawberry blonde hair and since using this combo I have noticed that it has really enhanced my hairs&#x27; shine.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner is not really soften my hair that much .</li>
            <li> After only one or two washes, my hair is soft, shiny, and fuller.</li>
            <li> barely any hair loss.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is quite mild but still not enough for everyday use.</li>
            <li> My hair is super thick and naturally wavy.</li>
            <li> I have read other reviews where they say it made their hair very greasy</li>
            <li> Things either make it dried out and straight or don&#x27;t let it shine naturally.</li>
            <li> My hair is normally thick and pretty frizzy, but this product helped smooth it out and tame the frizz.</li>
            <li> The smell first reminded me a little bit of the chemical used during perming but that may be because my hair was permed using shiseido products and the shampoo</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate.  </li>
            <li> It tends to get oily fast, but this combination doesn&#x27;t make it oily or weigh it down.</li>
            <li> Had high hopes for this combo due to all the rave reviews and hype.</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick, fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have used the Shiseido skin care line in the past and like the products very much.</li>
            <li> This combo leaves my fine straight hair feeling dirty and greasy, and underneath it all, after 4 weeks of use, my hair is still is dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> First I wanna start off by saying that I have thick, coarse Asian hair that has been permed.</li>
            <li> Be aware the product is made in Japan and the label is printed in Japanese, but how hard is to figure out how to use shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> On average, I would say that in total I used to spent the same amount on buying regular shampoos at the drug stores, it was just spread over time because I was buying frequently.</li>
            <li> I flat iron my hair every day</li>
            <li> just makes my hair too flat?</li>
            <li> Made a noticeable difference for my long, Asian hair!</li>
            <li> I actually like for a long time</li>
            <li> My Chinese daughter uses these products on her long hair.</li>
            <li> I have long naturally blonde hair and do get highlights and platinum coloring every 2 months, plus hair treatments.</li>
            <li> I am Asian, with coarse thick hair that is naturally straight.</li>
            <li> I had really dry blonde hair</li>
            <li> Only for a couple of hours , and then afterwards it makes your hair look dehydrated, and dry.</li>
            <li> We both have a lot of coarse, thick hair and this shampoo and conditioner really make it lay smoother.</li>
            <li> My hair is now soft and bouncy and I get complements all the time (for half the price!).</li>
            <li> The Shiseido Tsubaki Shining shampoo &amp; conditioner is helping my long, med.brown, dry, brittle, &amp; damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> once I alternate with other shampoos.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for a long time and my hair loves me for it!  </li>
            <li> and btw I let hair air dry,</li>
            <li> Make hair really dry.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry and can get frizzy and this suits it so well.  </li>
            <li> Though my hair does not look dry, it feels dry when I touch it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle enough for my hair that it doesn&#x27;t seem weighted down, doesn&#x27;t get dried out even a little bit, and it even takes longer to notice my hair get greasy in between washes.</li>
            <li> Its Ok but no better or worse than all the other shampoos.</li>
            <li> I have thick, normal a hair with slightly dry ends for reference.</li>
            <li> I have a dry and itchy scalp and once I used this shampoo and conditioner combo, my scalp isn&#x27;t as itchy and dry anymore!</li>
            <li> I have blonde highlights on dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> hey if pureology works stick with it!&amp;#34; and that is true, but DANG its expensive product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also live in an area with hard water.</li>
            <li> in all, I would rate the quality of this shampoo as being slightly under Pureology, but above the rest that I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair was very dry after a color process at the salon.</li>
            <li> But while you take a shower and when u brush ur hair it feels like u didn&#x27;t use conditioner, hair was a big mess</li>
            <li> It also lasts a long time due to the size of the bottles.</li>
            <li> For the price , I&#x27;m not really recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled for 15 years to find a shampoo/conditioner set that doesn&#x27;t either weigh it down or dry it out.</li>
            <li> my hair has a shine to it and it feels less dry.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> FYI, a little of each (shampoo and/or conditioner) goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have long, dirty blonde, curly hair, that&#x27;s really thin but looks very full to people.</li>
            <li> : there are two versions of this product - one is made in Japan, the other is made in USA.</li>
            <li> Not sure how the American product differs, but this one works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had issues with other hair products causing my skin to breakout.</li>
            <li> If compared to American drugstore shampoos, it does no better.</li>
            <li> It started to dry out my scalp and turn my hair color a little bit of an ashy gray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I blow dry everyday.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and in tact.. just not right for my hair</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve found that the shampoo leaves my hair feeling weighed down.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair shiny and conditioned without weighing it down or making it greasy.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;d either weigh it down, or make it frizzy.</li>
            <li> Have not experienced any drying like other reviews have noted but I also only wash my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been much, much less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have also seen less hair falling out in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Like, seriously- the tangles are brushed through unless I get a knot while sleeping.</li>
            <li> company also produces refill packages for the pump bottle dispensers which cuts down on packaging and waste.</li>
            <li> Maybe my hair won&#x27;t have such a hard time growing now that it isn&#x27;t getting dried out!</li>
            <li> Tresseme, garnier, pantene, and other drug store brands often made it limp and lifeless (sometimes even greasy!).</li>
            <li> I appreciate that little gesture.</li>
            <li> (I usually wash my hair every day but sometimes every other day).</li>
            <li> I found my hair to feel a little too heavy after using it often.  </li>
            <li> has went down a lot!</li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly, color treated, and coarse hair that ALWAYS requires an additional smoothing or styling product.  </li>
            <li> I used to use Redken shampoo, but that got to be far too expensive.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not got a heavy, tacky fragrance.</li>
            <li> Will use once in a while, not for everyday shampoo.</li>
            <li> After trying it out for a few weeks, it just does not measure up to its reputation.</li>
            <li> After using it for less than a week, I think it&#x27;s my HG!</li>
            <li> my quest to find something similar but less expensive</li>
            <li> Works well for color treated thin dry hair.</li>
            <li> I usually leave the conditioner in while I wash my body,</li>
            <li> I usually switch shampoo every shampoo</li>
            <li> , I usually use just the shampoo then a bit of conditioner just on the ends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure what and how all the features benefit my hair</li>
            <li> I usually go for the off the beaten track shampoo&#x27;s and have had some real losers</li>
            <li> i have hair that&#x27;s been bleached to hell in the past and is slowly recovering and soon after i started using this, i noticed my hair became noticeably softer and easier to manage.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see the package lying at the door in such terrible weather.</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy, frizzy hair, and nothing has ever made my hair as manageable as this duo.</li>
            <li> I have been on a mission to find a shampoo/conditioner combo that will work well with my wavy thick course hair without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Conditioner works equally well, and left my hair feeling insanely</li>
            <li> I try to wash my hair only three to four times a week to prolong my color and avoid damage, with this shampoo that was impossible.</li>
            <li> It has harsh chemicals in this shampoo, just stop using and wasting money on expensive shampoos and go look for something organic.</li>
            <li> I wanted to see how Shiseido would work on my thin &amp; delicate</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> and the pump on the shampoo is broken.</li>
            <li> Or what is in the product that is making such a horrible skin reaction for me.</li>
            <li> I also ordered the T-Gel Dandruff Shampoo and it has a terrible smell and I am sending that one back!</li>
            <li> you can never go wrong with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> very thin liquid.</li>
            <li> wanted to verify if this product was the Japan or USA version (I am finicky like that :( ).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed by this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I hate the smell.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with the shampoo and conditioner !</li>
            <li> I can brush it without the horrible tangling of before also.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this shampoo! It works amazing! I had trouble figuring out if this was just as great on my hair type which is: Blonde, curly, and normal thickness (I&#x27;m caucasian). I was worried that it might weigh it down, but its great! I also went to a separate site to look up the ingredients. This shampoo/conditioner is SULFATE FREE!!! Which is absolutely amazing! My mother also uses it and she has thinner/curly/red hair.</li>
            <li> Great Shampoo and Conditioner! My hair is so soft and shiny after I used them.</li>
            <li> 2nd time purchase, will buy again. Nice, smooth with a beautiful smell.</li>
            <li> Works well for color treated thin dry hair. Looks thicker. Feels softer. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells good, helps dry scalp and keeps your hair smooth. I love it. My husband n kids love it too! Shipping is fast too!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is fine but it kind of makes my hair feel a little dry.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and conditioner set for almost 3 months now. Within the first month of using this product, I loved how it transformed my hair! My hair is normally thick and pretty frizzy, but this product helped smooth it out and tame the frizz. Plus I really loved how it smelled. After that first month, however, I noticed that my skin was starting to react and my scalp began feeling itchy. At first I thought it was my skincare products, so I stopped using them to see if my skin would improve. I&#x27;ve realized now that the culprit is this shampoo/conditioner. Even though it provided such promising results when I first started using it, I have to stop using the rest of the product because it caused my skin to break out and turn red. I would caution anyone with sensitive skin to avoid this product.</li>
            <li> First I wanna start off by saying that I have thick, coarse Asian hair that has been permed. I got these as a Christmas present from my boyfriend and this is the best shampoo/conditioner I have used in my entire life. I have read other reviews where they say it made their hair very greasy but I personally did not experience such thing. In fact, the tsubaki shampoo/conditioner has actually helped with controlling the amount of hair grease I have. Ever since I started using this (about two months ago) my hair has been feeling and looking very healthy. My hair feels soft and sleek to the touch and it&#x27;s been much, much less frizzy. I do have to say that my hair started to tangle more, but it&#x27;s nothing I can&#x27;t brush through. The smell first reminded me a little bit of the chemical used during perming but that may be because my hair was permed using shiseido products and the shampoo may have brought it out. It smells wonderful after I get out of the shower. I usually leave the conditioner in while I wash my body, etc and after toweling drying, I put a very tiny amount of hair oil at my ends. I then let my hair dry and the next morning my hair smells great and looks great. Overall, I definitely recommend these to anybody out there who is looking for that shampoo/conditioner to fall in love with!</li>
            <li> I had never tried this brand of shampoo and conditioner before, but love it. The product smells good, has a very attractive packaging and has left my hair shinier than it has been in a while.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  It cleans my fine hair and leaves it very shiny. Some shampoo&#x27;s irritate my neck in the shower and I don&#x27;t have issues with this product. I also like the scent.</li>
            <li> Product, price and packaging is AMAZING!!! Will reorder again and again!</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used, and that&#x27;s saying a lot. I have thick, wavy, frizzy hair, and nothing has ever made my hair as manageable as this duo. Shiseido products are all excellent, and I also use the Radiant Lifting Foundation and powder, which are also the best foundation products I have ever found. Can&#x27;t recommend these products highly enough.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo,  very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> make my hair shine and soft. Third time buying this already!</li>
            <li> makes your hair very soft, tangle free and manageable. smells nice too.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and in tact.. just not right for my hair</li>
            <li> great product and will keep on using it till they run out.</li>
            <li> Good quality and got this in time . It was a snow day I was surprised to see the package lying at the door in such terrible weather.</li>
            <li> After first use my hair was super soft and gave me crazy volume, smells good too. But while you take a shower and when u brush ur hair it feels like u didn&#x27;t use conditioner, hair was a big mess oh and btw I let hair air dry, don&#x27;t know if it makes difference</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner! I have course, wavy hair and it makes my hair smooth, soft and shiny! I flat iron my hair every day - seems to help control the damage. And it smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> Its Ok but no better or worse than all the other shampoos. I wont buy again</li>
            <li> I have very think hair and it makes my hair really smooth</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh...this shampoo and conditioner is wonderful!  My hair is thick and this shampoo worked magic on making it silky soft.  Also the fragrance is light and smells so good.  It&#x27;s not a fruity fragrance but it&#x27;s a nice light smell.  This is my #1 shampoo and conditioner from now on.</li>
            <li> I used to use Redken shampoo, but that got to be far too expensive. These are amazing, they make my hair incredibly shiny and soft, and the smell is lovely - almost like apple blossoms?</li>
            <li> Great smell and a little goes a long way bi love the way my hair feels. I have Japanese blood so maybe that&#x27;s why is product works so well for me?</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick, fine hair. It&#x27;s mildly color treated. I&#x27;ve struggled for 15 years to find a shampoo/conditioner set that doesn&#x27;t either weigh it down or dry it out. I have had to alternate brands to avoid those things. Salon and drugstore brands all had the same problems. I tried Tsubaki shining on a whim after reading reviews and I AM THRILLED!!! The shampoo and conditioner set can be used together without stealing volume or drying out my locks! My hair doesn&#x27;t collect residue from this product and it&#x27;s not got a heavy, tacky fragrance. And it really does bring out the shine!</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo, the conditioner I think just makes my hair too flat? But the shampoo does jsut enough to makes my hair soft, straight and manageable!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product after reading some great reviews on Amazon and a couple of beauty review sites. It seemed like the perfect shampoo for thick, straight hair. However, I&#x27;ve found that the shampoo leaves my hair feeling weighed down. It feels as if something has been caked onto my hair and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The upside to this is that my hair does not expand and get poufy, which it has the tendency to do on its own. However, since I currently live in a climate that isn&#x27;t very humid, my hair probably wouldn&#x27;t be prone to expansion anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers point out, the product smells great! I wish I could say it worked well for my hair, but the feeling that the shampoo is simply placing gunk on my hair vs. actually cleaning it means I&#x27;m still on the look-out for a better hair care product.</li>
            <li> If you have bleached hair like me, Tsubaki conditioners from Shiseido are the only thing that will make your hair silky and smooth. Wonderful fragrance and texture. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with the shampoo and conditioner ! Not as half good as the one I used in China..</li>
            <li> Ever since I went to Taiwan to visit my family about a year ago I fell in love with this shampoo and conditioner. My hair always is silky smooth the next day.</li>
            <li> Make hair really dry. The conditioner is not really soften my hair that much . For the price , I&#x27;m not really recommend</li>
            <li> Run of the mill shampoo, pleasant scent and moisturizing, just nothing exceptional</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It leaves my hair very soft, it&#x27;s not too heavy and the smell is EXTREMELY light - which I adore.  I cannot stand shampoos and conditioners that reek of perfume.  I also like the pump.  I am a very pleased customer!</li>
            <li> Does make my hair shiny and very moisturized</li>
            <li> Great smell and perfect shine</li>
            <li> This is good for me,It s that I hope,my hair feel so good,beatiful,good smaller</li>
            <li> smells great, enhances shine and softness. great value for the quality and quantity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the conditioner so far, but it is amazing.  It really hydrates my hair well without making it oily, leaving my hair shiny and silky.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner, if I had not seen this on Amazon I would of not purchased a lot for the money and it really makes hair clean, shine and the conditioner is great.</li>
            <li> Wish it was cheaper, but great shampoo!</li>
            <li> love it.all I use.. Thank u...</li>
            <li> Made a noticeable difference for my long, Asian hair! I have virgin hair (no color, perm, etc), and most shampoos dry my hair out a lot. This leave my hair feeling soft, tangle-free, and strong. Brushing/Combing my hair has never been so easy. Happy and impressed with the difference this shampoo/conditioner combo has made for me :)</li>
            <li> it moisturizes our hair thats true. its far better than some costly shampoos available in the market. But i don&#x27;t felt it like an excellent one because an itchy scalp problem is there after using this one .Its not a problem if we don&#x27;t mind it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo make my hair very smooth. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Really like this shampoo. Read an article about at Huff Post, took a chance, and ordered it. Be aware the product is made in Japan and the label is printed in Japanese, but how hard is to figure out how to use shampoo and conditioner. It perhaps a bit too nice smell for a guy :)  but what the heck. Hair feels healthy, full, and smooth.</li>
            <li> I always have this set in my guest bath and it get s used.  The products smell wonderful and the conditioner is rich and leaves your hair silky soft and easy to style.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this set for about 2 months now. While I don&#x27;t really notice any added shine to my hair, it&#x27;s a reasonably priced shampoo and conditioner set. It smells great, but I&#x27;ll probably try out some of the other brand&#x27;s sets to see if I like it better.</li>
            <li> If u Asian! U will love this shampoo</li>
            <li> Great for Asian hair ! Leaves it feeling very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Makes hair silky and smooth.  Has a great smell!!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner set. I am growing out my hair and wanted to keep my hair healthy through the process. I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.  It leaves my hair shiny and conditioned without weighing it down or making it greasy.  I usually switch shampoo every shampoo but with this one, I&#x27;ve been using for like 2 weeks straight and its still awesome.  I love all things Shiseido.</li>
            <li> Love it💗💗💗💗... And they gave me sample</li>
            <li> I got this because of the rad reviews on here. But to be honest it&#x27;s pretty mediocre. It&#x27;s just your average shampoo/conditioner that does the job, but nothing extraordinary. I have color treated hair, so I need something way more moisturizing. The shampoo was too drying and the conditioner was meh. I just think considering the price, it would do more. But hey, if it works for you, go for it.</li>
            <li> I replaced my Suave Natural Infusion Awapuhi Anti-Breakage Shampoo &amp; Conditioner with the new Shiseido set and noticed a difference right away.  With the Suave I had to also use a detangling spray prior to combing out my hair because of the knots at the ends.  This product deletes the need of a detangler.  I have semi-fine shoulder length color treated hair and only need to use 1 pump of shampoo and conditioner. The fragrance is like exotic flowers but is not overpowering and you only notice a hint of smell once your hair is dry. I would recommend this product to anyone willing to spend in this price-point.</li>
            <li> very great hair care product</li>
            <li> My Asian hair often responds not too well to American products. Tresseme, garnier, pantene, and other drug store brands often made it limp and lifeless (sometimes even greasy!). I had to use high end salon brands for whatever reason to get my desired bouncy, shiny hair. My hair is very processed as well. Howevever, Tsubaki Shining restored luster and shine. My hair is now soft and bouncy and I get complements all the time (for half the price!). I&#x27;m a happy customer.</li>
            <li> I use Shiseido Tsubaki Shining - Shampoo and Conditioner (550ml) along with Shiseido Tsubaki Damage Care Hair Mask with Tsubaki Amino - 180 gram jar twice a week.  My hair has no frizz and is smooth and very easy to manage.  I have also seen less hair falling out in the shower.  The fragrance is sweet and clean and the bottle size is generous.</li>
            <li> Leaves my girlfriend&#x27;s hair feeling clean and soft.  Has a nice shine to it too.  Only 4 stars because she was hoping for more volume and it isn&#x27;t there.</li>
            <li> Only because nothing is perfect I give it a 4 star.  Just love it. I have recommended the product to friends and family.  Makes hair feel soft and look shiny.</li>
            <li> I have blonde highlights on dark brown hair. I also live in an area with hard water. This duo really smooths my hair and adds shine. I will buy again. I also thought it was a good value for my money. I recommend.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for the first time last night.  The shampoo cleanses without drying out your hair, and the conditioner made my hair really soft.  I like that the shampoo isn&#x27;t super foamy or sudsy like some other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for a while and have not found anything better. I bought this time for my tween niece and she loves it. We both have a lot of coarse, thick hair and this shampoo and conditioner really make it lay smoother. Plus it make my hair very shiny. I saw my niece for the holiday&#x27;s and her hair looked great. Since this was a gift I sent out of state I do not know how well it was packaged. However, I did not hear any complaints form my neice.</li>
            <li> I had some issues with my order that I don&#x27;t believe were the fault of the company but rather our local post office.  Anyway, the company was quick to respond and handle my problem.  They sent out another shipment that arrived today.  I love the smell and am looking forward to washing my hair with this.</li>
            <li> I really like this. I had really dry blonde hair and it helped smooth it within 2 weeks. Will buy it again!</li>
            <li> I bought and used this brand in Japan and loved it! One of the best shampoo and conditioners I&#x27;ve ever used. I was so delighted when I found out I could get it in the states and I just used it again for the first time in about 7 years and I am not disappointed. My hair is so soft, it looks shiny and feels really good. It&#x27;s wonderful and I recommend anyone to try it because to me it&#x27;s the best</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo. I have fine hair that tends to get greasy (I live in a tropical climate too). This smells great, I usually use just the shampoo then a bit of conditioner just on the ends. Considering you get two huge bottles, it&#x27;s a great value and the sleek red bottles look great in my shower! Will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> The shipment was fast, it arrived with my order are intact or no damage. I&#x27;m happy with it! I never tried it yet, so I&#x27;m hoping this product will work on my hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is phenomenal. It leaves my hair so soft and easy to brush and it smells wonderful. The bottles are really big with nice and easy pumps as well.  I will definitely get this shampoo again.</li>
            <li> OK stuff. I usually love Shiseido products. I can&#x27;t honestly say this is better than the ( higher quality) stuff I can get at the drug store. I will use it, but I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> The Shiseido Tsubaki Shining shampoo &amp; conditioner is helping my long, med.brown, dry, brittle, &amp; damaged hair.  I was hoping it would and now with using for 2 weeks, washing only every other day, I have shine, a normal weight and light waves, no frizz. I&#x27;ve even gotten compliments. I can brush it without the horrible tangling of before also. Smells wonderful. I only wish I could read an English label, that&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to try this shampoo and conditioner. My first 2 weeks of using it and so far my hair feels soft. Only for a couple of hours , and then afterwards it makes your hair look dehydrated, and dry. It has harsh chemicals in this shampoo, just stop using and wasting money on expensive shampoos and go look for something organic. Just advice, you can do whatever you want.</li>
            <li> Great product. I usually go for the off the beaten track shampoo&#x27;s and have had some real losers but this is truly a superior combo. FYI, a little of each (shampoo and/or conditioner) goes a long way. Also, the conditioner works really great for a face shaving gel. Now, if it could only wash my car!</li>
            <li> Love the scent but I find it is isn&#x27;t very moisturizing for my type hair.  Will use once in a while, not for everyday shampoo. It does give a lot of shine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Tsubaki since I knew it (almost 10years). Try this if you want long straight hairstyle.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and not too strong. lathers up wonderfully</li>
            <li> love this product!!! makes my hair nice and soft!!</li>
            <li> This is probably some of the best shampoo/conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used! I&#x27;ll definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many shampoos and conditioners before, most of them being luxury products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From: Ojon, Molton Brown, Kerastase, Acca Kappa, and even Pureology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would rate the quality of this shampoo as being slightly under Pureology, but above the rest that I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except for Pureology all other products that I have tried usually had a wonderful conditioner, but a shampoo that would leave my hair feeling dried out or &amp;#34;fried&amp;#34;. You would think &amp;#34;well hey if pureology works stick with it!&amp;#34; and that is true, but DANG its expensive product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my quest to find something similar but less expensive I wanted to see how Shiseido would work on my thin &amp; delicate hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) product smells GREAT. It doesn&#x27;t smell like any natural product, i.e flowers or something, but it smells natural.&lt;br /&gt;2) WORKS WELL! Finally a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t fry my hair! Left my hair smooth and soft, and moisturized. Hair also smells great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conditioner works equally well, and left my hair feeling insanely soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: there are two versions of this product - one is made in Japan, the other is made in USA. I specifically wanted to try the Japanese version, and I did. Not sure how the American product differs, but this one works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I have found a set (finally!) of hair products that suit my hair and I will be buying this set from now on. Now more switching and trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to verify if this product was the Japan or USA version (I am finicky like that :( ). Sent the seller and email at 10pm, and they replied an hour later! Thats great customer service!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, shipped prime and got the product right on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final rating: EXCELLENT product from an EXCELLENT seller!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> Love it! smells great!!!</li>
            <li> I don;t understand how my girlfriend could like this bottle so much.</li>
            <li> If you are not asian this does make your hair greasy. Smells good though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo and conditioner for the last two months or so and my hair has never felt healthier. I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> tried yesterday, better than P&amp;G! shining!</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo and conditioner. It has a pleasant, light scent and it makes my hair shiny and soft. However, my usual shampoo and condition provides results pretty close to these for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> This combo leaves my fine straight hair feeling dirty and greasy, and underneath it all, after 4 weeks of use, my hair is still is dry and brittle. This product cannot be returned, so after one month of building frustration, in the trash it goes.</li>
            <li> Shiseido Shampoo and Conditioner is absolutely fabulous and&lt;br /&gt;you get a lot of &amp;#34;bang&amp;#34; for what you spend.  A very generous&lt;br /&gt;size and a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it since my time in China. The smell just make me feel so comfortable, as well as the touch of my hair after shower. Will come back for substitutes after it&#x27;s out.</li>
            <li> very thin liquid. didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I found my hair to feel a little too heavy after using it often.  I only like it once I alternate with other shampoos.</li>
            <li> I have the dryest, finest hair ever. I wake up with huge puffy nests of tangles in my hair every morning and it&#x27;s a pain in the butt to detangle. Somehow, the conditioner from this set is able to smooth it all out without even brushing. It&#x27;s amazing! The shampoo is good too, but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s any better than what I was using before. This stuff also smells really good. The scent reminds me of fresh-squeezed apple juice and flowers.</li>
            <li> my son reccommended this to me and it is exactly the right product for my hair.</li>
            <li> Mom says it is the best ever</li>
            <li> Love love love these products.  Amazing on my color treated, fine, damaged hair.  Goodbye brazilian...Hello Shiseido</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a shampoo and conditioner I actually like for a long time and I think I&#x27;ve finally found it. Makes my hair shiny, smooth and it feels so soft and light. And it smells great. Have not experienced any drying like other reviews have noted but I also only wash my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> My Chinese daughter uses these products on her long hair. Beautiful.</li>
            <li> Great products! Makes my hair super soft and shiney</li>
            <li> I love this product. I think it&#x27;s a great deal for shampoo AND conditioner. The packaging is also beautiful and the formula is great! I have a dry and itchy scalp and once I used this shampoo and conditioner combo, my scalp isn&#x27;t as itchy and dry anymore! I am definitely going to repurchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed by this shampoo and conditioner. I used it for a week, convincing myself I must be doing something wrong. This left my hair smooth and shiny, but less than 8 hours later my scalp was so oily! I try to wash my hair only three to four times a week to prolong my color and avoid damage, with this shampoo that was impossible. I have thick, normal a hair with slightly dry ends for reference. This shampoo is going to a friend with a super dry scalp. Bummed</li>
            <li> This is just too awesome!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair lovely and very silky and shiny. I&#x27;m now done with US hair care brands. Shieseido has so far blown them all away.</li>
            <li> Left my hair smooth and shinny. I will definitely recommend a re order!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been on a mission to find a shampoo/conditioner combo that will work well with my wavy thick course hair without breaking the bank. I ordered the Japanese version of this product and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. It has totally transformed my hair in only two weeks. My hair looks and feels like silk and smells fabulous. It&#x27;s a very light floral smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering. I have caught myself sniffing my hair occasionally. I hope this product will always be readily available because I&#x27;m never switching brands. I already have my second shipment of it on the way.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice, makes no real difference in your hair though.</li>
            <li> Nice product. I&#x27;ll buy this again.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo &amp; conditioner.  Makes my hair soft and clean.  Has a very pleasant smell and so far has not dried out my hair and I blow dry everyday.</li>
            <li> I tried this again - rash all over my neck and ears. Not good. I love shiseido but have to wander if this is fake? Or what is in the product that is making such a horrible skin reaction for me. I would. It suggest others to buy.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner smells are amazing. I have used many shampoos, and this is my favorite. I&#x27;m not really sure what and how all the features benefit my hair or it does as it promises, but it smells super nice.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo and conditioner for a year non-stop, and these are probably the best of anything I tried before. What I like about it is that it keeps my hair moisturized. I live in the Phoenix area, and keeping hair moisturized here is problematic even in winter especially since I don&#x27;t do any special treatments for my hair (it is super dry and very hot most times). These products are doing a nice job for me in this sense. Hair is nice, shiny and moisturized which was noticed by few hair stylists I went to this year.  Besides the quality of the product, packaging is very convenient. I wash my hair every day and I used to buy hair products regularly and very often, maybe like once every 3-4 weeks. These bottles last 3-4 month for me because they are big. On average, I would say that in total I used to spent the same amount on buying regular shampoos at the drug stores, it was just spread over time because I was buying frequently.</li>
            <li> Came here on the time and date, love the price for it too :) my expectation for the set right on the mark the shampoo and coditioner makes my hair feel light and very soft. Also makes nice and silky love it! I&#x27;ll be buying more the next time.</li>
            <li> I love this product! By far my absolute favorite shampoo and conditioner. It leaves my hair very soft, shiny and the frizz has went down a lot!</li>
            <li> Smells so nice and makes hair feel nice. Nice size for the price too</li>
            <li> very good !!! my hair is soft and shiny!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best, first message scalp with water and only apply a small amount, like 1 TBLE spoon each and just message in and rinse. Thats it, very good to use, I really like the stuff.</li>
            <li> I have crappy frizzy hair and i have used this twice already I have to say it&#x27;s the best stuff I have ever bought. definitely worth the cost. my hair has a shine to it and it feels less dry. American products just aren&#x27;t worth the money. You really only need to use a small amount of each to get good coverage. Would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner... It leaves my hair feeling silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> my niece introduced me to the products and i like it. 😊</li>
            <li> This makes my hair incredibly shiny! I will be purchasing this product again, It also has strengthened my hair. This is a good product.</li>
            <li> I normally love Shiseido hair products but this one is a bit different. To use occasionally it works great but as far as everyday I would not recommend it. It started to dry out my scalp and turn my hair color a little bit of an ashy gray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works best for dyed hair and if you have natural/virgin hair like mine I would not recommend it. There are much better shampoos out there for the same price or cheaper.</li>
            <li> Product is very good. It does what it is suppose to do. It leaves your hair clean and shiny. The packaging is so attractive that is beautiful enough to be part of your bath room décor. The shape of the bottles make them easier to hold than some bottles with the same volume.</li>
            <li> Loved the smell. Used it once and my hair is shining, moisturewise it could be a little better, but I will definitely repurchase it.</li>
            <li> Twenty year old here- loving this! I have long, dirty blonde, curly hair, that&#x27;s really thin but looks very full to people. I have been struggling to find a good shampoo after deciding to grow out my hair. Things either make it dried out and straight or don&#x27;t let it shine naturally. Since I use a lot of Japanese products I decided to venture into the shampoo they create for their hair types. This shampoo allowed my long, tangled hair to be brushed very easily while when letting it air dry doesn&#x27;t take out the waves in my hair. Like, seriously- the tangles are brushed through unless I get a knot while sleeping. It doesn&#x27;t curl like it naturally does but I love how it looks. The smell of the shampoo is just wonderful! I love to sit with my towel on my hair because it makes such a wonderful scent. I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on how shiny and clean my hair looks. It even helps keep it soft after drying. My mother who has straight hair that stays short and is dyed, loves this set too. It&#x27;s very noticeable when she pumps some on it in the morning. Allows it to dry very beautiful and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again!</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff. I&#x27;ve always struggled with shampoos and conditioners. None of them seemed to benefit my &amp;#34;Asian&amp;#34; hair. They&#x27;d either weigh it down, or make it frizzy. My hair would usually get oily a day after washing, but since I&#x27;ve started using this, I&#x27;ve been able to go a couple days without (I still shower daily, mind you). Lathers nicely on my scalp, smells incredible, and if you don&#x27;t ring out your hair before applying the conditioner, it locks in the moisture. Already bought the refill bags that come with the bonus treatment.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I actually brought this product for my husband, who is Japanese. I found out about it via a blog about hair care products. My husband loves this product and his hair looks so healthy and shiny- and this product has a great scent.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!!!!!!! My hair looks amazing great size and great price!!!!!</li>
            <li> Not a very lathery shampoo, but both the shampoo and the conditioner leave my hair soft and shiny. The conditioner is particularly good.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair feel really nice.</li>
            <li> I recently went from hair that had to be washed everyday to a more dry scalp so I thought this may help keep my hair from drying out so much because I still prefer to wash and style everyday. The shampoo is quite mild but still not enough for everyday use. I use a cleansing conditioner but it does not condition my ends well enough so I use this conditioner also. The two work well together because the Tsubaki smooths my ends really nicely without being oily. I will probably continue to use the conditioner but not the shampoo just because I rarely need to shampoo. I have to use the two conditioner products because the Tsubaki does not work well enough for static. I live in a very dry climate.  I think this shampoo and conditioner would be really nice for someone with coarse curly hair. I has a really nice softening, smoothing effect without oiliness.  Also the scent is a really nice lightly floral/apple/pear. It&#x27;s very nice, smells clean and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Leave my hair so soft, very easy to brush and anti frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;Cant say my hair shine is so visible but happy with the result.&lt;br /&gt;Smell is not so heavy, its flower smell and clean, i&#x27;ll order again when finished&lt;br /&gt;But i Wish it REALLY gave a shine!!!!</li>
            <li> really great product !! i have hair that&#x27;s been bleached to hell in the past and is slowly recovering and soon after i started using this, i noticed my hair became noticeably softer and easier to manage. it also doesn&#x27;t become super greasy the day after either, like with my previous shampoo. the product itself has a pleasant smell that&#x27;s a bit hard to describe, but isn&#x27;t at all overpowering.</li>
            <li> Great Shampoo and Conditioner.  It si definetely woth the money.  Leaves hair feeling refreshed and looking shiny.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> Shiseido Tsubaki leaves my hair super shiny and silky. I have digitally permed hair and it is perfect for my curls. It also lasts a long time due to the size of the bottles.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo ever!!!!</li>
            <li> I am noticing that this shampoo and conditioner combination is keeping my hair frizz free and shiny. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;Love it</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this set!  Feels gentler than most shampoos and leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for a long time and my hair loves me for it!  Great scent and the price is perfect for me!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even express how much I love this shampoo and conditioner!  First of all, the smell of fresh sweet apples is heavenly - not chemically or fake at all...I found myself wearing a hair mustache most of the day because I kept grabbing my hair to smell it!  The shampoo rinses cleanly and the conditioner made my coarse-but-fine hair very soft and touchable.  The price on these two (they are a better price if bought as a set) is really reasonable and I have already purchased my next two bottles.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Smell great and my hair is very smooth and shiny</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried drugstore brands, salon brands, pricey brands from mall stores, and nothing has made a difference in my coarse Asian hair. I decided to try a Japanese brand that might work on my Japanese hair, and I finally found a shampoo and conditioner that work. After only one or two washes, my hair is soft, shiny, and fuller. My friend said that my hair was the first thing he noticed when he saw me. My hair always got dry at the ends, but now it looks healthy all the way through. It tends to get oily fast, but this combination doesn&#x27;t make it oily or weigh it down. After using it for less than a week, I think it&#x27;s my HG! I&#x27;m ordering a set to send to my sister now. :)</li>
            <li> Yummy smell, and the pumps work great on these.  That&#x27;s very important because they pretty spendy.  I&#x27;ve never had a Shiseido product yet, that I didn&#x27;t love.  Glad I found this, and I will probably be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> My hair was very dry after a color process at the salon. I bought 8 products to alleviate the dryness but nothing worked. I am a big fan of Shiseido skin care products so I decided to purchase the hair products. All I can say is AMAZING RESULTS. The condition of my hair improves every time I wash my hair. I Love it!</li>
            <li> Smells good. I think I prefer the conditioner over the shampoo.</li>
            <li> These products make my hair the shiniest and softest it&#x27;s ever been.  My hair is dry and can get frizzy and this suits it so well.  If your hair is fine, it would probably weigh it down but for my thick, dry hair it is so perfect!  It also smells sophisticated and not too fruity.</li>
            <li> I noticed the difference in my hair upon the first use.  It was shinier, healthier, and had some beautiful volume!  The scent is fantastic!  It smells like a freshly cut green apple with a hint of a soft floral note.  I have very thick, curly, color treated, and coarse hair that ALWAYS requires an additional smoothing or styling product.  Not needed with this shampoo and conditioner combo!  The size is HUGE and the pump dispenser is really convenient.  I read about this product on a beauty website and decided to give it a try.  I am so glad that I did!  This product is actually made in Japan so, that explains the high quality!  Would recommend to anyone with hard-to-manage hair who loves a great quality product!!!</li>
            <li> Literally one use. One use is all it took for me to fall in love with this!! My hair immediately felt soft and looked shiny. I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> My Japanese wife really likes this stuff. She says it is made from a tree in Japan.</li>
            <li> This is great for straight hair not so much for curly</li>
            <li> While I was in Tokyo I used Shiseido shampoo that the hotel offers its guests. I wanted a shampoo that would make my hair look &amp; smell nice and smooth. This shampoo has won me over. I used to buy tea tree shampoo but the Shiseido shampoo that uses camellia flowers is much better for the hair and scalp. And it does make my hair look refreshed and healthy.</li>
            <li> Make the hair soft and straight, I&#x27;m Asian, by the way.</li>
            <li> I have tried this shampoo when I was in Japan, I like it so I ordered here in U.S..I was surprised I can have it through Amazon..I have tried many shampoos here in America, I think its too  chemically strong and damage my hair like a steel wool,unlike Japanese shampoo it leaves my hair soft and bouncy..</li>
            <li> Used twice already hair feel smooth love it so far</li>
            <li> leaves my hair smelling really nice and very soft and manageable</li>
            <li> Shiseido Tsubaki Shining Shampoo and Conditioner are really nice.  I have been using them for a while now and I have noticed some definite results.  I have really long strawberry blonde hair and since using this combo I have noticed that it has really enhanced my hairs&#x27; shine.  I was using Nexxus prior to trying this one and while I really had no problems with Nexxus, I think the Shiseido combo is working a lot better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a great scent and my hair stays clean between uses.  It lathers well and the bottle itself is rather nice with a quality pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you are looking for a great smelling shampoo and conditioner that leaves your hair looking healthy and shiny Shiseido Tsubaki Shining Shampoo and Conditioner are for you.</li>
            <li> Smells so good! I can see shining effect right after the first use.</li>
            <li> I have never had so many compliments on how shiny my hair is!</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner are excellent products. I have long naturally blonde hair and do get highlights and platinum coloring every 2 months, plus hair treatments. The shampoo and conditioner leave my hair soft and shiny. It is easier to brush through...barely any hair loss. I was amazed. I have used the Shiseido skin care line in the past and like the products very much.</li>
            <li> I officially LOVE this Tsubaki shining set! My hair is super thick and naturally wavy. These products leave my hair clean, tangle-free, shiny and (most importantly) manageable. I also love the fragrance and the pump dispensers.&lt;br /&gt; I have had issues with other hair products causing my skin to breakout. I have had no problems with breakouts while using Tsubaki... Come to think of it, my skin is clearer than ever.&lt;br /&gt;This company also produces refill packages for the pump bottle dispensers which cuts down on packaging and waste. I appreciate that little gesture.</li>
            <li> I am John&#x27;s mom Rebecca and I am the one who placed the order. It really doesn&#x27;t have a smell. I was thinking it was going to smell really good but it doesn&#x27;t and the pump on the shampoo is broken. I also ordered the T-Gel Dandruff Shampoo and it has a terrible smell and I am sending that one back! I ordered that one for my husband because he has issues with dandruff.</li>
            <li> Good product, will buy again when I run out.</li>
            <li> My hair has felt so much better after I use this!!! Smells great!!! Highly recommend to anyone who wants to improve their hair quality.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo and conditioner!! My hair is very fine and easily weighted down by product, and gets greasy at the scalp pretty easily. It also gets dried out to where it feels like straw by most shampoos and conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is so amazing! It&#x27;s gentle enough for my hair that it doesn&#x27;t seem weighted down, doesn&#x27;t get dried out even a little bit, and it even takes longer to notice my hair get greasy in between washes. (I usually wash my hair every day but sometimes every other day). Maybe my hair won&#x27;t have such a hard time growing now that it isn&#x27;t getting dried out!</li>
            <li> Had high hopes for this combo due to all the rave reviews and hype. After trying it out for a few weeks, it just does not measure up to its reputation. I am Asian, with coarse thick hair that is naturally straight. I tend to get a bit frizzy in the crown area, especially during humid days. I bought this duo because I heard that it makes hair very shiny (&amp;#34;halo-like&amp;#34;) and that it tends to improve its texture. My hair is not on the damaged side to begin with. After using this duo, I can&#x27;t say that my hair is significantly shinier, nor can I say that my hair feels soft. I do notice that my hair is calmer -my frizziness has reduced. Though my hair does not look dry, it feels dry when I touch it. It doesn&#x27;t feel silky at all. If compared to American drugstore shampoos, it does no better. The incremental results do not earn a repurchase from me, especially when there are many shampoos out there which have provided better results.</li>
            <li> Awesome awesom awesome.. Love this shampoo and conditioner.. Smells so good and I love the way my hair feels ..soft .. Shiny..healthy ..manageable</li>
            <li> you can never go wrong with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> These are very nice products...so nice my hairdresser (where they sell the expensive stuff) remarked how healthy my hair was</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner set is okay.  The smell is nice, the quality is nice, but it&#x27;s nothing exceptional when you factor in the price.  I think my Herbal Essences is actually nicer and it&#x27;s a heck of a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> I hate the smell. It&#x27;s like hot water running through rusty pipes plus small Chinese candies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner is so chemical, when I run through my hair after washing it feels like each strand has shrunk to twice its size. Sure, it&#x27;s tangle-free and smooth right out of the shower, but the silkiness last for about 5 minutes. With this shampoo + conditioner, my hair gets itchy if I don&#x27;t wash after a day. I have a feeling I damage my hair each time I use this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it to my brother.</li>
            <li> 2nd order of it. Love it!!! I have oily scalp. I do not use the condition. I love the shampoo.</li>
            <li> The smell is great; it just requires more to get a good lather, especially with thicker hair. Overall very nice, keeps my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> I love these Shiseido shampoo and conditioner as much as I love their skin care products. These products have rich texture and smells great. More importantly, they effectively alleviate the dryness of chemically treated hair.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair really soft and free of frizz.  However, maybe TOO soft.  It doesn&#x27;t really hold a curl or have much body.  But if you have long, straight hair, this would be great for you!</li>
            <li> smells nice. also gives my hair a smooth touch. absolutely great product.</li>
