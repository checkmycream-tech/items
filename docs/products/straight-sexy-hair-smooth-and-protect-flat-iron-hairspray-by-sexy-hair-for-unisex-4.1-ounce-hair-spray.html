            <li>This works AMAZING</li>
            <li>Did I mention it smells amazing?</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>Before my hair kind of smelled somewhat burned, but it doesn&#x27;t with this anymore.</li>
            <li>I honestly dont have the time..</li>
            <li>im sure its all good ..</li>
            <li>It is my own fault for buying something I hadn&#x27;t smelled online.</li>
            <li>So honestly wouldn&#x27;t suggest this if you have any bit of curl to your hair or thickness, at all.</li>
            <li>I liked this product.</li>
            <li>Has kind of a baby powder scent to it but its nice</li>
            <li>If it is not on sale where I live, I know where I can get it, this is wonderful!</li>
            <li>Great product and quick delivery.</li>
            <li>The best by far!</li>
            <li>All i can say.. this is SEXY SEXY SEXY!</li>
            <li>Works great with the flat iron.. AND smells great.</li>
            <li>very light.</li>
            <li>Many people ask me how I do my hair.</li>
            <li>I plan on ordering more soon</li>
            <li>Well this product help keep the shine in my hair along with helping it look great straight.</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>and I love SEXY (brand name) hair products.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>am glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite product.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and love the price, if you buy it in a salon its like double the price, so having on amazon is awesome</li>
            <li>the product has been discontinued in most stores.</li>
            <li>this product is just ok its what they use on my hair in the salon</li>
            <li>so i found it on here for a better price</li>
            <li>The more you wash your hair the more oil your head will produce trying to counteract you repeatedly stripping it turning the process into a cycle.</li>
            <li>so the more I have to wash it the more I have to flat-iron</li>
            <li>my hair thus resulting in even more damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am in love with this product, I use it alway</li>
            <li>I had the same results at home and it is wonderful.</li>
            <li>my daughter has very curly hair and these products work great</li>
            <li>this product is probably better for girls with extensions.</li>
            <li>I have tried the others, which mostly are non-aerosol and they would spit instead of spray</li>
            <li>SOOO GLAD Sexy Hair Concepts made theirs as an aerosol can.  </li>
            <li>These item smells wonderful and leaves my hair silky after i flat iron it.  </li>
            <li>This is the best product I have found to use with my flat iron.</li>
            <li>It would have been preferred if they explained that there was a smell to using this, which is something very important to know as many people get headaches from strong smells.</li>
            <li>It made it very easy to spray on without huge drops soaking strands.</li>
            <li>My hair seems dryer when I use this product, and it tangles more easily.</li>
            <li>I use all Sexy Hair products &amp; have been using Smooth &amp; Protect for many years now.</li>
            <li>Takes the static out during winter and keeps it frizz free during the humid summer months.  </li>
            <li>Shame on you sexy straight, my hair was anything but!!!</li>
            <li>Second, it smells so good!</li>
            <li>PERFECT for keeping my hair straight, soft, and shiny.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Not always easy to find so</li>
            <li>It is nothing special, you are better off using something else.</li>
            <li>This stuff is AMAZING, best flat iron spray on the market by far....</li>
            <li>I have caucasian fine hair so that is what I used it on,</li>
            <li>I will preface this by saying I have fine hair.</li>
            <li>A lot of hair, but fine.</li>
            <li>Fine hair shouldn&#x27;t be washed every day.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, love the product!</li>
            <li>I originally tried this product through a sample given to me from my hairdresser, and after using it just ONCE I just HAD to buy a full sized bottle!  </li>
            <li>The spray is light and really even, and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>Really protects your hair from the heat &amp; makes it nice &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>But my hair is still smooth and sleek.</li>
            <li>make my hair smooth and with the Florida humidity</li>
            <li>, it smells good and makes my hair soft as well.</li>
            <li>I have wavy frizzy hair and this product is the best I have found to smooth and tame my hair.  </li>
            <li>This product smells a-m-a-z-i-n-g and does a wonderful job at protecting your hair from flat iron damage, as well as helping your hair stay straight for days.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product because of the great reviews, but I cannot see why it got such reviews.</li>
            <li>When using this product you can apply it and use your flat iron to get a smooth finish with great hold.</li>
            <li>Smells very good, and stops most of the fizz from humidity, but it&#x27;s not a strong hold at all!</li>
            <li>This product works great and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>the best of this product is that my hair last more, i only have to iron my hair once a week</li>
            <li>I love having my hair straight</li>
            <li>This product works as it claims, and i feel confident that my hair won&#x27;t get damaged as much by using this spray before straightening it.  </li>
            <li>so I decided to get a full sized bottle.</li>
            <li>It is the best hair product I ever tried for my fine weak hair.</li>
            <li>I need a better flat iron but with just a few sprays and no pretreating, my hair feels wonderful and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>naturally so it is pretty fine</li>
            <li>smells good and keeps my hair straight and soft.  </li>
            <li>quick shipping</li>
            <li>I started using this Straight &amp; Sexy Smooth and Protect and my hair stays nearly frizz free.  </li>
            <li>It helps me to get my hair nice and straight and it still is super soft.</li>
            <li>I have many heat protections and this is by far</li>
            <li>Smells nice, sprays evenly, I flat iron</li>
            <li>I will say that this works great, but as soon as you get your hair wet, your hair will revert back to its original form, from my experience.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many flat iron sprays and this is one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>Most important  it last several days even after sleeping on my hair is was still smooth.</li>
            <li>I have very light blonde hair</li>
            <li>bring it back so it lightly covers your hair!</li>
            <li>I spray it all over my hair, but focus more on the ends to ensure extra protection against split ends.</li>
            <li>I was blown away first</li>
            <li>silky smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so much softer after i straighten it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great and inexpensive, so I recommend anyone giving it at least a try.  </li>
            <li>Thanks !  </li>
            <li>, it just makes my hair seem so much straighter, shinier, silkier (no lie!)</li>
            <li>This product helped even it out and did not scorch or burn my hair with a higher heat added to it.&lt;br /&gt;I recommended it to my sister/hair-stylist and she will give it a try</li>
            <li>No they don&#x27;t exactly stink, but it kinda reminds me of the smell of a perm.</li>
            <li>It works great for my long hair before using my flat iron.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and could never use a flat iron without burning or frizzing until my hairdresser used Straight Sexy Hair with a flat iron.</li>
            <li>I love this product to protect my hair as I flat iron it.</li>
            <li>It made my flat iron seem to work more efficiently.</li>
            <li>straight while protecting your hair from the heat at the same time i&#x27;m going to continue to buy this product :)</li>
            <li>Not only does it protect your hair from splitting due to heat, but it makes your hair smell great and not burnt.</li>
            <li>I used this on my dry hair right before I straightened it, and it definitely added shine (which is why I liked it), but I noticed that at the top of my head it caused major static and my hair would not go down, so it looked like I had just rubbed a balloon on my head....</li>
            <li>and it stays straight and smooth even the next day!  </li>
            <li>My hair stayed silky straight for 2 days despite humidity.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t even know where to start or what to say about this product; I tried it several times with many different prestyling bases (Got2Be, Chi silk serum, Sexy Hair volumizing gel, and then finally with nothing.. etc)</li>
            <li>No smoothing or shine, it actually made my flatiron GRAB my hair instead of allowing it to slide smoothly.</li>
            <li>I had ordered this assuming that unisex meant that the smell would be gender neutral but as it turned out it&#x27;s very girly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that I mind so much as the smell gives me headaches (any perfume does).</li>
            <li>otherwise It&#x27;ll be very greasy</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;ll still keep your hair straight.</li>
            <li>i really like it and would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>so i cant really rate it ...</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>but it really seems like serum in a spray form.  </li>
            <li>I lot of people mentioned that they felt the product was very protective and had some conditioning aspects.</li>
            <li>Like really?</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t use too much before having to was out some build up though.</li>
            <li>My wife as very curly hair</li>
            <li>and I had used it a few times and liked it a lot</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really keep my hair straight nor did it work better than any other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>However, a little goes a long way, definitely hold the can a good 10 or more inches from your hair when you spray it so it wont make your hair look oily</li>
            <li>Hair hold up and stays straight even in high humidity.  </li>
            <li>I live in South Louisiana, very humid.  </li>
            <li>So it takes less product to make my hair feel greasy than many others</li>
            <li>This is great because it prevents you opening a package that has become a mess due to mishandling during shipping.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It did not matter if I used just a little, or added more.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and even though I had it professionally straightened it still has a bit of curl and a lot of frizz.</li>
            <li>I have hair that needs a lot of work to look normal.</li>
            <li>Helps with frizziness and flyaways very much, but I guess it would depend on how high the humidity is in the area, especially where I live.</li>
            <li>I read the other reviews and was excited about getting this product.</li>
            <li>I used this in combination with a few other their other sexy straight products &amp; all it did was arouse some serious frustration that I spent so much on products that I CAN NOT return because I used.&lt;br /&gt;First off - this products really don&#x27;t smell the greatest.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair smooth, shiny and silky and really protects from the heat of my flat iron, all without being greasy or weighing my hair down.  </li>
            <li>Using this product has smoothed and straightened my hair and it looks natural.</li>
            <li>Hours after, assuming a regular day at the office etc., my hair looks just as straight as it did in the morning.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair really soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Left my hair feeling very sticky/tacky and tangled.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, but I flat-iron it.  </li>
            <li>I aways use this hair spray to straighten my natural hair and my weave</li>
            <li>but this product actually makes a real difference</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li>I went natural about 6 months ago and haven&#x27;t had a perm.</li>
            <li>My hair is neither straight nor curly so this product really helps make my hair straight without having to use hairspray which makes my hair really stiff.</li>
            <li>also my flat ironed hair would not stay straight by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>Normally once outside, my hair will curl up or frizz when it&#x27;s really humid outside.  </li>
            <li>ITS PRETTY EXPENSIVE AND TO NOT BE ABLE TO GET ANYTHING OUT</li>
            <li>I order on amazon because its the only place I can find it for a decent price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried various flat iron protectant sprays in the past, and nothing even comes close to being as nice as this one.  </li>
            <li>This product is light enough to keep your hair&#x27;s bounce, but heavy enough to get it straight and sleek without any type of greasiness.  </li>
            <li>It looks natural and its very helpful for dry hair and it removes electrostatics from my hair.</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time and  really keeps your hair strait for days</li>
            <li>i have fine hair &amp; it left my hair greasy &amp; heavy.</li>
            <li>(there was still little bit of wave) for ONLY about 4hours (had been using kertain 7day smooth</li>
            <li>Definitely will be going back to the Bumble and Bumble straight hair product.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft but coarse near the root.</li>
            <li>My new hair stylist flat ironed my hair and she swears by this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 26 yrs old and have had problems with straighting my hair since middle school.</li>
            <li>I have natural blonde hair.</li>
            <li>Although this spray went on light, I found that it later left my hair feeling stiff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve become a recent fan of many Sexy Hair products but this one was INSTANT hate.</li>
            <li>But I would still have to wash my hair every other day which is just too much for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s necessary for me to use the flat iron daily because of my natural unflattering waves.  </li>
            <li>I have super thick and colored hair and it makes my hair look like I just walked out of my stylists</li>

            <li> Did I mention it smells amazing?</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> Before my hair kind of smelled somewhat burned, but it doesn&#x27;t with this anymore.</li>
            <li> I honestly dont have the time..</li>
            <li> im sure its all good ..</li>
            <li> It is my own fault for buying something I hadn&#x27;t smelled online.</li>
            <li> So honestly wouldn&#x27;t suggest this if you have any bit of curl to your hair or thickness, at all.</li>
            <li> I liked this product.</li>
            <li> Has kind of a baby powder scent to it but its nice</li>
            <li> If it is not on sale where I live, I know where I can get it, this is wonderful!</li>
            <li> Great product and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> The best by far!</li>
            <li> All i can say.. this is SEXY SEXY SEXY!</li>
            <li> Works great with the flat iron.. AND smells great.</li>
            <li> very light.</li>
            <li> Many people ask me how I do my hair.</li>
            <li> I plan on ordering more soon</li>
            <li> Well this product help keep the shine in my hair along with helping it look great straight.</li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> and I love SEXY (brand name) hair products.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> am glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite product.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> and love the price, if you buy it in a salon its like double the price, so having on amazon is awesome</li>
            <li> the product has been discontinued in most stores.</li>
            <li> this product is just ok its what they use on my hair in the salon</li>
            <li> so i found it on here for a better price</li>
            <li> The more you wash your hair the more oil your head will produce trying to counteract you repeatedly stripping it turning the process into a cycle.</li>
            <li> so the more I have to wash it the more I have to flat-iron</li>
            <li> my hair thus resulting in even more damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product, I use it alway</li>
            <li> I had the same results at home and it is wonderful.</li>
            <li> my daughter has very curly hair and these products work great</li>
            <li> this product is probably better for girls with extensions.</li>
            <li> I have tried the others, which mostly are non-aerosol and they would spit instead of spray</li>
            <li> SOOO GLAD Sexy Hair Concepts made theirs as an aerosol can.  </li>
            <li> These item smells wonderful and leaves my hair silky after i flat iron it.  </li>
            <li> This is the best product I have found to use with my flat iron.</li>
            <li> It would have been preferred if they explained that there was a smell to using this, which is something very important to know as many people get headaches from strong smells.</li>
            <li> It made it very easy to spray on without huge drops soaking strands.</li>
            <li> My hair seems dryer when I use this product, and it tangles more easily.</li>
            <li> I use all Sexy Hair products &amp; have been using Smooth &amp; Protect for many years now.</li>
            <li> Takes the static out during winter and keeps it frizz free during the humid summer months.  </li>
            <li> Shame on you sexy straight, my hair was anything but!!!</li>
            <li> Second, it smells so good!</li>
            <li> PERFECT for keeping my hair straight, soft, and shiny.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Not always easy to find so</li>
            <li> It is nothing special, you are better off using something else.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING, best flat iron spray on the market by far....</li>
            <li> I have caucasian fine hair so that is what I used it on,</li>
            <li> I will preface this by saying I have fine hair.</li>
            <li> A lot of hair, but fine.</li>
            <li> Fine hair shouldn&#x27;t be washed every day.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, love the product!</li>
            <li> I originally tried this product through a sample given to me from my hairdresser, and after using it just ONCE I just HAD to buy a full sized bottle!  </li>
            <li> The spray is light and really even, and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> Really protects your hair from the heat &amp; makes it nice &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> But my hair is still smooth and sleek.</li>
            <li> make my hair smooth and with the Florida humidity</li>
            <li> , it smells good and makes my hair soft as well.</li>
            <li> I have wavy frizzy hair and this product is the best I have found to smooth and tame my hair.  </li>
            <li> This product smells a-m-a-z-i-n-g and does a wonderful job at protecting your hair from flat iron damage, as well as helping your hair stay straight for days.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product because of the great reviews, but I cannot see why it got such reviews.</li>
            <li> When using this product you can apply it and use your flat iron to get a smooth finish with great hold.</li>
            <li> Smells very good, and stops most of the fizz from humidity, but it&#x27;s not a strong hold at all!</li>
            <li> This product works great and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> the best of this product is that my hair last more, i only have to iron my hair once a week</li>
            <li> I love having my hair straight</li>
            <li> This product works as it claims, and i feel confident that my hair won&#x27;t get damaged as much by using this spray before straightening it.  </li>
            <li> so I decided to get a full sized bottle.</li>
            <li> It is the best hair product I ever tried for my fine weak hair.</li>
            <li> I need a better flat iron but with just a few sprays and no pretreating, my hair feels wonderful and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> naturally so it is pretty fine</li>
            <li> smells good and keeps my hair straight and soft.  </li>
            <li> quick shipping</li>
            <li> I started using this Straight &amp; Sexy Smooth and Protect and my hair stays nearly frizz free.  </li>
            <li> It helps me to get my hair nice and straight and it still is super soft.</li>
            <li> I have many heat protections and this is by far</li>
            <li> Smells nice, sprays evenly, I flat iron</li>
            <li> I will say that this works great, but as soon as you get your hair wet, your hair will revert back to its original form, from my experience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many flat iron sprays and this is one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> Most important  it last several days even after sleeping on my hair is was still smooth.</li>
            <li> I have very light blonde hair</li>
            <li> bring it back so it lightly covers your hair!</li>
            <li> I spray it all over my hair, but focus more on the ends to ensure extra protection against split ends.</li>
            <li> I was blown away first</li>
            <li> silky smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so much softer after i straighten it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great and inexpensive, so I recommend anyone giving it at least a try.  </li>
            <li> Thanks !  </li>
            <li> , it just makes my hair seem so much straighter, shinier, silkier (no lie!)</li>
            <li> This product helped even it out and did not scorch or burn my hair with a higher heat added to it.&lt;br /&gt;I recommended it to my sister/hair-stylist and she will give it a try</li>
            <li> No they don&#x27;t exactly stink, but it kinda reminds me of the smell of a perm.</li>
            <li> It works great for my long hair before using my flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and could never use a flat iron without burning or frizzing until my hairdresser used Straight Sexy Hair with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I love this product to protect my hair as I flat iron it.</li>
            <li> It made my flat iron seem to work more efficiently.</li>
            <li> straight while protecting your hair from the heat at the same time i&#x27;m going to continue to buy this product :)</li>
            <li> Not only does it protect your hair from splitting due to heat, but it makes your hair smell great and not burnt.</li>
            <li> I used this on my dry hair right before I straightened it, and it definitely added shine (which is why I liked it), but I noticed that at the top of my head it caused major static and my hair would not go down, so it looked like I had just rubbed a balloon on my head....</li>
            <li> and it stays straight and smooth even the next day!  </li>
            <li> My hair stayed silky straight for 2 days despite humidity.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t even know where to start or what to say about this product; I tried it several times with many different prestyling bases (Got2Be, Chi silk serum, Sexy Hair volumizing gel, and then finally with nothing.. etc)</li>
            <li> No smoothing or shine, it actually made my flatiron GRAB my hair instead of allowing it to slide smoothly.</li>
            <li> I had ordered this assuming that unisex meant that the smell would be gender neutral but as it turned out it&#x27;s very girly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that I mind so much as the smell gives me headaches (any perfume does).</li>
            <li> otherwise It&#x27;ll be very greasy</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;ll still keep your hair straight.</li>
            <li> i really like it and would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> so i cant really rate it ...</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> but it really seems like serum in a spray form.  </li>
            <li> I lot of people mentioned that they felt the product was very protective and had some conditioning aspects.</li>
            <li> Like really?</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use too much before having to was out some build up though.</li>
            <li> My wife as very curly hair</li>
            <li> and I had used it a few times and liked it a lot</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really keep my hair straight nor did it work better than any other product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> However, a little goes a long way, definitely hold the can a good 10 or more inches from your hair when you spray it so it wont make your hair look oily</li>
            <li> Hair hold up and stays straight even in high humidity.  </li>
            <li> I live in South Louisiana, very humid.  </li>
            <li> So it takes less product to make my hair feel greasy than many others</li>
            <li> This is great because it prevents you opening a package that has become a mess due to mishandling during shipping.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It did not matter if I used just a little, or added more.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and even though I had it professionally straightened it still has a bit of curl and a lot of frizz.</li>
            <li> I have hair that needs a lot of work to look normal.</li>
            <li> Helps with frizziness and flyaways very much, but I guess it would depend on how high the humidity is in the area, especially where I live.</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews and was excited about getting this product.</li>
            <li> I used this in combination with a few other their other sexy straight products &amp; all it did was arouse some serious frustration that I spent so much on products that I CAN NOT return because I used.&lt;br /&gt;First off - this products really don&#x27;t smell the greatest.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair smooth, shiny and silky and really protects from the heat of my flat iron, all without being greasy or weighing my hair down.  </li>
            <li> Using this product has smoothed and straightened my hair and it looks natural.</li>
            <li> Hours after, assuming a regular day at the office etc., my hair looks just as straight as it did in the morning.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair really soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling very sticky/tacky and tangled.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, but I flat-iron it.  </li>
            <li> I aways use this hair spray to straighten my natural hair and my weave</li>
            <li> but this product actually makes a real difference</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li> I went natural about 6 months ago and haven&#x27;t had a perm.</li>
            <li> My hair is neither straight nor curly so this product really helps make my hair straight without having to use hairspray which makes my hair really stiff.</li>
            <li> also my flat ironed hair would not stay straight by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> Normally once outside, my hair will curl up or frizz when it&#x27;s really humid outside.  </li>
            <li> ITS PRETTY EXPENSIVE AND TO NOT BE ABLE TO GET ANYTHING OUT</li>
            <li> I order on amazon because its the only place I can find it for a decent price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried various flat iron protectant sprays in the past, and nothing even comes close to being as nice as this one.  </li>
            <li> This product is light enough to keep your hair&#x27;s bounce, but heavy enough to get it straight and sleek without any type of greasiness.  </li>
            <li> It looks natural and its very helpful for dry hair and it removes electrostatics from my hair.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and  really keeps your hair strait for days</li>
            <li> i have fine hair &amp; it left my hair greasy &amp; heavy.</li>
            <li> (there was still little bit of wave) for ONLY about 4hours (had been using kertain 7day smooth</li>
            <li> Definitely will be going back to the Bumble and Bumble straight hair product.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft but coarse near the root.</li>
            <li> My new hair stylist flat ironed my hair and she swears by this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 26 yrs old and have had problems with straighting my hair since middle school.</li>
            <li> I have natural blonde hair.</li>
            <li> Although this spray went on light, I found that it later left my hair feeling stiff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve become a recent fan of many Sexy Hair products but this one was INSTANT hate.</li>
            <li> But I would still have to wash my hair every other day which is just too much for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s necessary for me to use the flat iron daily because of my natural unflattering waves.  </li>
            <li> I have super thick and colored hair and it makes my hair look like I just walked out of my stylists</li>
            <li> So I bought this, hoping to find something to replace the Matrix Gold Heat dry oil spray that apparently has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> This is the only flat iron spray I use.</li>
            <li> Only complaint I have is that the bottle went empty quick, maybe it can&#x27;t be left on the side or thrown in a drawer.</li>
            <li> Usually, though it stays generally straight, the ends inevitably start to fold in or out.</li>
            <li> It is a waterless aerosol spray, so you don&#x27;t have to wait until the product dries to flat iron your hair.</li>
            <li> I ought to try it with my curling iron, but from the results with my flat iron, I would imagine that it would also help my curls look shinier and stay intact.</li>
            <li> I use this product every time I flat iron my hair.  </li>
            <li> This has helped protect my hair from the flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Frizz is a given even when I flat iron.</li>
            <li> help my hair lay flat and not funky.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair didn&#x27;t get as frizzy during the day nor oily and flat.</li>
            <li> I have curly, uncontrollable hair and this product helps me a lot when I use my flat iron.</li>
            <li> I also use it when I don&#x27;t use the flat iron just for the shine and managability</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all kinds of flat iron sprays.</li>
            <li> and she uses the flat iron to straighten it.</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick (Japanese), long hair, so normally products don&#x27;t get through to my hair since it&#x27;s kinda heavy</li>
            <li> My hair has always been long with medium loose to tight curls and so much volumn.</li>
            <li> I blow dry, then spray it, then flat iron it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticably seen less split ends and my hair just feels smoother in general.</li>
            <li> And it sucks because you can&#x27;t return it due to the fact that it has a hazard warning on the bottle for being very flammable.  </li>
            <li> Meaning, it is not liquidy when it hits your hair, it is already dry when it touches your hair so it doesn&#x27;t make it wet.</li>
            <li> This product protects my hair and I have minimal damage to my hair.</li>
            <li> I got my hair wet when washing my face.</li>
            <li> however, the scent is of what is closest to wet dog.</li>
            <li> I hate how most of them make your hair so stiff when you put enough for it to actually help straighten your hair.</li>
            <li> If your hair is only slightly wavey, it might work...but not for curls!</li>
            <li> Usually I just say \\&quot;screw heat protectant!\\&quot; but this stuff has made me feel differently.</li>
            <li> and my hair is usually pulled back.</li>
            <li> not sure if it works differently on different texture hair</li>
            <li> It smells very fake coconut-y like cheap sunscreen.</li>
            <li> When used as noted on dry hair, it makes your hair look oily even if you use a little bit.</li>
            <li> Flat iron can be very harsh on hair</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, color treated curly hair.</li>
            <li> and I straighten it so this helps bring it down without weighing it down or being greasy.</li>
            <li> No difference at all in my final outcome: FAIL, big fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And this cost less than in the salons.  </li>
            <li> So, I have to admit I&#x27;ve spent A LOT of money on hair products in the past.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure if a product does exist to where you can get it wet</li>
            <li> After drying my hair with a blowdryer, I sprayed a little of this spray on sections of my hair and straightened them.  </li>
            <li> I also spray a little on my hair after styling.</li>
            <li> I was using sooo little.</li>
            <li> maybe a few hours</li>
            <li> I just had to do a few touch ups in the front from were</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t keep my hair from frizzing or looking dried out</li>
            <li> so I feel like I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> By the time I got my flat-iron to my hair it had dried into the strands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hairstylist started using this on me a few times</li>

            <li> Changed my hair for the better perfect for flyaways</li>
            <li> This works AMAZING I have many heat protections and this is by far the best makes your hair smell and feel WONDERFUL my hair is so soft and feels so light I will keep buying this item I LOVE IT!!!! Don&#x27;t spray to close to hair bring it back so it lightly covers your hair!</li>
            <li> This product smells a-m-a-z-i-n-g and does a wonderful job at protecting your hair from flat iron damage, as well as helping your hair stay straight for days. It is a waterless aerosol spray, so you don&#x27;t have to wait until the product dries to flat iron your hair. I spray it all over my hair, but focus more on the ends to ensure extra protection against split ends. My hair stayed silky straight for 2 days despite humidity. I have pretty thick (Japanese), long hair, so normally products don&#x27;t get through to my hair since it&#x27;s kinda heavy... but this product does an amazing job! I ought to try it with my curling iron, but from the results with my flat iron, I would imagine that it would also help my curls look shinier and stay intact. Did I mention it smells amazing? I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> All i can say.. this is SEXY SEXY SEXY! I love it!! It makes me look gorgeous! Many people ask me how I do my hair. It looks natural and its very helpful for dry hair and it removes electrostatics from my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Usually I just say \\&quot;screw heat protectant!\\&quot; but this stuff has made me feel differently. For one, it has the consistency of hair spray, without being sticky when it touches your hair. Meaning, it is not liquidy when it hits your hair, it is already dry when it touches your hair so it doesn&#x27;t make it wet. Second, it smells so good! Before my hair kind of smelled somewhat burned, but it doesn&#x27;t with this anymore. It smells very refreshing. Third, it actually protects! I&#x27;ve noticably seen less split ends and my hair just feels smoother in general. I will definitely be buying plenty of bottles of this stuff.</li>
            <li> I use this product every time I flat iron my hair.  It works wonderfully!  Takes the static out during winter and keeps it frizz free during the humid summer months.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It works well. I have hair that needs a lot of work to look normal. I honestly dont have the time.. and my hair is usually pulled back. BUT.. when I have to have my hair done, this helps. A lot. I blow dry, then spray it, then flat iron it. Works great with the flat iron.. AND smells great. I look &amp; smell like I had my hair done at a salon. I plan on ordering more soon ~ I can&#x27;t dare run out!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 26 yrs old and have had problems with straighting my hair since middle school. My hair has always been long with medium loose to tight curls and so much volumn. Any! Time I would attempt to style with heat my hair was just destroyed and that ment I had to cut :(. Well this product help keep the shine in my hair along with helping it look great straight.</li>
            <li> This has helped protect my hair from the flat iron.  It&#x27;s necessary for me to use the flat iron daily because of my natural unflattering waves.  This product protects my hair and I have minimal damage to my hair.</li>
            <li> I have struggled all my life dealing with very thick course wavy/curly hair. My new hair stylist flat ironed my hair and she swears by this stuff.I was doubtful as nothing ever truly held away the wave for that long maybe a few hours but that was it. I was blown away first it protects your hair and makes it supper silky smooth and soft. Most important  it last several days even after sleeping on my hair is was still smooth. I just had to do a few touch ups in the front from were I got my hair wet when washing my face. But my hair is still smooth and sleek. someone even thought i was wearing a wig to to the dramatic difference in the texture change of my hair. I love this product</li>
            <li> PERFECT for keeping my hair straight, soft, and shiny.</li>
            <li> Great product and quick delivery. I have very curly hair and even though I had it professionally straightened it still has a bit of curl and a lot of frizz. Using this product has smoothed and straightened my hair and it looks natural.</li>
            <li> I like this product but lately have been having trouble with products making my head itch. Almost everything I use makes my head itch but this product is good and I love SEXY (brand name) hair products.</li>
            <li> This is a lightweight product and it smells really good! I love this product to protect my hair as I flat iron it. I deff. recommend this product. I have very light blonde hair naturally so it is pretty fine and I get bleached highlights. My hair feels so much softer after i straighten it!</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, color treated curly hair. Frizz is a given even when I flat iron. So I bought this, hoping to find something to replace the Matrix Gold Heat dry oil spray that apparently has been discontinued. I need a flatiron spray to do a lot of things: give shine, give cohesion to my hair so that the ends don&#x27;t look like straw, help my hair lay flat and not funky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t even know where to start or what to say about this product; I tried it several times with many different prestyling bases (Got2Be, Chi silk serum, Sexy Hair volumizing gel, and then finally with nothing.. etc) and this did nothing but make my hair feel like it was three days past a wash. (I wash every day out of necessity) No smoothing or shine, it actually made my flatiron GRAB my hair instead of allowing it to slide smoothly. It did not matter if I used just a little, or added more. No difference at all in my final outcome: FAIL, big fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$18 for this, and it&#x27;s going back. I&#x27;ve become a recent fan of many Sexy Hair products but this one was INSTANT hate.</li>
            <li> So, I have to admit I&#x27;ve spent A LOT of money on hair products in the past.  I have totally frizzy hair that&#x27;s in between curly and wavy (it&#x27;s a pain).  I love having my hair straight and this product is the best one I&#x27;ve ever used to get it the smoothest and silkiest it&#x27;s ever been.  After drying my hair with a blowdryer, I sprayed a little of this spray on sections of my hair and straightened them.  This product is light enough to keep your hair&#x27;s bounce, but heavy enough to get it straight and sleek without any type of greasiness.  It&#x27;s great and inexpensive, so I recommend anyone giving it at least a try.  Good luck, ladies:)!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many flat iron sprays and this is one is by far my favorite. The spray is light and really even, and the results are amazing. Hours after, assuming a regular day at the office etc., my hair looks just as straight as it did in the morning. Usually, though it stays generally straight, the ends inevitably start to fold in or out. Really great product.</li>
            <li> I originally tried this product through a sample given to me from my hairdresser, and after using it just ONCE I just HAD to buy a full sized bottle!  It makes my hair smooth, shiny and silky and really protects from the heat of my flat iron, all without being greasy or weighing my hair down.  I&#x27;ve tried various flat iron protectant sprays in the past, and nothing even comes close to being as nice as this one.  I love it!!</li>
            <li> These item smells wonderful and leaves my hair silky after i flat iron it.  I love this product!</li>
            <li> I have wavy frizzy hair and this product is the best I have found to smooth and tame my hair.  The best by far! I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I had ordered this assuming that unisex meant that the smell would be gender neutral but as it turned out it&#x27;s very girly. It&#x27;s not that I mind so much as the smell gives me headaches (any perfume does). I will say that this works great, but as soon as you get your hair wet, your hair will revert back to its original form, from my experience. This isn&#x27;t a flaw, but it may be something to consider if you want to avoid using product in your hair as well as straightening it every day.  I have to wash my hair every day otherwise It&#x27;ll be very greasy and I&#x27;m not sure if a product does exist to where you can get it wet and it&#x27;ll still keep your hair straight. Either way... This product works as it claims, and i feel confident that my hair won&#x27;t get damaged as much by using this spray before straightening it.  I only had it for about two weeks and I can feel the difference. It would have been preferred if they explained that there was a smell to using this, which is something very important to know as many people get headaches from strong smells. I will update my rating when they add that tidbit in the description.</li>
            <li> I had used the product before buying it on amazon. I love it. I have very thick hair and I straighten it so this helps bring it down without weighing it down or being greasy.</li>
            <li> My daughter in law told me about this product. She purchased it from her hairstylist and loves it so I wnted to try it. i really like it and would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Although this spray went on light, I found that it later left my hair feeling stiff. I prefer the Living Proof brand.</li>
            <li> its a gift for xtmas so i cant really rate it ...im sure its all good ..Thanks !  it got here in time for xtmas</li>
            <li> smells good and keeps my hair straight and soft.  i straighten my hair twice a week and it seems to help protect it from heat damage,</li>
            <li> Smells great.  Works great.  Easy to use.  Definitely would buy again.  I use this product daily and it is a great product.</li>
            <li> I love this! It made my flat iron seem to work more efficiently. My hair didn&#x27;t get as frizzy during the day nor oily and flat.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is the best straightening spray out there, it gives a light shine and it wraps around your hair like baby powder</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product in a 12oz size (in stores) and paid $12.  Shame on me for not noticing the 1 oz size and a price of $18 !! Silly me, thinking that the price was for a 12 oz size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to return this purchase - what do I need to do for return and refund.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I can&#x27;t find it locally anymore</li>
            <li> i RECIEVED THIS AND WENT TO USE IT AND IT DOESNT WORK, ITS PRETTY EXPENSIVE AND TO NOT BE ABLE TO GET ANYTHING OUT IS DISAPPOINTING</li>
            <li> Very good! Will be buying again!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. Leaves my hair really soft and shiny. I also spray a little on my hair after styling. I have relaxed 3c hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING, best flat iron spray on the market by far....I have super thick and colored hair and it makes my hair look like I just walked out of my stylists salon.  If you straighten your hair you are missing out if you aren&#x27;t using this product!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I used this product only twice, and the spray part got clogged, now I called the number on the bottle and they asked where I had purchase the item and I said amazon, wellllllll the customer service lady said they can only take there products back if they are brought at hair salon.  I really like this product however I will purchase from here on in at a hair salon.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have curly, uncontrollable hair and this product helps me a lot when I use my flat iron. It also leaves your hair with a great smell, which I love.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest product for curly, frizzy hair ever! Not always easy to find so am glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite product.  Left my hair feeling very sticky/tacky and tangled.  Yes, it straightened but the texture was awful.  Definitely will be going back to the Bumble and Bumble straight hair product.</li>
            <li> best thing I hve found to actually make my hair striaght, it smells good and makes my hair soft as well. Love it. and love the price, if you buy it in a salon its like double the price, so having on amazon is awesome</li>
            <li> works well doesnt leave a nasty feeling in hair</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, but I flat-iron it.  I live in South Louisiana, very humid.  Normally once outside, my hair will curl up or frizz when it&#x27;s really humid outside.  I started using this Straight &amp; Sexy Smooth and Protect and my hair stays nearly frizz free.  Love it!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t keep my hair from frizzing or looking dried out so I feel like I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! I aways use this hair spray to straighten my natural hair and my weave, I use it on my clients as well it gets your hair bone straight while protecting your hair from the heat at the same time i&#x27;m going to continue to buy this product :)</li>
            <li> love this product!!! make my hair smooth and with the Florida humidity it doesn&#x27;t frizz!!!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product because of the great reviews, but I cannot see why it got such reviews. When used as noted on dry hair, it makes your hair look oily even if you use a little bit. I have caucasian fine hair so that is what I used it on, not sure if it works differently on different texture hair but it really seems like serum in a spray form.  And it sucks because you can&#x27;t return it due to the fact that it has a hazard warning on the bottle for being very flammable.  I would skip this product. It is nothing special, you are better off using something else.</li>
            <li> this was the best price i could find anywhere online. the product has been discontinued in most stores. great buy. quick shipping</li>
            <li> this product is just ok its what they use on my hair in the salon so i found it on here for a better price</li>
            <li> Smells very good, and stops most of the fizz from humidity, but it&#x27;s not a strong hold at all!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical as I usually am about using hair products (nothing ever seems to work as well as anyone says it does, or work at all) but this product actually makes a real difference, it just makes my hair seem so much straighter, shinier, silkier (no lie!) I have really thick, curly hair and it transformed my mane into awesome silky smooth hair! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and could never use a flat iron without burning or frizzing until my hairdresser used Straight Sexy Hair with a flat iron. It is the best hair product I ever tried for my fine weak hair. I also use it when I don&#x27;t use the flat iron just for the shine and managability it produces with no frizzing what so ever. This product works great and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I did not use this product at all because the scent is so off-putting I couldn&#x27;t stand for my hair to smell like it. It smells very fake coconut-y like cheap sunscreen. If you don&#x27;t mind that then you might like this product. It is my own fault for buying something I hadn&#x27;t smelled online.</li>
            <li> Works great..pricey though</li>
            <li> I will preface this by saying I have fine hair. A lot of hair, but fine. So it takes less product to make my hair feel greasy than many others probably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells very pleasant, and I loved the mist aspect to it. It made it very easy to spray on without huge drops soaking strands. By the time I got my flat-iron to my hair it had dried into the strands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately it just made my hair a bit too greasy. I was using sooo little. Just a split second spray over each segment. But I would still have to wash my hair every other day which is just too much for me.&lt;br /&gt;I only wash my hair twice a week for varies reasons. 1. The more you wash your hair the more oil your head will produce trying to counteract you repeatedly stripping it turning the process into a cycle. Don&#x27;t fight your head. 2. Fine hair shouldn&#x27;t be washed every day. It&#x27;s damaging. 3. I have curly hair so the more I have to wash it the more I have to flat-iron my hair thus resulting in even more damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
            <li> So my sister got a sample bottle of this product and I had used it a few times and liked it a lot so I decided to get a full sized bottle. I used this on my dry hair right before I straightened it, and it definitely added shine (which is why I liked it), but I noticed that at the top of my head it caused major static and my hair would not go down, so it looked like I had just rubbed a balloon on my head....so overall I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all kinds of flat iron sprays. I hate how most of them make your hair so stiff when you put enough for it to actually help straighten your hair. This one is different! It helps me to get my hair nice and straight and it still is super soft. I hate the feeling of product build up and this product doesn&#x27;t even feel like it&#x27;s there. You should try this!!!</li>
            <li> This is the only flat iron spray I use. I have to straighten my hair every day, therefor I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products. I love this because It makes my hair feel awesome! I order on amazon because its the only place I can find it for a decent price.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  I used to get it at my hair salon until they discontinued it.  So, I went online and was happy to find it on Amazon!  It makes my hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews and was excited about getting this product. I lot of people mentioned that they felt the product was very protective and had some conditioning aspects. My hair seems dryer when I use this product, and it tangles more easily.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, love the product!</li>
            <li> I use all Sexy Hair products &amp; have been using Smooth &amp; Protect for many years now. It works great for my long hair before using my flat iron. Really protects your hair from the heat &amp; makes it nice &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product, I use it alway i do my hair... the best of this product is that my hair last more, i only have to iron my hair once a week</li>
            <li> My hair is neither straight nor curly so this product really helps make my hair straight without having to use hairspray which makes my hair really stiff. However, a little goes a long way, definitely hold the can a good 10 or more inches from your hair when you spray it so it wont make your hair look oily</li>
            <li> My hairstylist started using this on me a few times and I was impressed with the styles, softness and effectiveness of the product on my hair. I went natural about 6 months ago and haven&#x27;t had a perm. I figured I would give this a try myself and found it online. I had the same results at home and it is wonderful. I need a better flat iron but with just a few sprays and no pretreating, my hair feels wonderful and easy to manage. My hair is soft but coarse near the root. This product helped even it out and did not scorch or burn my hair with a higher heat added to it.&lt;br /&gt;I recommended it to my sister/hair-stylist and she will give it a try also!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In love with it! I am going to order a bigger bottle if I can find some!</li>
            <li> arrived on time, product is what it&#x27;s supposed to be. my daughter has very curly hair and these products work great she says.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed that I spent so much on this product. I read the reviews on this and was so pumped to get this product. I used this in combination with a few other their other sexy straight products &amp; all it did was arouse some serious frustration that I spent so much on products that I CAN NOT return because I used.&lt;br /&gt;First off - this products really don&#x27;t smell the greatest. No they don&#x27;t exactly stink, but it kinda reminds me of the smell of a perm. And that smell lingers.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly- It didn&#x27;t really keep my hair straight nor did it work better than any other product I&#x27;ve used. Like really? You&#x27;re $20.00 bottle &amp; you don&#x27;t work? Shame on you sexy straight, my hair was anything but!!! It kept my hair straight(ish) (there was still little bit of wave) for ONLY about 4hours (had been using kertain 7day smooth and that was lasting about 4 DAYS).&lt;br /&gt; So honestly wouldn&#x27;t suggest this if you have any bit of curl to your hair or thickness, at all. If your hair is only slightly wavey, it might work...but not for curls!</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff ever for your hair. Not only does it protect your hair from splitting due to heat, but it makes your hair smell great and not burnt. Only complaint I have is that the bottle went empty quick, maybe it can&#x27;t be left on the side or thrown in a drawer.</li>
            <li> Great product. Unfortunately I was told its being discontinued!</li>
            <li> this product is probably better for girls with extensions. i have fine hair &amp; it left my hair greasy &amp; heavy. i don&#x27;t like to wash my hair everyday but i had to wash my hair the very next day. will not buy it again &amp; probably won&#x27;t ever use it again. waste.</li>
            <li> I liked this product. Can&#x27;t use too much before having to was out some build up though.</li>
            <li> the feel of it is very nice. very light. however, the scent is of what is closest to wet dog. it also darkened my color a bit. I have natural blonde hair. I ended up giving it away.</li>
            <li> My wife as very curly hair and she uses the flat iron to straighten it. Flat iron can be very harsh on hair and you don&#x27;t always get the hold you want. When using this product you can apply it and use your flat iron to get a smooth finish with great hold. Best price I could find on Amazon and shipping was quick and very secure. They removed the spray caps to prevent any accidental discharge during shipping. This is great because it prevents you opening a package that has become a mess due to mishandling during shipping.</li>
            <li> Good spray, very light weight, no greasy feeling. Hair hold up and stays straight even in high humidity.  Has kind of a baby powder scent to it but its nice</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have found to use with my flat iron. It ties not leave my hair stuff - in fact I think it looks awesome!  Would definitely recommend trying it</li>
            <li> I have tried the others, which mostly are non-aerosol and they would spit instead of spray and I did not liked the way my hair would feel with those and also my flat ironed hair would not stay straight by the end of the day.  I am SOOO GLAD Sexy Hair Concepts made theirs as an aerosol can.  And this cost less than in the salons.  Smells nice, sprays evenly, I flat iron and it stays straight and smooth even the next day!  Helps with frizziness and flyaways very much, but I guess it would depend on how high the humidity is in the area, especially where I live. PLEASE, do not discontinue this one.  If it is not on sale where I live, I know where I can get it, this is wonderful!</li>
            <li> Great product I&#x27;ve bought it more than once.  It lasts a long time and  really keeps your hair strait for days</li>
