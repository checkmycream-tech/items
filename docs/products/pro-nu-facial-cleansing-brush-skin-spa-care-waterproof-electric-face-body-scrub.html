            <li>I love this and will continue to use it!</li>
            <li>I have always had skin issues and have tried so many skin care products to no avail, until now!</li>
            <li>but I did not know which one would be better suited for me, this one has everything!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>totally in love with my pro-nu!</li>
            <li>I think that my favorite part is the pumice stone, my feet are in heaven I tell you!</li>
            <li>but now it is my favorite!  </li>
            <li>and I just love this product!</li>
            <li>I love my Pro-Nu microderm abrasion brush!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I use this as often as I can and my skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product; just be prepared to have 4 (four AA sized batteries available to load the battery bay in the handle) to use it.)</li>
            <li>This brush is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>this is amazing.</li>
            <li>The face brush cleans your face and makes it look amazing as well.</li>
            <li>Amazing brush.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>but it was packaged very well and arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if it were rechargeable.</li>
            <li>I received this product for instructional purposes in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li>But today, when I was washing my face, it stopped on its own at times 10 times in the 3 minutes I was using it.</li>
            <li>A rechargable option would be nice.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice machine.</li>
            <li>so I am able to use it in the shower or tub or even in the living room after a good foot soak.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product during a promotion and the views I have expressed are my own.</li>
            <li>: I received this at a promotional price, and I am leaving my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>As advertised, quick shipment, great product.</li>
            <li>This brush has the perfect amount of power to get a good clean but also feels gentle and relaxing.</li>
            <li>I was able to purchase this for review during a promotional period and my opinions are unbiased and my own.</li>
            <li>Impressed thus far with this item.</li>
            <li>I bought one more item and gifted to my friend and got good feedback from her too(proved to be totally a worth gift).Totally loved this item.</li>
            <li>Works great, so far so good.</li>
            <li>The first one I received was defective, but they were great and replaced it for me.</li>
            <li>The attachments are easy to swap on and off and they came in a nice gift box to keep them all stored in.</li>
            <li>and I plan to order some more to give as a gift.</li>
            <li>It makes it more convenient for me.</li>
            <li>But, I have used all but the pumice, ie the facial brush, the buffer sponge and the body brush and it has worked great!</li>
            <li>The attachments: I wasn&#x27;t too sure about these.</li>
            <li>The one I had the most concern about was the sponge.</li>
            <li>its ok.</li>
            <li>I was able to grab this product on a promotion and am so glad I did for all the beneficial skin care I can now provide myself with at home.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I really do love this</li>
            <li>This is one product that I would definetly recommend to anyone that wants good nice  skin.</li>
            <li>Way better than using your hands to wash your face</li>
            <li>I was able to try the body brush with my homemade sugar exfoliating scrub which they recommend using &amp; I suggest you trying it as well.</li>
            <li>It does require more time in the shower but it outweighs the benefits.</li>
            <li>It does all the work for you because of the 360degree rotation versus scrubbing your feet with a pumice sponge/stone which requires more manual labor from you.</li>
            <li>I love it!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>This is way better than using your hands or wash cloth to wash your face with.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>I fell in love and wanted one, but</li>
            <li>I use this product every day, and love it.</li>
            <li>I apply my skin products with the sponge pad, and love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than using your fingers and getting all those oils on your face.</li>
            <li>When I saw this item available through a promotional offer I couldn&#x27;t wait to get it!  </li>
            <li>My skin has NEVER glowed or felt as smooth as it does after using this!  </li>
            <li>I love this brush set.</li>
            <li>The sponge head is great if you just want to use for a gentle face cleansing or for applying moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and I look and feel exponentially better.  </li>
            <li>Love this Device.</li>

            <li>This facial cleansing kit works great.</li>
            <li>I thought this was going to be a cheap inferior product that was</li>
            <li>Functionally: The attachments snap on securely and when the Pro-Nu is switched on</li>
            <li>I could use a stronger circulating brush for legs as it feels too light</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for anyone wanting to enjoy the benefits of the spa at home.</li>
            <li>Overall a great product.</li>
            <li>Just a cheap made product.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>

            <li>Just used it for the first time!</li>
            <li>It is a nice size and the handle will be easy to hold even wet.  </li>
            <li>My face was very smooth and soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>I highly recommended this product to those who have been trying to find the right treatment for their pores and having it scrubbed clean!</li>
            <li>There is a marked difference in my face and my skin feels so smooth!</li>
            <li>I probably need something more on the lines of a professional sander to tackle these toes.</li>
            <li>I did not get to use it daily as my feet are already soft &amp; currently in great shape.</li>
            <li>And they&#x27;re all useful.</li>
            <li>My skins so soft :)</li>
            <li>Love this so far.</li>
            <li>I feel so clean, soft and silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Price is right too.  </li>
            <li>She said it has just the right amount of power.</li>
            <li>and I used this right before I use my derma roller.</li>
            <li>It spins just right.</li>
            <li>these two are my life saver right now.</li>
            <li>all right off then add a lotion or</li>
            <li>I love how it comes with one full size brush head and 3 smaller ones.</li>
            <li>I love how the large bristle brush exfoliates my body and makes it feel amazingly soft.</li>
            <li>but it does and makes me feel like I have clean new skin every time I use it!</li>
            <li>, it leaves my skin super soft and clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d gladly pay a few more $$$$ for that.  </li>
            <li>I really hope there is a solution to this because I really love this handy little brush!</li>
            <li>I had an issue with the first one that I received, so I contacted the company and they were super fast in rectifying the situation.</li>
            <li>Priced very reasonable.</li>
            <li>you normally wouldn&#x27;t if you were to just manually clean your face.</li>
            <li>The  Pro-Nu works fine to completely cleans my face.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle and affordable and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The button has &amp;#34;l&amp;#34; on and &amp;#34;O&amp;#34; which if you push lightly, clicks and the spinner stops and starts again, if you push in completely it turns the unit off.</li>
            <li>When I first turned it on, it sounded &amp;#34;weak&amp;#34;, as though once touched to something it would stop spinning.</li>
            <li>Upon my first time using the Pro-Nu</li>
            <li>Upon my first time using the Pro-Nu</li>
            <li>I actually think it cleans better than the &amp;#34;brand&amp;#34; one i used in my derm&#x27;s office.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The rotating head is not uncomfortable in the slightest bit.</li>
            <li>using body brush at first it kept throwing the on switch off.</li>
            <li>I first saw a product like this at a Mary Kay party that I attended.</li>
            <li>my skin feels so much smoother and clearer now!</li>
            <li>First of all  -  I&#x27;m a guy.  </li>
            <li>I also use it on my butt to help keep pimples at bay. ;)</li>
            <li>I am in love with my Pro-Nu Facial brush!!!</li>
            <li>1) a face sponge 2)small brush to use on face to exfoliate 3) a bigger brush to use on hands, feet, &amp; body 4) a pumice stone (my favorite for my feet)</li>
            <li>I can put it on the Pro-Nu and take it into the shower with me, along with an all natural, glycerin filled soap and scrub it all away.</li>
            <li>It works way better and has more power behind it to clean up your feet.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much that after the first one came, I decided to order a second.</li>
            <li>Makes her feel soft and really clean.</li>
            <li>I thought my regular routine was good enough.</li>
            <li>I thought my regular routine was good enough.</li>
            <li>Just as good as the more expensive types...does what it&#x27;s meant to do</li>
            <li>I really felt that my face was getting more benefit from the creams/serum I used because of this deep cleaning product.</li>
            <li>Shipping was good, as usual.</li>
            <li>Easy to open and get to the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>A super soft attachment you can use to massage moisturizer into your skin.</li>
            <li>This works great to brush and clear off any dead skin!  </li>
            <li>I love this because my legs, arms, and torso get dry and flaky.</li>
            <li>It is battery operated ( they&#x27;re not included but they are the basic AA batteries that are easy to find) which is neat because you dont have to worry about charging  it.</li>
            <li>I love it except that I hope it is not going to stop working as I smelled like it was over heating and really did not use it long.</li>
            <li>The large brush can be used on the body to polish away and impurities to reveal healthier looking skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had large pores on my nose and, my ears and nose always end up greasy by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>The body brush works great as a dry brush to help promote circulation to hips, thighs and stomach before showering, and works amazing with my body wash and a bit of baking soda for exfoliating and getting rid of that dry dead winter skin while showering.</li>
            <li>Nice little brush.  </li>
            <li>The rotation isnt very fast not slow but</li>
            <li>This is great for me because I have combination skin: extremely oily on the forehead, nose and chin but dry and flaky in those areas, too.</li>
            <li>It really does feel amazing because my body felt as if I was washing away all the dead skin away.</li>
            <li>If your looking for an amazing facial cleansing brush look no further.</li>
            <li>Not too abrasive and has gentle exfoliation for the skin.</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>but it really did.&lt;br</li>
            <li>although it says it is waterproof, I would encourage you to shelter it as much as you can.</li>
            <li>I even ordered one as a “gag gift” for my mom on her birthday before I gave her the real gift that I got her – expecting a reaction like “</li>
            <li>It really has worked well on my skin.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t check before buying it.</li>
            <li>really well</li>
            <li>and I really like this set.</li>
            <li>These two works really well togather.</li>
            <li>tried the body brush and really didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>it makes your whole body feel refreshed.</li>
            <li>I really want to give it 5-stars</li>
            <li>I am in absolute heaven with this product.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend this one!</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>This weather really does a job on my skin.</li>
            <li>My face feels so much cleaner after using this brush.</li>
            <li>Gentle, for your money you get a lot.</li>
            <li>Dont spend too much time at 1 spot with that head.</li>
            <li>I use an exfoliant and always before I had to use my fingers to gently massage the exfoliant into my face.</li>
            <li>This product is very practial.</li>
            <li>It is nice that it comes with multiple brushes for different uses.</li>
            <li>It is much better than the other twice as costly facial cleaners available in the market.</li>
            <li>It really does deep clean &amp; get the dirt of that</li>
            <li>It really does deep clean.</li>
            <li>The small  facial brush works wonderful with my facial cleanser, exfoliating and cleansing all at once.</li>
            <li>Within minutes you can restore your skin back to its original glory....</li>
            <li>I love the pumice head letting me deep clean my feet keeping the dead skin and callous away.</li>
            <li>I love the different brush heads and I use them daily.</li>
            <li>I have a super expensive $200 facial brush that I just thought was the best thing ever until it finally died and I needed a replacement.</li>
            <li>I love that it has the four various attachment heads and can be used on your face and with a simple change of the attachments it can be used on your feet!  </li>
            <li>I love that it is waterproof and comes with all the different types of heads to use for different reasons.</li>
            <li>That just kept growing.&lt;br /&gt;I am highly allergic to mold so threw it</li>
            <li>I then opened the item before I trashed it and saw the battery was highly corroded.</li>
            <li>Then again, it does a little but just seems totake more time than I want to spend trying to balance myself on 1 foot while in the shower.</li>
            <li>It cleanses my skin without making it angry lol.</li>
            <li>It cleanses my skin without making it angry lol.</li>
            <li>This is gentle on my sensitive skin and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>The brush is gentle enough, yet effective for removing the dead skin cells and dirt.</li>
            <li>But well worth the price especially when compared to brands being sold for $100&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>I love how its not so harsh on my face and body.</li>
            <li>My face felt fresh and  invigorated after using the brush head with some of my facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>I NEED NEW SKIN?”</li>
            <li>EVEN WITH NEW BATTERIES</li>
            <li>I have been using this Pro-Nu Facial &amp; Body Cleansing Set for a few days now &amp; I am already loving this set.</li>
            <li>Well... VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Well... VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Now my skin feels very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I love all the different attachments it comes with, the small brush, the large brush, pumice stone and buffer brush.</li>
            <li>I used the larger pad on my body, my skin had been peeling from a sun burn and the large surface helped get everything off.</li>
            <li>The small facial brush seriously exfoliates my face perfectly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for exfoliating, cleaning off makeup that causes a lot of our problems: blackheads, dirty pores blemishes.</li>
            <li>Dermatologists told me I will need 10 years for my blackheads to clear out</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this three times so far.</li>
            <li>have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this three times so far.</li>
            <li>One for deep cleansing and one for gentle cleansing.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I could use the old brush heads with some paint and make some art with this thing..</li>
            <li>but I do have sensitive skin anyways.</li>
            <li>All of my friends have the Clarisonic Skin Care system and I&#x27;ve been completely jealous until now.  </li>
            <li>The Body brush is not harsh to the skin.</li>
            <li>Use the pumice stone on my feet to keep them soft.</li>
            <li>I then rub in a moisturizer or some type of natural oil.&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li>My main reason for even wanting this product was the facial brush.</li>
            <li>it makes them feel soft and smooth, no more feet snagging on the blankets at night.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle but use it too long in one spot and it will hurt.</li>
            <li>lower price than many other similar brushes; different heads to use (but only one of each!).&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li>This definitely will be having you feel like a brand new lady.</li>
            <li>This definitely will be having you feel like a brand new lady.</li>
            <li>It offered the most (water proof, multiple heads) with the least amount of risk.</li>
            <li>Exfoliate your entire body with the pumice and use the sponge on more delicate areas.  </li>
            <li>It was dropped once and fell apart, but was very surprised when it still worked after putting it back together.</li>
            <li>Facial brush bristle are very soft &amp; massage sponge is of no use.</li>
            <li>I saw a major difference.</li>
            <li>I woke up the next morning with soft, smooth skin that felt softer than usual.</li>
            <li>I saw a major difference.</li>
            <li>I woke up the next morning with soft, smooth skin that felt softer than usual.</li>
            <li>Not too big, not too small and easy to grip.</li>
            <li>(I use Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Facial Cream and Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Daily Moisturizing Cream.</li>
            <li>(I use Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Facial Cream and Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Daily Moisturizing Cream.</li>
            <li>Now full of battery rust and can&#x27;t use it- after only a few months.</li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t used the other parts that came with it.</li>
            <li>I had some peeling near the chin &amp; sides of my jar area and these two brushes worked very well at removing all the dead skin I had.</li>
            <li>Dead skin was removed very gently from my face allowing my skin to breath and regenerate.</li>
            <li>A large and small soft nylon brush.</li>
            <li>and I will be taking it back as it isn&#x27;t build nearly as well as this one and not nearly as strong.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The small hard one is great to remove dead skin</li>
            <li>Found it really odd, but it didn&#x27;t bother me much since it only happened once in a while.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this so bad, because it is comparable to the Clarisonic ones, and way better priced.</li>

            <li> I have always had skin issues and have tried so many skin care products to no avail, until now!</li>

            <li> I use this as often as I can and my skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product; just be prepared to have 4 (four AA sized batteries available to load the battery bay in the handle) to use it.)</li>
            <li> This brush is absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> this is amazing.</li>
            <li> The face brush cleans your face and makes it look amazing as well.</li>
            <li> Amazing brush.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> but it was packaged very well and arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if it were rechargeable.</li>
            <li> I received this product for instructional purposes in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li> But today, when I was washing my face, it stopped on its own at times 10 times in the 3 minutes I was using it.</li>
            <li> A rechargable option would be nice.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice machine.</li>
            <li> so I am able to use it in the shower or tub or even in the living room after a good foot soak.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product during a promotion and the views I have expressed are my own.</li>
            <li> : I received this at a promotional price, and I am leaving my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> As advertised, quick shipment, great product.</li>
            <li> This brush has the perfect amount of power to get a good clean but also feels gentle and relaxing.</li>
            <li> I was able to purchase this for review during a promotional period and my opinions are unbiased and my own.</li>
            <li> Impressed thus far with this item.</li>
            <li> I bought one more item and gifted to my friend and got good feedback from her too(proved to be totally a worth gift).Totally loved this item.</li>
            <li> Works great, so far so good.</li>
            <li> The first one I received was defective, but they were great and replaced it for me.</li>
            <li> The attachments are easy to swap on and off and they came in a nice gift box to keep them all stored in.</li>
            <li> and I plan to order some more to give as a gift.</li>
            <li> It makes it more convenient for me.</li>
            <li> But, I have used all but the pumice, ie the facial brush, the buffer sponge and the body brush and it has worked great!</li>
            <li> The attachments: I wasn&#x27;t too sure about these.</li>
            <li> The one I had the most concern about was the sponge.</li>
            <li> its ok.</li>
            <li> I was able to grab this product on a promotion and am so glad I did for all the beneficial skin care I can now provide myself with at home.</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I really do love this</li>
            <li> This is one product that I would definetly recommend to anyone that wants good nice  skin.</li>
            <li> Way better than using your hands to wash your face</li>
            <li> I was able to try the body brush with my homemade sugar exfoliating scrub which they recommend using &amp; I suggest you trying it as well.</li>
            <li> It does require more time in the shower but it outweighs the benefits.</li>
            <li> It does all the work for you because of the 360degree rotation versus scrubbing your feet with a pumice sponge/stone which requires more manual labor from you.</li>
            <li> I love it!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> This is way better than using your hands or wash cloth to wash your face with.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It does all the work for you because of the 360 rotation versus scrubbing your feet with a pumice stone which requires more manual labor from you.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I fell in love and wanted one, but</li>
            <li> I use this product every day, and love it.</li>
            <li> I apply my skin products with the sponge pad, and love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than using your fingers and getting all those oils on your face.</li>
            <li> When I saw this item available through a promotional offer I couldn&#x27;t wait to get it!  </li>
            <li> My skin has NEVER glowed or felt as smooth as it does after using this!  </li>
            <li> I love this brush set.</li>
            <li> The sponge head is great if you just want to use for a gentle face cleansing or for applying moisturizer.</li>
            <li> and I look and feel exponentially better.  </li>
            <li> Love this Device.</li>
            <li> The body and face brushes are great the pumice  attachment not so much</li>
            <li> Granddaughter love it.</li>

            <li> and I LOVE it already.</li>

            <li> Smooth as a babies&#x27; bottom!</li>
            <li> However, it does make my face feel better, I just wish it did have the two speed option.</li>
            <li> This Pro-Nu waterproof electric facial cleansing brush is great!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> This appliance does a much more thorough job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also recommended this product to some of my friends and they are all very excited about it.</li>
            <li> My moisturizer actually absorbed soooo much better instead of sitting on top of my skin!</li>
            <li> My moisturizer actually absorbed soooo much better instead of sitting on top of my skin!</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good for the price.</li>

            <li> Functionally: The attachments snap on securely and when the Pro-Nu is switched on</li>
            <li> I could use a stronger circulating brush for legs as it feels too light</li>

            <li> Overall a great product.</li>

            <li> I always love to try new things out there</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Just used it for the first time!</li>
            <li> It is a nice size and the handle will be easy to hold even wet.  </li>
            <li> My face was very smooth and soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> I highly recommended this product to those who have been trying to find the right treatment for their pores and having it scrubbed clean!</li>
            <li> There is a marked difference in my face and my skin feels so smooth!</li>
            <li> I probably need something more on the lines of a professional sander to tackle these toes.</li>
            <li> I did not get to use it daily as my feet are already soft &amp; currently in great shape.</li>
            <li> And they&#x27;re all useful.</li>
            <li> My skins so soft :)</li>
            <li> Love this so far.</li>
            <li> I feel so clean, soft and silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Price is right too.  </li>
            <li> She said it has just the right amount of power.</li>
            <li> and I used this right before I use my derma roller.</li>
            <li> It spins just right.</li>
            <li> these two are my life saver right now.</li>
            <li> all right off then add a lotion or</li>
            <li> I love how it comes with one full size brush head and 3 smaller ones.</li>
            <li> I love how the large bristle brush exfoliates my body and makes it feel amazingly soft.</li>
            <li> but it does and makes me feel like I have clean new skin every time I use it!</li>
            <li> , it leaves my skin super soft and clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d gladly pay a few more $$$$ for that.  </li>
            <li> I really hope there is a solution to this because I really love this handy little brush!</li>
            <li> I had an issue with the first one that I received, so I contacted the company and they were super fast in rectifying the situation.</li>
            <li> Priced very reasonable.</li>
            <li> you normally wouldn&#x27;t if you were to just manually clean your face.</li>
            <li> The  Pro-Nu works fine to completely cleans my face.  </li>
            <li> It is gentle and affordable and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The button has &amp;#34;l&amp;#34; on and &amp;#34;O&amp;#34; which if you push lightly, clicks and the spinner stops and starts again, if you push in completely it turns the unit off.</li>
            <li> When I first turned it on, it sounded &amp;#34;weak&amp;#34;, as though once touched to something it would stop spinning.</li>
            <li> Upon my first time using the Pro-Nu</li>
            <li> Upon my first time using the Pro-Nu</li>
            <li> I actually think it cleans better than the &amp;#34;brand&amp;#34; one i used in my derm&#x27;s office.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The rotating head is not uncomfortable in the slightest bit.</li>
            <li> using body brush at first it kept throwing the on switch off.</li>
            <li> I first saw a product like this at a Mary Kay party that I attended.</li>
            <li> my skin feels so much smoother and clearer now!</li>
            <li> First of all  -  I&#x27;m a guy.  </li>
            <li> I also use it on my butt to help keep pimples at bay. ;)</li>
            <li> I am in love with my Pro-Nu Facial brush!!!</li>
            <li> 1) a face sponge 2)small brush to use on face to exfoliate 3) a bigger brush to use on hands, feet, &amp; body 4) a pumice stone (my favorite for my feet)</li>
            <li> I can put it on the Pro-Nu and take it into the shower with me, along with an all natural, glycerin filled soap and scrub it all away.</li>
            <li> It works way better and has more power behind it to clean up your feet.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much that after the first one came, I decided to order a second.</li>
            <li> Makes her feel soft and really clean.</li>
            <li> I thought my regular routine was good enough.</li>
            <li> I thought my regular routine was good enough.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the more expensive types...does what it&#x27;s meant to do</li>
            <li> I really felt that my face was getting more benefit from the creams/serum I used because of this deep cleaning product.</li>
            <li> Shipping was good, as usual.</li>
            <li> Easy to open and get to the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> A super soft attachment you can use to massage moisturizer into your skin.</li>
            <li> This works great to brush and clear off any dead skin!  </li>
            <li> I love this because my legs, arms, and torso get dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> It is battery operated ( they&#x27;re not included but they are the basic AA batteries that are easy to find) which is neat because you dont have to worry about charging  it.</li>
            <li> I love it except that I hope it is not going to stop working as I smelled like it was over heating and really did not use it long.</li>
            <li> The large brush can be used on the body to polish away and impurities to reveal healthier looking skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had large pores on my nose and, my ears and nose always end up greasy by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> The body brush works great as a dry brush to help promote circulation to hips, thighs and stomach before showering, and works amazing with my body wash and a bit of baking soda for exfoliating and getting rid of that dry dead winter skin while showering.</li>
            <li> Nice little brush.  </li>
            <li> The rotation isnt very fast not slow but</li>
            <li> This is great for me because I have combination skin: extremely oily on the forehead, nose and chin but dry and flaky in those areas, too.</li>
            <li> It really does feel amazing because my body felt as if I was washing away all the dead skin away.</li>
            <li> If your looking for an amazing facial cleansing brush look no further.</li>
            <li> Not too abrasive and has gentle exfoliation for the skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> but it really did.&lt;br</li>
            <li> although it says it is waterproof, I would encourage you to shelter it as much as you can.</li>
            <li> I even ordered one as a “gag gift” for my mom on her birthday before I gave her the real gift that I got her – expecting a reaction like “</li>
            <li> It really has worked well on my skin.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t check before buying it.</li>
            <li> really well</li>
            <li> and I really like this set.</li>
            <li> These two works really well togather.</li>
            <li> tried the body brush and really didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> it makes your whole body feel refreshed.</li>
            <li> I really want to give it 5-stars</li>
            <li> I am in absolute heaven with this product.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend this one!</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> This weather really does a job on my skin.</li>
            <li> My face feels so much cleaner after using this brush.</li>
            <li> Gentle, for your money you get a lot.</li>
            <li> Dont spend too much time at 1 spot with that head.</li>
            <li> I use an exfoliant and always before I had to use my fingers to gently massage the exfoliant into my face.</li>
            <li> This product is very practial.</li>
            <li> It is nice that it comes with multiple brushes for different uses.</li>
            <li> It is much better than the other twice as costly facial cleaners available in the market.</li>
            <li> It really does deep clean &amp; get the dirt of that</li>
            <li> It really does deep clean.</li>
            <li> The small  facial brush works wonderful with my facial cleanser, exfoliating and cleansing all at once.</li>
            <li> Within minutes you can restore your skin back to its original glory....</li>
            <li> I love the pumice head letting me deep clean my feet keeping the dead skin and callous away.</li>
            <li> I love the different brush heads and I use them daily.</li>
            <li> I have a super expensive $200 facial brush that I just thought was the best thing ever until it finally died and I needed a replacement.</li>
            <li> I love that it has the four various attachment heads and can be used on your face and with a simple change of the attachments it can be used on your feet!  </li>
            <li> I love that it is waterproof and comes with all the different types of heads to use for different reasons.</li>
            <li> That just kept growing.&lt;br /&gt;I am highly allergic to mold so threw it</li>
            <li> I then opened the item before I trashed it and saw the battery was highly corroded.</li>
            <li> Then again, it does a little but just seems totake more time than I want to spend trying to balance myself on 1 foot while in the shower.</li>
            <li> It cleanses my skin without making it angry lol.</li>
            <li> It cleanses my skin without making it angry lol.</li>
            <li> This is gentle on my sensitive skin and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> The brush is gentle enough, yet effective for removing the dead skin cells and dirt.</li>
            <li> But well worth the price especially when compared to brands being sold for $100&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> I love how its not so harsh on my face and body.</li>
            <li> My face felt fresh and  invigorated after using the brush head with some of my facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> I NEED NEW SKIN?”</li>
            <li> EVEN WITH NEW BATTERIES</li>
            <li> I have been using this Pro-Nu Facial &amp; Body Cleansing Set for a few days now &amp; I am already loving this set.</li>
            <li> Well... VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Well... VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Now my skin feels very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I love all the different attachments it comes with, the small brush, the large brush, pumice stone and buffer brush.</li>
            <li> I used the larger pad on my body, my skin had been peeling from a sun burn and the large surface helped get everything off.</li>
            <li> The small facial brush seriously exfoliates my face perfectly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for exfoliating, cleaning off makeup that causes a lot of our problems: blackheads, dirty pores blemishes.</li>
            <li> Dermatologists told me I will need 10 years for my blackheads to clear out</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this three times so far.</li>
            <li> have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this three times so far.</li>
            <li> One for deep cleansing and one for gentle cleansing.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I could use the old brush heads with some paint and make some art with this thing..</li>
            <li> but I do have sensitive skin anyways.</li>
            <li> All of my friends have the Clarisonic Skin Care system and I&#x27;ve been completely jealous until now.  </li>
            <li> The Body brush is not harsh to the skin.</li>
            <li> Use the pumice stone on my feet to keep them soft.</li>
            <li> I then rub in a moisturizer or some type of natural oil.&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li> My main reason for even wanting this product was the facial brush.</li>
            <li> it makes them feel soft and smooth, no more feet snagging on the blankets at night.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle but use it too long in one spot and it will hurt.</li>
            <li> lower price than many other similar brushes; different heads to use (but only one of each!).&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li> This definitely will be having you feel like a brand new lady.</li>
            <li> This definitely will be having you feel like a brand new lady.</li>
            <li> It offered the most (water proof, multiple heads) with the least amount of risk.</li>
            <li> Exfoliate your entire body with the pumice and use the sponge on more delicate areas.  </li>
            <li> It was dropped once and fell apart, but was very surprised when it still worked after putting it back together.</li>
            <li> Facial brush bristle are very soft &amp; massage sponge is of no use.</li>
            <li> I saw a major difference.</li>
            <li> I woke up the next morning with soft, smooth skin that felt softer than usual.</li>
            <li> I saw a major difference.</li>
            <li> I woke up the next morning with soft, smooth skin that felt softer than usual.</li>
            <li> Not too big, not too small and easy to grip.</li>
            <li> (I use Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Facial Cream and Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Daily Moisturizing Cream.</li>
            <li> (I use Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Facial Cream and Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Daily Moisturizing Cream.</li>
            <li> Now full of battery rust and can&#x27;t use it- after only a few months.</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t used the other parts that came with it.</li>
            <li> I had some peeling near the chin &amp; sides of my jar area and these two brushes worked very well at removing all the dead skin I had.</li>
            <li> Dead skin was removed very gently from my face allowing my skin to breath and regenerate.</li>
            <li> A large and small soft nylon brush.</li>
            <li> and I will be taking it back as it isn&#x27;t build nearly as well as this one and not nearly as strong.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The small hard one is great to remove dead skin</li>
            <li> Found it really odd, but it didn&#x27;t bother me much since it only happened once in a while.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this so bad, because it is comparable to the Clarisonic ones, and way better priced.</li>
            <li> I mean, I&#x27;ve been able to eliminate a few products because this can not only replace them</li>
            <li> The facial brush is firm but not  hard where is would damage of break the skin.</li>
            <li> I have only used it 3 times, only time will tell how it holds up long term!</li>
            <li> I did leave it out to dry before I packaged it back up for later use.</li>
            <li> The bristles of the brushes are so soft and delicate even for my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Most useful for me is the facial sponge that I use for applying foundation and serum on my face which I hated to do it with my fingers..</li>
            <li> – it’s rather small and seems like it doesn’t really do much for my feet.</li>
            <li> Batteries last a long time.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how long the batteries last.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t say how long that will last yet.  </li>
            <li> Get&#x27;s the job done, doesn&#x27;t last very long..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m constantly flaking around the cheeks, eyebrows, forehead and the skin on my body is horribly dry, flaky and itchy.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave this brush 4 stars instead of 5 was due to the larger body brush falling off of the handle while using.</li>
            <li> I only use the brushes, the small for the face, and the big one for other parts of the body, mainly legs.</li>
            <li> After a couple of months, I found it was making my skin problems worse, not better, and my skin was massively irritated and inflamed until I stopped using the brush entirely, and went back to using clean hands and</li>
            <li> If you have long locks you probably don’t want to go risking them getting tangled up in this spinning brush – you’ve been warned!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The facial brush was somewhat rough on my skin..</li>
            <li> I took a long bath and used all the attachments.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Two minor issues.  </li>
            <li> I had those tiny facial brushes I purchased at the store, but the refill heads were becoming very expensive.</li>
            <li> my dermatologist office staff tried to persuade me to buy the super expensive brand when i last visited my derm&#x27;s office, she insisted it had to be clarasonic..</li>
            <li> I love the little facial scrubber, but the bigger one is a bit awkward for me.</li>
            <li> Two facial (facial brush and facial sponge), a body brush, and a small pumice</li>
            <li> sponge looks like it might be replaced sooner than other attachments which will last longer because when using making up it may stain if not washed off well.</li>
            <li> sponge looks like it might be replaced sooner than other attachments which will last longer because when using making up it may stain if not washed off well.</li>
            <li> i have been wanting one of these type brushes for some time now but didn&#x27;t want to pay the several hundred dollar price tag for some of the other types out there.</li>
            <li> I cleaned with soap and water and allowed to air dry.</li>
            <li> I took out the batteries and was going to let it dry out</li>
            <li> But I do have days when they start to get dry in some areas</li>
            <li> My face is always peeling from being dry</li>
            <li> The pumice stone works wonders for my dry heals</li>
            <li> face is combination:  oily and dry.</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m getting a deep facial that&#x27;s removing  all the dead skin and dirt.</li>
            <li> For my night regimen I do the same except for adding a few drops of vitamin E oil to my moisturizer.)over do the vinegar, you want just enough to sanitize.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This brush has helped firm my skin, and it looks much healthier without all of those dead cells hanging on all the time.  </li>
            <li> They, too, get dry spots and the skin gets really rough and flaky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also cordless, which is a little obvious...</li>
            <li> But what I will tell you is that, for the cost, you really can’t go wrong with the Pro-Nu facial scrubber.</li>
            <li> For my night regimen I do the same except for adding a few drops of vitamin E oil to my moisturizer.)</li>
            <li> The bonus for me is the pumice stone attachment, works wonders on rough skin areas like heels and knees.</li>
            <li> took it out of the shower and everything inside was wet.</li>
            <li> After spending a few hours manically searching Amazon and through all of the different reviews and etc.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Pro-Nu Facial &amp; Body Cleansing Set for a few days now</li>
            <li> Just a little background on me: I am a 33 year old African American male who suffers from acne and a tendency to pick at any bump or scab on his face (don’t judge me – I’m standing in my truth).</li>
            <li> My pores look smaller and the pumice stone has cleared my dead dry dead skin.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> i would still rather have this than pay 200$ for the other model.</li>
            <li> When in use, even with new batteries, the rotation of the head is very slow.</li>
            <li> but you have to be little careful when you use that head on your face.</li>
            <li> you have tough as nails skin with absolutely no problems (i.e., tough as leather, no acne, no sensitivities, no tendency to burst capillaries, etc.), then this facial brush might work for you, because the bristles inevitably get hard and tougher with use, even in my soft water region, despite washing out the bristles carefully after every usage.  </li>
            <li> This item comes with different heads, although a few are small i like it.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the money or time.</li>
            <li> Aside from the price going down after I purchased it, I also realize that I prefer the rechargeable ones over the battery powered.</li>
            <li> So, against my friends judgment, I decided to scope out the “less costly” competition.</li>
            <li> , so the manufacturer must be obscure; the bristles inevitably become hard and irritating after only a few months of use, and are probably loaded with bacteria, despite disinfection, which can lead to further skin problems, and/or irritating because the bristles become harder and rougher with use.</li>
            <li> They felt a little flimsy but in retrospect, you wouldn&#x27;t want to use steel wool on your face.</li>
            <li> I placed my order and received my little scrubber  </li>
            <li> I know I have this neat little tool to use if needed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I add a little soap and scrub it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, it started to lag after just a few weeks.</li>
            <li> After a few months you can replace the cleaning head.</li>
            <li> i use it with St. Ives Blackhead Clearing Green Tea Scrub, 6 Oz.</li>
            <li> By cleaning them with this brush, it helps to shrinken your pores and get rid of dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> It has few heads which you can switch to.</li>
            <li> I used to have to scrub my face raw to get the dried and dead skin off of it.</li>
            <li> I usually use this to cleanse and exfoliate</li>
            <li> I have had a small, inexpensive version of a face brush for about a year and it does</li>
            <li> fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;It has a small brush for the face.</li>
            <li> mom, wife, and student I hardly have time for me to take a spa day...</li>
            <li> The internal rechargeable battery went bad after having it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I know it is water resistance but at least I do this to avoid any deactivate may happen to the device.</li>
            <li> My feet are very ticklish, I hate getting pedicures, because the pedicurist always tickles my feet.</li>
            <li> People, my skin is bad cover with blackheads, I&#x27;m hoping within a year i can have my skin back</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is because it is broken or if I am using it wrongly.</li>
            <li> There should be speed setting, it is very slow.</li>
            <li> I WAS WRONG.</li>
            <li> U won&#x27;t b sorry if u order it..</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m drowning (silly, I know).</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that it would work, but I’ve been using it for a couple of weeks now</li>
            <li> Unable to find replacement heads anywhere, either Amazon or the web</li>
            <li> It makes me look so pale and pasty and, if I wear leggings, once I go to take them off, it rubs the skin off and the leggings look disgusting.</li>
            <li> And since it&#x27;s impossible to find replacement brush heads for this unit anywhere, (Amazon or otherwise), you&#x27;re stuck with the aging brush heads.  </li>
            <li> Badly made, lasted all of 2 weeks, and brush stopped spinning</li>
            <li> I figured the batteries were going bad</li>
            <li> TOO BAD BECAUSE IT COMES WITH SOME NEAT BRUSHES AND PADS.  </li>
            <li> Now what I will not tell you is that this thing “changed my life and turned an ugly duckling into a swan.”</li>
            <li> I will say that I’m somewhat disappointed with the pumice head</li>
            <li> Very disappointing when you cant even start to see results.</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate to cleanse my skin because when I put water on my face</li>
            <li> Hate it!&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It is much better than the other twice as costly facial cleaners available in the market. I use this as often as I can and my skin looks amazing. It is gentle and affordable and worth every penny. Ladies, You will Iove this!  I do and I plan to order some more to give as a gift.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product; just be prepared to have 4 (four AA sized batteries available to load the battery bay in the handle) to use it.)</li>
            <li> This facial cleansing kit works great. The heads are easy to change out. They all do specific things for my face and skin. The brush heads are so soft and feel so nice on my face. I feel like I&#x27;m getting a deep cleansing. I&#x27;m glad to have been given the opportunity to test this product at a special price, and share my experiences and feedback. I like that the pumice stone a lot. I feel like I&#x27;m getting a deep facial that&#x27;s removing  all the dead skin and dirt. It&#x27;s gentle but use it too long in one spot and it will hurt. I also like that it&#x27;s waterproof. It makes it more convenient for me. I can use this while I&#x27;m in the shower. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Worked great for one use, after that would not even turn on. Very disappointing when you cant even start to see results.</li>
            <li> It supposedly has 2 speeds. The button has &amp;#34;l&amp;#34; on and &amp;#34;O&amp;#34; which if you push lightly, clicks and the spinner stops and starts again, if you push in completely it turns the unit off. I could not tell a difference between the speeds!? However, the unit has good speed and power. I was pleasantly surprised. When I first turned it on, it sounded &amp;#34;weak&amp;#34;, as though once touched to something it would stop spinning. But, I have used all but the pumice, ie the facial brush, the buffer sponge and the body brush and it has worked great! I have only used it 3 times, only time will tell how it holds up long term! But well worth the price especially when compared to brands being sold for $100&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> Most useful for me is the facial sponge that I use for applying foundation and serum on my face which I hated to do it with my fingers..this helps with even application.to remove makeup the brush helps me with my deep cleaning...perfect can be used anywhere wandering around the house....</li>
            <li> Works very well, easy to use, does not eat batteries can be used in the shower.</li>
            <li> This facial is by far the best and affordable. It&#x27;s gentle on the skin and easy to clean the brushes. I love the different brush heads and I use them daily. I would recommend this product and I&#x27;ve tried the clarisonic.</li>
            <li> so fresh &amp; so clean clean</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. It arrived on time and she&#x27;s been using it ever since. Good product.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first. I thought this was going to be a cheap inferior product that was a Mia knock off. I WAS WRONG. I&#x27;ll start with observations then I&#x27;ll get into what it&#x27;s done for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Packaging: It was super easy to get into. Nothing super fancy but it was packaged very well and arrived in perfect condition. Easy to open and get to the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Pro-Nu unit: The contoured handle fit in my hand perfectly. I have carpal tunnel so holding onto things can be an issue at times. I loved that this was a perfect size. Not too big, not too small and easy to grip. The unit came with four attachments. Two facial (facial brush and facial sponge), a body brush, and a small pumice stone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Power: The one thing that annoys me about the Pro-Nu (but not enough to be a deal breaker..) is that it takes four AA batteries. It would be nice if it were rechargeable. Side note: Getting the endcap off is a beast.... UNLESS you read the directions... but  hey.... who reads directions? Directions are for chumps! (Kidding. Read them. It&#x27;ll make getting it off easy. So easy you&#x27;ll feel like your forehead sloped a bit more than it should have... you know.... before you read the directions.) This unit has two brush settings. They both work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Functionally: The attachments snap on securely and when the Pro-Nu is switched on it spins in a 360 degree circle. I was soooo happy about this. I&#x27;ve purchased units before that just vibrated. The Pro-Nu does the work for you. All you do is hold it. It&#x27;s that easy. Did I forget to mention that it&#x27;s waterproof?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. The attachments: I wasn&#x27;t too sure about these. They felt a little flimsy but in retrospect, you wouldn&#x27;t want to use steel wool on your face. The one I had the most concern about was the sponge. So far so good. I cleaned with soap and water and allowed to air dry. If you don&#x27;t want to use a detergent, I&#x27;d imagine soaking in a vinegar water solution would be good. (Don&#x27;t over do the vinegar, you want just enough to sanitize.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE VERDICT:&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin. Well... VERY sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve used this three times so far. I thought my regular routine was good enough. Upon my first time using the Pro-Nu I saw a major difference. I could see the dirt that was removed from my skin on the brush! My skin felt clean and refreshed without the irritation. When following up with moisturizer on the sponge I was gobsmacked. My moisturizer actually absorbed soooo much better instead of sitting on top of my skin! I woke up the next morning with soft, smooth skin that felt softer than usual. I love this and will continue to use it! It cleanses my skin without making it angry lol. (I use Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Facial Cream and Burt&#x27;s Bees Sensitive Daily Moisturizing Cream. For my night regimen I do the same except for adding a few drops of vitamin E oil to my moisturizer.)over do the vinegar, you want just enough to sanitize.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE VERDICT:&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin.

            <li> This product is pretty good for the price. It does its job. This item comes with different heads, although a few are small i like it. The rotation isnt very fast not slow but its ok. I usually use this to cleanse and exfoliate</li>
            <li> awesome product..... my dermatologist office staff tried to persuade me to buy the super expensive brand when i last visited my derm&#x27;s office, she insisted it had to be clarasonic.. but i went online and saw this one, I read the reviews  and thought I&#x27;d give this one a try.&lt;br /&gt;i must say it is super awesome, not a bit of regret. I actually think it cleans better than the &amp;#34;brand&amp;#34; one i used in my derm&#x27;s office.&lt;br /&gt;If you are thinking of a facial brush and don&#x27;t want to spend hundreds of $$$. This is THE ONE.&lt;br /&gt;I am not affiliated with the product, just a customer who tried it and loves it.....</li>
            <li> I have been using this every day since i bought it. In the shower even works wonders on my skin.I want buy my husband one stince it comes with a several scrub brushes and a body brush.</li>
            <li> OMG! If you don&#x27;t have one of these, you need to hurry up and get one! Like, yesterday! This brush is absolutely amazing. It has four different attachments to use. One pumice stone attachment to effortlessly and easily pamper and exfoliate your feet and elbows. A super soft attachment you can use to massage moisturizer into your skin. A large and small soft nylon brush. The bristles of the brushes are so soft and delicate even for my very sensitive skin. The large brush can be used on the body to polish away and impurities to reveal healthier looking skin. The smaller soft brush is absolutely perfect for cleansing your face. I have used it with a foam cleanser, gel cleanser, and even a facial scrub. The brushes never leave my skin red or irritated. The small facial brush seriously exfoliates my face perfectly. I used to have to scrub my face raw to get the dried and dead skin off of it. The great thing about this brush is that it&#x27;s waterproof. You can bring it in the shower with you and not worry about the battery chamber getting flooded and ruining the device. I love how easy my makeup comes up. I love how the large bristle brush exfoliates my body and makes it feel amazingly soft. I have a super expensive $200 facial brush that I just thought was the best thing ever until it finally died and I needed a replacement. I am so glad I got this one and saved so much money. It has two speeds just like the one I used to have. One for deep cleansing and one for gentle cleansing. This product is made with such amazing quality! I have already recommended it to multiple people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product received for testing and review*</li>
            <li> Works great and I can&#x27;t tell the difference between the 170 Mia thing I brought my mom. Oh this comes with four different attachments too. Great product! Recommend over the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> The machine quite working after two months. Although the instructions say it is waterproof, it is not. The battery compartment was damp.</li>
            <li> Love the price and this works great!</li>
            <li> This given as a gift and the recipient seems happy with it.</li>
            <li> Nice little brush.  Not too abrasive and has gentle exfoliation for the skin. Price is right too.  Shipping was good, as usual.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough about this kit! I have always had skin issues and have tried so many skin care products to no avail, until now! There is a marked difference in my face and my skin feels so smooth! The bonus for me is the pumice stone attachment, works wonders on rough skin areas like heels and knees. I was able to grab this product on a promotion and am so glad I did for all the beneficial skin care I can now provide myself with at home. The item arrived intact and in working condition.</li>
            <li> Its a very good item and the price was perfect. U won&#x27;t b sorry if u order it..I could use a stronger circulating brush for legs as it feels too light but it&#x27;s great for the face and I feel smoother skin using it.</li>
            <li> For the price, you cannot beat it.  The first one I received was defective, but they were great and replaced it for me.</li>
            <li> Very nice set for the price. Just as good as the more expensive types...does what it&#x27;s meant to do</li>
            <li> The Pro-Nu Facial and Body Ultra Brush is like heaven on my face!!! Being a full time mom, wife, and student I hardly have time for me to take a spa day... well now I can take a spa day any day right in the comfort of my own home. All the attachments that come with it are super beneficial to help making you feel like the pretty that you are! It comes with a facial brush, facial buffer, pumice stone, and a body brush. I am super pleased with the power and speed of the motor. I did receive this for review purposes and I have to say this is one of the most awesome things I have gotten!</li>
            <li> Batteries last a long time. Does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate to cleanse my skin because when I put water on my face I feel like I&#x27;m drowning (silly, I know). Well with this nifty tool I don&#x27;t have to worry about that! I simply attach the head and get to work beautifying my skin without having to submerge my face with water! The rotating head is not uncomfortable in the slightest bit. I was able to purchase this for review during a promotional period and my opinions are unbiased and my own. I really like this product and I even recommended it to my sister. It is a must have beauty tool.</li>
            <li> Impressed thus far with this item. I utilized the face brush and sponge and felt the difference after my wash. My face was very smooth and soft to the touch. I cannot wait to use the body brush!</li>
            <li> I have used the brush multiple times and I love it, it leaves my skin super soft and clean. I only use the brushes, the small for the face, and the big one for other parts of the body, mainly legs. The speed and bristles work perfect on my skin. It says it is waterproof, but I have never used it under the shower ( I do not want to take the risk).</li>
            <li> Product is cheaply designed and does not have the power behind it as a MIa or similar product. When in use, even with new batteries, the rotation of the head is very slow. Definitely not worth the money or time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. it does what it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li> Got this for my mom and she loves it. She said it has just the right amount of power. Not too strong. Not too soft.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a PIXNOR one for my grandmom and I will be taking it back as it isn&#x27;t build nearly as well as this one and not nearly as strong.&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest this.</li>
            <li> Works great, so far so good. Priced very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Water go into it. Now full of battery rust and can&#x27;t use it- after only a few months.</li>
            <li> Badly made, lasted all of 2 weeks, and brush stopped spinning</li>
            <li> This is not waterproof. I really loved this product. I didn&#x27;t have faith that it would work but it really did.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it started to lag after just a few weeks. I figured the batteries were going bad quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I took it out of the shower and everything inside was wet. I took out the batteries and was going to let it dry out but then I noticed the mold. That just kept growing.&lt;br /&gt;I am highly allergic to mold so threw it away.&lt;br /&gt;So although it says it is waterproof, I would encourage you to shelter it as much as you can. Then it will be a really good product.</li>
            <li> I love the little facial scrubber, but the bigger one is a bit awkward for me. The foot scrubber works great too.</li>
            <li> Get&#x27;s the job done, doesn&#x27;t last very long..</li>
            <li> Just a little background on me: I am a 33 year old African American male who suffers from acne and a tendency to pick at any bump or scab on his face (don’t judge me – I’m standing in my truth). Now what I will not tell you is that this thing “changed my life and turned an ugly duckling into a swan.” But what I will tell you is that, for the cost, you really can’t go wrong with the Pro-Nu facial scrubber. I was on the phone one day talking to my best friend about skin remedies (yep guys have those discussions too) and he suggested that I look into getting a Clarisonic. I looked into the Clarisonic and saw the price and I looked elsewhere. I wasn’t about to spend $100+ for an oversized power toothbrush without some sort of guarantee that it would cook my breakfast and make my bed. So, against my friends judgment, I decided to scope out the “less costly” competition. After spending a few hours manically searching Amazon and through all of the different reviews and etc. and decided to go with this one. It offered the most (water proof, multiple heads) with the least amount of risk. I placed my order and received my little scrubber  and it has become my morning salvation! Did this thing cure my acne? Nope, that requires a change and diet and so on… However it has helped to greatly reduce the acne scars that take forever to heal and clear. It does a great job at exfoliating your skin. I’ve been using it since May with the same set of batteries. The big brush is good to use on your skin while in the shower. Since I have short hair I decided to try the big brush out on my head and IT FEELS AMAZING! (again I have short, coarse hair so I can do that. If you have long locks you probably don’t want to go risking them getting tangled up in this spinning brush – you’ve been warned!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I will say that I’m somewhat disappointed with the pumice head – it’s rather small and seems like it doesn’t really do much for my feet. Then again, it does a little but just seems totake more time than I want to spend trying to balance myself on 1 foot while in the shower. I probably need something more on the lines of a professional sander to tackle these toes. Anywho, I am happy with my purchase. I even ordered one as a “gag gift” for my mom on her birthday before I gave her the real gift that I got her – expecting a reaction like “SO WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY? I NEED NEW SKIN?” but no.. she was actually excited about receiving it and uses it on her feet all the time.  It is about time for me to look for replacement brush heads for this thing but if I can’t I’ll just order a new Pro-Nu since the cost more than justifies the purchase. Perhaps I could use the old brush heads with some paint and make some art with this thing.. Hmm…</li>
            <li> This is great. It really has worked well on my skin. I really do love this and I used this right before I use my derma roller. This is one product that I would definetly recommend to anyone that wants good nice  skin.</li>
            <li> The facial brush was somewhat rough on my skin..but I do have sensitive skin anyways. I use this twice a week to keep up my regimen of at home facial cleaning. I really haven&#x27;t used the other parts that came with it. I just bought it for the facial head it had good reviews and relatively good price. One thing I do have to say I wish it was rechargeable..I really didn&#x27;t check before buying it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Pro-Nu Facial &amp; Body Cleansing Set for a few days now &amp; I am already loving this set. I always love to try new things out there &amp; this is one I had to try. Especially one you have at your disposal whenever you need when you need.&lt;br /&gt; In the couple of days I have been using this I have seen immediate results when using the facial brush &amp; facial buffer. These two works really well I had some peeling near the chin &amp; sides of my jar area and these two brushes worked very well at removing all the dead skin I had. It really does deep clean &amp; get the dirt of that you normally wouldn&#x27;t if you were to just manually clean your face. My face felt super clean afterwords &amp; my vitamnin C serum &amp; organic punch skin cream is what I used afterwards. I really felt that my face was getting more benefit from the creams/serum I used because of this deep cleaning product. Way better than using your hands to wash your face with.&lt;br /&gt; I was able to try the body brush with my homemade sugar exfoliating scrub which they recommend using &amp; I suggest you trying it as well. It really does feel amazing because my body felt as if I was washing away all the dead skin away. This definitely will be having you feel like a brand new lady. It does require more time in the shower but it outweighs the benefits.You also receive a pumice stone attachment that you can use on your feet. It does all the work for you because of the 360degree rotation versus scrubbing your feet with a pumice sponge/stone which requires more manual labor from you. I did not get to use it daily as my feet are already soft &amp; currently in great shape. But I do have days when they start to get dry in some areas and I like that I know I have this neat little tool to use if needed.&lt;br /&gt; So overall I love it!!&lt;br /&gt;-Made well durable and good quality materials were used to make it.&lt;br /&gt;-Waterproof feature&lt;br /&gt;-4 attachments to help improve the look/feel of your skin&lt;br /&gt;-Affordable price&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to take with you on trips/easy to store so you are never left without it&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to operate/use&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;Some of the things I disliked:&lt;br /&gt;-The sponge looks like it might be replaced sooner than other attachments which will last longer because when using making up it may stain if not washed off well.

            <li> Not 1 but  4 brushes! The body brush is bigger than I thought it would be and I love it. My main reason for even wanting this product was the facial brush. I have always wanted one but I did not know which one would be better suited for me, this one has everything!  The facial brush is firm but not  hard where is would damage of break the skin. Dead skin was removed very gently from my face allowing my skin to breath and regenerate. I used this product at night as I was concerned about any redness, there was none. It does not come with batteries so be prepared. I did leave it out to dry before I packaged it back up for later use. Overall, I like it and would purchase one for my teenager.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*this product was purchased using a coupon and details my personal experience using this*</li>
            <li> I have been using this Pro-Nu Facial &amp; Body Cleansing Set for a few days now and I really like this set. I always love to try new things out there and this is one I had to try.&lt;br /&gt;In the couple of days I have been using this I have seen immediate results when using the facial brush &amp; facial buffer. These two works really well togather. My face is always peeling from being dry but, I had some peeling on my forehead and cheeks and these two brushes worked very well at removing all the dead skin I had. It really does deep clean. My face felt super clean afterwords. I really felt that my face was getting more benefit from the creams/serum I uses because of this deep cleaning product. This is way better than using your hands or wash cloth to wash your face with.&lt;br /&gt;I tried the body brush and really didn&#x27;t like it. The on/off switch kept turning off. Then I couldn&#x27;t get it to stay on. This definitely will be having you feel like a brand new lady. I also receive a pumice stone attachment that you can use on your feet. It does all the work for you because of the 360 rotation versus scrubbing your feet with a pumice stone which requires more manual labor from you.&lt;br /&gt;So overall I like it!!&lt;br /&gt;-Made well durable and good quality materials were used to make it.&lt;br /&gt;-Waterproof feature&lt;br /&gt;-4 attachments to help improve the look/feel of your skin&lt;br /&gt;-Affordable price&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to take with you on trips/easy to store so you are never left without it&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to operate/use&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;Some of the things I disliked:&lt;br /&gt;On switch doesn&#x27;t stay on so I have to hold it on which is a pain!&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t find the two speeds that it says it has.&lt;br /&gt;When using body brush at first it kept throwing the on switch off.</li>
            <li> this is amazing. I love it. I took a long bath and used all the attachments. it makes your whole body feel refreshed. I would recommend this for anyone wanting to enjoy the benefits of the spa at home.</li>
            <li> Really loved this item.I have tan on my body and used all types of scrubbers but nothing worked out.Am using this since 2 weeks and saw a lot of difference  before and after.Now my skin feels very soft and shiny.I bought one more item and gifted to my friend and got good feedback from her too(proved to be totally a worth gift).Totally loved this item.Would recommend to any one.</li>
            <li> sometimes it doesnt &amp;#34;stay&amp;#34; on and i have to keep my thumb on the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; switch. sometimes you get what you pay for. i would still rather have this than pay 200$ for the other model.</li>
            <li> I first saw a product like this at a Mary Kay party that I attended. I fell in love and wanted one, but not a Mary Kay branded one! I had an issue with the first one that I received, so I contacted the company and they were super fast in rectifying the situation. I use this product every day, and love it. It cleans everything off of my face and leaves my skin feeling refreshed. I apply my skin products with the sponge pad, and love it. It&#x27;s better than using your fingers and getting all those oils on your face. I used the larger pad on my body, my skin had been peeling from a sun burn and the large surface helped get everything off. My feet are very ticklish, I hate getting pedicures, because the pedicurist always tickles my feet. you can&#x27;t tickle yourself though! The rough pad is for your feet, perfect to give yourself some pampering. This would be a great item to through into a  pampering gift basket. I received this product for instructional purposes in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.</li>
            <li> All of my friends have the Clarisonic Skin Care system and I&#x27;ve been completely jealous until now.  When I saw this item available through a promotional offer I couldn&#x27;t wait to get it!  I am not disappointed, this little gadget is so wonderful and at a fraction of the cost of the Clarisonic.  My skin has NEVER glowed or felt as smooth as it does after using this!  If you are on a budget like me I suggest you give it a try.  I love that it has the four various attachment heads and can be used on your face and with a simple change of the attachments it can be used on your feet!  You need this in your life!</li>
            <li> I love this brush set. The small  facial brush works wonderful with my facial cleanser, exfoliating and cleansing all at once. The sponge head is great if you just want to use for a gentle face cleansing or for applying moisturizer. The body brush works great as a dry brush to help promote circulation to hips, thighs and stomach before showering, and works amazing with my body wash and a bit of baking soda for exfoliating and getting rid of that dry dead winter skin while showering. The pumice stone works wonders for my dry heals it makes them feel soft and smooth, no more feet snagging on the blankets at night. The only reason I gave this brush 4 stars instead of 5 was due to the larger body brush falling off of the handle while using. Overall a great product.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much that after the first one came, I decided to order a second. I&#x27;ve also recommended this product to some of my friends and they are all very excited about it. I really want to give it 5-stars but after having it for about a week, I noticed that at times when I am using it on my face, it would randomly stop working without me touching the power buttons. Found it really odd, but it didn&#x27;t bother me much since it only happened once in a while. But today, when I was washing my face, it stopped on its own at times 10 times in the 3 minutes I was using it. I am not sure if it is because it is broken or if I am using it wrongly. I really hope there is a solution to this because I really love this handy little brush!</li>
            <li> I love this product! This skin cleansing brush does wonders. It comes with 4 different attachments. And they&#x27;re all useful. I&#x27;m so happy with this brush. Wish I bought it sooner. My skins so soft :)</li>
            <li> This brush is doing wonders on my skin!  I was skeptical that it would work, but I’ve been using it for a couple of weeks now and I look and feel exponentially better.  This brush has helped firm my skin, and it looks much healthier without all of those dead cells hanging on all the time.  Plus, it’s very good for my pores.</li>
            <li> I am in absolute heaven with this product. I love it so much! I have always wanted one but could not fathom paying what they charge at retail stores like ULTA. This is gentle on my sensitive skin and gets the job done. I&#x27;m so grateful I purchased this product, and will be returning&#x27;</li>
            <li> totally in love with my pro-nu! i have been wanting one of these type brushes for some time now but didn&#x27;t want to pay the several hundred dollar price tag for some of the other types out there. i am so happy with this purchase! my skin feels so much smoother and clearer now! my pores are clean and minimized and my daily serums are so much more effective now! i highly recommend this one!</li>
            <li> Item is great, brushes are gentle on my sensitive skin. Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Product as advertised. It was dropped once and fell apart, but was very surprised when it still worked after putting it back together. Good product!</li>
            <li> First of all  -  I&#x27;m a guy.  I&#x27;ve always had large pores on my nose and, my ears and nose always end up greasy by the end of the day. The  Pro-Nu works fine to completely cleans my face.  You definatly feel the difference.  I also use it on my butt to help keep pimples at bay. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two minor issues.  I would prefer the on/off switch to be on the top/outside of the handle.  A rechargable option would be nice.  I&#x27;d gladly pay a few more $$$$ for that.  We&#x27;ll see how long the batteries last.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it.  Makes her feel soft and really clean. She said it&#x27;s the best thing they could&#x27;ve made</li>
            <li> I bought and then returned this item.  Aside from the price going down after I purchased it, I also realize that I prefer the rechargeable ones over the battery powered.</li>
            <li> As advertised, quick shipment, great product. Recommended seller.</li>
            <li> Just a cheap made product. The internal rechargeable battery went bad after having it for a few weeks. I then opened the item before I trashed it and saw the battery was highly corroded.</li>
            <li> Very happy great value</li>
            <li> I am in love with my Pro-Nu Facial brush!!! I had those tiny facial brushes I purchased at the store, but the refill heads were becoming very expensive. I decided to get one of these and I do not regret it at all! I love how its not so harsh on my face and body. I love that it is waterproof and comes with all the different types of heads to use for different reasons. I love the pumice head letting me deep clean my feet keeping the dead skin and callous away. My husband also uses this and loves it!. We are very happy with this.</li>
            <li> It is sort of scratchy but it leaves my skin feeling pretty smooth</li>
            <li> Love this Device. It makes my skin very clean, fresh and Glowy. The Body brush is not harsh to the skin. It spins just right. To avoid any deficit in operating just detach the brush before washing it and also wipe the device it self with a wet cloth instead of running the water directly on it. I know it is water resistance but at least I do this to avoid any deactivate may happen to the device.</li>
            <li> Love this so far. I like how it has two brushes, a sponge, and pumice stone. The stone is for your feet. The sponge pad is for putting face cream on. The bigger brush is for your body, and the smaller brush is for your face. I really wanted this so bad, because it is comparable to the Clarisonic ones, and way better priced. My skin isn&#x27;t irritated. The brush is gentle enough, yet effective for removing the dead skin cells and dirt. After a few months you can replace the cleaning head. I use this with my acne skin cleansing gel. I also use rechargeable batteries so you know there is no wiring on the device to get in the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be posting before and after pictures later.</li>
            <li> The body and face brushes are great the pumice  attachment not so much</li>
            <li> Granddaughter love it.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush with so many uses! I love how it comes with one full size brush head and 3 smaller ones. This is a nice machine. The pumice stone works wonders on my feet and is way easier to use this than an actual pumice stone. It works way better and has more power behind it to clean up your feet. The attachments are easy to swap on and off and they came in a nice gift box to keep them all stored in. The face brush cleans your face and makes it look amazing as well. I received this as a gift to share my experiences while using it.</li>
            <li> This is such a jewel to anyone&#x27;s beauty routine. This little genius is light weight, comes with easy interchangeable attachments that will help you from head to toe; and leave you feeling great.</li>
            <li> i use it with St. Ives Blackhead Clearing Green Tea Scrub, 6 Oz. these two are my life saver right now. Dermatologists told me I will need 10 years for my blackheads to clear out but I only being using these two for two weeks now and can see a difference. People, my skin is bad cover with blackheads, I&#x27;m hoping within a year i can have my skin back and i can go to the beach again :)</li>
            <li> I have only had this item for two days now and I LOVE it already. I think that my favorite part is the pumice stone, my feet are in heaven I tell you! I love that there are 4 changeable head units for this device. My face felt fresh and  invigorated after using the brush head with some of my facial cleanser. It is so simple to use that it is a cinch making this part of your daily routine.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:moNEDIHD7PZWEG]]</li>
            <li> Great value for the price!  I&#x27;m never going to spend $100s of dollars on a face brush!....so this was a perfect fit. It comes with 4 attachments: 1) a face sponge 2)small brush to use on face to exfoliate 3) a bigger brush to use on hands, feet, &amp; body 4) a pumice stone (my favorite for my feet) The unit is battery operated, although you need to purchase them separately.  Overall, this is a handy unit and a good value for the price</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love micro brushes???!!! This works great to brush and clear off any dead skin!  It comes 4 different attachments. The stone looking like thing kinda scared me but now it is my favorite!  I thought it was going to peel my skin away but it does and makes me feel like I have clean new skin every time I use it!</li>
            <li> Everything you need for healthier skin. Exfoliates and cleanses all in one tool.  4 different heads, face, sponge, pumice and brush. This is waterproof so I use this along with my cleanser in the shower.  Exfoliate your entire body with the pumice and use the sponge on more delicate areas.  Use the pumice stone on my feet to keep them soft. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I have had a small, inexpensive version of a face brush for about a year and it does okay but I never realized how big a difference a quality, versatile brush would make until I received this. I mean, I&#x27;ve been able to eliminate a few products because this can not only replace them but it can out perform them 100%.&lt;br /&gt;I love that it&#x27;s waterproof so I am able to use it in the shower or tub or even in the living room after a good foot soak. Ahh... It&#x27;s like heaven!&lt;br /&gt;My face is combination:  oily and dry. I&#x27;m constantly flaking around the cheeks, eyebrows, forehead and the skin on my body is horribly dry, flaky and itchy. It makes me look so pale and pasty and, if I wear leggings, once I go to take them off, it rubs the skin off and the leggings look disgusting. It&#x27;s like my legs have dandruff or I&#x27;m a snake coming out of my skin..  Hate it!&lt;br /&gt;So, what makes this brush system so special? Let&#x27;s start with what you get and what it&#x27;s used for.&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned before, this unit is waterproof, which makes it a great addition to your bath, shower or a foot soaker. It&#x27;s also cordless, which is a little obvious... no electrical appliances in water!!! It spins so you get a full, continuous scrubbing.&lt;br /&gt;You get the large brush, which is best used on larger parts of the body. I love this because my legs, arms, and torso get dry and flaky. This weather really does a job on my skin. I can put it on the Pro-Nu and take it into the shower with me, along with an all natural, glycerin filled soap and scrub it all away. I feel so clean, soft and silky smooth. Once out of the shower, I apply a body oil or butter.... I feel fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;It has a small brush for the face. It&#x27;s great for exfoliating, cleaning off makeup that causes a lot of our problems: blackheads, dirty pores blemishes. By cleaning them with this brush, it helps to shrinken your pores and get rid of dead skin cells. This is great for me because I have combination skin: extremely oily on the forehead, nose and chin but dry and flaky in those areas, too. I add just a dab of exfoliator to the brush, dampen my face and scrub for a couple minutes. Leaves my face clean and smooth. I then rub in a moisturizer or some type of natural oil.&lt;br /&gt;Next, there&#x27;s a pumice stone head that is just perfect for my feet. They, too, get dry spots and the skin gets really rough and flaky. I add a little soap and scrub it all right off then add a lotion or oil.&lt;br /&gt;The last attachment is a beauty cotton attachment. It massages to help stimulate your skin and restore metabolism and elasticity.&lt;br /&gt;I just love it. It&#x27;s fast and easy to use. the heads just pop on and off. Within minutes you can restore your skin back to its original glory.... Smooth as a babies&#x27; bottom!</li>
            <li> EVEN WITH NEW BATTERIES THIS BRUSH DID NOT WORK, SO BACK TO AMAZON IT WENT. TOO BAD BECAUSE IT COMES WITH SOME NEAT BRUSHES AND PADS.  IF THE MFR. CAN MAKE THE PRODUCT WORK OUT OF THE BOX, THEN I&#x27;LL BUY IT AGAIN</li>
            <li> There should be speed setting, it is very slow. Facial brush bristle are very soft &amp; massage sponge is of no use.</li>
            <li> I bought these for the &amp;#34;2 speed&amp;#34; it adverties, but I guess it means on is one speed and off is another? However, it does make my face feel better, I just wish it did have the two speed option.</li>
            <li> Just used it for the first time! I love it except that I hope it is not going to stop working as I smelled like it was over heating and really did not use it long.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful set.  My daughter has been wanting one of these face scrubbers for a while and this set is a great one.  It no only includes the face brush but also a pumice stone for feet, a larger brush for legs and body and a make-up sponge attachment as well.  It takes 4 AA batteries that are no included and I can&#x27;t say how long that will last yet.  It is a nice size and the handle will be easy to hold even wet.  She is very pleased with the product and so am I.</li>
            <li> I have been looking to purchase a product like this for quit sometime and I just love this product! It makes your face feel very clean and soft and smooth! I highly recommended this product to those who have been trying to find the right treatment for their pores and having it scrubbed clean! The item is battery powered and they are not include. It is nice that it comes with multiple brushes for different uses.</li>
            <li> If your looking for an amazing facial cleansing brush look no further. This Pro-Nu waterproof electric facial cleansing brush is great! I love all the different attachments it comes with, the small brush, the large brush, pumice stone and buffer brush. My face feels so much cleaner after using this brush. My pores look smaller and the pumice stone has cleared my dead dry dead skin. This brush has the perfect amount of power to get a good clean but also feels gentle and relaxing. My skin looks great and I owe it all to this facial cleanser. I purchased this product during a promotion and the views I have expressed are my own.</li>
            <li> Gentle, for your money you get a lot.</li>
            <li> Amazing brush. I was looking for some product which can work deeply in my skin. This product is amazing. I tried it on my face, hands and legs. It has few heads which you can switch to. The small hard one is great to remove dead skin but you have to be little careful when you use that head on your face. Dont spend too much time at 1 spot with that head. It deeply cleans the skin. Im&lt;br /&gt;100% satisfies with this product.</li>
            <li> I love my Pro-Nu microderm abrasion brush! All of the different heads give a different experience and all are very pleasant.</li>
            <li> this is a wonderful product. the pores are smaller my face is smoother. my face is glowing every time i use it. i would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for three months and have very mixed feelings about it.&lt;br /&gt;If you have tough as nails skin with absolutely no problems (i.e., tough as leather, no acne, no sensitivities, no tendency to burst capillaries, etc.), then this facial brush might work for you, because the bristles inevitably get hard and tougher with use, even in my soft water region, despite washing out the bristles carefully after every usage.  And since it&#x27;s impossible to find replacement brush heads for this unit anywhere, (Amazon or otherwise), you&#x27;re stuck with the aging brush heads.  After a couple of months, I found it was making my skin problems worse, not better, and my skin was massively irritated and inflamed until I stopped using the brush entirely, and went back to using clean hands and a gentler touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s:  Mechanically reliable; lower price than many other similar brushes; different heads to use (but only one of each!).&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s:  Unable to find replacement heads anywhere, either Amazon or the web, so the manufacturer must be obscure; the bristles inevitably become hard and irritating after only a few months of use, and are probably loaded with bacteria, despite disinfection, which can lead to further skin problems, and/or irritating because the bristles become harder and rougher with use.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I use an exfoliant and always before I had to use my fingers to gently massage the exfoliant into my face. This appliance does a much more thorough job. Easy to use. I love it!</li>
            <li> Just as advertised.trusted seller.</li>
            <li> This product is very practial. It is battery operated ( they&#x27;re not included but they are the basic AA batteries that are easy to find) which is neat because you dont have to worry about charging  it. I just leave it in the shower and I dont have to worry about it because it is charged and waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;This product is so wonderful. The body brush is great for your back, helps to reach more areas without having to do so much movement. The pumice works perfect for filing calluses whether they are on your feet or hands. The facial brushes work wonderful, I really enjoy washing my face with the brush because I feel like it is taking off all the suncream, cream, or make up.&lt;br /&gt;Note: I received this at a promotional price, and I am leaving my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
