            <li>These work great and are very gentle on the eye area.</li>
            <li>She said the eye mask feels more applied tape under her eyes and lacks ...</li>
            <li>They worked WONDERFULLY on both upper and lower.</li>
            <li>I love these things.</li>
            <li>Ok, let me not think of that.</li>
            <li>My husband and I love these.</li>
            <li>Stuff is ok.  </li>
            <li>Not my favorite</li>
            <li>I love to put them on in the mornings.</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any difference but it feels nice and cool.</li>
            <li>Been using for a while now and although the long term effects aren&#x27;t there, they&#x27;re fabulous for a day where your nights sleep hasn&#x27;t been the best.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice , fast delivery</li>
            <li>First, I got them on sale at ULTA, buy one get one free, so they were quite cheap.</li>
            <li>- popped these guys on for 30 minutes (as described in the directions) and my eyes looked as if I had a full nights rest.</li>
            <li>would probably buy these again if they were on sale, but at full price, the results aren&#x27;t good enough.</li>
            <li>However, I have become a loyal fan of these.</li>
            <li>They work great for puffiness and dark circles.</li>
            <li>but I increased my intake long ago and continued to have a good potassium intake</li>
            <li>These patches certainly felt nice and cool and my eyes felt refreshed, but the puffiness was barely diminished.</li>
            <li>A bit expensive, but worked great and nice to know</li>
            <li>Having only 5 packs is veryyyy less and dont know good enuf to check the impact but am not gonna buy more to check that</li>
            <li>I just realize I have to be consistent, and hopefully this company doesn&#x27;t go out of business.</li>
            <li>The product is good , soothing for eyes but my main purpose was for dark circles and it didnt help.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how dark circles take away from your appearance, so I have continued and will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li>Though it takes a few weeks to see, just once or twice a week makes a huge difference!!</li>
            <li>The product came fast.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about 3 months straight, twice a week as the instructions recommend.</li>
            <li>They really moisturize and refresh your eyes and face.</li>
            <li>and I stopped after I didn&#x27;t see much results.</li>
            <li>They really reduce my under-eye swelling</li>
            <li>i like this product, but didn&#x27;t see much of a result.</li>
            <li>Will of course use the rest since they are paid for but did not see why product reviewed so highly</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>it the affects lasted for the whole 12 hours, I start out looking super, end up well back to my old wrinkly self ......</li>
            <li>My eyes are so much more refreshed, and now my concealer does not settle into the little lines I do have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and when I put my expensive eye cream on after I remove the patches, my eyes look great.  </li>
            <li>I put the patches on opposite (so the smaller ends are on my eyelids) and left on for about 15 more minutes.</li>
            <li>I used this product as a skeptic, but after a few days I did notice a big difference; although I used it in conjunction with The Garnier Eye Roller, L&#x27;Oreal Collagen Filler, and drinking alot more H20, they all did the job.</li>
            <li>I applied them to my clean face right after a bath and did other little errands while they were on.  </li>
            <li>they require a long use of this item, but for the price it is to use a few times a week, its better to invest in a eye cream.</li>
            <li>Slap those suckers on while you&#x27;re drinking your morning coffee for about 30 minutes and your eyes will definitely look better than they did before.</li>
            <li>My main problem is large puffy bags under my eyes and dark blue veins, but no dark circles.</li>
            <li>My eyes have darkish circles whether I&#x27;m tired or not but not terrible.</li>
            <li>These little things work pretty neat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them 3 times for the first week as recommended, and I already see a difference with dark circles under my eyes!</li>
            <li>I have some really puffy under eye bags and it only help reduce just a little bit.</li>

            <li> I have some really puffy under eye bags and it only help reduce just a little bit.</li>
            <li> I must say though that I didn&#x27;t order the product for like 2 weeks and the 3rd week when I finally ordered it and got it in the mail I noticed my dark circles starting to come back.  </li>
            <li> I spent a whole night crying due to a loss, woke up the next day and my eyes were swollen and puffy</li>
            <li> it really sticks to the delicate undereye</li>
            <li> and I still noticed the dark circles (so apparently that wasn&#x27;t the cause for me),</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using for long</li>
            <li> It feels like a sticky tape and dry.</li>
            <li> One partial came off but finally stuck after pressing and holding down for about 40 seconds.  </li>
            <li> but it does work a bit especially when you leave it in the fridge for a little while before applying.</li>
            <li> We are 40 years old and sometimes have to look refreshed for appointments or meetings and have partied to hard the night before, these under eye patches do the trick.</li>
            <li> However, the product itself is not what I expected.</li>
            <li> My eyes are usually puffy every morning due to allergies and being a side &amp; back sleeper.</li>
            <li> After trying creams, tea bags, spoons, vitamins, and any other \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; fix, I decided to give these a try.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;m almost through the first pack</li>
            <li> I have even cut these up to put on other places of my face.</li>
            <li> When I first ordered these I was skeptical of how well they would work.</li>
            <li> I have noticeable dark cirlces under my eyes.</li>
            <li> After about 2 months my dark circles were to my amazement almost gone, and I looked healthier when I looked at myself in the mirror.</li>
            <li> I have also heard that lacking potassium could cause you to have dark circles</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that they haven&#x27;t been in stock when I&#x27;ve wanted them.</li>
            <li> Not sure about them reduces wrinkles, but the patches are soooo soothing after a long day at work!</li>
            <li> I look like I&#x27;m half dead.</li>
            <li> so when you pull it off you have to tug a little.</li>
            <li> , only problems with it is that the paper on the skin all night is irritating and disturbs my sleep, keep trying to scratch</li>
            <li> Well, at least it works.</li>
            <li> But once I get tired, FORGET IT.</li>
            <li> I mean, do I have to use this for the rest of my life!!?</li>
            <li> Sorry, but I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement</li>
            <li> Expensive, but they work!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Wife bought it based on reviews.  She said the eye mask feels more applied tape under her eyes and lacks ... I think she said .... a lotion feel.  I don&#x27;t know.  I am not a woman so I will never know.  She will not repeat.</li>
            <li> The product came fast. However, the product itself is not what I expected. I have some really puffy under eye bags and it only help reduce just a little bit.</li>
            <li> These little things work pretty neat. My eyes are usually puffy every morning due to allergies and being a side &amp; back sleeper. I used them under my eyes for 30 minutes as directed. Then I thought I would try it on my eye lids. I put the patches on opposite (so the smaller ends are on my eyelids) and left on for about 15 more minutes. They worked WONDERFULLY on both upper and lower. A bit expensive, but worked great and nice to know I got the same result without having to smear skin tightening lotion all over my face.</li>
            <li> Maybe I should have allowed the patches to stay on over 30 minutes but after 30 minutes I did not see a difference.  I applied them to my clean face right after a bath and did other little errands while they were on.  One partial came off but finally stuck after pressing and holding down for about 40 seconds.  Will of course use the rest since they are paid for but did not see why product reviewed so highly</li>
            <li> I love these things. Though it takes a few weeks to see, just once or twice a week makes a huge difference!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 months straight, twice a week as the instructions recommend. I have noticeable dark cirlces under my eyes. My eyes have darkish circles whether I&#x27;m tired or not but not terrible. But once I get tired, FORGET IT. I look like I&#x27;m half dead. I noticed a definite difference after the 4th-5th week. You have to keep using it. After about 2 months my dark circles were to my amazement almost gone, and I looked healthier when I looked at myself in the mirror. It&#x27;s amazing how dark circles take away from your appearance, so I have continued and will continue to use this product. I must say though that I didn&#x27;t order the product for like 2 weeks and the 3rd week when I finally ordered it and got it in the mail I noticed my dark circles starting to come back.  I mean, do I have to use this for the rest of my life!!? Ok, let me not think of that. Well, at least it works. That&#x27;s all. I just realize I have to be consistent, and hopefully this company doesn&#x27;t go out of business. I have also heard that lacking potassium could cause you to have dark circles but I increased my intake long ago and continued to have a good potassium intake and I still noticed the dark circles (so apparently that wasn&#x27;t the cause for me), so that&#x27;s when I decided to finally get a product like this. I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> After trying creams, tea bags, spoons, vitamins, and any other \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; fix, I decided to give these a try. First, I got them on sale at ULTA, buy one get one free, so they were quite cheap. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m almost through the first pack and they aren&#x27;t as good as I hoped. My main problem is large puffy bags under my eyes and dark blue veins, but no dark circles. These patches certainly felt nice and cool and my eyes felt refreshed, but the puffiness was barely diminished. Also, I leave them on for 45-60 minutes to get results.&lt;br /&gt;I would probably buy these again if they were on sale, but at full price, the results aren&#x27;t good enough.</li>
            <li> I used this product as a skeptic, but after a few days I did notice a big difference; although I used it in conjunction with The Garnier Eye Roller, L&#x27;Oreal Collagen Filler, and drinking alot more H20, they all did the job. My eyes are so much more refreshed, and now my concealer does not settle into the little lines I do have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> My husband and I love these. We are 40 years old and sometimes have to look refreshed for appointments or meetings and have partied to hard the night before, these under eye patches do the trick. We place these on before bed and the next day there are no purple bags under your eyes, no swelling or puffiness. These work great and are very gentle on the eye area. I have even cut these up to put on other places of my face. They really moisturize and refresh your eyes and face. I would by these for friends and family as gifts. They make a great gift in a care package for college students.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;PS</li>
            <li> Stuff is ok.  Wife thought it was too sticky.  Plus, there aren&#x27;t enough pads to determine that it works.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using for long and I stopped after I didn&#x27;t see much results. It just sticks on your face and it easy to apply but its probably best to use this product in combination with sleep.</li>
            <li> The product is good , soothing for eyes but my main purpose was for dark circles and it didnt help.    Having only 5 packs is veryyyy less and dont know good enuf to check the impact but am not gonna buy more to check that</li>
            <li> Not my favorite but it does work a bit especially when you leave it in the fridge for a little while before applying.</li>
            <li> I bought these for travel because I don&#x27;t get a restful night&#x27;s sleep in unfamiliar surroundings.  They really reduce my under-eye swelling and when I put my expensive eye cream on after I remove the patches, my eyes look great.  Expensive, but they work!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice , fast delivery</li>
            <li> Not enough of moisturizing liquid...it really sticks to the delicate undereye so when you pull it off you have to tug a little.</li>
            <li> When I first ordered these I was skeptical of how well they would work. However, I have become a loyal fan of these. They work great for puffiness and dark circles. I love to put them on in the mornings. The only complaint I have is that they haven&#x27;t been in stock when I&#x27;ve wanted them. I will continue to purchase these whenever they are on here.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t even stay stuck on. Kept having to pick them up and try to restock them. They might work if you tape them to your face but for me they didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Sorry, but I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement</li>
            <li> Love these. Been using for a while now and although the long term effects aren&#x27;t there, they&#x27;re fabulous for a day where your nights sleep hasn&#x27;t been the best. Slap those suckers on while you&#x27;re drinking your morning coffee for about 30 minutes and your eyes will definitely look better than they did before.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference but it feels nice and cool.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product. It feels like a sticky tape and dry. Did not notice an effect at all.</li>
            <li> It works great, only problems with it is that the paper on the skin all night is irritating and disturbs my sleep, keep trying to scratch cause it itches. Also I work 12 hour shifts and it would be nice it the affects lasted for the whole 12 hours, I start out looking super, end up well back to my old wrinkly self ......LOLOL</li>
            <li> We are in the middle of alergy season, and wake up with lots of puffieness around my eyes.  20 minutes with the patches and all is well and I can continue to apply my morning makeup</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE these eye recovery patches! I&#x27;ve used them 3 times for the first week as recommended, and I already see a difference with dark circles under my eyes! Not sure about them reduces wrinkles, but the patches are soooo soothing after a long day at work! Wear while your watching t.v. and having a glass of wine! You will feel so relaxed!!! I will definitely stock up on these babies!</li>
            <li> i like this product, but didn&#x27;t see much of a result. they require a long use of this item, but for the price it is to use a few times a week, its better to invest in a eye cream.</li>
            <li> LOVE these things! Perfect for that all-nighter or hangover relief. I spent a whole night crying due to a loss, woke up the next day and my eyes were swollen and puffy - popped these guys on for 30 minutes (as described in the directions) and my eyes looked as if I had a full nights rest.</li>
            <li> So amazing - they stay on really well and work great. They are so soothing and great after a hangover.</li>
