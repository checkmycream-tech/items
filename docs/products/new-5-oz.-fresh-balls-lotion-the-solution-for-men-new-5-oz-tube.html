            <li>Pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li>but I also saw really good reviews on it.</li>
            <li>this product is good for every day use, I am a perfuse sweater</li>
            <li>But the cream is good by itself, as if the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is so good that I am buying bottles in advance just in case</li>
            <li>Good price and</li>
            <li>He got a good laugh and once he tried it he was quite impressed.</li>

            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and very effective.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing what happens when he doesn&#x27;t apply it just one day.  </li>
            <li>Amazing product.  </li>
            <li>Then I skipped it on a warm day</li>
            <li>I have shared this with my buddies and they all have purchased their own...</li>
            <li>This stuff is just awesome, goes on as a lotion and dries fast into a powder.</li>
            <li>Warm weather just started to hit here in NYC</li>
            <li>Great is thicker like the first product !!</li>
            <li>what kind of odor your body produces  that will determine if this is a good fit for you or not.  </li>
            <li>What a good product I highly recommend it for every one, great deal.</li>
            <li>Liked it a lot and gave a couple to co-wotkets who enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li>My meaty clackers have never been more appreciative.</li>
            <li>I have been a Gold Bond user for years and it has been effective for me, but I read reviews which said this was better.  </li>
            <li>Despite the hilarious name, this product is extremely effective.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth a shot because it&#x27;s a great price</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;who received it thought it was funny and great.</li>
            <li>Gives me a very comfortable feeling.</li>
            <li>BEING IN A WARM TO HOT CLIME, GOOD STUFF</li>
            <li>but it is extremely accurate!</li>
            <li>Top notch.</li>
            <li>I love the scent and the way it feels.</li>
            <li>Love this product&lt;br /&gt;Better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>Love the product, defiantly a must summer or winter.</li>
            <li>Much better than using talc powder.  </li>
            <li>Also love the laughs when I recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li>About a finger tip or two does the trick most of the day.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure how well it would hold up.</li>
            <li>Feels great shipped fast, just remember wash your hands.</li>
            <li>more sweaty jewels!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>love it.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work</li>
            <li>great delivery fast  </li>
            <li>Fusion seemed more in reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So this stuff is okay.    </li>
            <li>Seriously, I love this product.</li>
            <li>its okay</li>
            <li>Many men have them, and they need to be maintained.  </li>
            <li>Thankfully I am not prone to fungal infections, but if I was, I am sure the tea tree oil in this product would help prevent and/or soothe them.  </li>
            <li>a powder would be better</li>
            <li>Make sure you wash your hands after because it will make your clothes</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>Pretty good sized tubes too</li>
            <li>Works pretty good.</li>
            <li>My husband loves his fresh ball&#x27;s!!</li>
            <li>The best stuff to keep my guys nice and fresh all day long.  </li>
            <li>Much more comfortable in the summer.  </li>
            <li>So far it has worked great.</li>
            <li>I think I first heard about it on Stern and having a fresh junk smell and feel sounded great.</li>
            <li>Best money I&#x27;ve spent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also the most comfortable to apply--it doesn&#x27;t burn like some powders.</li>
            <li>Fresh balls goes on easily and dries quickly, smells good.  </li>
            <li>Love me some fresh balls!  </li>
            <li>Not any more, I have found the promised land with fresh balls!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t spread easily.</li>
            <li>The application is cleaner and easy.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it claims, probably the best personal care investment I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
            <li>Goes on as a lotion and quickly dries to a powder that stays where it belongs and lasts for many hours.  </li>
            <li>Since he started using fresh balls he feels more comfortable.</li>
            <li>Well here&#x27;s another great product that my local stores refuse to carry.</li>
            <li>My husband says it does the job well enough - he likes the old way better (and let&#x27;s face it, powdering the basket in front of the air conditioner was probably awesome), but he gets no sweating or chafing with this stuff.</li>
            <li>Fantastic job order arrived at my place in one day</li>
            <li>Light barber shop smell out of the tube.</li>
            <li>Lol enough said!!</li>
            <li>Massage some into your mansack and enjoy a day free of sweaty balls.</li>
            <li>I liked it some much</li>
            <li>it works because I wouldn&#x27;t feel comfortable buying this over the counter in the store.</li>
            <li>Powder works better, I still get bat wings but keeps you fresh with no odor.</li>
            <li>Surprised them at how good it felt.</li>
            <li>which is great because I live in a hot and humid state.</li>
            <li>This item is a necessity particularly anywhere with a warm climate or if you enjoy working out.</li>
            <li>great, apply it fresh from the shower and stay dry and chafe free all day!</li>
            <li>All guys trust me, use fresh balls!</li>
            <li>I sweat a lot here in the states, but Singapore is even more hot and humid.  </li>
            <li>Now I have fresh balls!</li>
            <li>for some reason, this doesn&#x27;t work as well as the original...</li>
            <li>It works exactly as advertised, and perhaps better.  </li>
            <li>And it appears to be lady friendly to, if you know what I&#x27;m saying.  </li>
            <li>I take the cap off which helps keep the container clean.  </li>
            <li>the boy&#x27;s happy an dry..</li>
            <li>This stuff works great, my balls stay dry and don&#x27;t stick to my legs.</li>
            <li>feels very nice in the summer, and all year long.</li>
            <li>what I see the old guys do at the gym with powder instead?&amp;#34; I will say though that I love this stuff now!</li>
            <li>It works ok, but apparently I am alergic to one or more ingredients in it</li>
            <li>Body Time costs more, but you don&#x27;t need to apply much to work.</li>
            <li>He works outdoors doing manual labor most days, and this product has saved him so much pain and discomfort.</li>
            <li>I love it and wish I had found out about it much sooner.</li>
            <li>Not bad</li>
            <li>fresh balls fresh balls, whatcha gonna do, get into the mouth of a girl or two!</li>
            <li>Keeps me fresh and clean with no chafing</li>
            <li>It comes out of the tube as a cream and once applied quickly drys to a soothing powder.  </li>
            <li>Balls dries quickly and the smell vanishes almost immediately.</li>
            <li>Wash your hands quickly.  </li>
            <li>Quick overnight delivery was praised since the gates of hell have opened in and around the nations capital this week.  </li>
            <li>Was shipped quickly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very hot, moist summer here in Florida</li>
            <li>After using this product on some very hot, sweaty days, I now see a benefit:  </li>
            <li>As to feeling fresh and cool, the product works.</li>
            <li>It has a very mild masculine smell and nothing perfumery- goes on like lotion and when it dries, i can feel the differences as I am not sweaty esp during that warmer days when in the car, I find myself having to angle the AC vent in car to cool my undercarriage!</li>
            <li>The fragrance was pleasant, but that&#x27;s about the only positive for me.  </li>
            <li>Works good keeps things dry</li>
            <li>I use it daily and love it!</li>
            <li>Nothing sticks together anymore in the hot weather!  </li>
            <li>Back in the 90&#x27;s, John Friedman made a liquid powder that not only smelled amazing (like grapes), and created a nice powdery film that lasted all day.</li>
            <li>Great idea instead of using messy powders.</li>
            <li>It only seemed to happen during warm weather.</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s balls are fresh</li>
            <li>If you use talcum powder on your man parts, this stuff is far better.</li>
            <li>love and applaud the goal of a cream-to-powder product for this sensitive area.</li>
            <li>Hats off to fresh balls, it&#x27;s the ball freshest of freshness....for balls.</li>
            <li>I will stick with Gold Bond, although I have 3 tubes of Fresh Balls.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t a day that goes by without me using Fresh Balls</li>
            <li>He loves Fresh Balls 5 Oz Tube.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband as all the men at work were discussing their own personal experience with fresh balls.  </li>
            <li>My husband loves the fresh balls and uses it after his shower and has recommended it to others.</li>
            <li>Let this be said about Fresh Balls, the guy that created this stuff is a genius.  </li>
            <li>Once I&#x27;ve applied Fresh Balls, I can go all day without being irritated by my sweaty, soaking underwear.</li>
            <li>I was informed of my not so fresh balls and their being a product to assist with this issue.</li>
            <li>Fresh.</li>
            <li>Fresh.</li>
            <li>Still sweat right through it.</li>
            <li>Goes right on as a lotion, but dries as a powder.</li>
            <li>This product single handedly changed my life for the better!</li>
            <li>On really hot days, I prefer to use Boudreaux&#x27;s Butte Paste since it creates a thicker barrier between my skin and my clothing, and I will use this Fresh Balls on the non-jungle-hot-days.&lt;br /&gt;Overall,</li>
            <li>At first I could do nothing but laugh about why someone would go though the effort of creating a product like this.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what it promises to do and keeps your balls fresh.</li>
            <li>And best of all, it really does keep the boys dry all day long.  </li>
            <li>My balls never felt so amazing after a long day!</li>
            <li>Everything stays nice and dry.  </li>
            <li>Goes on in no time, dries to a powder finish, keeps you fresh all day - what more could you possibly want?!</li>
            <li>keeps you cool, dry and comfortable, even in Haiti heat!</li>
            <li>Talcum or corn starch or Gold Bond does a much better job of keeping the boys cool and dry, without making you look as if you have testicular leprosy.  </li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s always good to smell plesant down there!</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s a kitchen manager and spends a lot of time in a hot kitchen.  </li>
            <li>Actually, I might try another product to see if there is anything better out there.</li>
            <li>There is nothing that even comes close to this stuff, I highly recommend it!!  </li>
            <li>A must have for people in hot or humid climates.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it claims to</li>
            <li>As an overweight gentleman I am quite sweaty; making a first impression during any weather besides a blizzard was always a disaster.</li>
            <li>It was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>It describes exactly what it&#x27;s used for, but c&#x27;mon.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my feet a lot, and this really has stopped chaffing, I recommend it to any guy I know!  </li>
            <li>A side note: I once tried using foot powder on my crotch because it&#x27;s probably the strongest powder there is (has more menthol than regular medicated powders)</li>
            <li>But, spring is just beginning and summer has yet to hit, so I&#x27;ll see how well it holds up during extremely hot days.</li>
            <li>It’s fresh to death and that’s just keeping it real.</li>
            <li>This does exactly what it says it will do</li>
            <li>I was initially taken aback by the name of the product, but as I read the reviews and found them all to be rather humorous and positive, I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make a mess like talcum powder does, and works even better at keeping things comfortable.</li>
            <li>Bought This for our huge American bulldog as recommended by vet to keep the moist pockets in the pads of his feet dry.. works fantastic!!</li>
            <li>After seeing all of the positive reviews, I couldn&#x27;t wait to get this product and try it out.  </li>
            <li>I do not find it to be effective at preventing sweating, and it is probably less effective than other powders at preventing chafing or the stickiness that comes with sweating.</li>
            <li>Pretty much says it all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few products similar to this, and so far this has done the best job.</li>
            <li>In fact, I purchased this two-pack of Fresh Balls whilst en-route somewhere along the New Jersey Turnpike.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a sweater and this stuff is way better than powder for keeping you dry all day</li>
            <li>be sure to let dry to a powder before putting on your underwear.  </li>
            <li>I would certainly shower before sex.  </li>
            <li>#34;Why is there a fine white dust all over everything in my home?&amp;#34; I couldn&#x27;t figure it out.</li>
            <li>reviews were very high on product.  </li>
            <li>PS to save on shipping they have a shipping code from Howard&#x27;s show \\&quot;100\\&quot; that gave me free shipping the last time  </li>
            <li>My husband absolutely loves this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So that stopped, but it didn&#x27;t really matter where he did the powdering -</li>
            <li>If you put too much on, it makes your junk look like its covered in flakes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product absolutely makes a difference, a must for all dudes not living in Artic conditions.</li>
            <li>He really likes it.</li>
            <li>Was delivered fast and works.</li>
            <li>Notwithstanding the name, which is offensive to me, the product works really well</li>
            <li>This really does the job</li>
            <li>just dont put on too much</li>
            <li>i tried it and was really runny.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a paste/cream that dries fast and leaves a powder residue.  </li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>Better than expected.</li>
            <li>I was a powder user for years, but there really isn&#x27;t any way to use powder without getting it all over the place.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to the creators of this product.  </li>
            <li>I guess it really depends on how much you sweat and</li>
            <li>And it is really only effective for a short while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It dries pretty quickly, isn&#x27;t overly scented, and just simply works.  </li>
            <li>Works great follow the directions and ignore the other reviews about it being wet or moist.  </li>
            <li>This is soo much better than gold bond or other power alternatives.</li>
            <li>and when i work out nothing holds up, this really doesn&#x27;t either, but between workouts and during daily activity it keeps me nice, and dry.  </li>
            <li>, is good for a hot day use spairing a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>This product arrived early and was exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Definitely can&#x27;t count on it to last more than a few hours  as far as odor control, but  it is very comfortable feeling and keeps you dry for the most part.</li>
            <li>In this fast paced society we live in, one must take a breath and think about the freshness of their balls.</li>
            <li>Less is more with this stuff.</li>
            <li>Only caution, might want to rinse off if you are about to get lucky.  </li>
            <li>Most recently, it has been going all over my back stairs, and I&#x27;ve got to say, the resentment builds over years and years of vacuuming, dusting and mopping up someone else&#x27;s basket powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is a little bit like a rash cream smell with a mild hint of masculine cheap lotion/ cologne.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a slight warming effect when first applied -- not painful, but very noticeable.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend if you are outside in hot conditions!</li>
            <li>I live in Florida so keeping dry and comfortable is a challenge.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not totally disappointed in this product, but I&#x27;m not sure that I would rush out to buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>With it being a lotion, it is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t make a mess like powders, and it really does what it says....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than powder because powder for a few reasons.</li>
            <li>Wherever you would normally need powder.</li>
            <li>No irritation, no adverse effect, just cool dryness all day long.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t go back to the pre Fresh Balls era.  </li>
            <li>Neater than dusty powder, kinda pricey.overall good product.</li>
            <li>Silky smooth and dry all day!!</li>
            <li>Better than the normal powders you can buy anywhere, this product provides lasting dryness and soothing comfort all day long!</li>
            <li>Way better than gold bond and less smelly like an old man.</li>
            <li>It goes on like a powder and leaves a cool dry place.  </li>
            <li>My balls never felt better on a hot day I got four bottles of this and for the hole summer only used one last long works</li>
            <li>Was looking for a new liquid powder and thought I&#x27;d give this a try.</li>
            <li>We weren&#x27;t aware such such a product even existed but thanks to reality TV, the family was educated!</li>
            <li>I love this product, no more Goldbond everywhere.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty much the exact same thing, minus the pervasive stain power.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Keeps my danglers dry and fresh.</li>
            <li>Keeps me dry and fresh.</li>
            <li>Will keep you dry and fresh.</li>
            <li>After a year of hemming and hawing back and forth and suffering much ridicule from my better half about wanting to order this stuff I finally took the leap.  </li>
            <li>Any fresh feeling provided does not last more than a few hours on a nice muggy day.</li>
            <li>With this stuff, I feel dry and clean on the warmer days or even when go commando and not having to worry about potential &amp;#34;sweat spots&amp;#34; in the crotch area.</li>
            <li>The solution is to remove the cap when you use it and depense it directly from the tube withot the cap then replace the cap after use.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say how it tastes to the ladies, but I haven&#x27;t gotten any complaints about it so far (been about 1 year since I bought this).</li>
            <li>If your in a hurry use a blow dryer so it completely dries.  </li>
            <li>As far as I know it works for them.</li>
            <li>but it never really becomes powder-like; for the amount used to achieve any modest, short lived result your wallet is much better off simply using a talc powder rather then this tapioca based concoction.  </li>
            <li>I put it on after my shower and drying completely.  </li>
            <li>No waste.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>Not messy like talcs and powders.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell like an old man product.</li>
            <li>It does keep you fresh all day, even when the going gets rough.</li>
            <li>So, it actually lasts longer than Fresh Balls even if it comes in a bigger tube.</li>
            <li>And if you manage to get a fair amount anywhere, it gives the appearance that you&#x27;ve really made a serious mess on yourself.</li>
            <li>The smell of the product doesn&#x27;t last long, nor is it strong enough  to rid that musty  junk smell.</li>
            <li>Helps keep dry in hot humid weather.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a clean and neat guy, but sometimes when the weather is a little humid</li>
            <li>I just wish they would go back to the more discrete silver and black packaging instead of the screaming orange and blue with the dude&#x27;s silhouette.</li>
            <li>This is the only thing that saves me while working outside in the hot Texas summers.</li>
            <li>First of all, any fabric even the smallest amount it touches - maybe the outside of your boxers, or the lower part of your shirt, it creates a what looks like what can only be described as a class-5 jizz stain.  </li>
            <li>First, powder is much harder to apply directly to any part of your body because of its composition.</li>
            <li>I like this product overall,  however  my  main complaints are the  smell of the product  and the odor control -  </li>
            <li>Imagine if you will, thousands of tiny people blowing little gusts of wind to keep you fresh and cool all day long.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to any guy that is big into sport our workouts.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida and it&#x27;s pretty humid down here</li>
            <li>/&gt;It would be cool if at some point someone creates a something that this product was shooting for, but this is not it and is a waste.</li>
            <li>It really keeps you dry.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t eliminate the sweat by any means, but it does control it well enough that I&#x27;m not constantly worried about sweat stains where they really shouldn&#x27;t be.</li>
            <li>No mess like traditional powders, and won&#x27;t quick-freeze your sensitive parts like those powder sprays do.  </li>
            <li>Finally, powder doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as Fresh Balls unless you use medicated powder.</li>
            <li>A little pricey, but all-in-all still worth it.</li>
            <li>Was not what I expected,  too much hassle</li>
            <li>Maybe it does, but it wasn&#x27;t apparent to me.</li>
            <li>This product fails to fulfill its own description.  </li>
            <li>Its kind of a silly name,  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, fresh balls does the job just as well, and without all the random powder, which can accidentally get all over your clothes if you just want to do a quick application before heading out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and, if in spite of regular, frequent bathing, you need something to mask male genital odor</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does not dry as stated</li>
            <li>This product&#x27;s jizz stain mimicking is so powerful that it&#x27;s enough that I threw it away after my wife didn&#x27;t believe that this product could make such a mess.</li>
            <li>This stuff has worked to keep them cool and dry since I started using it a few days ago.  </li>
            <li>It works better than any other product out there and you hardly even know its there.</li>
            <li>Just a few small dabs applied to the area keeps you dry and confortable mostly all day!  </li>
            <li>Not a single issue with crotch rot/chafing since I started using it, in spite of daily walk/run/cycling adventures at all hours of the day and evening.  </li>
            <li>It does leaves white residue, and does not keep you dry for a long time, especially if you live in humid climate.</li>

            <li> Pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> but I also saw really good reviews on it.</li>
            <li> this product is good for every day use, I am a perfuse sweater</li>
            <li> But the cream is good by itself, as if the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is so good that I am buying bottles in advance just in case</li>
            <li> Good price and</li>

            <li> Amazing product.  </li>
            <li> Then I skipped it on a warm day</li>
            <li> I have shared this with my buddies and they all have purchased their own...</li>
            <li> This stuff is just awesome, goes on as a lotion and dries fast into a powder.</li>
            <li> Warm weather just started to hit here in NYC</li>
            <li> Great is thicker like the first product !!</li>
            <li> what kind of odor your body produces  that will determine if this is a good fit for you or not.  </li>
            <li> What a good product I highly recommend it for every one, great deal.</li>
            <li> Liked it a lot and gave a couple to co-wotkets who enjoyed using it.</li>
            <li> My meaty clackers have never been more appreciative.</li>
            <li> I have been a Gold Bond user for years and it has been effective for me, but I read reviews which said this was better.  </li>
            <li> Despite the hilarious name, this product is extremely effective.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth a shot because it&#x27;s a great price</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;who received it thought it was funny and great.</li>
            <li> Gives me a very comfortable feeling.</li>
            <li> BEING IN A WARM TO HOT CLIME, GOOD STUFF</li>

            <li> Love the product, defiantly a must summer or winter.</li>
            <li> Much better than using talc powder.  </li>
            <li> Also love the laughs when I recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> About a finger tip or two does the trick most of the day.</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t sure how well it would hold up.</li>
            <li> Feels great shipped fast, just remember wash your hands.</li>
            <li> more sweaty jewels!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> love it.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work</li>
            <li> great delivery fast  </li>
            <li> Fusion seemed more in reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So this stuff is okay.    </li>
            <li> Seriously, I love this product.</li>
            <li> its okay</li>
            <li> Many men have them, and they need to be maintained.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully I am not prone to fungal infections, but if I was, I am sure the tea tree oil in this product would help prevent and/or soothe them.  </li>
            <li> a powder would be better</li>
            <li> Make sure you wash your hands after because it will make your clothes</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> Pretty good sized tubes too</li>
            <li> Works pretty good.</li>
            <li> My husband loves his fresh ball&#x27;s!!</li>
            <li> The best stuff to keep my guys nice and fresh all day long.  </li>
            <li> Much more comfortable in the summer.  </li>
            <li> So far it has worked great.</li>
            <li> I think I first heard about it on Stern and having a fresh junk smell and feel sounded great.</li>
            <li> Best money I&#x27;ve spent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also the most comfortable to apply--it doesn&#x27;t burn like some powders.</li>
            <li> Fresh balls goes on easily and dries quickly, smells good.  </li>
            <li> Love me some fresh balls!  </li>
            <li> Not any more, I have found the promised land with fresh balls!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t spread easily.</li>
            <li> The application is cleaner and easy.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it claims, probably the best personal care investment I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
            <li> Goes on as a lotion and quickly dries to a powder that stays where it belongs and lasts for many hours.  </li>
            <li> Since he started using fresh balls he feels more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Well here&#x27;s another great product that my local stores refuse to carry.</li>
            <li> My husband says it does the job well enough - he likes the old way better (and let&#x27;s face it, powdering the basket in front of the air conditioner was probably awesome), but he gets no sweating or chafing with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Fantastic job order arrived at my place in one day</li>
            <li> Light barber shop smell out of the tube.</li>
            <li> Lol enough said!!</li>
            <li> Massage some into your mansack and enjoy a day free of sweaty balls.</li>
            <li> I liked it some much</li>
            <li> it works because I wouldn&#x27;t feel comfortable buying this over the counter in the store.</li>
            <li> Powder works better, I still get bat wings but keeps you fresh with no odor.</li>
            <li> Surprised them at how good it felt.</li>
            <li> which is great because I live in a hot and humid state.</li>
            <li> This item is a necessity particularly anywhere with a warm climate or if you enjoy working out.</li>
            <li> great, apply it fresh from the shower and stay dry and chafe free all day!</li>
            <li> All guys trust me, use fresh balls!</li>
            <li> I sweat a lot here in the states, but Singapore is even more hot and humid.  </li>
            <li> Now I have fresh balls!</li>
            <li> for some reason, this doesn&#x27;t work as well as the original...</li>
            <li> It works exactly as advertised, and perhaps better.  </li>
            <li> And it appears to be lady friendly to, if you know what I&#x27;m saying.  </li>
            <li> I take the cap off which helps keep the container clean.  </li>
            <li> the boy&#x27;s happy an dry..</li>
            <li> This stuff works great, my balls stay dry and don&#x27;t stick to my legs.</li>
            <li> feels very nice in the summer, and all year long.</li>
            <li> what I see the old guys do at the gym with powder instead?&amp;#34; I will say though that I love this stuff now!</li>
            <li> It works ok, but apparently I am alergic to one or more ingredients in it</li>
            <li> Body Time costs more, but you don&#x27;t need to apply much to work.</li>
            <li> He works outdoors doing manual labor most days, and this product has saved him so much pain and discomfort.</li>
            <li> I love it and wish I had found out about it much sooner.</li>
            <li> Not bad</li>
            <li> fresh balls fresh balls, whatcha gonna do, get into the mouth of a girl or two!</li>
            <li> Keeps me fresh and clean with no chafing</li>
            <li> It comes out of the tube as a cream and once applied quickly drys to a soothing powder.  </li>
            <li> Balls dries quickly and the smell vanishes almost immediately.</li>
            <li> Wash your hands quickly.  </li>
            <li> Quick overnight delivery was praised since the gates of hell have opened in and around the nations capital this week.  </li>
            <li> Was shipped quickly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very hot, moist summer here in Florida</li>
            <li> After using this product on some very hot, sweaty days, I now see a benefit:  </li>
            <li> As to feeling fresh and cool, the product works.</li>
            <li> It has a very mild masculine smell and nothing perfumery- goes on like lotion and when it dries, i can feel the differences as I am not sweaty esp during that warmer days when in the car, I find myself having to angle the AC vent in car to cool my undercarriage!</li>
            <li> The fragrance was pleasant, but that&#x27;s about the only positive for me.  </li>
            <li> Works good keeps things dry</li>
            <li> I use it daily and love it!</li>
            <li> Nothing sticks together anymore in the hot weather!  </li>
            <li> Back in the 90&#x27;s, John Friedman made a liquid powder that not only smelled amazing (like grapes), and created a nice powdery film that lasted all day.</li>
            <li> Great idea instead of using messy powders.</li>
            <li> It only seemed to happen during warm weather.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s balls are fresh</li>
            <li> If you use talcum powder on your man parts, this stuff is far better.</li>
            <li> love and applaud the goal of a cream-to-powder product for this sensitive area.</li>
            <li> Hats off to fresh balls, it&#x27;s the ball freshest of freshness....for balls.</li>
            <li> I will stick with Gold Bond, although I have 3 tubes of Fresh Balls.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a day that goes by without me using Fresh Balls</li>
            <li> He loves Fresh Balls 5 Oz Tube.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband as all the men at work were discussing their own personal experience with fresh balls.  </li>
            <li> My husband loves the fresh balls and uses it after his shower and has recommended it to others.</li>
            <li> Let this be said about Fresh Balls, the guy that created this stuff is a genius.  </li>
            <li> Once I&#x27;ve applied Fresh Balls, I can go all day without being irritated by my sweaty, soaking underwear.</li>
            <li> I was informed of my not so fresh balls and their being a product to assist with this issue.</li>
            <li> Fresh.</li>
            <li> Fresh.</li>
            <li> Still sweat right through it.</li>
            <li> Goes right on as a lotion, but dries as a powder.</li>
            <li> This product single handedly changed my life for the better!</li>
            <li> On really hot days, I prefer to use Boudreaux&#x27;s Butte Paste since it creates a thicker barrier between my skin and my clothing, and I will use this Fresh Balls on the non-jungle-hot-days.&lt;br /&gt;Overall,</li>
            <li> At first I could do nothing but laugh about why someone would go though the effort of creating a product like this.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what it promises to do and keeps your balls fresh.</li>
            <li> And best of all, it really does keep the boys dry all day long.  </li>
            <li> My balls never felt so amazing after a long day!</li>
            <li> Everything stays nice and dry.  </li>
            <li> Goes on in no time, dries to a powder finish, keeps you fresh all day - what more could you possibly want?!</li>
            <li> keeps you cool, dry and comfortable, even in Haiti heat!</li>
            <li> Talcum or corn starch or Gold Bond does a much better job of keeping the boys cool and dry, without making you look as if you have testicular leprosy.  </li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s always good to smell plesant down there!</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s a kitchen manager and spends a lot of time in a hot kitchen.  </li>
            <li> Actually, I might try another product to see if there is anything better out there.</li>
            <li> There is nothing that even comes close to this stuff, I highly recommend it!!  </li>
            <li> A must have for people in hot or humid climates.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it claims to</li>
            <li> As an overweight gentleman I am quite sweaty; making a first impression during any weather besides a blizzard was always a disaster.</li>
            <li> It was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> It describes exactly what it&#x27;s used for, but c&#x27;mon.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my feet a lot, and this really has stopped chaffing, I recommend it to any guy I know!  </li>
            <li> A side note: I once tried using foot powder on my crotch because it&#x27;s probably the strongest powder there is (has more menthol than regular medicated powders)</li>
            <li> But, spring is just beginning and summer has yet to hit, so I&#x27;ll see how well it holds up during extremely hot days.</li>
            <li> It’s fresh to death and that’s just keeping it real.</li>
            <li> This does exactly what it says it will do</li>
            <li> I was initially taken aback by the name of the product, but as I read the reviews and found them all to be rather humorous and positive, I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make a mess like talcum powder does, and works even better at keeping things comfortable.</li>
            <li> Bought This for our huge American bulldog as recommended by vet to keep the moist pockets in the pads of his feet dry.. works fantastic!!</li>
            <li> After seeing all of the positive reviews, I couldn&#x27;t wait to get this product and try it out.  </li>
            <li> I do not find it to be effective at preventing sweating, and it is probably less effective than other powders at preventing chafing or the stickiness that comes with sweating.</li>
            <li> Pretty much says it all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few products similar to this, and so far this has done the best job.</li>
            <li> In fact, I purchased this two-pack of Fresh Balls whilst en-route somewhere along the New Jersey Turnpike.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sweater and this stuff is way better than powder for keeping you dry all day</li>
            <li> be sure to let dry to a powder before putting on your underwear.  </li>
            <li> I would certainly shower before sex.  </li>
            <li> #34;Why is there a fine white dust all over everything in my home?&amp;#34; I couldn&#x27;t figure it out.</li>
            <li> reviews were very high on product.  </li>
            <li> PS to save on shipping they have a shipping code from Howard&#x27;s show \\&quot;100\\&quot; that gave me free shipping the last time  </li>
            <li> My husband absolutely loves this product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So that stopped, but it didn&#x27;t really matter where he did the powdering -</li>
            <li> If you put too much on, it makes your junk look like its covered in flakes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product absolutely makes a difference, a must for all dudes not living in Artic conditions.</li>
            <li> He really likes it.</li>
            <li> Was delivered fast and works.</li>
            <li> Notwithstanding the name, which is offensive to me, the product works really well</li>
            <li> This really does the job</li>
            <li> just dont put on too much</li>
            <li> i tried it and was really runny.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a paste/cream that dries fast and leaves a powder residue.  </li>
            <li> Really works.</li>
            <li> Better than expected.</li>
            <li> I was a powder user for years, but there really isn&#x27;t any way to use powder without getting it all over the place.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to the creators of this product.  </li>
            <li> I guess it really depends on how much you sweat and</li>
            <li> And it is really only effective for a short while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It dries pretty quickly, isn&#x27;t overly scented, and just simply works.  </li>
            <li> Works great follow the directions and ignore the other reviews about it being wet or moist.  </li>
            <li> This is soo much better than gold bond or other power alternatives.</li>
            <li> and when i work out nothing holds up, this really doesn&#x27;t either, but between workouts and during daily activity it keeps me nice, and dry.  </li>
            <li> , is good for a hot day use spairing a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This product arrived early and was exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Definitely can&#x27;t count on it to last more than a few hours  as far as odor control, but  it is very comfortable feeling and keeps you dry for the most part.</li>
            <li> In this fast paced society we live in, one must take a breath and think about the freshness of their balls.</li>
            <li> Less is more with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Only caution, might want to rinse off if you are about to get lucky.  </li>
            <li> Most recently, it has been going all over my back stairs, and I&#x27;ve got to say, the resentment builds over years and years of vacuuming, dusting and mopping up someone else&#x27;s basket powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is a little bit like a rash cream smell with a mild hint of masculine cheap lotion/ cologne.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a slight warming effect when first applied -- not painful, but very noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you are outside in hot conditions!</li>
            <li> I live in Florida so keeping dry and comfortable is a challenge.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not totally disappointed in this product, but I&#x27;m not sure that I would rush out to buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> With it being a lotion, it is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t make a mess like powders, and it really does what it says....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than powder because powder for a few reasons.</li>
            <li> Wherever you would normally need powder.</li>
            <li> No irritation, no adverse effect, just cool dryness all day long.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t go back to the pre Fresh Balls era.  </li>
            <li> Neater than dusty powder, kinda pricey.overall good product.</li>
            <li> Silky smooth and dry all day!!</li>
            <li> Better than the normal powders you can buy anywhere, this product provides lasting dryness and soothing comfort all day long!</li>
            <li> Way better than gold bond and less smelly like an old man.</li>
            <li> It goes on like a powder and leaves a cool dry place.  </li>
            <li> My balls never felt better on a hot day I got four bottles of this and for the hole summer only used one last long works</li>
            <li> Was looking for a new liquid powder and thought I&#x27;d give this a try.</li>
            <li> We weren&#x27;t aware such such a product even existed but thanks to reality TV, the family was educated!</li>
            <li> I love this product, no more Goldbond everywhere.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty much the exact same thing, minus the pervasive stain power.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Keeps my danglers dry and fresh.</li>
            <li> Keeps me dry and fresh.</li>
            <li> Will keep you dry and fresh.</li>
            <li> After a year of hemming and hawing back and forth and suffering much ridicule from my better half about wanting to order this stuff I finally took the leap.  </li>
            <li> Any fresh feeling provided does not last more than a few hours on a nice muggy day.</li>
            <li> With this stuff, I feel dry and clean on the warmer days or even when go commando and not having to worry about potential &amp;#34;sweat spots&amp;#34; in the crotch area.</li>
            <li> The solution is to remove the cap when you use it and depense it directly from the tube withot the cap then replace the cap after use.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say how it tastes to the ladies, but I haven&#x27;t gotten any complaints about it so far (been about 1 year since I bought this).</li>
            <li> If your in a hurry use a blow dryer so it completely dries.  </li>
            <li> As far as I know it works for them.</li>
            <li> but it never really becomes powder-like; for the amount used to achieve any modest, short lived result your wallet is much better off simply using a talc powder rather then this tapioca based concoction.  </li>
            <li> I put it on after my shower and drying completely.  </li>
            <li> No waste.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> Not messy like talcs and powders.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like an old man product.</li>
            <li> It does keep you fresh all day, even when the going gets rough.</li>
            <li> So, it actually lasts longer than Fresh Balls even if it comes in a bigger tube.</li>
            <li> And if you manage to get a fair amount anywhere, it gives the appearance that you&#x27;ve really made a serious mess on yourself.</li>
            <li> The smell of the product doesn&#x27;t last long, nor is it strong enough  to rid that musty  junk smell.</li>
            <li> Helps keep dry in hot humid weather.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a clean and neat guy, but sometimes when the weather is a little humid</li>
            <li> I just wish they would go back to the more discrete silver and black packaging instead of the screaming orange and blue with the dude&#x27;s silhouette.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that saves me while working outside in the hot Texas summers.</li>
            <li> First of all, any fabric even the smallest amount it touches - maybe the outside of your boxers, or the lower part of your shirt, it creates a what looks like what can only be described as a class-5 jizz stain.  </li>
            <li> First, powder is much harder to apply directly to any part of your body because of its composition.</li>
            <li> I like this product overall,  however  my  main complaints are the  smell of the product  and the odor control -  </li>
            <li> Imagine if you will, thousands of tiny people blowing little gusts of wind to keep you fresh and cool all day long.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to any guy that is big into sport our workouts.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida and it&#x27;s pretty humid down here</li>
            <li> /&gt;It would be cool if at some point someone creates a something that this product was shooting for, but this is not it and is a waste.</li>
            <li> It really keeps you dry.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t eliminate the sweat by any means, but it does control it well enough that I&#x27;m not constantly worried about sweat stains where they really shouldn&#x27;t be.</li>
            <li> No mess like traditional powders, and won&#x27;t quick-freeze your sensitive parts like those powder sprays do.  </li>
            <li> Finally, powder doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as Fresh Balls unless you use medicated powder.</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but all-in-all still worth it.</li>
            <li> Was not what I expected,  too much hassle</li>
            <li> Maybe it does, but it wasn&#x27;t apparent to me.</li>
            <li> This product fails to fulfill its own description.  </li>
            <li> Its kind of a silly name,  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, fresh balls does the job just as well, and without all the random powder, which can accidentally get all over your clothes if you just want to do a quick application before heading out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and, if in spite of regular, frequent bathing, you need something to mask male genital odor</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not dry as stated</li>
            <li> This product&#x27;s jizz stain mimicking is so powerful that it&#x27;s enough that I threw it away after my wife didn&#x27;t believe that this product could make such a mess.</li>
            <li> This stuff has worked to keep them cool and dry since I started using it a few days ago.  </li>
            <li> It works better than any other product out there and you hardly even know its there.</li>
            <li> Just a few small dabs applied to the area keeps you dry and confortable mostly all day!  </li>
            <li> Not a single issue with crotch rot/chafing since I started using it, in spite of daily walk/run/cycling adventures at all hours of the day and evening.  </li>
            <li> It does leaves white residue, and does not keep you dry for a long time, especially if you live in humid climate.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry fast and leaves a mess.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> If you, or your partner, don&#x27;t particularly mind your private parts looking as if they&#x27;re coated with some alien whitish yuck, you might find this product acceptable.  </li>
            <li> Then it dawned on me one morning as I stood there pouring a cloud of powder down by boxers and all over my junk why this stuff was developed.  </li>
            <li> The dermatologist said to use diluted white vinegar letting it air dry two to three times a day.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I was surprised to find that Walgreens.com sales this product for half the price (about $6.99).</li>
            <li> problem of white residue, just apply and let dry.</li>
            <li> abd it will keep you mostly dry for several hours</li>
            <li> I would definitely say it is not worth the extra cost, and would use &amp;#34;Gold Bond&amp;#34; or some similar powder in its place.</li>
            <li> this lotion has solved a long term problem in my marriage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Ordered with Monkey Butt and the people</li>
            <li> No product that can arrest the immediate onset of smelly balls after a shower has been invented before this!&lt;br /&gt;Cold</li>
            <li> and it works all day long</li>
            <li> Which after long hours leads to chafing and discomfort.  </li>
            <li> After hard intense long work outs at the gym, things stay dry and no odor at all.  </li>
            <li> The only minor issue I have is that a bit of product residue can dry in the cap and become a bit messy the next time you open it.  </li>
            <li> even then, expect  significant dried lotion and powder left behind.  </li>
            <li> I always hated that hot, clammy situation that would develop throughout the day, which would ultimately culminate in the old man parts getting pretty gamy towards dusk.  </li>
            <li> I have tried numerous powders and other lotions but nothing compares to this stuff.</li>
            <li> This stuff seems to dry out a kitty.</li>
            <li> If you like having dry balls, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> keep&#x27;s me dry all day AAA</li>
            <li> but doesn&#x27;t keep you as dry as gold bond spray or powder...</li>
            <li> keeps my balls bone dry for over 48 hours, and my wife says it smells nice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but the boys are dry and no chafing.  </li>
            <li> Product claims to transform from cream to a dry, non-talc powder when used.</li>
            <li> Dry.</li>
            <li> For me, the product did not live up to the hype.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been concerned about the amount of talc getting washed down the shower drain and potentially clogging up my cesspool, so I went looking for an alternative.  </li>
            <li> So every guy,( especially one not satisfied with what they are currently using),  owes it to their self to try this product.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful with it coming in contact with any dark clothing before it dries as it will show up big time.</li>
            <li> Keeps you a little drier during daily activities.</li>
            <li> Keeps my junk real dry.</li>
            <li> I actually used this a few times and didn&#x27;t notice anything.</li>
            <li> This product was everything I expected it would be.</li>
            <li> Secondly, when applying powder, usually half of it makes it onto your body and the other half just falls through your fingers.</li>
            <li> Eliminates any odor you may get during extreme sweating.</li>
            <li> In other cases, it doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> No more white powder clouds again.  </li>
            <li> Like any other guy, I sweat.  </li>
            <li> I bought one to try and at first I was skeptical and thinking to myself &amp;#34;geez, isn&#x27;t that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little heavy and always had big legs, even when I was skinny, so I&#x27;ve used a lot of gold bond.</li>
            <li> wish it dried a bit faster, but once dry</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;m just not seeing anything positive as a result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been living in a cloud of Gold Bond powder since I first learned the importance of keeping the boys dry as an awkward teenager.  </li>
            <li> If you have dark color undies</li>
            <li> I was usually smelly and sweaty after a long day, or after returning from the gym.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard about this product off and on for quite some time but was hesitant to purchase a tube until a rather steamy bus trip from New York City to Washington, DC left me desperate for a solution.  </li>
            <li> (Rain, Sleet, or Snow) And extreme Heat!  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll eventually notice a slight difference, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing any harm.  </li>
            <li> I can sit down without that little wiff of stink and wondering if any one else can smell it.  </li>
            <li> It goes on lille a lotion and just leaves a mess everywhere.  </li>
            <li> Second of all, it dries into like a paste, which is not a good look.</li>
            <li> It does the job, like a powder but not the mess that a powder has.</li>
            <li> It does leave a powdery mess in your underwear.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the medicated scent of Gold Bond, doesn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;balls of fire&amp;#34; sensation of Gold Bond and doesn&#x27;t leave a powder mess everywhere.  </li>
            <li> and I sometimes need a little &amp;#34;barrier&amp;#34; between me and my bra.</li>
            <li> The chaffing is gone the little on and off rash is gone.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably keep using the product for a little while.  </li>
            <li> Goes on like shortening, which was a little disconcerting.</li>
            <li> , my boys get a little sweaty.  </li>
            <li> I do like the smell of this lotion, but I was hoping for a slightly THICKER layer of powder to be left behind after it dried.</li>
            <li> so I could sneak in a shot every few hours.  </li>
            <li> Product does NOT hold up to its claims of providing relief or not being messy.  </li>
            <li> A friend mentioned seeing this a few years ago, so I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money on the version for your feet.</li>
            <li> According to my guys, when you&#x27;re sitting in The Swamp cheering your Florida Gators on, this product makes things a lot less swamp-like!</li>
            <li> No more mess.</li>
            <li> Hot summers lead to bad things.</li>
            <li> When dried, I find that the skin where it was applied feels no more \\&quot;powdered\\&quot; or \\&quot;lubricated\\&quot; than skin where it wasn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> usually use a dab of lotion about the size of a pea.</li>
            <li> No more batwing.  </li>
            <li> , not sure how I made it through the summer months w/o it!&lt;br /&gt;Works</li>
            <li> No more paw licking.. dont know how it works for humans-</li>
            <li> Use it everyday!  </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s get past the fact that this product is used on testicles.  </li>
            <li> It is not much more than lotion that dries into a powder.</li>
            <li> Very messy and leaves marks all over any clothing it touches.  </li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t completely remove the sweat or smell but helps preventing it from being as bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased at least 15 tubes of this stuff.  </li>
            <li> This stuff sucks.</li>
            <li> and I have burned and scared  my thighs even with the very small amount I used.</li>
            <li> with all that use, one 5oz tube has lasted him over 6 months, so it&#x27;s some serious bang for your buck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have this ugly ass white spot on it.</li>
            <li> Just try it, you won&#x27;t be disapointed, in fact I suggest you order at least two at a time to save on shipping because once you start using it you won&#x27;t want to go without it!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Another plus, it keeps some awful smells at bay ;)</li>
            <li> They seem to be improving at each iteration, but it is not a great product for drying your balls.  </li>
            <li> This product works ridiculous!  </li>
            <li> For those of you out there who suffer from what some refer to as &amp;#34;swamp crotch&amp;#34;, you know who you are, your days of uncomfortably sweaty nether-regions have been numbered.</li>
            <li> No swampy or uncomfortable crotch, and no sweat stained underpants.</li>
            <li> drive around all day and check jobsites and sometimes I&#x27;m working at those jobsites, out in the sun, and I haven&#x27;t had it fail yet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit too expensive.</li>
            <li> When I feel the need to cover the label, something&#x27;s wrong...</li>
            <li> This product may have a silly name</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work.......</li>
            <li> I know one of my brothers suffers from chaffing during the summer</li>
            <li> Horrible unbelievable embarrassing stink is gone!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really bad for you.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sick to death of having my Pinaud Clubman talc ending up on the floor instead of its intended destination.</li>
            <li> and you will not be disappointing!.</li>
            <li> disappointed but will look for something else.  </li>
            <li> You wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!  </li>
            <li> For me, this stuff is terrible.  </li>
            <li> so I picked this up  because sweaty crotch is just horrible with the terrible combination of heat and humidity we have.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Neater than dusty powder, kinda pricey.overall good product.</li>
            <li> Keeps me fresh and clean with no chafing</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that saves me while working outside in the hot Texas summers. I have tried numerous powders and other lotions but nothing compares to this stuff. Highly recommend if you are outside in hot conditions! Also, great for when working out.</li>
            <li> My husband and sons LOVE this product!!  We weren&#x27;t aware such such a product even existed but thanks to reality TV, the family was educated! According to my guys, when you&#x27;re sitting in The Swamp cheering your Florida Gators on, this product makes things a lot less swamp-like!</li>
            <li> Well here&#x27;s another great product that my local stores refuse to carry. (I asked and they give you lip service but nothing happens)  I tried it after hearing it advertised on the Howard Stern radio show and it&#x27;s become part of my daily grooming routine.  I even use a bit before bedtime because it prevents that moist clammy feeling men get in our private areas.  Just a few small dabs applied to the area keeps you dry and confortable mostly all day!  It comes out of the tube as a cream and once applied quickly drys to a soothing powder.  The only minor issue I have is that a bit of product residue can dry in the cap and become a bit messy the next time you open it.  The solution is to remove the cap when you use it and depense it directly from the tube withot the cap then replace the cap after use.  Just try it, you won&#x27;t be disapointed, in fact I suggest you order at least two at a time to save on shipping because once you start using it you won&#x27;t want to go without it!  PS to save on shipping they have a shipping code from Howard&#x27;s show \\&quot;100\\&quot; that gave me free shipping the last time  I placed an order.</li>
            <li> My balls has never been happier, or dryer.</li>
            <li> like it says Happy junk</li>
            <li> My husband absolutely loves this product.  He&#x27;s a kitchen manager and spends a lot of time in a hot kitchen.  It&#x27;s amazing what happens when he doesn&#x27;t apply it just one day.  I&#x27;ve been searching for a product for him for quite a while, and a friend recommended it to us 2 years ago.  If you&#x27;re looking for a product to help prevent male chafing - this is it!</li>
            <li> Works wonders, where it suppose to. It does leaves white residue, and does not keep you dry for a long time, especially if you live in humid climate. Does gives you benefit of dryness and helps with chafing. If you have dark color undies they my have white residue too.</li>
            <li> This stuff works!  Wish I had know about it earlier.  Only caution, might want to rinse off if you are about to get lucky.  This stuff seems to dry out a kitty.</li>
            <li> this lotion has solved a long term problem in my marriage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to wonder, &amp;#34;Why is there a fine white dust all over everything in my home?&amp;#34; I couldn&#x27;t figure it out. It only seemed to happen during warm weather. Then, one day, I came into the bedroom as my husband was dressing after his shower and discovered him powdering his, er, basket in front of the blasting air conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that stopped, but it didn&#x27;t really matter where he did the powdering - a substantial amount of it was going to go everywhere. Most recently, it has been going all over my back stairs, and I&#x27;ve got to say, the resentment builds over years and years of vacuuming, dusting and mopping up someone else&#x27;s basket powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, I saw this product. It maybe a solution for men, but it&#x27;s a godsend for me. My husband says it does the job well enough - he likes the old way better (and let&#x27;s face it, powdering the basket in front of the air conditioner was probably awesome), but he gets no sweating or chafing with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Never used this but got it for Christmas gag gifts. Ordered with Monkey Butt and the people&lt;br /&gt;who received it thought it was funny and great.</li>
            <li> Keeps my junk real dry. My partner greatly appreciates it, as I&#x27;m a sweater. No residue left, which means....</li>
            <li> Much more comfortable in the summer.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t have aluminum or triclosan/triclocarban.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a new liquid powder and thought I&#x27;d give this a try. It&#x27;s a very hot, moist summer here in Florida and I sometimes need a little &amp;#34;barrier&amp;#34; between me and my bra. I do like the smell of this lotion, but I was hoping for a slightly THICKER layer of powder to be left behind after it dried. Back in the 90&#x27;s, John Friedman made a liquid powder that not only smelled amazing (like grapes), and created a nice powdery film that lasted all day.This is not that.&lt;br /&gt;Fresh Balls dries quickly and the smell vanishes almost immediately. You will need to wash your hands immediately after application or you will have a white dust on anything you touch.  But not too big of an issue. I bought this in a two pack and I definitely will not need to reorder anytime soon. Actually, I might try another product to see if there is anything better out there. On really hot days, I prefer to use Boudreaux&#x27;s Butte Paste since it creates a thicker barrier between my skin and my clothing, and I will use this Fresh Balls on the non-jungle-hot-days.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m not totally disappointed in this product, but I&#x27;m not sure that I would rush out to buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> I used to use baby powder (without talc) to manage my swamp crotch.&lt;br /&gt;However, fresh balls does the job just as well, and without all the random powder, which can accidentally get all over your clothes if you just want to do a quick application before heading out.&lt;br /&gt;I usually use a dab of lotion about the size of a pea. Less is more with this stuff. If you put too much on, it makes your junk look like its covered in flakes.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say how it tastes to the ladies, but I haven&#x27;t gotten any complaints about it so far (been about 1 year since I bought this). Probably neutral.</li>
            <li> Works great.  I like that it goes on as lotion.  It really keeps you dry.</li>
            <li> Fantastic job order arrived at my place in one day</li>
            <li> Keeps you a little drier during daily activities.</li>
            <li> Love using this stuff, its frigging awesome.  I always hated that hot, clammy situation that would develop throughout the day, which would ultimately culminate in the old man parts getting pretty gamy towards dusk.  This product absolutely makes a difference, a must for all dudes not living in Artic conditions.</li>
            <li> The best product invented !!! Keeps your balls and the spot by your ass from a rash !!</li>
            <li> Liked it a lot and gave a couple to co-wotkets who enjoyed using it. Surprised them at how good it felt.</li>
            <li> This item is a necessity particularly anywhere with a warm climate or if you enjoy working out.</li>
            <li> Keeps my danglers dry and fresh.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.  Horrible unbelievable embarrassing stink is gone!  I can sit down without that little wiff of stink and wondering if any one else can smell it.  The chaffing is gone the little on and off rash is gone.  I used to keep gold bond powder close so I could sneak in a shot every few hours.  The dermatologist said to use diluted white vinegar letting it air dry two to three times a day.  Didn&#x27;t work.  Fresh balls goes on easily and dries quickly, smells good.  If your in a hurry use a blow dryer so it completely dries.  I take the cap off which helps keep the container clean.  Wash your hands quickly.  Start with a small amount the first day and increase that amount as needed.  Wish the container just said hygiene for men or mens freshness, so I don&#x27;t have to hide it.  This product arrived early and was exactly as advertised.  I will use this company again.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this stuff!</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Way better than gold bond and less smelly like an old man.</li>
            <li> Top notch. Couldn&#x27;t, wouldn&#x27;t, and haven&#x27;t gone a day without using this in over a year. I hope it never stops being made as it&#x27;s the best there is for what it&#x27;s intended for.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s balls are fresh</li>
            <li> Love this product! Eliminates any odor you may get during extreme sweating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sweater and this stuff is way better than powder for keeping you dry all day</li>
            <li> Always in my gym bag to use after my post-workout shower. I love the scent and the way it feels.</li>
            <li> In some cases it dries as a crusty paste. In other cases, it doesn&#x27;t do anything. Cannot recommend for any reason</li>
            <li> I bought this as gag gift for my brothers and my husband for Christmas. I printed out the male prostitute review and taped it to the product. I know one of my brothers suffers from chaffing during the summer so I hoped this would help. As far as I know it works for them.</li>
            <li> If you like having dry balls, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> Just what the doctor ordered. My meaty clackers have never been more appreciative.</li>
            <li> Love this product&lt;br /&gt;Better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> Love the product, defiantly a must summer or winter. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!  The foot care cream is also great!</li>
            <li> This product works great. After hard intense long work outs at the gym, things stay dry and no odor at all.  Keeps the boys happy. Much better than using talc powder.  Highly recommend to any guy that is big into sport our workouts.</li>
            <li> If you use talcum powder on your man parts, this stuff is far better. It&#x27;s a lotion that dries as a powder. It doesn&#x27;t make a mess like talcum powder does, and works even better at keeping things comfortable. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Update: After using this product on some very hot, sweaty days, I now see a benefit:  It does keep you fresh all day, even when the going gets rough. Still, I had hoped for that talc-feeling smoothness, which it does not deliver. That&#x27;s why my initial review was 3 stars, but I&#x27;m now upgrading it to 4 for freshness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love and applaud the goal of a cream-to-powder product for this sensitive area. I&#x27;m sick to death of having my Pinaud Clubman talc ending up on the floor instead of its intended destination. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m just not seeing anything positive as a result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a slight warming effect when first applied -- not painful, but very noticeable.  When dried, I find that the skin where it was applied feels no more \\&quot;powdered\\&quot; or \\&quot;lubricated\\&quot; than skin where it wasn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably keep using the product for a little while.  Maybe I&#x27;ll eventually notice a slight difference, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing any harm.  But I won&#x27;t re-order this.</li>
            <li> This item was once again purchased for my husband.  He works out side in the heat - Tractor Trailer/bus mechanic and he says this is the best thing he&#x27;s ever  found.  It goes on like a powder and leaves a cool dry place.  He really likes it.</li>
            <li> Works great follow the directions and ignore the other reviews about it being wet or moist.  It is a cream that dries very fast and is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> There is nothing that even comes close to this stuff, I highly recommend it!!  Silky smooth and dry all day!!</li>
            <li> I was initially taken aback by the name of the product, but as I read the reviews and found them all to be rather humorous and positive, I decided to give it a try.  What more can I say than the product works and feels great!  Everything stays nice and dry.  Gives me a very comfortable feeling.</li>
            <li> For those of you out there who suffer from what some refer to as &amp;#34;swamp crotch&amp;#34;, you know who you are, your days of uncomfortably sweaty nether-regions have been numbered. I&#x27;ve heard about this product off and on for quite some time but was hesitant to purchase a tube until a rather steamy bus trip from New York City to Washington, DC left me desperate for a solution.  In fact, I purchased this two-pack of Fresh Balls whilst en-route somewhere along the New Jersey Turnpike.  Quick overnight delivery was praised since the gates of hell have opened in and around the nations capital this week.  I gave it an &amp;#34;I like it&amp;#34; rating because today is only the second day I&#x27;ve applied this miracle cream/powder.  So far so good! No swampy or uncomfortable crotch, and no sweat stained underpants.</li>
            <li> No more batwing.  A must have for people in hot or humid climates. You&#x27;ll never use Gold Bond powder again.</li>
            <li> In this fast paced society we live in, one must take a breath and think about the freshness of their balls. I can say now, my balls are the freshest they&#x27;ve been. Hats off to fresh balls, it&#x27;s the ball freshest of freshness....for balls.</li>
            <li> The tip dries often. The formulation is still too watery. They seem to be improving at each iteration, but it is not a great product for drying your balls.  It also doesn&#x27;t last as long. They still have to beat the effectiveness of China Rain Liquid Powder by Body Time. Body Time costs more, but you don&#x27;t need to apply much to work. So, it actually lasts longer than Fresh Balls even if it comes in a bigger tube.</li>
            <li> This product fails to fulfill its own description.  It goes on like lotion and then sort of dries and provides some freshness but it never really becomes powder-like; for the amount used to achieve any modest, short lived result your wallet is much better off simply using a talc powder rather then this tapioca based concoction.  Any fresh feeling provided does not last more than a few hours on a nice muggy day.</li>
            <li> Great product! Also love the laughs when I recommend it to my friends. FYI, don&#x27;t use alot of it. About a finger tip or two does the trick most of the day.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! All guys trust me, use fresh balls! You&#x27;ll never use anything else after you use this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every product for this problem and this is the only one that held up. I stumbled across this from Artofmanliness.com and thought I would give it a try. It works great. I live in Florida and it&#x27;s pretty humid down here so I wasn&#x27;t sure how well it would hold up. So far it has worked great. It lasts all day and there&#x27;s basically no sweat where it gets applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I drive around all day and check jobsites and sometimes I&#x27;m working at those jobsites, out in the sun, and I haven&#x27;t had it fail yet. If you in a line of work where you&#x27;re sweating profusely all day, then who knows. But for me, this is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I was surprised to find that Walgreens.com sales this product for half the price (about $6.99).</li>
            <li> Product does NOT hold up to its claims of providing relief or not being messy.  If you already have chaffing, then it will set your &amp;#34;fields&amp;#34; on fire.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as I thought it would (I still get a bit sweaty), and the powder will cover your underwear, but it does work.</li>
            <li> Heard about this product through &amp;#34;Mansome&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave it a shot, not sure how I made it through the summer months w/o it!&lt;br /&gt;Works great, apply it fresh from the shower and stay dry and chafe free all day!</li>
            <li> I used it 3 days and gave up on it.</li>
            <li> Goes on like shortening, which was a little disconcerting. Turns into powder, as advertised. No burn. Light barber shop smell out of the tube. This is a keeper.</li>
            <li> Was not what I expected,  too much hassle and you have to wash your hands after applying</li>
            <li> Great product will deffenitly buy again</li>
            <li> Was delivered fast and works. Pretty good sized tubes too</li>
            <li> Works good keeps things dry</li>
            <li> After seeing all of the positive reviews, I couldn&#x27;t wait to get this product and try it out.  I have been a Gold Bond user for years and it has been effective for me, but I read reviews which said this was better.  I got my tubes just before heading out to Singapore for business.  I sweat a lot here in the states, but Singapore is even more hot and humid.  For me, this stuff is terrible.  It goes on lille a lotion and just leaves a mess everywhere.  I put it on after my shower and drying completely.  Then got dressed.  This didn&#x27;t work at all for me.  The fragrance was pleasant, but that&#x27;s about the only positive for me.  Very messy and leaves marks all over any clothing it touches.  For me, the product did not live up to the hype.  I will stick with Gold Bond, although I have 3 tubes of Fresh Balls.</li>
            <li> The best stuff to keep my guys nice and fresh all day long.  I&#x27;ve purchased at least 15 tubes of this stuff.  There isn&#x27;t a day that goes by without me using Fresh Balls</li>
            <li> Works pretty good. Leaves white residue on underwear. The scent could be improved!</li>
            <li> Amazing product.  My balls never felt so amazing after a long day!</li>
            <li> Feels great shipped fast, just remember wash your hands.</li>
            <li> This product single handedly changed my life for the better! I use it daily and love it!</li>
            <li> Great ,&lt;br /&gt;Dryness last all day long.&lt;br /&gt;No more sweaty jewels!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to everybody looking for freshness !</li>
            <li> My husband had been using powder and it would be everywhere.  A friend recommended to get this and he loves it.  No more mess.</li>
            <li> Dat $hiz gived me phresh balz</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband because our summer temps can reach 112. He loves Fresh Balls 5 Oz Tube. He can&#x27;t go day without using it.</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever to keep your junk happy.  This is the second summer I&#x27;ve used this product here in the Dallas, TX area.  Not a single issue with crotch rot/chafing since I started using it, in spite of daily walk/run/cycling adventures at all hours of the day and evening.  Goes on as a lotion and quickly dries to a powder that stays where it belongs and lasts for many hours.  No mess like traditional powders, and won&#x27;t quick-freeze your sensitive parts like those powder sprays do.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Notwithstanding the name, which is offensive to me, the product works really well and, if in spite of regular, frequent bathing, you need something to mask male genital odor, this is the product to use.</li>
            <li> Great product. .keeps the boy&#x27;s happy an dry..</li>
            <li> My husband loves his fresh ball&#x27;s!! Lol enough said!!</li>
            <li> As someone who works in a kitchen, this is a godsend for preventing...swampiness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been concerned about the amount of talc getting washed down the shower drain and potentially clogging up my cesspool, so I went looking for an alternative.  A friend mentioned seeing this a few years ago, so I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it.  It does exactly what it claims to do.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it dried a bit faster, but once dry it&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit too expensive.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a joke until I read the reviews and saw the video on YouTube. This is not joke!. No need to go into details but give it a try and you will not be disappointing!.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband as a joke but I also saw really good reviews on it. He got a good laugh and once he tried it he was quite impressed. He had to ordered a tube for his brother.</li>
            <li> Great is thicker like the first product !!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how, but this stuff works. I, however, do not use it on my &amp;#34;balls&amp;#34; but rather my underarms. As an overweight gentleman I am quite sweaty; making a first impression during any weather besides a blizzard was always a disaster. Not anymore.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t spread easily. Crusts on my hands within seconds. Somehow it gets on my shirt and I have this ugly ass white spot on it. When applied correctly, it doesn&#x27;t work well at all. Still sweat right through it.</li>
            <li> This stuff sucks. I think I first heard about it on Stern and having a fresh junk smell and feel sounded great. First of all, any fabric even the smallest amount it touches - maybe the outside of your boxers, or the lower part of your shirt, it creates a what looks like what can only be described as a class-5 jizz stain.  And if you manage to get a fair amount anywhere, it gives the appearance that you&#x27;ve really made a serious mess on yourself. Second of all, it dries into like a paste, which is not a good look. This product&#x27;s jizz stain mimicking is so powerful that it&#x27;s enough that I threw it away after my wife didn&#x27;t believe that this product could make such a mess. If I could attach a picture I would, but it would probably be removed bc it would appear as though it violated some t&amp;c.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So just wash your balls and call it a day. Although if you&#x27;re going to use a follow up product because your lifestyle is improved by not giving another reason to have your wife not handle business, I&#x27;ve used the gold bond topical and it&#x27;s pretty much the exact same thing, minus the pervasive stain power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be cool if at some point someone creates a something that this product was shooting for, but this is not it and is a waste.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  For years I used Balmex and Dr Smith&#x27;s, which I still keep around the house and will use on occasion.  But this stuff is preferred for daily use.  Keep one at home, and one in the gym bag.  Definitely will reorder!</li>
            <li> This stuff actually works. Keeps me dry and fresh.</li>
            <li> keep&#x27;s me dry all day AAA</li>
            <li> Great for summer use.  Will keep you dry and fresh.</li>
            <li> This is a reorder because this works. I actually used this a few times and didn&#x27;t notice anything. Then I skipped it on a warm day and THAT I noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No fuss. No white powder on the floor. Lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Changed my life.  Does exactly what it claims, probably the best personal care investment I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I travel to Haiti, sometimes twice a year on missions trips. One year a guy brought this with him and let me try it, it is a life saver! With it being a lotion, it is easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t make a mess like powders, and it really does what it says....keeps you cool, dry and comfortable, even in Haiti heat! I have shared this with my buddies and they all have purchased their own...it is that good! Keep your boys happy!</li>
            <li> Not bad but doesn&#x27;t keep you as dry as gold bond spray or powder...</li>
            <li> Works well!  No burn or irritation.</li>
            <li> Everything arrived on time and in great condition. It was exactly as described. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and very effective.  I would certainly shower before sex.  And wash hands immediately following application.  Otherwise your hands will become powdery.  This is the best product I have tried for its intended purpose for its efficacy and ease of application.  I will definetly purchase again.  I live in Florida so keeping dry and comfortable is a challenge.  This really does the job</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff. He works outdoors doing manual labor most days, and this product has saved him so much pain and discomfort. He&#x27;s also in the Marine reserves and takes it with him to every drill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with all that use, one 5oz tube has lasted him over 6 months, so it&#x27;s some serious bang for your buck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another plus, it keeps some awful smells at bay ;)</li>
            <li> Works great.  I just wish they would change the product name/packaging.  It describes exactly what it&#x27;s used for, but c&#x27;mon.  When I feel the need to cover the label, something&#x27;s wrong...</li>
            <li> This stuff rocks!  I wasn&#x27;t sure it would work but it does.  BTW people, don&#x27;t use talc on your junk.  It&#x27;s really bad for you.  Buy this instead!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry fast and leaves a mess.</li>
            <li> My balls never felt better on a hot day I got four bottles of this and for the hole summer only used one last long works great delivery fast  thank you</li>
            <li> Now I have fresh balls! Goes on like a gel and dries great.  Massage some into your mansack and enjoy a day free of sweaty balls.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle product...my &amp;#34;junk&amp;#34; has never felt better!! LOL!! A male must-have!!</li>
            <li> Love me some fresh balls!  Just kidding!  It does the job, like a powder but not the mess that a powder has.</li>
            <li> Works well must try. Great price for 2</li>
            <li> Tried it on a whim, keeps my nuts from sticking to my leg, that&#x27;s all I was looking for.</li>
            <li> for some reason, this doesn&#x27;t work as well as the original...</li>
            <li> This product works great!!!</li>
            <li> Best money I&#x27;ve spent. This product works wonders</li>
            <li> No product that can arrest the immediate onset of smelly balls after a shower has been invented before this!&lt;br /&gt;Cold Fusion seemed more in reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This keeps my balls bone dry for over 48 hours, and my wife says it smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me, your danglies deserve to be cared for!</li>
            <li> Does what it says. Works great</li>
            <li> Bought This for our huge American bulldog as recommended by vet to keep the moist pockets in the pads of his feet dry.. works fantastic!! No more paw licking.. dont know how it works for humans- but works great on the pooch!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m hooked. just dont put on too much or you&#x27;ll get dingle berries. don&#x27;t waste your money on the version for your feet. i tried it and was really runny.</li>
            <li> AAA+++ just as ordered!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a clean and neat guy, but sometimes when the weather is a little humid or I&#x27;m doing something physical, my boys get a little sweaty.  This stuff has worked to keep them cool and dry since I started using it a few days ago.  Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Hot summers lead to bad things. This stuff really works. What can I say - Happy Junk says it all.</li>
            <li> Goes on in no time, dries to a powder finish, keeps you fresh all day - what more could you possibly want?!</li>
            <li> It works ok, but apparently I am alergic to one or more ingredients in it and I have burned and scared  my thighs even with the very small amount I used.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a paste/cream that dries fast and leaves a powder residue.  The powder that is left does not burn or tingle at all.  So if you are looking for dryness - this product works.  If you are looking for dry/fresh balls then this is your product.    Gold Bond powder also dries and it tingles.  So I prefer Gold Bond product.  So this stuff is okay.    It does leave a powdery mess in your underwear.  I won&#x27;t be buying this product again.  Will return to Gold Bonds Powder Spray.  The application is cleaner and easy.</li>
            <li> this product is good for every day use, I am a perfuse sweater and when i work out nothing holds up, this really doesn&#x27;t either, but between workouts and during daily activity it keeps me nice, and dry.  Plus, it&#x27;s always good to smell plesant down there!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband as all the men at work were discussing their own personal experience with fresh balls.  My husband loves the fresh balls and uses it after his shower and has recommended it to others.</li>
            <li> This product may have a silly name but it actually works. I liked it some much I actually gave this to several family members as gifts this year.</li>
            <li> This product was everything I expected it would be.</li>
            <li> I saw this product on the documentary, Mansome.  At first I could do nothing but laugh about why someone would go though the effort of creating a product like this.  Then it dawned on me one morning as I stood there pouring a cloud of powder down by boxers and all over my junk why this stuff was developed.  After a year of hemming and hawing back and forth and suffering much ridicule from my better half about wanting to order this stuff I finally took the leap.  Let this be said about Fresh Balls, the guy that created this stuff is a genius.  I&#x27;ve been living in a cloud of Gold Bond powder since I first learned the importance of keeping the boys dry as an awkward teenager.  No more white powder clouds again.  This stuff is just awesome, goes on as a lotion and dries fast into a powder. Doesn&#x27;t have the medicated scent of Gold Bond, doesn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;balls of fire&amp;#34; sensation of Gold Bond and doesn&#x27;t leave a powder mess everywhere.  And best of all, it really does keep the boys dry all day long.  Hour on a treadmill at the gym and this stuff holds up, I may be drenched in sweat all over but the boys are dry and no chafing.  Best product for the family jewels.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday!  I&#x27;m on my feet a lot, and this really has stopped chaffing, I recommend it to any guy I know!  Excellent product, and with the two pack, you save money, too!</li>
            <li> Was shipped quickly it works well, is good for a hot day use spairing a little goes a long way. I will be buying again</li>
            <li> The name speaks for it self. Helps keep dry in hot humid weather.&lt;br /&gt;No problem of white residue, just apply and let dry.</li>
            <li> Despite the hilarious name, this product is extremely effective. It does exactly what it promises to do and keeps your balls fresh. I actually use it around my entire nether regions area (front and back) and it works wonders.&lt;br /&gt;  Warm weather just started to hit here in NYC so I picked this up  because sweaty crotch is just horrible with the terrible combination of heat and humidity we have. Once I&#x27;ve applied Fresh Balls, I can go all day without being irritated by my sweaty, soaking underwear. It&#x27;s better than powder because powder for a few reasons. First, powder is much harder to apply directly to any part of your body because of its composition. Secondly, when applying powder, usually half of it makes it onto your body and the other half just falls through your fingers. Finally, powder doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as Fresh Balls unless you use medicated powder. A side note: I once tried using foot powder on my crotch because it&#x27;s probably the strongest powder there is (has more menthol than regular medicated powders) and it actually burned my junk, so I don&#x27;t recommend using it.&lt;br /&gt;  Seriously, I love this product. But, spring is just beginning and summer has yet to hit, so I&#x27;ll see how well it holds up during extremely hot days.</li>
            <li> I use it every day. My balls have never been fresher. Great idea instead of using messy powders. Goes right on as a lotion, but dries as a powder. No waste. Use it all over your under carriage. Front, under, back. Wherever you would normally need powder.</li>
            <li> If you, or your partner, don&#x27;t particularly mind your private parts looking as if they&#x27;re coated with some alien whitish yuck, you might find this product acceptable.  Otherwise, this is junk, and shouldn&#x27;t be on yours.  Talcum or corn starch or Gold Bond does a much better job of keeping the boys cool and dry, without making you look as if you have testicular leprosy.  Cannot recommend.</li>
            <li> This is soo much better than gold bond or other power alternatives. I love it and wish I had found out about it much sooner.</li>
            <li> BEING IN A WARM TO HOT CLIME, GOOD STUFF</li>
            <li> This stuff works great!  Does what is says it is supposed to do.  Nothing sticks together anymore in the hot weather!  I will be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little heavy and always had big legs, even when I was skinny, so I&#x27;ve used a lot of gold bond. Not any more, I have found the promised land with fresh balls!</li>
            <li> I was informed of my not so fresh balls and their being a product to assist with this issue. Imagine if you will, thousands of tiny people blowing little gusts of wind to keep you fresh and cool all day long. I would venture to say that I have the freshest balls on the block. I will be buying this product in the future. It’s fresh to death and that’s just keeping it real.</li>
            <li> be sure to let dry to a powder before putting on your underwear.  even then, expect  significant dried lotion and powder left behind.  As to feeling fresh and cool, the product works.</li>
            <li> This does exactly what it says it will do and it works all day long which is great because I live in a hot and humid state.</li>
            <li> Best product out there.</li>
            <li> Product claims to transform from cream to a dry, non-talc powder when used. Maybe it does, but it wasn&#x27;t apparent to me. But the cream is good by itself, as if the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Includes an instruction to shake before use. Who puts a shakable cream in a tube?</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work as advertised.  disappointed but will look for something else.  reviews were very high on product.  just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> its okay but wont re-order.</li>
            <li> Wow. This stuff is great! Really works. Better than expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lotion, for your balls. &#x27;Nough said.</li>
            <li> Enough said. Not messy like talcs and powders. Pleasant fragrance. A little pricey, but all-in-all still worth it. I&#x27;ve already bought another shipment.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s get past the fact that this product is used on testicles.  Many men have them, and they need to be maintained.  I was a powder user for years, but there really isn&#x27;t any way to use powder without getting it all over the place.  And it is really only effective for a short while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a terrific hygiene product.  It works exactly as advertised, and perhaps better.  No irritation, no adverse effect, just cool dryness all day long.  Thankfully I am not prone to fungal infections, but if I was, I am sure the tea tree oil in this product would help prevent and/or soothe them.  It dries pretty quickly, isn&#x27;t overly scented, and just simply works.  No nonsense, no gimmick.  It works.  Try this stuff and say goodbye to bat wings.</li>
            <li> I am a letter carrier for the post office.  I work in all types of weather. (Rain, Sleet, or Snow) And extreme Heat!  Like any other guy, I sweat.  Which after long hours leads to chafing and discomfort.  I have tried several different products to no avail.  This product works ridiculous!  It is so good that I am buying bottles in advance just in case they quit selling it.  I can&#x27;t go back to the pre Fresh Balls era.  It works better than any other product out there and you hardly even know its there. And it appears to be lady friendly to, if you know what I&#x27;m saying.  So every guy,( especially one not satisfied with what they are currently using),  owes it to their self to try this product.  You wont be disappointed. Thanks to the creators of this product.  Its kind of a silly name,  but it is extremely accurate!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work.......&lt;br /&gt;My sweat/moisture overpowers this.&lt;br /&gt;It does not dry as stated</li>
            <li> Dry. Fresh. VERY happy!</li>
            <li> . It works about as well as Lanocane Anti-Chafing &amp;#34;but, it seems to last longer&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This stuff gets rave reviews elsewhere from guys, but I don&#x27;t know why. It is not much more than lotion that dries into a powder. I do not find it to be effective at preventing sweating, and it is probably less effective than other powders at preventing chafing or the stickiness that comes with sweating. I would definitely say it is not worth the extra cost, and would use &amp;#34;Gold Bond&amp;#34; or some similar powder in its place.</li>
            <li> I was usually smelly and sweaty after a long day, or after returning from the gym. This product doesn&#x27;t completely remove the sweat or smell but helps preventing it from being as bad</li>
            <li> Fresh. Balls. Pretty much says it all.</li>
            <li> My husband is a cook and he sweats a lot. Since he started using fresh balls he feels more comfortable.</li>
            <li> a powder would be better</li>
            <li> Works great. My husband and son used it when they went hiking and camping for Boy Scouts. Definitely recomend over powders and sprays.</li>
            <li> feels very nice in the summer, and all year long.What a good product I highly recommend it for every one, great deal.</li>
            <li> I sweat a lot and especially in the summer, it&#x27;s more difficult to manage in some places than others. I&#x27;ve tried a few products similar to this, and so far this has done the best job. It doesn&#x27;t eliminate the sweat by any means, but it does control it well enough that I&#x27;m not constantly worried about sweat stains where they really shouldn&#x27;t be. It&#x27;s also the most comfortable to apply--it doesn&#x27;t burn like some powders.</li>
            <li> This stuff works. Doesn&#x27;t smell like an old man product. Make sure you wash your hands after because it will make your clothes</li>
            <li> This stuff works great, my balls stay dry and don&#x27;t stick to my legs.</li>
            <li> Does what it says it does. Just be careful with it coming in contact with any dark clothing before it dries as it will show up big time. I have no idea why this stuff isn&#x27;t sold at every pharmacy and retail chain because it is so awesome. I just wish they would go back to the more discrete silver and black packaging instead of the screaming orange and blue with the dude&#x27;s silhouette.</li>
            <li> I bought one to try and at first I was skeptical and thinking to myself &amp;#34;geez, isn&#x27;t that what I see the old guys do at the gym with powder instead?&amp;#34; I will say though that I love this stuff now! It has a very mild masculine smell and nothing perfumery- goes on like lotion and when it dries, i can feel the differences as I am not sweaty esp during that warmer days when in the car, I find myself having to angle the AC vent in car to cool my undercarriage! I am sure i am not alone here- lol! With this stuff, I feel dry and clean on the warmer days or even when go commando and not having to worry about potential &amp;#34;sweat spots&amp;#34; in the crotch area. Good price and it works because I wouldn&#x27;t feel comfortable buying this over the counter in the store.</li>
            <li> fresh balls fresh balls, whatcha gonna do, get into the mouth of a girl or two!</li>
            <li> Powder works better, I still get bat wings but keeps you fresh with no odor. I will go back to powder.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome I will continue to order it</li>
            <li> Better than the normal powders you can buy anywhere, this product provides lasting dryness and soothing comfort all day long!</li>
            <li> I love this product, no more Goldbond everywhere.</li>
            <li> I like this product overall,  however  my  main complaints are the  smell of the product  and the odor control -  Smell:  it is a little bit like a rash cream smell with a mild hint of masculine cheap lotion/ cologne. I think that using a  stronger deodorant  or  odor eliminating product in the ingredients would solve both issues.  The smell of the product doesn&#x27;t last long, nor is it strong enough  to rid that musty  junk smell. Definitely can&#x27;t count on it to last more than a few hours  as far as odor control, but  it is very comfortable feeling and keeps you dry for the most part. I guess it really depends on how much you sweat and what kind of odor your body produces  that will determine if this is a good fit for you or not.  it&#x27;s worth a shot because it&#x27;s a great price abd it will keep you mostly dry for several hours</li>
            <li> Great Product! Speedy Service!</li>
