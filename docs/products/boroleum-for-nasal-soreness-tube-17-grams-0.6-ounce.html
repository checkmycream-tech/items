            <li>We love ❤</li>
            <li>I bought every product imaginable trying to resolve this: aquaphor, nose better gel, homeopathic tea tree oil salve, silver antibiotic gel, you name it</li>
            <li>LOVE the product but BEWARE</li>
            <li>Works pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Excellent for dry nostrils.</li>

            <li>such a great product.</li>

            <li>Boroleum is just right!</li>
            <li>I bought this product not expecting much but have been beyond satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I found this product good to use especially on a plane trip to prevent germs aboard from me.</li>
            <li>A note to them via Amazon brought a quick refund without response.</li>
            <li>I use this for nasal congeston - better than vicks - gives clear breathing.</li>
            <li>An old favorite that always helps.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the best I have found in the entire world wide market.</li>
            <li>The delivery is always right on.  </li>
            <li>has a good fragrance, menthol and a little</li>
            <li>I have went to the doctor, researched remedies online, tried many different things, NOTHING worked.</li>
            <li>I use it regularly and love it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kinda refreshing actually.</li>
            <li>Been using this for years, especially when we fly and our noses are dry.</li>
            <li>Works great, but very small amount for the price.</li>
            <li>It also works great as a moisturizer on dry/chapped skin for other parts of your body, especially hands.</li>
            <li>Pretty much just vaseline with some methol in it.  </li>
            <li>Better than Vicks, need this for dry weather</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for years; used to use a liquid nose oil product, but this lasts so much longer during the night and helps me breath easier while sleeping.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>but I know you can get a lung disease from sticking too much petroleum jelly in your nose.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It is inexpensive and works for chapped lips really well.</li>
            <li>So much sickness circulates through plane air systems.</li>
            <li>They would scab up, the scab would fall off before it was ready</li>
            <li>Great product but not easy to stop the future shipments</li>
            <li>My husband has used Boroleum for many years due to a nasal problem.  </li>
            <li>(I live in Germany much of the time).&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>I like the boroleum for nasal soreness ointment because it is a light moisturizer for the nasal passages during the winter months with the dry heat.</li>
            <li>Smell not as strong as I expected.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Today, my nose isn&#x27;t even remotely sore to the touch, whereas before I would wince when I even touched it lightly.</li>
            <li>I apply it several times a day and right</li>
            <li>That was new to me.  </li>
            <li>He likes it very much and we order from different sources depending on the price.</li>
            <li>I put a little on a q-tip and swab it inside to lightly coat and moisturize.</li>
            <li>I use it to clear my nose at bedtime.</li>
            <li>Old remedy that still works</li>
            <li>I would nearly cry every time I had to blow my nose, and as an allergy sufferer, I was miserable.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It is often difficult to find and I was delighted with the ease of this purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent most of the winter recovering from a sinus infection that has left my nose very dry and sore.  </li>
            <li>Apply very little, otherwise the light menthol can hit your throat which is unplesant.</li>
            <li>It really helps my nose deal with the dry winter air.</li>
            <li>, Boreleum really works well to soothe sore, dry, stuffy nose problems.  </li>
            <li>This really helps keep my nostrils coated so they don&#x27;t dry out as often.</li>
            <li>My late dad always used Mentholatum, but it seemed too strong to me.</li>
            <li>When your nose becomes raw from having a cold this stuff is great!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know it was developed for that purpose, but it definitely works.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s similar to Vicks Vapo Rub, but safer to apply directly where it&#x27;s needed.  </li>
            <li>But, be careful not to use to much or you&#x27;ll be trying to figure out what to do with it.  </li>
            <li>I apply just a little bit every morning and night and in just a few days I feel so much better.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;A specialist gave me an oil mixture that was developed for the dry conditons in SPACE for astronauts.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;A specialist gave me an oil mixture that was developed for the dry conditons in SPACE for astronauts.  </li>
            <li> Very affordable and a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> These tiny cuts caused unbelievable amounts of pain when blowing my nose, or if I simply gently touched my nose in any way.</li>
            <li> but it does not seem to last long enough for me.  </li>
            <li> tube of this lasts a very, very long time even if used several times a day.</li>
            <li> This is the ultimate stuff to keep your nose from going sore in dry air.</li>
            <li> When I travel to areas that are outside of my norm, this product is so helpful, because my nostrils tend to dry out.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t sting or smell bad; it has a nice wintergreen type scent.</li>
            <li> I live in an area of very low humidity, and this stuff saves the delicate skin in my nose.</li>
            <li> You only need to use a little at a time, so tube will last a long time.</li>
            <li> you will begin receiving emails about all kinds of other products whose lists you are suddenly on</li>
            <li> a very long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not suggesting that this cures anything, but it does provide relief.</li>
            <li> goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> I have allergies which leaves my nose dry and cracked, and makes it bleed.</li>
            <li> Dry nose has been an issue this helps.</li>
            <li> It works on dry hands too.</li>
            <li> A LIFE SAVER!&lt;br /&gt;I have been suffering with a dry, sore, cracked nose for FOREVER.</li>
            <li> I always use it when I travel on planes as well, the dry air you know.</li>
            <li> I suffer from sinusitis and use quite a few different products and this definitely helps when my nose gets dry or sore.</li>
            <li> I dont typically write reviews, but I have been searching for this nasal gel for a year since I ran out and finally found it again!</li>
            <li> AS EXPECTED AND SHIPPED PROMPTLY</li>
            <li> My Mom used simple products for everyday discomforts.</li>
            <li> Due to the wet environment of the inside of the nostril they would never heal.</li>
            <li> I mean a tiny amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have a messed up nasal lining due to overdosing on AFRIN NASAL SPRAY during my years of SCUBA diving.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband and I have bee using this product since we met each other and probably before that(We are senior citizens).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other ones</li>
            <li> I do not want to run out, even though you only need to use a small amount.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for at least ten years.</li>
            <li> Indications&lt;br /&gt;For temporary relief of pain and itching associated with minor burns, sunburn, minor cuts, scrapes, insect bites and minor skin irritation (e.g. dry nasal passages) , however on their container it states not for internal use, and it is not as petroleum is bad to inhale and can cause a lung</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since I was a little kid, and my mother who recommended it to me has been using it even longer.  </li>
            <li> i have numerous problems with dry nose since my unfortunate deviated septum operation.</li>
            <li> I would readily recommend it to cold or sinus sufferers.</li>
            <li> I still apply it a few times a day to ensure they stay moisturized</li>
            <li> This product was sent to the wrong person, Shana Cottle, who is in a local prison</li>
            <li> I use this when the inside of my nose gets sore- usually during allergy season.</li>
            <li> This product was a major disappointment to me.</li>
            <li> Helps with dry nasal lining, which during winter cracks and bleeds..agreat value and makes winter months less painful</li>
            <li> Waste of money!!</li>
            <li> A very small bit goes</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> When we got a stuffy or dry nose from a cold or allergy, a spot of Boroleum did the trick.</li>
            <li> Within about 1.5 weeks the horrible little sores are completely healed up!</li>
            <li> I can only ascertain that they were caused from dryness and also due to the fact that I started smoking again (terrible I know).</li>
            <li> No more bloody, dry nose!</li>

            <li> This is the ultimate stuff to keep your nose from going sore in dry air. Apply very little, otherwise the light menthol can hit your throat which is unplesant.</li>
            <li> Our household could not get along without our Boroleum. A great product, a good price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> A pharmacist recommended this years ago, and it&#x27;s really great.   Stops nosebleeds, almost immediately.  Don&#x27;t know it was developed for that purpose, but it definitely works.</li>
            <li> Old remedy that still works</li>
            <li> I love this product as it is uniquely effective and have used it for decades. It is often difficult to find and I was delighted with the ease of this purchase.</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for over 50 years in the winter.  Keeps your nose from drying out. Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Boroleum for years. It helps keep a sore nose moist and mentholated.</li>
            <li> When your nose becomes raw from having a cold this stuff is great!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve a few allergy sufferers in this house and this product works very well as easing sore noses.  The price is VERY good compared to where we were getting it before this purchase.</li>
            <li> This product was sent to the wrong person, Shana Cottle, who is in a local prison so it was returned to the sender. I see no indication of a credit on my credit card.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  works like vicks without burning your nose and eyes.</li>
            <li> Good product, improves air flow</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever for night-time stuffy/dry noses!  I&#x27;ve used this for years; used to use a liquid nose oil product, but this lasts so much longer during the night and helps me breath easier while sleeping.</li>
            <li> This product was a major disappointment to me. I thought it would be soothing for my nasal passages, however when applied it left a burning sensation in my nostrils. Waste of money!!</li>
            <li> This product is not sold locally and it&#x27;s the best.  Retailers are missing out on a door buster salve that heals all wounds and even helps with herpes cold sores.</li>
            <li> Boroleum saves me nose every winter. My late dad always used Mentholatum, but it seemed too strong to me. Boroleum is just right!</li>
            <li> I have allergies which leaves my nose dry and cracked, and makes it bleed. This is great keeps your nose nice and moist also clears your sinuses as an added bonus. thanks</li>
            <li> Product arrived promptly and as advertised.</li>
            <li> Best nasal stuff!! Helps with allergies and colds!</li>
            <li> This has petroleum in it and can not be used in nasal passages. This is what their label reads: Indications&lt;br /&gt;For temporary relief of pain and itching associated with minor burns, sunburn, minor cuts, scrapes, insect bites and minor skin irritation (e.g. dry nasal passages) , however on their container it states not for internal use, and it is not as petroleum is bad to inhale and can cause a lung issue.&lt;br /&gt;Their description is misleading!</li>
            <li> It contains Menthol, Camphor and petroleum jelly.  It seems to be pretty effective but I know you can get a lung disease from sticking too much petroleum jelly in your nose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for at least ten years. I have a messed up nasal lining due to overdosing on AFRIN NASAL SPRAY during my years of SCUBA diving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A specialist gave me an oil mixture that was developed for the dry conditons in SPACE for astronauts.  After a couple of years, I could no longer find that product and found this at Magellan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tube of this lasts a very, very long time even if used several times a day. A very small bit goes a very long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not suggesting that this cures anything, but it does provide relief. Check with your doctor before you stick anything in your nose!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this from Sinclair at an excellent price for six tubes, but was overcharged on the shipping. A note to them via Amazon brought a quick refund without response.</li>
            <li> I like this!  Not just petroleum it helps heal and moisturizer. Thanks. Dry nose has been an issue this helps. Smell not as strong as I expected.</li>
            <li> one of our favorite products.</li>
            <li> I use this when the inside of my nose gets sore- usually during allergy season. This is the only product I have found that helps</li>
            <li> I like the boroleum for nasal soreness ointment because it is a light moisturizer for the nasal passages during the winter months with the dry heat.</li>
            <li> I love Boroleum.  It really helps my nose deal with the dry winter air. It works on dry hands too.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years, especially when we fly and our noses are dry. I put a little on a q-tip and swab it inside to lightly coat and moisturize. Makes a huge difference! I just wish I could find this at a local store instead of having to order online....</li>
            <li> Its like chapstick for your nose and I love it.  Very affordable and a little bit goes a long way.  I suffer from sinusitis and use quite a few different products and this definitely helps when my nose gets dry or sore.</li>
            <li> A LIFE SAVER!&lt;br /&gt;I have been suffering with a dry, sore, cracked nose for FOREVER. I have went to the doctor, researched remedies online, tried many different things, NOTHING worked. (Coconut Oil, Homemade healing ointment, Antibiotic cream, Ayr Nose Spray, Saline Nose Spray) This came in the mail last night. I put it on and had instant relief. Today, my nose isn&#x27;t even remotely sore to the touch, whereas before I would wince when I even touched it lightly. I would nearly cry every time I had to blow my nose, and as an allergy sufferer, I was miserable.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff makes me happy again. Seriously. If I could hire a plane and skywrite how awesome it is, I would. Amazing.</li>
            <li> it made my nose smelly in a bad way, but helped the pain.&lt;br /&gt;did solve the issue- had to get antibiotic cream</li>
            <li> I use this for nasal congeston - better than vicks - gives clear breathing. I use it each day - best ever!</li>
            <li> My husband has used Boroleum for many years due to a nasal problem.  He likes it very much and we order from different sources depending on the price.</li>
            <li> such a great product. I use it every winter to avoid cracked membranes. has a good fragrance, menthol and a little goes a very long way. I always use it when I travel on planes as well, the dry air you know.</li>
            <li> Works great, but very small amount for the price.</li>
            <li> Great Product.  Use it to keep nose moist at night.  Also works great on rashes, etc.  Have recommended it to my friends.  Have used it for years.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff....I use it to clear my nose at bedtime.</li>
            <li> Great product. Have used this for years. Glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Helps with dry nasal lining, which during winter cracks and bleeds..agreat value and makes winter months less painful</li>
            <li> My husband and I have bee using this product since we met each other and probably before that(We are senior citizens).  It is inexpensive and works for chapped lips really well. The delivery is always right on.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> great product and no wait like at CVS</li>
            <li> An old favorite that always helps. I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that works for me. I&#x27;ve tried other ones but nope, Boroleum it is.</li>
            <li> Love this product it helps me sleep better at night with out my nasal passage drying out from the heat at night.</li>
            <li> Great for keeping your nasal passages from being dry.</li>
            <li> Excellent for dry nostrils.</li>
            <li> I use it regularly and love it. Great product!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since I was a little kid, and my mother who recommended it to me has been using it even longer.  Works great in loosening mucus and soothing sore/rough skin that arises from blowing one&#x27;s nose often during times of nasal distress.  It also works great as a moisturizer on dry/chapped skin for other parts of your body, especially hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent most of the winter recovering from a sinus infection that has left my nose very dry and sore.  I bought this product not expecting much but have been beyond satisfied.  I apply just a little bit every morning and night and in just a few days I feel so much better.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> We love ❤ this stuff.</li>
            <li> Better than Vicks, need this for dry weather</li>
            <li> i have numerous problems with dry nose since my unfortunate deviated septum operation. Using this twice a day keeps my nose bearable and no bleeding since using it. That was new to me.  Nice aroma.</li>
            <li> Good nose swab to mitigate blood flow in nose bleeds and moisturize nasal lining.</li>
            <li> BEST NOSE MED I HAVE FOUND.  BW</li>
            <li> A good old fashioned home remody type of thing, Boreleum really works well to soothe sore, dry, stuffy nose problems.  It&#x27;s similar to Vicks Vapo Rub, but safer to apply directly where it&#x27;s needed.  I would readily recommend it to cold or sinus sufferers.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good.  Pretty much just vaseline with some methol in it.  Menthol is not that strong though.  It does keep you nose moisturized if you use twice a day.  You only need to use a little at a time, so tube will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Great product but not easy to stop the future shipments</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best I have found in the entire world wide market. (I live in Germany much of the time).&lt;br /&gt;In winter I get red and scaly feeling under my nose. This fixes that!</li>
            <li> This is great for nasal dryness and soreness.  But, be careful not to use to much or you&#x27;ll be trying to figure out what to do with it.  I mean a tiny amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I live in an area of very low humidity, and this stuff saves the delicate skin in my nose.</li>
            <li> I found this product good to use especially on a plane trip to prevent germs aboard from me. I have used it every trip for about 10 years and&lt;br /&gt;have not gotten sick. So much sickness circulates through plane air systems.</li>
            <li> For the past 3 months I have suffered from what can only be described as small paper cuts on the inside of my nostril at the top where my nostril meets the septum. I can only ascertain that they were caused from dryness and also due to the fact that I started smoking again (terrible I know). These tiny cuts caused unbelievable amounts of pain when blowing my nose, or if I simply gently touched my nose in any way. Due to the wet environment of the inside of the nostril they would never heal. They would scab up, the scab would fall off before it was ready and then it would be an open wound again. Repeat this misery for the last 3 months of my life. I bought every product imaginable trying to resolve this: aquaphor, nose better gel, homeopathic tea tree oil salve, silver antibiotic gel, you name it I tried it and used it religiously! Nothing seemed to heal them, until I ordered this stuff! Within about 1.5 weeks the horrible little sores are completely healed up! I still apply it a few times a day to ensure they stay moisturized so I don&#x27;t ever have this problem again! The ointment is actually quite soothing and a bonus it clears your sinuses. I don&#x27;t mind the smell it&#x27;s kinda refreshing actually. This product saved my nose!</li>
            <li> I dont typically write reviews, but I have been searching for this nasal gel for a year since I ran out and finally found it again! I have tried many brands, but this one has changed the insides of my dry, sinus and allergy prone nose - it is so amazing! You will not be sorry. It doesn&#x27;t sting or smell bad; it has a nice wintergreen type scent. A+++++</li>
            <li> What a blessing!  I was waking up with a bloody nose every morning until I started using Boroleum!  I apply it several times a day and right before I go to sleep.  No more bloody, dry nose! I have purchased an additional tube, one for home and one for work.  I do not want to run out, even though you only need to use a small amount.</li>
            <li> This product is great for dry nosrils. When I travel to areas that are outside of my norm, this product is so helpful, because my nostrils tend to dry out. It is also great if you have allergies.</li>
            <li> LOVE the product but BEWARE you will begin receiving emails about all kinds of other products whose lists you are suddenly on</li>
            <li> Excellent-been using it since 1970&#x27;s</li>
            <li> AS EXPECTED AND SHIPPED PROMPTLY</li>
            <li> Chose this product because of constant allergy stuffiness.  Used 2x already but it does not seem to last long enough for me.  Will try once more when allergy season in full bloom.</li>
            <li> This really helps keep my nostrils coated so they don&#x27;t dry out as often.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get through the night with this product!</li>
            <li> When I was little(along time ago) My Mom used simple products for everyday discomforts. When we got a stuffy or dry nose from a cold or allergy, a spot of Boroleum did the trick. JUST TRY IT -Believe me its FAB</li>
