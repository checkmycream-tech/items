    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>For me, Abba works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I am very impressed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li>Best shampoo I have ever used!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great if your hair needs recovery.</li>
            <li>It smells great, I&#x27;m not allergic to it, and it does what it is supposed to do:  </li>
            <li>I loved it and started buying it in bulk.</li>
            <li>Smells great, too, kind of like marzipan.</li>
            <li>love it!  </li>
            <li>kind of like coconut</li>
            <li>This shampoo with aloe vera and rose canina works like a charm for my hair.</li>
            <li>It suds up nicely, detangles and can deal with even the most damaged locks.</li>
            <li>Cleans hair great, no buildup, fresh smell.</li>
            <li>it would have been a much better product.</li>
            <li>I love these Abba products.  </li>
            <li>My hair does so much better.  </li>
            <li>My beautician recommended this product to me and I am so glad that I found it.</li>
            <li>LOVE it.</li>
            <li>For now, I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used this shampoo for years and love it.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>More so than the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Cheap dollar store shampoo would do a better job.  </li>
            <li>It now leaves a greasy feeling in my hair and doesn&#x27;t seem to clean it, and it also strips more color from my hair than it used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a lovely, rose-like scent, and you need just the smallest amount to clean your hair.  </li>
            <li>The scent does err on the strong side, but it doesn&#x27;t linger once you rinse it out.</li>
            <li>I have fine textured hair.  </li>
            <li>the smell is light ...</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was really happy to find this shampoo on Amazon as my local drugstore no longer carries it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again I am not picky about shampoo, it just has to be gentle, yet clean well, have some lather, be sulfate free, have no terrible ingredients or overwhelming fragrance, affordable and cruelty free.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;real\\&quot; formula, or maybe just a more current one, is great, definitely the best shampoo I&#x27;ve used in a long time.</li>
            <li>clean hair well WITHOUT drying or further damaging my damaged, colored hair at all; both have pleasant fragrance that rinse out and do not linger in hair.</li>
            <li>I do love Abba as a company as they have a large range of products that are 100% vegan.  </li>
            <li>I do think it helps maintain color fairly well, but it&#x27;s definitely a STAR when it comes to the condition it leaves the hair in.</li>
            <li>it is usually pretty easy.  </li>
            <li>My hair is clean but not stripped, fresh but not perfumed.  </li>
            <li>Ofcourse not as much suds as the sulfate shampoos (that is fine by me) and</li>
            <li>I started using this in my salon and on my own head several years ago, and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the performance.</li>
            <li>This one is worth the try.</li>
            <li>This product not only smells nice but makes my hair feel silky without stripping my color.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps because it is vegan it has a stale smell instead of the typically bright smells associated with good shampoo.  </li>
            <li>So I would consider this shampoo a success and will continue to repurchase whichever version of ABBA Color Protect Amazon</li>
            <li>The new one (coconut &amp; sage) smells like very sweet vanilla&#x27;d coconut.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this twice so far, but I love how rich it is and how healthy my hair feels after using it.</li>
            <li>it was only fair to edit this review as I&#x27;ve come to realize that the NEW formula may be the one that I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>Previously I had been using kerastase, which I loved.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is very gentle</li>
            <li>Also, the cap on the bottle was shattered when I received it, which wasn&#x27;t s huge deal because I just replaced it with the cap from my old bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>at 38 I finally like my hair :)</li>
            <li>I will just find a better smelling sulfate-free shampoo or go back to Kerastase.</li>
            <li>The first time I ordered this shampoo, I got the Color Protection Shampoo with Aloe &amp; Rosa Canina (which is what is pictured in the product page).</li>
            <li>My one tip is that it is very concentrated, so I mix it in a pump bottle with water in equal parts...making it easier to rinse as well as a better value.</li>
            <li>Since I haven&#x27;t used it for too long, I can&#x27;t yet comment on its color-protecting abilities, but I will update my review as I use this more.</li>
            <li>Color still bleeds and fades from my hair, but that is inevitable with my combination of damaged/overprocessed hair + red dye (which I&#x27;m sure you know fades very fast!).</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and smooth, with no heavy residue.</li>
            <li>It took me a long time to embrace the sulfate free shampoos, because I demand bubbles...</li>
            <li>Both lather well for a sulfate-free shampoo, much more than my previous DermOrganic</li>
            <li>it leaves my hair color vibrant.</li>
            <li>This is the older product as pictured, not the newer version.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gentle and all natural product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have red tones in my hair and red is notorious for fading very quickly, so I&#x27;m hoping that this extends the vibrancy of my color.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;ve noticed that it takes a good four weeks for my base color to fade enough to see my highlights since this does such a good job of keeping the color on your hair.  </li>
            <li>The old one (Aloe &amp; rosa canina) smells like fruity rosy cherries.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this shampoo for anyone, especially if they color their hair.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner are both products i purchase at my salon and was excited to find on Amazon for a fraction of the cost (almost four times less) - a terrific find!</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE ON 3/28/13:  I&#x27;ve been using this since last August, and it really does make your color last a lot longer.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair feeling clean, and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo has the consistency of KY Jelly and took 3x as much shampoo compared to other shampoos.  </li>
            <li>I generally do not leave bad reviews, but I felt compelled to share as buying a shampoo without being able to smell it first can be iffy.</li>

            <li> My overall color still lasts quite a while before needing a refresher, actually quite long considering how damaged my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it twice now with the same results, and it actually dried my hair out which doesn&#x27;t normally happen.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately its still mostly better than the other options out there with the same properties.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is an old formula, but the shampoo I received is nothing like the bottle of the same shampoo I just finished using, and had purchased from a chain drugstore.</li>
            <li> I have long, wavy color-treated hair.  </li>
            <li> Definitely give their other products a chance.</li>
            <li> Other than the fragrance, I don&#x27;t notice any big differences.</li>
            <li> (Probably because it doesn&#x27;t dry out and strip the hair)</li>
            <li> I have purchased other Abba shampoos before and really liked them, so please don&#x27;t think all of their products are bad.  </li>
            <li> I put a dollop of this stuff on my hand, rubbed it between my wet hands, and then attempted to apply it to my soaking wet hair.  </li>
            <li> It has absolutely no lather, and the scent is nothing like the Abba Color Protect shampoo I had before this one.</li>
            <li> The trouble is that the shampoo I got from this seller on Amazon is not the same shampoo.</li>
            <li> A little bottle goes a long way!</li>
            <li> It lathers less like any other low/no sulfate shampoo.  </li>
            <li> For some reason a shampoo that fulfills all of those is hard to find, but ABBA fits my basic needs well.</li>
            <li> The second time I ordered, I got the Color Protection Shampoo with &amp;#34;ProQuinoa Complex with Coconut and sage&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I no longer need any other product!</li>
            <li> I have hair with a little wave in it....and can even go a day or two between washings.  </li>
            <li> A few folks on a haircare forum recommended this to me when I was asking about moisturizing shampoos.  </li>
            <li> I am a very frugal person and don&#x27;t like to waste anything, but this shampoo was SO bad that I dumped about 3/4 of it down the shower drain.  </li>
            <li> and it was very difficult to work it though my hair, no matter how much I used per shampoo.  </li>
            <li> The scent was not appealing at all, either.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not sure if there is any way to control which you get.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> not sure why they switched, but its just not nearly as good as it was.</li>
            <li> if it doesn&#x27;t bubble, it seems broken to me despite the science or logic printed on the bottle.</li>
            <li> This is by far the WORST shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used!  </li>
            <li> Steer WAY clear of this crap!  </li>
            <li> I am stunned by the bad reviews on this.</li>
            <li> It is so bad that I will have to just throw it away and find another source.</li>
            <li> I absolutely HATED this shampoo!  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is by far the WORST shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used!  Cheap dollar store shampoo would do a better job.  The shampoo has the consistency of KY Jelly and took 3x as much shampoo compared to other shampoos.  I have shoulder length hair and washing it is usually pretty easy.  I put a dollop of this stuff on my hand, rubbed it between my wet hands, and then attempted to apply it to my soaking wet hair.  It globbed up all in 1 spot and then didn&#x27;t spread out!  I had a heck of a time rinsing it out.  I&#x27;ve tried it twice now with the same results, and it actually dried my hair out which doesn&#x27;t normally happen.  The smell is obnoxious.  Steer WAY clear of this crap!  I&#x27;d expect that for $2 an ounce (when bought from my salon) it would have been a much better product.</li>
            <li> I am stunned by the bad reviews on this. It took me a long time to embrace the sulfate free shampoos, because I demand bubbles...if it doesn&#x27;t bubble, it seems broken to me despite the science or logic printed on the bottle. I started using this in my salon and on my own head several years ago, and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the performance. I do think it helps maintain color fairly well, but it&#x27;s definitely a STAR when it comes to the condition it leaves the hair in. It suds up nicely, detangles and can deal with even the most damaged locks. My one tip is that it is very concentrated, so I mix it in a pump bottle with water in equal parts...making it easier to rinse as well as a better value. This stuff is great if your hair needs recovery. I follow with the corresponding conditioner, also thinned out with water.</li>
            <li> I love these Abba products.  My hair does so much better.  I started with the conditioner and then added the shampoo.  Of course, ordering from Amazon is a price savings. I recommend them.  5 stars!!</li>
            <li> Everyone has different needs for their hair care.  I have long, wavy color-treated hair.  I wash it only about twice a week.  For me, Abba works perfectly.  My hair is clean but not stripped, fresh but not perfumed.  It lathers less like any other low/no sulfate shampoo.  I&#x27;ve tried everything, no expense spared, from eco-friendly products to salon recommendations.  This is the ticket for me.  This one is worth the try.</li>
            <li> I color my hair and have had to use some sort of antifrizz serum for years......but once I switched to this shampoo and conditioner I no longer need any other product! (Probably because it doesn&#x27;t dry out and strip the hair) I have hair with a little wave in it....and can even go a day or two between washings.  I am very impressed. Ofcourse not as much suds as the sulfate shampoos (that is fine by me) and the smell is light ...kind of like coconut....but I can deal with that........at 38 I finally like my hair :)</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner are both products i purchase at my salon and was excited to find on Amazon for a fraction of the cost (almost four times less) - a terrific find!</li>
            <li> I started using this shampoo after being offered a sample from my hair stylist. I loved it and started buying it in bulk. After 2 years, they changed their formula. It now leaves a greasy feeling in my hair and doesn&#x27;t seem to clean it, and it also strips more color from my hair than it used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure why they switched, but its just not nearly as good as it was. Unfortunately its still mostly better than the other options out there with the same properties.</li>
            <li> I absolutely HATED this shampoo!  I am a very frugal person and don&#x27;t like to waste anything, but this shampoo was SO bad that I dumped about 3/4 of it down the shower drain.  It did not lather at ALL and it was very difficult to work it though my hair, no matter how much I used per shampoo.  I have purchased other Abba shampoos before and really liked them, so please don&#x27;t think all of their products are bad.  I do love Abba as a company as they have a large range of products that are 100% vegan.  Definitely give their other products a chance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this shampoo for anyone, especially if they color their hair. It&#x27;s a gentle and all natural product. Just need about the size of a dime squirted into my hand, in order to thoroughly shampoo my hair. A little bottle goes a long way!</li>
            <li> love it!  This product not only smells nice but makes my hair feel silky without stripping my color.  it leaves my hair color vibrant. My beautician recommended this product to me and I am so glad that I found it. Next time I plan to purchase a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years! LOVE it. My hair feels soft and smooth, with no heavy residue. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This shampoo with aloe vera and rose canina works like a charm for my hair. It smells great, I&#x27;m not allergic to it, and it does what it is supposed to do:  it cleans my hair and does not fade the color.</li>
            <li> Previously I had been using kerastase, which I loved. However, I figured another sulfate-free shampoo would have the same effect and this was cheaper. It left my hair feeling unclean ang greasy at the crown after just 12 hours or so. The scent was not appealing at all, either. I generally do not leave bad reviews, but I felt compelled to share as buying a shampoo without being able to smell it first can be iffy. Perhaps because it is vegan it has a stale smell instead of the typically bright smells associated with good shampoo.  I will just find a better smelling sulfate-free shampoo or go back to Kerastase.</li>
            <li> The first time I ordered this shampoo, I got the Color Protection Shampoo with Aloe &amp; Rosa Canina (which is what is pictured in the product page). The second time I ordered, I got the Color Protection Shampoo with &amp;#34;ProQuinoa Complex with Coconut and sage&amp;#34;. Both times, I ordered from this very same page from Amazon LLC. So I&#x27;m not sure if there is any way to control which you get.&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I opened my second bottle, I knew it was different from the scent. The old one (Aloe &amp; rosa canina) smells like fruity rosy cherries. The new one (coconut &amp; sage) smells like very sweet vanilla&#x27;d coconut. Scent-wise I prefer the coconut as I tend to dislike fruity scents. The scent does err on the strong side, but it doesn&#x27;t linger once you rinse it out. Other than the fragrance, I don&#x27;t notice any big differences. But YMMV as I am not picky about shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;On the actual product- I do like both shampoos. Both lather well for a sulfate-free shampoo, much more than my previous DermOrganic (I know lather isn&#x27;t correlated with cleanliness, I just can&#x27;t get over the lather-need society has conditioned in me); clean hair well WITHOUT drying or further damaging my damaged, colored hair at all; both have pleasant fragrance that rinse out and do not linger in hair. Color still bleeds and fades from my hair, but that is inevitable with my combination of damaged/overprocessed hair + red dye (which I&#x27;m sure you know fades very fast!). My overall color still lasts quite a while before needing a refresher, actually quite long considering how damaged my hair is.&lt;br /&gt;Again I am not picky about shampoo, it just has to be gentle, yet clean well, have some lather, be sulfate free, have no terrible ingredients or overwhelming fragrance, affordable and cruelty free. For some reason a shampoo that fulfills all of those is hard to find, but ABBA fits my basic needs well. So I would consider this shampoo a success and will continue to repurchase whichever version of ABBA Color Protect Amazon decides to throw at me.Amazon decides to throw at me.</li>
            <li> I like the shampoo fragrance and how it cleanses my hair. There seems to be no residue left in my hair. I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> A few folks on a haircare forum recommended this to me when I was asking about moisturizing shampoos.  I&#x27;ve only used this twice so far, but I love how rich it is and how healthy my hair feels after using it. It has a lovely, rose-like scent, and you need just the smallest amount to clean your hair.  It&#x27;s also sulfate- and silicone-free for those following the Curly Girl routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have red tones in my hair and red is notorious for fading very quickly, so I&#x27;m hoping that this extends the vibrancy of my color.  Since I haven&#x27;t used it for too long, I can&#x27;t yet comment on its color-protecting abilities, but I will update my review as I use this more. For now, I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE ON 3/28/13:  I&#x27;ve been using this since last August, and it really does make your color last a lot longer.  In fact, I&#x27;ve noticed that it takes a good four weeks for my base color to fade enough to see my highlights since this does such a good job of keeping the color on your hair.  It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for years and love it.  This is the older product as pictured, not the newer version.</li>
            <li> I love it. Best shampoo I have ever used!  I got complements people asking what I did to my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of this shampoo.  More so than the conditioner.  I only use sulfate-free shampoos and this one is one of my favourites.  Leaves my hair feeling clean, and a little goes a long way.  I always pick it up on Amazon as it&#x27;s the cheapest here.  This is one shampoo that will always be in the rotation.  Smells great, too, kind of like marzipan.</li>
            <li> I have fine textured hair.  This shampoo is very gentle and I&#x27;ve used it every day for years.  Cleans hair great, no buildup, fresh smell.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is an old formula, but the shampoo I received is nothing like the bottle of the same shampoo I just finished using, and had purchased from a chain drugstore. It has absolutely no lather, and the scent is nothing like the Abba Color Protect shampoo I had before this one. Also, the cap on the bottle was shattered when I received it, which wasn&#x27;t s huge deal because I just replaced it with the cap from my old bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really happy to find this shampoo on Amazon as my local drugstore no longer carries it. The \\&quot;real\\&quot; formula, or maybe just a more current one, is great, definitely the best shampoo I&#x27;ve used in a long time. The trouble is that the shampoo I got from this seller on Amazon is not the same shampoo. It is so bad that I will have to just throw it away and find another source. So bummed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 2/14/13&lt;br /&gt;Thought it was only fair to edit this review as I&#x27;ve come to realize that the NEW formula may be the one that I don&#x27;t like. Can&#x27;t blame the seller for this. I still give it one star though because this shampoo went from the best ever to the worst ever!</li>
