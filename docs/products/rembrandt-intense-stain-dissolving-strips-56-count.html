            <li>The box, and my dentist, told me I can&#x27;t bleach the bonding, but I&#x27;m telling you it lightened my front and bottom teeth evenly, so I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
            <li>Happy whitening!</li>
            <li>This is probably your best bet.</li>
            <li>And the best part?</li>
            <li>It does leave some residue of sticky goo, but my teeth look great!!!</li>
            <li>Excellent product.  </li>

            <li>I love these strips!!!</li>
            <li>strips are AMAZING!!</li>
            <li>Great value and excellent product!</li>
            <li>incredibly chapped.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But when I start to move it, or attempt to eat or drink, it was incredibly painful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was impressed with the great results achieved also.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;strips - Brilliant they stick to the teeth and don&#x27;t move about and shift and cause me to want to spit every two seconds.</li>
            <li>great buy for the price</li>
            <li>These work great for the price.</li>
            <li>and my teeth looked great in all the photos.</li>
            <li>This is the best value I have found for this kind of product.</li>
            <li>, I can still notice the candy corn effect on my teeth, but they are lessened, so I am happy.  </li>
            <li>Great over the counter whitening system.</li>
            <li>Rembrandts are great because the dissolve in your mouth.</li>
            <li>happy to find them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>great product.</li>
            <li>Great whiting kit.</li>
            <li>My teeth were noticeably whiter, I was happy.</li>
            <li>I think these are really a great bargain, I read one reviewer used just one strip by putting thier teeth together and then slapping it on like that until it begins to dissolve.</li>
            <li>Despite these flaws, I would still purchase again for the great whitening they provide.</li>
            <li>and they work great.  </li>
            <li>I drink coffee every day and the dentist asks me what I use because my whitening looks great.</li>
            <li>The Rembrandt strips work great for me.  </li>
            <li>These strips are great to use since they dissolve while in your mouth.</li>
            <li>Listerine discontinued these, I was happy to see the Rembrandt folks carry them.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize this when I got it, but it is still a great value.</li>
            <li>well though, them along with the toothpaste and the mouthwash have greatly improved the color of my teeth.</li>
            <li>And they are a great price as well.</li>
            <li>So I think these work great, I&#x27;m seeing a difference, but DO NOT fall asleep with these in your mouth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say these win by a landslide.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The do the job at a great price, and the fact they dissolve is a great feature.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>Works great will buy again.</li>
            <li>It works great</li>
            <li>and my teeth feel and look great.  </li>
            <li>The whitening works great</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>great product.</li>
            <li>Price is great, product is great.  </li>
            <li>Great product, it works well</li>
            <li>works great takes a while for results</li>
            <li>Great experience.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far...not a happy customer.</li>
            <li>The price is also great.</li>
            <li>They work great.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>He hasn&#x27;t experienced any sensitivity or pain while using them.</li>
            <li>and I can already see a huge difference!!!</li>
            <li>Love this product!!</li>
            <li>very useful, just one week you will see the difference!!!</li>
            <li>These are amazing!</li>
            <li>These are amazing!</li>
            <li>Amazing results with this product!</li>
            <li>I reaaly liked the ease of use and the results these strips gave me!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Experience more of the wonderful thank you</li>
            <li>They whiten really nicely without any pain, are minty tasting and there were 56 strips in this box!  </li>
            <li>The strips dissolve, and they have a minty taste that is pleasant.  </li>
            <li>I am allergic to all Crest whitening products, so I am very happy to have found an inexpensive, easy to use alternative.</li>
            <li>Very Easy And Convenient!</li>
            <li>Whenever I feel that my teeth are not as bright as they were when I started the treatment, I restart the process all over.</li>
            <li>Whenever I feel that my teeth are not as bright as they were when I started the treatment, I restart the process all over.</li>
            <li>It was always a good hour or so for me.  </li>
            <li>but what good is that if they don&#x27;t remove stains or yellowing on the teeth?</li>
            <li>This product is good.</li>
            <li>Good luck with that.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be fair, I found these under the sink in my bathroom, in a box meant for whitening strips from Crest.</li>
            <li>I am delighted to find them on the market again and wish I&#x27;d realized sooner that these are the ones I used to use.  </li>
            <li>my teeth look good for now,</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>but these did a good job.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t smoke but do drink coffee (with cream) and my teeth are a good color</li>
            <li>Wish the whiting lasted longer but good results</li>
            <li>I have been searching for good whitening strips since they stopped selling the Listerine ones at Target.</li>
            <li>Loved it.  </li>
            <li>I like these strips don&#x27;t have to take them out good in 10 minutes vanish.</li>
            <li>You now have strips on your teeth to make them even more beautiful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m  planning buying more Thomas products from Amazon great online shopping</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product&#x27;s effectiveness.</li>
            <li>probably not as good as the nice crest ones</li>
            <li>do leave a nice taste and my teeth feel good afterwards.  </li>
            <li>The very first application of the strips showed a remarkable improvement!</li>
            <li>Love these teeth strips!</li>
            <li>I love that these strips dissolve on your teeth!</li>
            <li>the results wont improve much more after 3 weeks!</li>
            <li>but I drink more coffee now to reduce my appetite, so now my bi annual whitening will be with Rembrandt!</li>
            <li>These worked ok but not as well as I had hoped!</li>
            <li>They work better!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>On top of that, they work!</li>
            <li>absolutely love these!</li>
            <li>Love the dissolvable!</li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li>I love them!</li>
            <li>The dryer your teeth and surrounding gums, the more successful you will be in positioning the strips.  </li>
            <li>I love these!</li>
            <li>I love these things!</li>
            <li>The taste isn&#x27;t the greatest when you first start using them</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying more today!</li>
            <li>Love it !</li>
            <li>but these do work great and are easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy application on the teeth provide for a great experience.</li>
            <li>They are amazing.</li>
            <li>They are amazing.</li>
            <li>These are amazing.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t work as well to me as the Rembrant nor are they as cost effective as the Rembrandt.</li>
            <li>Perfect for those who don&#x27;t have perfectly straight teeth.</li>
            <li>But maybe that&#x27;s a good thing as they spend more time on your teeth cleaning them.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be doing a nice job.</li>
            <li>They really do work wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Since they dissolve on their own, you don&#x27;t have to worry about finding a place to throw them out.</li>
            <li>Kind of like that feeling you get after a dentist appointment</li>
            <li>kind of just let my saliva and the disolved strip just pool around my teeth</li>
            <li>I did notice a difference when I finished using the product, but it wasn&#x27;t as nice of a difference as I was hoping/wanting/expecting.</li>
            <li>Definitely nice to know that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using the whole Rembrandt system and I&#x27;m very happy with this.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re effective.</li>
            <li>I loved those just as much as I love these.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I would suggest getting a non-dissolvable kind of strip -- one with a plastic backing that needs to be removed.</li>
            <li>Have mouthwash or water handy to rinse thoroughly once the 10-15 minutes are up.  </li>
            <li>strips effectively whitened my teeth and reduced</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t move which is nice.</li>
            <li>These are perfect in every way.&lt;br /&gt;Price - Reasonable, so maybe it doesn&#x27;t come in a fancy plastic box but who cares?</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be honest..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as effective as spending hundreds at a dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the kind that you take off after about 20 minutes -</li>
            <li>SEE THE SMILE ON MY FACE BRIGHTER WHITER TEETH!!!</li>
            <li>For older people, I am in my 50s and my teeth are whiter than they have been for a good 20+ years!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;In summary, I am very pleased with the results, but I am glad I had a checkup when I did</li>
            <li>The price (&amp;#60;$20) was great, but in retrospect it may have been more worthwhile to spend a bit more (e.g. ~$30) to get Crest Whitestrips.</li>
            <li>While these are easy to use and dissolve, they aren&#x27;t as good as the Listerine version.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>price is good but rather pay more and get better product.</li>
            <li>These strips are very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>used for the first 2 weeks..very good!</li>
            <li>Excellent was beautiful and wonderful, but after experience pain in the teeth of cold water</li>
            <li>This worked pretty good!</li>
            <li>Great well worth</li>
            <li>They dissolve mostly on there own, but I never have a problem since I brush after.</li>
            <li>That being said, as an adult I&#x27;ve tried my best to take care of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>These strips do the job and so easy!</li>
            <li>you want an easy way to whiten then these strips are it!</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice to be able to talk while you&#x27;re wearing these strips and they dissolve (for the most part)</li>
            <li>They are very easy and enjoyable to use.</li>
            <li>You can see results almost immediately and for the price, it&#x27;s a great alternative to higher prices strips.  </li>
            <li>Product was delivered on time,works great as stated,I will be buying again from Amazon, thanks!</li>
            <li>These are very comfortable to wear, nearly invisible and have a very pleasant taste.</li>
            <li>Love these, easy &amp; they work!</li>
            <li>effective product that is easy to use---very well thought out.  </li>
            <li>These strips are easy to apply, dissolve quickly, and are very effective.</li>
            <li>Love these strips.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that it dissolves in your mouth.</li>
            <li>Though I love Rembrandt toothpaste and mouthwash.</li>
            <li>I love to drink iced coffee</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re hassle free!</li>
            <li>Love that the strips just dissolve away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are okay.</li>
            <li>Great product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Which means they are even MORE expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but seems that after awhile it doesn&#x27;t go much better ...</li>
            <li>I love how well they stick to my teeth.</li>
            <li>so when you put them on try to get them mostly on your teeth.</li>
            <li>By the time I get out, they&#x27;re mostly dissolved.  </li>
            <li>I love these whitening strips.  </li>
            <li>love this</li>
            <li>Better instruction needed and bleaching</li>
            <li>I love them, but not at their latest price.  </li>
            <li>They whiten ok.....</li>
            <li>They work so much better and are easier to use.</li>
            <li>There is mostly hydrogen peroxide in here</li>
            <li>This comes with more and is cheaper though</li>
            <li>My teeth were taking on a light mahogany color (ick!).</li>
            <li>I love it and am planning to purchase more.</li>
            <li>I love these.  </li>
            <li>so, so much more</li>
            <li>The strips themselves were interesting.</li>
            <li>I am able to ignore it.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s more bang for my buck</li>
            <li>These stick to teeth SO much better than Crest.</li>
            <li>Once they touch your teeth, you better not need to move them because they are officially stuck.</li>
            <li>After a while, I gave up and rinsed with water, satisfied that this was Rembrandt&#x27;s intention.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if they are the best choice in terms of radical whitening, but they&#x27;re the ones I prefer in terms of the total package.  </li>
            <li>I did not experience any gum sensitivity and I am pleased with the result.</li>
            <li>Put it on when  heading out of the house and before you reach your destination the strip will have dissolved.&lt;br /&gt;Easiest and most affordable way to deal with unwanted stains.</li>
            <li>not too sure this worked for me..</li>
            <li>A $.58 bottle of hydrogen peroxide is working much better for me than this.  </li>
            <li>So much easier to use and really great results.  </li>
            <li>These work much better than Crest strips.</li>
            <li>Make sure you follow the directions on how to put them on your teeth..</li>
            <li>If i felt I needed more whitening, I would use them a couple days more.</li>
            <li>I like putting them on and being able to leave my house and even drink water with it in.  </li>
            <li>Best white strip I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li>Will be buying some more for sure, thank you.</li>
            <li>I love these dissolving strips because you can put them on and go.</li>
            <li>I also have resin bonding on my top front teeth.</li>
            <li>Eliminate saliva from your bottom teeth as best as possible.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spat out more mangled whitening strips than I care to say.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I got better results that lasted longer</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how many minutes that takes but</li>
            <li>No there are stronger, but these do the trick and remove most of you coffee/tea stains.</li>
            <li>At that point, the strip starts to tear and more attaches to my lips.  </li>
            <li>Soon, more of this strip is on the inside of my mouth than on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, these strips seem to be the most convenient.  </li>
            <li>Also more invisible.  </li>
            <li>More convenient than trays or strips that you must remove.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased that Rembrandt is now manufacturing these so the strips are easier to remove from the packets!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got a sample of this online and now ordered more.</li>
            <li>My gums were ok</li>
            <li>These are my favorite.  </li>
            <li>the top all the way across.</li>
            <li>You should be able to avoid it sticking to your lip.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had an issue with the top</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>and I love that the strips dissolve.</li>
            <li>was pleased with the price and the amount of the product that the package contained.  </li>
            <li>i will order more of this if it does.</li>
            <li>My sister raved about how bright my smile was at a wedding.</li>
            <li>More like 20, and even then I&#x27;ll have bits stuck to my gums</li>
            <li>I love these strips.</li>
            <li>They are a lot better than the crest</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>got more whitening from 3 days of these than my wife got from 10 days of a whitening kit she got from the dentist.  </li>
            <li>Best white strips on the market</li>
            <li>These are the best white strips I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I love these strips,</li>
            <li>and you should be able to remove the strip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried numerous types of stain removing products for my teeth and this one works the best.  </li>
            <li>It does not, however, magically remove all stains and the product must be used once or twice a day to get results.  </li>
            <li>allows easy access to the stain removing strip which is also very easy to apply to teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This has been a good product for me and the price is right.</li>
            <li>Rembrandt is known as pretty much the best onthe market.</li>
            <li>I agree that it is best to open up 3 sides to easily remove the strip from the package.</li>
            <li>I will say first off, dissolving were a good idea.</li>
            <li>They were good the first couple of days</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed!  </li>
            <li>I love this product because it is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to report that the strips I&#x27;m now using are easy to peel away from the backing.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think these whiten as effectively as Crest WhiteStrips, but the convenience of the quick dissolving means that even my fiance will use them at nighttime</li>
            <li>They are the easiest strips to use to clean your teeth!</li>
            <li>I miss the original Crest White Strips, they were the best</li>
            <li>If I ever find them again at a fair price, I&#x27;ll certainly stock up again.</li>
            <li>The only whiting strips easy to use and effective!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great so far.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t expect a roughly $20 product to get rid of years of stained teeth, but for the price and the result I&#x27;ve seen, I&#x27;d say the product worked to the best of its ability.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product as a cheap alternative to the crest whitening strips, They are OK...</li>
            <li>This product provided the results I would have expected and the price was was the best I found anywhere online</li>
            <li>This works great for me because I&#x27;m always so busy.</li>
            <li>Great for people with sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>, I too like other reviewers didn&#x27;t realize you had to use them twice a day best results.</li>
            <li>Easy to use &amp;#34;on-the-go&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Easily 30 mins</li>
            <li>Easy to use (contrary to some reviews)</li>
            <li>its extremely easy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Super easy to apply, and the rest is history.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use.</li>
            <li>Its an affordable easy way to whiten teeth.</li>
            <li>These tear so easily</li>
            <li>once the working strip is extracted, it is easy to apply to teeth, and works as advertised</li>
            <li>They fall apart way to easy</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, and dissolve in about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Easy to use...does the job well.</li>
            <li>I know that it may not be easy so give up some of these things for some people, for example coffee since it may be part of a person&#x27;s morning routine...</li>
            <li>I know that it may not be easy so give up some of these things for some people, for example coffee since it may be part of a person&#x27;s morning routine...</li>
            <li>&gt;  - Easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Minus-</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use whitening strips.</li>
            <li>works well, noticing a difference, easy to use.</li>
            <li>Yes, you should use scissors when opening the packages, but just cut two packages at once, and it&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li>and these seems so easy to use and inexpensive to me.  </li>
            <li>Malleable but don&#x27;t rip easily.</li>
            <li>(there are two perforations) for easy access to the strip.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>easy, not bulky.</li>
            <li>The strips were easy to apply and dissolved within 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>They were easy to use and put on.  </li>
            <li>Full access to the strip, just make sure your hands ARE DRY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They whitened my teeth beautifully, and I didn&#x27;t even need to use all of them to get my desired results, so I am saving them for the future!</li>
            <li>These strips are not a &amp;#34;gooey&amp;#34; and can easily and quickly be applied to your teeth and they stay put!</li>
            <li>I have beautiful white teeth.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll love them just as much as I do. :)</li>
            <li>these certainly whiten and make your teeth appear clean a good quick fix!</li>
            <li>better than the rembrandt 2-hour trays, best in general so far!  </li>
            <li>but I just took a break for a couple days and it was fine.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and cheap vs alternatives</li>
            <li>Obviously the cheapest way is not always the most effective!</li>
            <li>These are definitely a worthy replacement!</li>
            <li>I thought it would whiten much more quickly</li>
            <li>After the first couple of applications, it&#x27;s very easy to do.</li>
            <li>At this great price I am surprised more people don&#x27;t ditch that other popular brand and switch to Rembrandt!  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see a huge difference</li>
            <li>and I can see a huge difference.</li>
            <li>The only thing that didn&#x27;t make me happy was that the expiration date on the box is 12/2014.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d put them on, read for about an hour, and notice there was still about 10% remaining when I turned out the light.  </li>
            <li>Much more fun than brushing with horseradish.</li>
            <li>These things are powerful using dental grade activated peroxide, which is safe orally and can be swallowed because it converts into Oxygen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great to use for short term</li>
            <li>I really liked the Listerine Whiting strip&#x27;s, but they were discontinued, these are very close to the Listerine.  </li>
            <li>but I would get compliments on my smile more</li>
            <li>could never get them to fit on my teeth.  </li>
            <li>So if I had to rate this in comparison with the syringe filled whitening or crest</li>
            <li>Also great for maintaining a white smile/ use a couple times a week.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t care for these, didn&#x27;t find them all that effective.  </li>
            <li>and I definitely notice a difference, although we&#x27;re going to get another box so he can keep using them until he&#x27;s happy with the level of whitening.</li>
            <li>They do a good job, if you re not expecting professional whitening.</li>
            <li>They seem to do a good job of whitening so far...</li>
            <li>These strips work effectively and stick on better than any other kind.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also very happy to see the pricing on these (much more reasonably priced than the \\&quot;other</li>
            <li>I also love that they&#x27;re dissolving, I put them on right before I go to bed &amp; they dissolve while I sleep.</li>
            <li>The price is also very fair when compared to other whitening strips.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really notice a huge difference but very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Super easy to apply, and plenty of room to wrap all the way from below your gums up over the tooth.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use</li>
            <li>They dissolved easily and quickly.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use, no need to peel off and really whitened my teeth.</li>
            <li>But wearing them is kind of like high school health</li>
            <li>Definitely a high quality, convenient &amp; effective product.</li>
            <li>They dissolve in about 7 minutes or so which is really nice because you can use them quickly while you&#x27;re getting ready in the morning</li>
            <li>Once received  I found the strips were easy to use and had a ok taste,but didn&#x27;t show much improvement.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the 20$!</li>
            <li>First of many purchases.  </li>
            <li>I love that they don&#x27;t burn my gums like many other of this kind</li>
            <li>and theres no globby tray to clean or strips to remove-</li>
            <li>So perhaps the strips were less than ideal for use after sitting in the household equivalent of a moist cave for three years.</li>
            <li>Application is super easy and quick.</li>
            <li>Worked great, noticeable whitening, the dissolving backer made them much easier to use than other whiteners I have tried, just put them on and go, no waiting to take them off and throw away to backer, normally I would put them on and go to sleep, worked great.</li>
            <li>These are easy to use, respond rapidly and the price is right.</li>
            <li>, they are hard to get all the residue off when you are done too, not the best strips out there</li>
            <li>That lil&#x27; bit of extra work is worth it to me in exchange for being able to leave an effective whitening strip on my teeth that will cleanly dissolve away.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t until about the time I had finished with the whole box that I started noticing a difference, but that&#x27;s OK.  </li>
            <li>Its a good product, I especially like how it just dissolves away.</li>
            <li>After four days of 2-times-a-day applications I&#x27;m pleased at the continued whitening but my teeth are probably not going to get much whiter.</li>
            <li>Also, make sure your mouth is very moist when applying them or they stick to your gums and lips before you can apply them.  </li>
            <li>Good price and actually work.  </li>
            <li>I was intensely shopping lightning deals before Christmas and these strips were available!  </li>
            <li>My teeth didn&#x27;t get sensitive and not having to take off the strips after I&#x27;m done is nice as well compared to the crest.</li>
            <li>Rembrandt Intense Stain Dissolving Strips, 56 Count works better than cheaper products.</li>
            <li>Not as good as going to the dentist, for obvious reasons, but for a home kit</li>
            <li>While I had no issue with these strips, I saw almost no results after almost a full carton.</li>
            <li>I recommend it, I have whole family using it now, which means I have to hurry &amp; order more.</li>
            <li>I loved the listerine brand, they seemed to actually whiten my teeth</li>
            <li>Be SURE your hands are VERY DRY.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not badly, but I see it.</li>
            <li>These work great, easy use, noticeable changes in a few uses.  </li>
            <li>I will suggest that you read the instructions before using for the first time - I put them in backwards and got a mouth full of foam!  </li>
            <li>but these do make a difference, and they are pretty easy to use.</li>
            <li>These are a great price compared to some other brands- based on the reviews here</li>
            <li>The good thing about this box is that you get SO many strips and for sooo little compared to Crest.</li>
            <li>Delivery of the product was quick.  </li>
            <li>It is a mild whitener and does not hurt you gums.</li>
            <li>quick delivery.</li>
            <li>, I think it was a quick fix</li>
            <li>These strips look well and work quickly.</li>
            <li>They dissolve quickly, maybe 5-10 mins.</li>
            <li>would recommend these as a convenient and quick way to get noticeably whiter teeth.  </li>
            <li>If there&#x27;s any portion that hasn&#x27;t fully dissolved by the time I reach the parking lot, I just take a quick swipe with a tissue</li>
            <li>I could stop it quickly, and recover quickly....</li>
            <li>Whitens teeth quickly.</li>
            <li>I got the strips quickly and they were just what I wanted.</li>
            <li>in all, this is the best product out there for stain removal and keeping teeth white based on my experience with about 10 different products.  </li>
            <li>First time was fantastic which is why I ordered it again.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise they whiten nicely and are more affordable then other whitening products on the Market.</li>
            <li>and I loved that these desolved in 5 minutes so you don&#x27;t have to keep them in for too long.</li>
            <li>The taste of the strips is great (typical mouth was taste) and they dissolve on your teeth within 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and not too much discomfort.  </li>
            <li>okay means that it&#x27;s good, but I&#x27;m not sure any products truly whiten teeth like they claim.</li>
            <li>This is very affordable and easy to use it.  </li>
            <li>There are tear notches all around the product, with DRY Hands tear the LENGTH wise side all the way across, then tear the WIDTH Side on either side, you don&#x27;t need to do both</li>
            <li>These are some pretty good whitening strips and I have noticed a several shade difference since using them.</li>
            <li>Regardless, the strips stuck very well and were easy to stick on my teeth.</li>
            <li>be fair, my teeth a pretty yellow from a childhood of yellowing...</li>
            <li>but my first impression is not favorable!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!!</li>
            <li>These are great but use them up fast or they dry up.  </li>
            <li>keeps my teeth pretty clean.</li>
            <li>peeling them off the foil stretches them and they are too large to fit on my teeth.</li>
            <li>I know it says on the package that it is safe and no side effects were reported, but i guess i am little freaked out by swallowing all the stuff they put in it to make my teeth nice ad</li>
            <li>so I like to use these every couple months to keep my teeth nice and white.</li>
            <li>So far I love them.</li>
            <li>:) i have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall.. worth the money in that they do indeed whiten your teeth.</li>
            <li>thus far I think this is a nice, reasonably priced product.</li>
            <li>but I liked that I only had to use them for 2 weeks instead of a month.</li>
            <li>I would love to know if they are completely discontinued</li>
            <li>I think my smile is brighter, but not dramatically.</li>
            <li>Still worth the money given the price vs Crest products for example.</li>
            <li>Hello again 25yr old smile :)</li>
            <li>So nice not having anything left that I have to peel off!</li>
            <li>although I haven&#x27;t finished my 2 weeks worth yet.</li>
            <li>Adapting the instructions saved me from wasting strips and gave me my money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>Here are some tips that are worth considering and are not included in the instructions on the packaging:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My friend is the one who got me hooked on these because he always has the nicest smile and</li>
            <li>that for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>And help your teeth and breathe smelling fresh.</li>
            <li>I used these last year and liked them.</li>
            <li>This is the only kind of whitner to buy.</li>
            <li>found them a lot easier to apply than Crest strips, and am glad they take longer than 10 minutes to dissolve (which, if you&#x27;re patient, they do completely).  </li>
            <li>Worth a try to see what you think</li>
            <li>When first starting, be sure to follow the directions to use them 2x a day - this is very important if you really want them to work for you.</li>
            <li>I usually wear them too bed or while working out, I love love them!  </li>
            <li>This was product was very easy to use, and didn&#x27;t cause me any teeth sensitivity,but the results were good, not great.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them if you are looking for good quality white strips.</li>
            <li>the sink&#x27;s right there.</li>
            <li>No sensitivity, I noticed an improvement right</li>
            <li>I apply them right before I go to bed</li>
            <li>Sometimes this rather stick to your fingers, gums, lips, or tongue but will slip right off</li>
            <li>These strips may contain the right ingredients and work well at whitening, but a conservative guess is that 1/3 of the strips will end up</li>
            <li>so I use them right before going out</li>
            <li>It peels right off.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not like me, and don&#x27;t have mini-scissors handy, tearing 3 sides off first is key.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for whitening strips that were cheap, easy to apply and did not affect my daily life, and these are it!</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t expect amazing results on the first day, but if you are consistent with the use of this product you will start seeing results shortly</li>
            <li>Had a kind of strange taste when dissolving.</li>
            <li>I really liked that these strips dissolved, so I didn&#x27;t have to worry about leaving them on for too long or pulling gooey plastic off my teeth.</li>
            <li>Luckily there are 56 of them, so you can try and try again to get one on straight.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply these strips and the instructions are clear.</li>
            <li>It s not messy, they strips dissolve easily in about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stains that used to be on my teeth have finally come off, and that makes me smile more.</li>
            <li>The whitening effect was not very dramatic; these strips are great if you want a less noticeable whitening.</li>
            <li>They are difficult to stick to bottom teeth for some reasonably they work beautifully on the top ones.</li>
            <li>Make sure to use clean, dry hands and to apply to your bottom teeth first.</li>
            <li>I was happy with how short the process took, and I actually felt like I noticed a difference on the first use.</li>
            <li>After the first 2 weeks of use, the price per day is very negligible and is so very worth spending on THESE Rembrandt Intense Stain Dissolving Strips.</li>
            <li>I only whiten twice a year, since colgate advanced clean toothpaste with the sandy stuff</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why, but crest seems to assume that everyone has a huge mouth with huge teeth and makes the upper strip way too large.</li>
            <li>Much more affordable than the Crest White Strips !</li>
            <li>But glad to use it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to go!  </li>
            <li>But, if you read the box before using, you&#x27;ll find instructions to put them on the lower teeth first --</li>
            <li>After you zip open the top, look at either side of the packet.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a difference after the first treatment.</li>
            <li>Seems to work great as my teeth are brighter but not amazing like the Crest whitening strips.</li>
            <li>and i haven&#x27;t seen a noticeable enough difference for me to give it any more than three stars.</li>
            <li>love these strips because you simply apply them and you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product exactly two times.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, everything went well.</li>
            <li>If I want hot food, I wait until it&#x27;s lukewarm to eat it.</li>
            <li>I have recommended these to multiple friends and they love them as well.</li>
            <li>My first impression was that the instructions are really simple and the packaging was okay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get used to the sensation and get the hang of properly putting them on.</li>
            <li>but like I said it was my first try.</li>
            <li>I did use them two times a day for the first 3 days but my gums got sore</li>
            <li>It has been a week since I started and my teeth are not disgusting yellow anymore!</li>
            <li>The first couple of days using them, however, caused some sensitivity in a couple of my teeth and the surrounding gums.</li>
            <li>but if Im already spending this much I might as well go ahead and buy the Crest Whitestrips!</li>
            <li>After finally reading the instructions and using the strips properly, I found that I liked them!  </li>
            <li>You will need to be consistent and use these twice a day.  </li>
            <li>The whitening strips seem to work pretty well.</li>
            <li>I dread using these, as they melt in your mouth and taste pretty gnarly.</li>
            <li>I have used them 3 days in a row and can&#x27;t imagine how much whiter my teeth could get!</li>
            <li>First, you need to read and follow the instructions.</li>
            <li>The first time using them it took me a minute to get the hang of it, but after that all went well.  </li>
            <li>and I could see how much brighter my smile looked.</li>
            <li>Also they are more affordable than others I find in store and these never left spots on my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Very displeased!</li>
            <li>Make sure you have opened the package all the way across the top, otherwise if you try pulling the strip out with the package ripped open only halfway or so...you might tear the strip.</li>
            <li>I love that the each strip is made to work for both upper or lower.</li>
            <li>At first this caused my stomach to become upset.  </li>
            <li>exactly the shower</li>
            <li>(and you get a lot more per box than with Crest&#x27;s similar product)!  </li>
            <li>These are different for everyone, but they took about 15 minutes for the bottom teeth to dissolve, and 30 for the top to dissolve.</li>
            <li>I have used these strips on and off over the last year and really am satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li>I am a satisfied customer and will keep using them as needed to keep my teeth white since I don&#x27;t plan on giving up my coffee.  </li>
            <li>Ok, I think I&#x27;ll be the first to actually comment on their functionality in addition to their ease of use.</li>
            <li>they really work what else can I say!</li>
            <li>I use them every few weeks to keep my teeth bright looking.</li>
            <li>I think these whitened okay, but they didn&#x27;t actually dissolve  in my mouth after&lt;</li>
            <li>if I&#x27;m able to get enough of them out of the packages.....</li>
            <li>tried my first dissolving strip set this morning.</li>
            <li>will likely buy these again when I run out, as I foresee myself liking them more.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used whitening strips</li>
            <li>I REALLY LIKE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>Be SURE the little triangle cutout is on your left hand side on your bottom teeth, and right hand side on your top teeth!...</li>
            <li>In general, easy to use and god effect for the price.</li>
            <li>Once i finish the box my teeth are a realistic white (not neon white) lol.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used any other kind</li>
            <li>I agree with other users that it is nice to brush teeth after use.</li>
            <li>Open your mouth wide lol and press them against your teeth.</li>
            <li>Not being a coffee or wine drinker nor a smoker may contribute to their lack of effectiveness as I don&#x27;t have much in the way of stains or yellowing to correct, but I was hoping for a brighter, more noticeable white.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product even more than its big name competitor.  </li>
            <li>The first box lasted me a good  months if not more because of the way that I use them (I&#x27;ll explain my routine at the end of this review).</li>
            <li>results are not what you would get if they were done professionally, but that&#x27;s ok because the look that they gave my teeth was a natural look.</li>
            <li>and it is especially quick and easy...not messy like some.</li>
            <li>Also, the strips tear very easily, so need to be careful in application.  </li>
            <li>Some of the strips in the second box did not come of of the packaging easily as was the case of my first box.  </li>
            <li>I gave the Rembrandt a try based on the positive reviews here</li>
            <li>and I got results pretty fast.  </li>
            <li>After that first use, they dont hurt as much.  </li>
            <li>Not unhappy with my purchase, was just expecting more given some of the other reviews.</li>
            <li>For the morning routine I just put them on before the shower and they were pretty much dissolved by the time I got out.</li>
            <li>BAM, a nice white, not to obvious smile.</li>
            <li>I have tried the zoom whitening system from the dentist and that just made my teeth so sensitive and this doesn&#x27;t cause any sensitivity and has no bad taste.</li>
            <li>My first box of Rembrandt Strips worked fine, but the second box I have had problems with.  </li>
            <li>The strips don&#x27;t come off very easily, they mostly come off in pieces - not happy about that.</li>
            <li>Complete rip off &amp; huge dissapointment as I&#x27;ve always heard that Rembrandt is a high quality product.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a person who it very particular about texture, you might not like this product.</li>
            <li>I really like pretty much all Rembrant products.</li>
            <li>Make sure your hands are completely dry.</li>
            <li>Make sure your hands are 100% dry before handling the strips.&lt;br /&gt;2)  </li>
            <li>To me, the packaging is easy to open.  </li>
            <li>Just have dry hands and rip the top of the package long-ways to peel the strip out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easy to apply and definitely do not fall apart when you&#x27;re trying to put them on.</li>
            <li>Packaging is easy to open.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thirdly, it whitens teeth without making them super sensitive.</li>
            <li>Easy to open package</li>
            <li>You must read instructions as the strips must go on in a certain direction.</li>
            <li>The price for the Rembrandt strips is also very reasonable compared to other much more costly and less effective products.</li>
            <li>I think I did get a small result and more polished teeth but would have liked to see a brighter white result.</li>
            <li>Came In Such A Quick Amount Of Time!</li>
            <li>I believe these used to be sold as Listerine Strips and are certainly easier and more comfortable to use than the hard plastic trays.  </li>
            <li>i tried trimming to fit better, but no luck the product is just too delicate to work with.</li>
            <li>and they really are sooooo gentle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used up almost the whole package after 3 months.</li>
            <li>but I really wasn&#x27;t expecting anyhing.</li>
            <li>I really like these Rembrant strips.</li>
            <li>I could not keep it in my mouth for the directed time.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves a very gooey slimed film on teeth, took both 2 cycles brushing and gargling to remove film and taste.</li>
            <li>but anyway, no matter how much I brush my teeth</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really like these.</li>
            <li>so it is very bubbly.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive and fast delivery</li>
            <li>I wish I had the attention span to use these for the whole two weeks, but I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I did not notice any difference on my teeth, after using the whole package diligently (twice a day as instructed)</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t want it to dissolve too fast</li>
            <li>and you will have ABSOLUTELY without A SHADOW OF A DOUBT, noticeably whiter teeth, even after just 4 or 5 days you&#x27;ll notice something, and by day 14 you&#x27;re gonna be getting compliments.</li>
            <li>you really get what you pay for</li>
            <li>These worked... Not an intense change, but my teeth felt cleaner.  </li>
            <li>They could really use this product there.</li>
            <li>They REALLY DO WORK on surface stains from coffee, cigarettes, et al.</li>
            <li>In addition, it is important to use these strips daily.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see much change in color on my teeth.</li>
            <li>I had a very unsightly trout pout.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used those in the past and were very satisfied with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If there was a phrase with which I could describe these whitening strips, it would be &amp;#34;an unusual experience.&amp;#34; They do the job, and do it well.</li>
            <li>expected better results</li>
            <li>These are so much easier and quicker to use.  </li>
            <li>That is, because they are so much easier to use, I use them.  </li>
            <li>I teamed these strips with the Rembrandt Intense Stain Tooth</li>
            <li>These really work.</li>
            <li>much so I threw them away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used wraps before that really were painful/uncomfortable, however, I haven&#x27;t had any issue with these.</li>
            <li>Rembrandt dissolving strips really work.</li>
            <li>With reviews I read I expected more result.  </li>
            <li>I could see the difference but did not notice how much of a difference until I would look at pictures of myself</li>
            <li>think that they are very well rounded set of strips.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I go a whole month without using them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sometimes I go a whole month without using them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really works...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these for weeks now and they really seem to work.</li>
            <li>It should be noted that you need two strips per use, so it is really a 28 day program.</li>
            <li>B007RF1YZG Rembrandt Intense Stain Dissolving Strips, 56 Count]]&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Instead of fumbling around trying to tear it in a straight line, I use Swiss army knife scissors and cut 3 sides off the packaging.  </li>
            <li>The whitening effect is very MEH.</li>
            <li>The strips are very this and begin to melt if they touch anything with moisture on it: fingers, gums, lips, tongue, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like these strips.  </li>
            <li>and while I&#x27;m showering/getting ready for the day in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>This product leaves a residue on your teeth and really does not whiten as well as Crest Strips.</li>
            <li>(they&#x27;re not noticeable unless someone is really looking at your teeth close up).  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t smoke, but I drink a lot of coffee, and I&#x27;ve invested a lot of money in my teeth, so this was the last (cheap) step.</li>
            <li>I put them on before my work commute, and before I started to get ready for bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got pulled over after I started using them, the officer thought I had my high-beams on, but it turns out I was really just smiling.</li>
            <li>and I see a very noticeable difference  in the color of my teeth almost immediately.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think you can really swallow while using these.  </li>
            <li>And since those strips don&#x27;t dissolve, they cause so much gagging and can even induce vomiting at times.</li>
            <li>This product is much easier to use than theother whitening systems I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I thought these worked very well.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really find this to be the case, however I used some advice I had read.</li>
            <li>He used one whole box of these</li>
            <li>I have to wait 20 minutes (not 5-10 minutes) for them to dissolve as much as they can, and then I brush my teeth to remove the remaining film.</li>
            <li>liked these, bottom strip much larger than crest white  strips</li>
            <li>They apply easily enough and whiten nicely without making your teeth look paper white --</li>
            <li>I was a bit concerned after reading a few reviews, but I made sure my hands were dry and had no issues with the strips desolving anywhere except my teeth - I haven&#x27;t been using them consistently enough to say whether they are whitening my teeth or not, but they are easy to use :-)</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t hurt my teeth like most other strips do.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re cheaper than other brands of strips, and work better for me.</li>
            <li>I used to use the listerine dissolving whitening strips and was so sad that they discontinued them, but these are the same exact product as the listerine, and very satisfied with it!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other drugstore brands but Rembrandt is always my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I use a whitening toothpaste which may help, but this is better than any other OTC teeth whitening product I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I like these better than any of the 5 other products I&#x27;ve used to whiten teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the way it wraps around the back of my teeth to clean there, too.</li>
            <li>If you liked Listerine Whitening strips and were annoyed that they were discontinued, you&#x27;ll be happy to know that they&#x27;re back, exactly the same, just under a different name</li>
            <li>I have to imagine that anyone who likes these strips must have some kind of enormous horse mouth, or else very damp teeth and very dry lips.</li>
            <li>but they were outdated and no longer removed easily from foil and even if they did they no longer worked so need more.</li>
            <li>kind of sort of becomes less noticeable over a ridiculously long period of time, but never really goes away&amp;#34; kind of like racism in the South.</li>
            <li>These are so much easier to use than the normal strips.</li>
            <li>, I unintentionally fell asleep while wearing these strips and was surprised at much whiter my teeth looked in the morning!</li>
            <li>and you would have an awfully hard time putting the top ones on first and then fighting all that saliva!  </li>
            <li>I have tried others and these are the best as they really do disolve and do leave a bad taste.</li>
            <li>I find that they work much better than the 2 hour whitening tray treatment by Rembrandt and cause less tooth sensitivity than the trays.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, the product works for teeth, they are whiter, but now shows off my black tongue more.</li>
            <li>No intense sensitivity and easy to use.</li>
            <li>They disolve quickly and after just one use see a big difference.....</li>
            <li>; That was when I knew i should stop and be satisfied with my white teeth, and they&#x27;ve been white ever since.</li>
            <li>On top of that, my inner lips (both upper and lower) were covered with sores.</li>
            <li>I did accidentally tear one of the strips while trying to pull it out, but that was mainly my fault</li>
            <li>the strips do indeed dissolve and leave a decent mint flavor in the mouth.</li>
            <li>is a very inexpensive way to keep your smile white.</li>
            <li>It would probably take two cartons to notice a decent difference, at which point you could&#x27;ve just bought Crest and done it in a shorter time period.&lt;br /&gt;Take</li>
            <li>I wil say as the strips settle themselves in during its 10 min dissolve i does sting a particular part of my mouth...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not every product is for everybody, but as I look at reviews I have to wonder how many people who struggle with using these actually read and follow the directions (which are very simple).  </li>
            <li>Just cut open the top and the two side panels, then peel back the packaging</li>
            <li>I really like them much better than the Crest White Strips which I have used for a long time.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even need a full weeks worth of product and now just use them occasionally to keep my teeth at the brighter white shade I like.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend  this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I think I got high.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>So i gave these a try based on the high rating.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>I expect far better from Rembrandt-save your money and use other well known brands</li>
            <li>whenever I had them on during that one week period I try to keep my mouth as dry as possible by smiling or by swallowing more often so that the strips dissolve much slower than 10 minutes that it says on the box.</li>
            <li>So far I have only used 1/2 of the box and my teeth are already significantly whitened.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product every few months to keep my smile looking fresh!</li>
            <li>I think they are milder than some of the others, too, and since they are also cheaper, using them a little longer or more often isn&#x27;t a problem.  </li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant, but I&#x27;m glad I gave these a shot.</li>
            <li>They have little notches on them - Tear the top off, then the sides, and then just take the strip out.</li>
            <li>It did it&#x27;s job, however the leading brands are a little more pricey</li>
            <li>From the $200+ Glo from sephora to toothpaste and nothing&#x27;s worked better for me than these dandy little strips.</li>
            <li>I love these little boogers and would recommend them to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li>I figure that if they remain intact for 20 minutes or more, they are whitening a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I found that it took more than the 5-10 min advertised for the strips to disintegrate, and they would frequently leave little bits that wouldn&#x27;t really dissolve.</li>
            <li>they work well, and do not bother my sensitive teeth as much as crest whitestrips.</li>
            <li>The strips worked great for the front of my teeth, but unfortunately did not reach in between my teeth.</li>
            <li>I have done 3 applications with these strips, and was really surprised at how much whiter my teeth are.  </li>
            <li>I will try them again just to see if they can get my teeth even whiter, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re worth the effort currently.</li>
            <li>However, the directions tell you to use them 2 times per day, so there are actually 14 days worth.  </li>
            <li>These are the first white strips I&#x27;ve ever used, and I really like them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I just had a dentist visit and they told me to stop whitening because my shade is now out of the normal teeth spectrum</li>
            <li>I was advised to only do a touch up (a week&#x27;s worth of strips) in about three months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then normal size would practically fully wrap around my teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a heavy tea and coffee drinker, so my teeth have seen better days.</li>
            <li>You definitely get your money&#x27;s worth from this</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell, these Rembrandt strips are an exact replica of the old Listerine dissolving ones.  </li>
            <li>However, I did notice better results with the crest 9maybe because my teeth used to be less white the first time).</li>
            <li>While they are not as strong as the 20%/30% trays they work well for brightening several shades, dont irritate, plus you will actually use them!</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t white white, but they do look pretty natural and unstained and now I can wear lipstick again and my teeth don&#x27;t appear more yellow.</li>
            <li>White enough to give me a bright smile, but not super white to the point that it looked unnatural.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Crazy good deal at the time!</li>
            <li>or if they are being sold under another new name?!!!!???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They dissolve easily, well within half an hour.</li>
            <li>At first to get a noticeable result in whiteness, I would use one set of strips per day everyday for a full week.</li>
            <li>No fuss, no wasted time, you can use as many or as few as you need, and save the rest.</li>
            <li>put my teeth together without overbiting and apply one strip the the front which covers my upper and lower, hold my mouth shut for about 1 minute and that gives the strip time to get wet and seperate itself from the top and bottom teeth</li>
            <li>These strips, by following the directions, took the stains AWAY and keeps new stains from forming!!!</li>
            <li>not professional but close enough for a day to day basis and easy on your teeth enamel</li>
            <li>I heard from other review that this product works great, however i have a hard time with the taste</li>
            <li>After the last application, I expect to see a nice patch of pearly white on my right canine, my lower left cuspid, and possibly some bleaching of my upper gums.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They do dissolve after about 10 minutes and you just have to rinse or brush to get the last remnants of the taste of the strip out of your mouth, which is pretty convenient.  </li>
            <li>As far as using this product: READ THE INSTRUCTIONS PEOPLE!</li>
            <li>I have been using this for the past week and half,and i just love it.  </li>
            <li>I give these a 4 star only because I have used other whiteneing strips that I like better.  </li>
            <li>Instant results with no burning, and no weird flavor.</li>
            <li>I am into my first week using these strips and I already see solid results.</li>
            <li>They brightened my teeth 1-2 shades (although my teeth are already pretty white).</li>
            <li>I am an avid tea/coffee drinker so white strips are a must.</li>
            <li>The application is pretty simple.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t even think there was anything in each individual packet.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive teeth, get these now!</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re willing to put in the technical effort and accept the trial-and-error process, they might work for you as well -- and for a fraction of the price of Crest Whitestrips.</li>
            <li>These are the first and only strips I will probably ever use.</li>
            <li>I did exactly what the instructions said - twice a day for two weeks, and I can definitely see a difference.</li>
            <li>you can see why I was hesitent to try it one again, but I&#x27;m getting married and I feel like my teeth are way too yellow.  </li>
            <li>These are EXACTLY the same!</li>
            <li>It was pretty necessary to rip off all three sides of the packaging to prevent the strip from tearing (which still happened often).</li>
            <li>I think they&#x27;re really easy to get out of the package and use, and with just a little practice you can get them right to the edge of the teeth and avoid contact with the gums, which is a major source of irritation with goopy trays and big, waxy strips.  </li>
            <li>Keep a stiff upper lip is a great statement for the English, it helps hide those crooked chompers.</li>
            <li>Faintly sour, nothing overwhelming, definitely does not stop me from using them.</li>
            <li>I have not, however, been able to get rid of one stain between two of my teeth, but it is too deep of a stain, going down layers into the tooth, for anything to remove it.</li>
            <li>I have loved these strips since finding them in our local Walmart store but they no longer carry them:( Can always count on Amazon to offer up everything I want :)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I make sure that i take a kleenex and dry my teeth and inside lips and tongue before I apply the strips because they do start dissolving as soon as they get wet.</li>
            <li>They worked fine, but one night I put them in and fell asleep for a few minutes</li>
            <li>I pure chased these based on other positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are not horribly discolored, just enough wear &amp; tear to want something a little brighter.</li>
            <li>They are not as strong as others I have used, but they will take off daily coffee buildup, or other stains that natural foods can give anyones teeth.</li>
            <li>others reviewers note, the strips tear easily, and if you don&#x27;t open the packages VERY carefully, you might tear a strip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They dissolve completely</li>
            <li>Your teeth will fall out from old age before you can whiten them.</li>
            <li>: gradually whitens teeth if used daily for 5days straight.</li>
            <li>Does not make teeth sensitive nor appear see through.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>In some cases by the time I removed them they were rip or torn and in some cases nearly unusable.  </li>
            <li>been only using it for 1 week, it did whitened my teeth a little...though not as much as i would have like...</li>
            <li>My dentist told me it&#x27;s from antibiotics that stained my teeth when I was young.  </li>
            <li>As far as whiteness goes, my teeth still aren&#x27;t pearly whites (nor did I expect them to be)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it would really bring your teeth up several shades though.  </li>
            <li>but absolutely a pain in the ass to open the package</li>
            <li>it is completely dissolved</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 76 years old.</li>
            <li>They melt on your teeth like the old listermint breath strips.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give 4.5 stars if I could because of that, but otherwise I&#x27;d recommend them completely.</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>This time they must be old or expired.</li>
            <li>They did not bother my sensitive teeth at all.</li>
            <li>Take the side that doesn&#x27;t have the strip on it completely off.</li>
            <li>Overall, these strips were very effective.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>used a whole box, and now I am halfway through my second box.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much experience with white strips, but I just received these today.</li>
            <li>This is completely ineffective.</li>
            <li>They claim to be 10 minute strips, but my drive is 30 minutes, and the strips are just about completely dissolved by then.  </li>
            <li>thing I noticed was that the strips did not dissolve completely on my teeth that have veneers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these for years now, I don&#x27;t use them according to directions, they make my teeth to sensitive (all whitening products do).</li>
            <li>If your teeth are sensitive to whitening products you won&#x27;t have a problem with these.</li>
            <li>All is left is see the results after using the whole box.</li>
            <li>The strips end up almost completely dissolving in about 30 minutes with my method.</li>
            <li>After the week of what  I call intense whitening, I only have to do touch ups from that point.</li>
            <li>and it helped the effects last for much longer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The strips end up almost completely dissolving in about 30 minutes with my method.</li>
            <li>After the week of what  I call intense whitening, I only have to do touch ups from that point.</li>
            <li>and it helped the effects last for much longer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are just like the old listerine whitening strips.  </li>
            <li>mine must have been 7,000 years old cause when i opened the package the strips were like fused to the sides of the packaging.</li>
            <li>They just disappear.&lt;br /&gt;These have whitened my teeth considerably after using for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>After tearing off the top of an individual strip packet, cut open the sides of the packet with scissors so that the strip is fully exposed, then carefully peel it off.  </li>
            <li>comparable to professional strength without the pain to the teeth &amp; wallet</li>
            <li>brush my teeth with sensodyne, because I have sensitive teeth and that has worked for me-</li>
            <li>Before I even ordered this product I read the reviews and kept hope alive.</li>
            <li>These whitening strips don&#x27;t hurt my sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth from grinding</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money</li>
            <li>Unlike Crest, the Rembrandt strips did not make my teeth sensitive AT ALL, even when I used two sets in one day - and I have fairly sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>These were old strips, brittle, off-taste... old.</li>
            <li>The strips had a visible effect on me, but towards the end of the two week period my teeth became quite sensitive.</li>
            <li>So far too soon to see results as I am on day 5, although I saw faster results with the Listerine</li>
            <li>the old Listerine melt-in-your-mouth strips.</li>
            <li>Came fast, not a big fan of the product though.</li>
            <li>After using the Rembrandt strips twice a day for nearly a month, I now apply them once a day for maintenance.</li>
            <li>These whitening strips perform as they say, however they do not dissolve completely and leave a film on your teeth.</li>
            <li>Those people smile with their mouhts closed.</li>
            <li>Overall the product does what it says it will do, but for a few dollars more the Crest strips are the way to go.</li>
            <li>a waste of a third or more of the box.....frustrating.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even know if these work effectively to whiten teeth, because they upset my stomach and nauseated me.</li>
            <li>the dissolving feature of these is both nice and annoying, sure you don&#x27;t have to throw anything away</li>
            <li>mentioned by others, it is a little difficult to open the individual strips from its wrapping, but I&#x27;ve learned to estimate the size of the actual strips inside the wrapping, so I just cut the edges off and am able to get to the strips far more easily.  </li>
            <li>In other words, if you were to imagine the packet as an envelope and the strip as a letter, open the top and sides of the envelope and fold it back before removing the letter.&lt;br /&gt;3)  </li>
            <li>Previous reviews had said they weren&#x27;t noticeable, which was aesthetically true</li>
            <li>Generally speaking i have VERY sensitive teeth and can never use any of these products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Somewhere down the line, the item was probably placed somewhere super hot.&lt;br /&gt;Cant</li>
            <li>I usually buy the plus white whitening gel and put it in my retainers and that seems to work better for me, and is cheaper.</li>
            <li>I noticed slight sensitivity on my gums after the 5 days in a row of treatment but after being more careful when applying the strips I haven&#x27;t had that problem again.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s important to have dry hands when applying the strips -- they&#x27;re meant to dissolve in your mouth, so if you touch them with wet hands</li>
            <li>All you do is tear open the thinner seal, then you can simply tear down the length of the packet, leaving the strip completely exposed for easy extraction.</li>
            <li>Besides the slightly unpleasant texture/taste, I am pretty satisfied with the product and hope they work!</li>
            <li>At first it looked like the packets were empty but no - on closer inspection</li>
            <li>Used other brands previously which were much better and noticeable</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are less powerful than the Crest strips.  </li>
            <li>I would buy them again, but only for a daily use, not for whitening  the teeth intensely.</li>
            <li>By that I mean my coffee and tea stains are gone and i receive many complements on ho white</li>
            <li>I have used other strips that have visibly worked for me in the first three uses....</li>
            <li>(In a previous update, I had to cut open the top and 2 sides of each packet and very carefully pry up the edge of the strip with my fingernail and then try to peel the strip off the backing in one piece.)  </li>
            <li>So I amazing, that I try not to tell anyone my secret!</li>
            <li>The box says they will dissolve in 5-10 minutes, but it generally took at about 20 for me.</li>
            <li>basically, it&#x27;s very yellow towards the gumline and lightens as it reaches the far end of the teeth.</li>
            <li>These things wad up as soon as they get near your mouth and refuse to stick to teeth properly.</li>
            <li>I will be using the last ones tomorrow and my teeth look considerably whiter than they did.  </li>
            <li>You have to really look once you open up the sachet and use your nails to try to peal back the actual strip.</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY whitening product out there that doesn&#x27;t leave my teeth hurting &amp; ridiculously sensitive afterwards.</li>
            <li>So I was pleasantly surprised to see the return of dissolving strips, albeit under a different brand name.  </li>
            <li>I do use scissors to cut the packets open but have no trouble using the strips.  </li>
            <li>It only takes 15 minutes for them to dissolve completely</li>
            <li>Then take the two halves left and completely remove the one without the strip attached.</li>
            <li>If you are looking to achieve a noticeable white far beyond just stain removal</li>
            <li>but then I learned that if I brush my teeth first with Sensodyne or a similar product I can then apply these strip with absolutely no sensitivity during or after the application.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Putting them on:&lt;br /&gt;Ok, getting them on my bottom teeth is always kind of difficult, but I&#x27;ve never ruined a strip.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other whitening strips and those help significantly more (crest white strips) but are a little pricier</li>
            <li>There are the ONLY white strips that do not bother my mouth or make my teeth sensitive!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not messy, and even opening the little packages that each individual strip comes in is made simple that you can just slip them right</li>
            <li>there were any other brands on the market (and don&#x27;t much care, either).  </li>
            <li>Your teeth will be whiter, but very marginally since the strips aren&#x27;t as harsh/strong as other brands.</li>
            <li>and really does the job without costing a lot like the other strips.</li>
            <li>The wraps cover all the teeth visible when I smile; I recall that Crest&#x27;s were just a little too short</li>
            <li>/&gt;The strips are pretty fragile, so be careful removing them from their individual packs, but it&#x27;s not rocket</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like about them is that when I use them for the first treatment, my teeth become extremely sensitive and HURT after a few minutes when the strip is applied.  </li>
            <li>I have only used them twice so far and a friend of mine commented on how white my teeth are.</li>
            <li>So, if you are young, before deep stains set in, use these strips NOW so you won&#x27;t end up with stains too deep to get rid of.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect a professional whitening, but this did white one bit from my naked eye.  </li>
            <li>At $129 and up, I&#x27;ll just say &#x27;no thanks&#x27; and continue to use the older ones</li>
            <li>Their dry right out of the box, not slimy like other brands  </li>
            <li>Work well but taste a little funny</li>
            <li>When I first used these I saw little results, but with continued used I did start seeing results.</li>
            <li>Tastes a little funny though.</li>
            <li>After a little under two weeks of consistent use, my teeth are noticeably whiter.</li>
            <li>Yes, there is definite improvement, but it&#x27;s pretty slight.</li>
            <li>I had mild whitening, but not as extreme as other whiteners, but they caused sensitivity so I would rather use this as a safer dental choice.</li>
            <li>Manual says it only takes about 5-10 min to dissolve completely, but mine took well over 30 min for it to dissolve, good thing the taste isnt all that bad</li>
            <li>The films completely melted on to the packaging LONG BEFORE I EVEN GOT THEM</li>
            <li>If each box gives a few shades of white, resulting in a cumulative whitening effect, it would be worth it at this price to buy several boxes, so we&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did experience a slight bitter taste during the process, but it went away quickly.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a slight change but not as much as I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li>These are thin, but still easy to use.</li>
            <li>This went away shortly after removal of strips, and didn&#x27;t even occur after the first few days.</li>
            <li>Got them again a month ago and found them to be so thin they tear son easily</li>
            <li>When putting them on, though, I carefully do it by putting the strip on one tooth and then carefully and gently push it between two teeth as far as possible without ripping the strip, cover the next tooth, then carefully and gently push it between two teeth, and etc.(starting with a front tooth and going back on one side of the array of teeth and then continuing with the other side) thereby getting at the stains between the front teeth.</li>
            <li>I bought this with a little hesitation after reading a review of a lady whose mouth got really swollen.</li>
            <li>The Rembrandt box accurately says that the strips &amp;#34;noticeably whitens tough stains, like coffee...</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and spend a little extra on the Crest ones that don&#x27;t dissolve; they work very well.</li>

            <li> The box, and my dentist, told me I can&#x27;t bleach the bonding, but I&#x27;m telling you it lightened my front and bottom teeth evenly, so I&#x27;m impressed!</li>

            <li> strips are AMAZING!!</li>
            <li> Great value and excellent product!</li>
            <li> incredibly chapped.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But when I start to move it, or attempt to eat or drink, it was incredibly painful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was impressed with the great results achieved also.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;strips - Brilliant they stick to the teeth and don&#x27;t move about and shift and cause me to want to spit every two seconds.</li>
            <li> great buy for the price</li>
            <li> These work great for the price.</li>
            <li> and my teeth looked great in all the photos.</li>
            <li> This is the best value I have found for this kind of product.</li>
            <li> , I can still notice the candy corn effect on my teeth, but they are lessened, so I am happy.  </li>
            <li> Great over the counter whitening system.</li>
            <li> Rembrandts are great because the dissolve in your mouth.</li>
            <li> happy to find them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> great product.</li>
            <li> Great whiting kit.</li>
            <li> My teeth were noticeably whiter, I was happy.</li>
            <li> I think these are really a great bargain, I read one reviewer used just one strip by putting thier teeth together and then slapping it on like that until it begins to dissolve.</li>
            <li> Despite these flaws, I would still purchase again for the great whitening they provide.</li>
            <li> and they work great.  </li>
            <li> I drink coffee every day and the dentist asks me what I use because my whitening looks great.</li>
            <li> The Rembrandt strips work great for me.  </li>
            <li> These strips are great to use since they dissolve while in your mouth.</li>
            <li> Listerine discontinued these, I was happy to see the Rembrandt folks carry them.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this when I got it, but it is still a great value.</li>
            <li> well though, them along with the toothpaste and the mouthwash have greatly improved the color of my teeth.</li>
            <li> And they are a great price as well.</li>
            <li> So I think these work great, I&#x27;m seeing a difference, but DO NOT fall asleep with these in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say these win by a landslide.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The do the job at a great price, and the fact they dissolve is a great feature.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product.  </li>
            <li> Works great will buy again.</li>
            <li> It works great</li>
            <li> and my teeth feel and look great.  </li>

            <li> Great experience.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far...not a happy customer.</li>
            <li> The price is also great.</li>
            <li> They work great.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> He hasn&#x27;t experienced any sensitivity or pain while using them.</li>
            <li> and I can already see a huge difference!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product!!</li>
            <li> very useful, just one week you will see the difference!!!</li>
            <li> These are amazing!</li>
            <li> These are amazing!</li>
            <li> Amazing results with this product!</li>
            <li> I reaaly liked the ease of use and the results these strips gave me!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Experience more of the wonderful thank you</li>
            <li> They whiten really nicely without any pain, are minty tasting and there were 56 strips in this box!  </li>
            <li> The strips dissolve, and they have a minty taste that is pleasant.  </li>
            <li> I am allergic to all Crest whitening products, so I am very happy to have found an inexpensive, easy to use alternative.</li>
            <li> Very Easy And Convenient!</li>
            <li> Whenever I feel that my teeth are not as bright as they were when I started the treatment, I restart the process all over.</li>
            <li> Whenever I feel that my teeth are not as bright as they were when I started the treatment, I restart the process all over.</li>
            <li> It was always a good hour or so for me.  </li>
            <li> but what good is that if they don&#x27;t remove stains or yellowing on the teeth?</li>
            <li> This product is good.</li>
            <li> Good luck with that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be fair, I found these under the sink in my bathroom, in a box meant for whitening strips from Crest.</li>
            <li> I am delighted to find them on the market again and wish I&#x27;d realized sooner that these are the ones I used to use.  </li>
            <li> my teeth look good for now,</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> but these did a good job.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t smoke but do drink coffee (with cream) and my teeth are a good color</li>
            <li> Wish the whiting lasted longer but good results</li>
            <li> I have been searching for good whitening strips since they stopped selling the Listerine ones at Target.</li>
            <li> Loved it.  </li>
            <li> I like these strips don&#x27;t have to take them out good in 10 minutes vanish.</li>
            <li> You now have strips on your teeth to make them even more beautiful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  planning buying more Thomas products from Amazon great online shopping</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product&#x27;s effectiveness.</li>
            <li> probably not as good as the nice crest ones</li>
            <li> do leave a nice taste and my teeth feel good afterwards.  </li>
            <li> The very first application of the strips showed a remarkable improvement!</li>
            <li> Love these teeth strips!</li>
            <li> I love that these strips dissolve on your teeth!</li>
            <li> the results wont improve much more after 3 weeks!</li>
            <li> but I drink more coffee now to reduce my appetite, so now my bi annual whitening will be with Rembrandt!</li>
            <li> These worked ok but not as well as I had hoped!</li>
            <li> They work better!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> On top of that, they work!</li>
            <li> absolutely love these!</li>
            <li> Love the dissolvable!</li>
            <li> Love them!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li> I love them!</li>
            <li> The dryer your teeth and surrounding gums, the more successful you will be in positioning the strips.  </li>
            <li> I love these!</li>
            <li> I love these things!</li>
            <li> The taste isn&#x27;t the greatest when you first start using them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying more today!</li>
            <li> Love it !</li>
            <li> but these do work great and are easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy application on the teeth provide for a great experience.</li>
            <li> They are amazing.</li>
            <li> They are amazing.</li>
            <li> These are amazing.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t work as well to me as the Rembrant nor are they as cost effective as the Rembrandt.</li>
            <li> Perfect for those who don&#x27;t have perfectly straight teeth.</li>
            <li> But maybe that&#x27;s a good thing as they spend more time on your teeth cleaning them.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be doing a nice job.</li>
            <li> They really do work wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Since they dissolve on their own, you don&#x27;t have to worry about finding a place to throw them out.</li>
            <li> Kind of like that feeling you get after a dentist appointment</li>
            <li> kind of just let my saliva and the disolved strip just pool around my teeth</li>
            <li> I did notice a difference when I finished using the product, but it wasn&#x27;t as nice of a difference as I was hoping/wanting/expecting.</li>
            <li> Definitely nice to know that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using the whole Rembrandt system and I&#x27;m very happy with this.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re effective.</li>
            <li> I loved those just as much as I love these.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I would suggest getting a non-dissolvable kind of strip -- one with a plastic backing that needs to be removed.</li>
            <li> Have mouthwash or water handy to rinse thoroughly once the 10-15 minutes are up.  </li>
            <li> strips effectively whitened my teeth and reduced</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t move which is nice.</li>
            <li> These are perfect in every way.&lt;br /&gt;Price - Reasonable, so maybe it doesn&#x27;t come in a fancy plastic box but who cares?</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be honest..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as effective as spending hundreds at a dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the kind that you take off after about 20 minutes -</li>
            <li> SEE THE SMILE ON MY FACE BRIGHTER WHITER TEETH!!!</li>
            <li> For older people, I am in my 50s and my teeth are whiter than they have been for a good 20+ years!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;In summary, I am very pleased with the results, but I am glad I had a checkup when I did</li>
            <li> The price (&amp;#60;$20) was great, but in retrospect it may have been more worthwhile to spend a bit more (e.g. ~$30) to get Crest Whitestrips.</li>
            <li> While these are easy to use and dissolve, they aren&#x27;t as good as the Listerine version.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> price is good but rather pay more and get better product.</li>
            <li> These strips are very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> used for the first 2 weeks..very good!</li>
            <li> Excellent was beautiful and wonderful, but after experience pain in the teeth of cold water</li>
            <li> This worked pretty good!</li>
            <li> Great well worth</li>
            <li> They dissolve mostly on there own, but I never have a problem since I brush after.</li>
            <li> That being said, as an adult I&#x27;ve tried my best to take care of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> These strips do the job and so easy!</li>
            <li> you want an easy way to whiten then these strips are it!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also nice to be able to talk while you&#x27;re wearing these strips and they dissolve (for the most part)</li>
            <li> They are very easy and enjoyable to use.</li>
            <li> You can see results almost immediately and for the price, it&#x27;s a great alternative to higher prices strips.  </li>
            <li> Product was delivered on time,works great as stated,I will be buying again from Amazon, thanks!</li>
            <li> These are very comfortable to wear, nearly invisible and have a very pleasant taste.</li>
            <li> Love these, easy &amp; they work!</li>
            <li> effective product that is easy to use---very well thought out.  </li>
            <li> These strips are easy to apply, dissolve quickly, and are very effective.</li>
            <li> Love these strips.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that it dissolves in your mouth.</li>
            <li> Though I love Rembrandt toothpaste and mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I love to drink iced coffee</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re hassle free!</li>
            <li> Love that the strips just dissolve away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are okay.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Which means they are even MORE expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but seems that after awhile it doesn&#x27;t go much better ...</li>
            <li> I love how well they stick to my teeth.</li>
            <li> so when you put them on try to get them mostly on your teeth.</li>
            <li> By the time I get out, they&#x27;re mostly dissolved.  </li>
            <li> I love these whitening strips.  </li>
            <li> love this</li>
            <li> Better instruction needed and bleaching</li>
            <li> I love them, but not at their latest price.  </li>
            <li> They whiten ok.....</li>
            <li> They work so much better and are easier to use.</li>
            <li> There is mostly hydrogen peroxide in here</li>
            <li> This comes with more and is cheaper though</li>
            <li> My teeth were taking on a light mahogany color (ick!).</li>
            <li> I love it and am planning to purchase more.</li>
            <li> I love these.  </li>
            <li> so, so much more</li>
            <li> The strips themselves were interesting.</li>
            <li> I am able to ignore it.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s more bang for my buck</li>
            <li> These stick to teeth SO much better than Crest.</li>
            <li> Once they touch your teeth, you better not need to move them because they are officially stuck.</li>
            <li> After a while, I gave up and rinsed with water, satisfied that this was Rembrandt&#x27;s intention.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if they are the best choice in terms of radical whitening, but they&#x27;re the ones I prefer in terms of the total package.  </li>
            <li> I did not experience any gum sensitivity and I am pleased with the result.</li>
            <li> Put it on when  heading out of the house and before you reach your destination the strip will have dissolved.&lt;br /&gt;Easiest and most affordable way to deal with unwanted stains.</li>
            <li> not too sure this worked for me..</li>
            <li> A $.58 bottle of hydrogen peroxide is working much better for me than this.  </li>
            <li> So much easier to use and really great results.  </li>
            <li> These work much better than Crest strips.</li>
            <li> Make sure you follow the directions on how to put them on your teeth..</li>
            <li> If i felt I needed more whitening, I would use them a couple days more.</li>
            <li> I like putting them on and being able to leave my house and even drink water with it in.  </li>
            <li> Best white strip I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li> Will be buying some more for sure, thank you.</li>
            <li> I love these dissolving strips because you can put them on and go.</li>
            <li> I also have resin bonding on my top front teeth.</li>
            <li> Eliminate saliva from your bottom teeth as best as possible.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spat out more mangled whitening strips than I care to say.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I got better results that lasted longer</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how many minutes that takes but</li>
            <li> No there are stronger, but these do the trick and remove most of you coffee/tea stains.</li>
            <li> At that point, the strip starts to tear and more attaches to my lips.  </li>
            <li> Soon, more of this strip is on the inside of my mouth than on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, these strips seem to be the most convenient.  </li>
            <li> Also more invisible.  </li>
            <li> More convenient than trays or strips that you must remove.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased that Rembrandt is now manufacturing these so the strips are easier to remove from the packets!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this online and now ordered more.</li>
            <li> My gums were ok</li>
            <li> These are my favorite.  </li>
            <li> the top all the way across.</li>
            <li> You should be able to avoid it sticking to your lip.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had an issue with the top</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> and I love that the strips dissolve.</li>
            <li> was pleased with the price and the amount of the product that the package contained.  </li>
            <li> i will order more of this if it does.</li>
            <li> My sister raved about how bright my smile was at a wedding.</li>
            <li> More like 20, and even then I&#x27;ll have bits stuck to my gums</li>
            <li> I love these strips.</li>
            <li> They are a lot better than the crest</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> got more whitening from 3 days of these than my wife got from 10 days of a whitening kit she got from the dentist.  </li>
            <li> Best white strips on the market</li>
            <li> These are the best white strips I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I love these strips,</li>
            <li> and you should be able to remove the strip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous types of stain removing products for my teeth and this one works the best.  </li>
            <li> It does not, however, magically remove all stains and the product must be used once or twice a day to get results.  </li>
            <li> allows easy access to the stain removing strip which is also very easy to apply to teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This has been a good product for me and the price is right.</li>
            <li> Rembrandt is known as pretty much the best onthe market.</li>
            <li> I agree that it is best to open up 3 sides to easily remove the strip from the package.</li>
            <li> I will say first off, dissolving were a good idea.</li>
            <li> They were good the first couple of days</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed!  </li>
            <li> I love this product because it is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to report that the strips I&#x27;m now using are easy to peel away from the backing.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think these whiten as effectively as Crest WhiteStrips, but the convenience of the quick dissolving means that even my fiance will use them at nighttime</li>
            <li> They are the easiest strips to use to clean your teeth!</li>
            <li> I miss the original Crest White Strips, they were the best</li>
            <li> If I ever find them again at a fair price, I&#x27;ll certainly stock up again.</li>
            <li> The only whiting strips easy to use and effective!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great so far.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t expect a roughly $20 product to get rid of years of stained teeth, but for the price and the result I&#x27;ve seen, I&#x27;d say the product worked to the best of its ability.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product as a cheap alternative to the crest whitening strips, They are OK...</li>
            <li> This product provided the results I would have expected and the price was was the best I found anywhere online</li>
            <li> This works great for me because I&#x27;m always so busy.</li>
            <li> Great for people with sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> , I too like other reviewers didn&#x27;t realize you had to use them twice a day best results.</li>
            <li> Easy to use &amp;#34;on-the-go&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Easily 30 mins</li>
            <li> Easy to use (contrary to some reviews)</li>
            <li> its extremely easy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Super easy to apply, and the rest is history.</li>
            <li> They are easy to use.</li>
            <li> Its an affordable easy way to whiten teeth.</li>
            <li> These tear so easily</li>
            <li> once the working strip is extracted, it is easy to apply to teeth, and works as advertised</li>
            <li> They fall apart way to easy</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, and dissolve in about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Easy to use...does the job well.</li>
            <li> I know that it may not be easy so give up some of these things for some people, for example coffee since it may be part of a person&#x27;s morning routine...</li>
            <li> I know that it may not be easy so give up some of these things for some people, for example coffee since it may be part of a person&#x27;s morning routine...</li>
            <li> &gt;  - Easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Minus-</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use whitening strips.</li>
            <li> works well, noticing a difference, easy to use.</li>
            <li> Yes, you should use scissors when opening the packages, but just cut two packages at once, and it&#x27;s easy.</li>
            <li> and these seems so easy to use and inexpensive to me.  </li>
            <li> Malleable but don&#x27;t rip easily.</li>
            <li> (there are two perforations) for easy access to the strip.</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> easy, not bulky.</li>
            <li> The strips were easy to apply and dissolved within 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li> They were easy to use and put on.  </li>
            <li> Full access to the strip, just make sure your hands ARE DRY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They whitened my teeth beautifully, and I didn&#x27;t even need to use all of them to get my desired results, so I am saving them for the future!</li>
            <li> These strips are not a &amp;#34;gooey&amp;#34; and can easily and quickly be applied to your teeth and they stay put!</li>
            <li> I have beautiful white teeth.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll love them just as much as I do. :)</li>
            <li> these certainly whiten and make your teeth appear clean a good quick fix!</li>
            <li> better than the rembrandt 2-hour trays, best in general so far!  </li>
            <li> but I just took a break for a couple days and it was fine.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and cheap vs alternatives</li>
            <li> Obviously the cheapest way is not always the most effective!</li>
            <li> These are definitely a worthy replacement!</li>
            <li> I thought it would whiten much more quickly</li>
            <li> After the first couple of applications, it&#x27;s very easy to do.</li>
            <li> At this great price I am surprised more people don&#x27;t ditch that other popular brand and switch to Rembrandt!  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a huge difference</li>
            <li> and I can see a huge difference.</li>
            <li> The only thing that didn&#x27;t make me happy was that the expiration date on the box is 12/2014.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d put them on, read for about an hour, and notice there was still about 10% remaining when I turned out the light.  </li>
            <li> Much more fun than brushing with horseradish.</li>
            <li> These things are powerful using dental grade activated peroxide, which is safe orally and can be swallowed because it converts into Oxygen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great to use for short term</li>
            <li> I really liked the Listerine Whiting strip&#x27;s, but they were discontinued, these are very close to the Listerine.  </li>
            <li> but I would get compliments on my smile more</li>
            <li> could never get them to fit on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> So if I had to rate this in comparison with the syringe filled whitening or crest</li>
            <li> Also great for maintaining a white smile/ use a couple times a week.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t care for these, didn&#x27;t find them all that effective.  </li>
            <li> and I definitely notice a difference, although we&#x27;re going to get another box so he can keep using them until he&#x27;s happy with the level of whitening.</li>
            <li> They do a good job, if you re not expecting professional whitening.</li>
            <li> They seem to do a good job of whitening so far...</li>
            <li> These strips work effectively and stick on better than any other kind.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also very happy to see the pricing on these (much more reasonably priced than the \\&quot;other</li>
            <li> I also love that they&#x27;re dissolving, I put them on right before I go to bed &amp; they dissolve while I sleep.</li>
            <li> The price is also very fair when compared to other whitening strips.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice a huge difference but very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Super easy to apply, and plenty of room to wrap all the way from below your gums up over the tooth.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use</li>
            <li> They dissolved easily and quickly.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use, no need to peel off and really whitened my teeth.</li>
            <li> But wearing them is kind of like high school health</li>
            <li> Definitely a high quality, convenient &amp; effective product.</li>
            <li> They dissolve in about 7 minutes or so which is really nice because you can use them quickly while you&#x27;re getting ready in the morning</li>
            <li> Once received  I found the strips were easy to use and had a ok taste,but didn&#x27;t show much improvement.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the 20$!</li>
            <li> First of many purchases.  </li>
            <li> I love that they don&#x27;t burn my gums like many other of this kind</li>
            <li> and theres no globby tray to clean or strips to remove-</li>
            <li> So perhaps the strips were less than ideal for use after sitting in the household equivalent of a moist cave for three years.</li>
            <li> Application is super easy and quick.</li>
            <li> Worked great, noticeable whitening, the dissolving backer made them much easier to use than other whiteners I have tried, just put them on and go, no waiting to take them off and throw away to backer, normally I would put them on and go to sleep, worked great.</li>
            <li> These are easy to use, respond rapidly and the price is right.</li>
            <li> , they are hard to get all the residue off when you are done too, not the best strips out there</li>
            <li> That lil&#x27; bit of extra work is worth it to me in exchange for being able to leave an effective whitening strip on my teeth that will cleanly dissolve away.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until about the time I had finished with the whole box that I started noticing a difference, but that&#x27;s OK.  </li>
            <li> Its a good product, I especially like how it just dissolves away.</li>
            <li> After four days of 2-times-a-day applications I&#x27;m pleased at the continued whitening but my teeth are probably not going to get much whiter.</li>
            <li> Also, make sure your mouth is very moist when applying them or they stick to your gums and lips before you can apply them.  </li>
            <li> Good price and actually work.  </li>
            <li> I was intensely shopping lightning deals before Christmas and these strips were available!  </li>
            <li> My teeth didn&#x27;t get sensitive and not having to take off the strips after I&#x27;m done is nice as well compared to the crest.</li>
            <li> Rembrandt Intense Stain Dissolving Strips, 56 Count works better than cheaper products.</li>
            <li> Not as good as going to the dentist, for obvious reasons, but for a home kit</li>
            <li> While I had no issue with these strips, I saw almost no results after almost a full carton.</li>
            <li> I recommend it, I have whole family using it now, which means I have to hurry &amp; order more.</li>
            <li> I loved the listerine brand, they seemed to actually whiten my teeth</li>
            <li> Be SURE your hands are VERY DRY.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not badly, but I see it.</li>
            <li> These work great, easy use, noticeable changes in a few uses.  </li>
            <li> I will suggest that you read the instructions before using for the first time - I put them in backwards and got a mouth full of foam!  </li>
            <li> but these do make a difference, and they are pretty easy to use.</li>
            <li> These are a great price compared to some other brands- based on the reviews here</li>
            <li> The good thing about this box is that you get SO many strips and for sooo little compared to Crest.</li>
            <li> Delivery of the product was quick.  </li>
            <li> It is a mild whitener and does not hurt you gums.</li>
            <li> quick delivery.</li>
            <li> , I think it was a quick fix</li>
            <li> These strips look well and work quickly.</li>
            <li> They dissolve quickly, maybe 5-10 mins.</li>
            <li> would recommend these as a convenient and quick way to get noticeably whiter teeth.  </li>
            <li> If there&#x27;s any portion that hasn&#x27;t fully dissolved by the time I reach the parking lot, I just take a quick swipe with a tissue</li>
            <li> I could stop it quickly, and recover quickly....</li>
            <li> Whitens teeth quickly.</li>
            <li> I got the strips quickly and they were just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> in all, this is the best product out there for stain removal and keeping teeth white based on my experience with about 10 different products.  </li>
            <li> First time was fantastic which is why I ordered it again.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise they whiten nicely and are more affordable then other whitening products on the Market.</li>
            <li> and I loved that these desolved in 5 minutes so you don&#x27;t have to keep them in for too long.</li>
            <li> The taste of the strips is great (typical mouth was taste) and they dissolve on your teeth within 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and not too much discomfort.  </li>
            <li> okay means that it&#x27;s good, but I&#x27;m not sure any products truly whiten teeth like they claim.</li>
            <li> This is very affordable and easy to use it.  </li>
            <li> There are tear notches all around the product, with DRY Hands tear the LENGTH wise side all the way across, then tear the WIDTH Side on either side, you don&#x27;t need to do both</li>
            <li> These are some pretty good whitening strips and I have noticed a several shade difference since using them.</li>
            <li> Regardless, the strips stuck very well and were easy to stick on my teeth.</li>
            <li> be fair, my teeth a pretty yellow from a childhood of yellowing...</li>
            <li> but my first impression is not favorable!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!!</li>
            <li> These are great but use them up fast or they dry up.  </li>
            <li> keeps my teeth pretty clean.</li>
            <li> peeling them off the foil stretches them and they are too large to fit on my teeth.</li>
            <li> I know it says on the package that it is safe and no side effects were reported, but i guess i am little freaked out by swallowing all the stuff they put in it to make my teeth nice ad</li>
            <li> so I like to use these every couple months to keep my teeth nice and white.</li>
            <li> So far I love them.</li>
            <li> :) i have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall.. worth the money in that they do indeed whiten your teeth.</li>
            <li> thus far I think this is a nice, reasonably priced product.</li>
            <li> but I liked that I only had to use them for 2 weeks instead of a month.</li>
            <li> I would love to know if they are completely discontinued</li>
            <li> I think my smile is brighter, but not dramatically.</li>
            <li> Still worth the money given the price vs Crest products for example.</li>
            <li> Hello again 25yr old smile :)</li>
            <li> So nice not having anything left that I have to peel off!</li>
            <li> although I haven&#x27;t finished my 2 weeks worth yet.</li>
            <li> Adapting the instructions saved me from wasting strips and gave me my money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li> Here are some tips that are worth considering and are not included in the instructions on the packaging:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My friend is the one who got me hooked on these because he always has the nicest smile and</li>
            <li> that for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> And help your teeth and breathe smelling fresh.</li>
            <li> I used these last year and liked them.</li>
            <li> This is the only kind of whitner to buy.</li>
            <li> found them a lot easier to apply than Crest strips, and am glad they take longer than 10 minutes to dissolve (which, if you&#x27;re patient, they do completely).  </li>
            <li> Worth a try to see what you think</li>
            <li> When first starting, be sure to follow the directions to use them 2x a day - this is very important if you really want them to work for you.</li>
            <li> I usually wear them too bed or while working out, I love love them!  </li>
            <li> This was product was very easy to use, and didn&#x27;t cause me any teeth sensitivity,but the results were good, not great.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them if you are looking for good quality white strips.</li>
            <li> the sink&#x27;s right there.</li>
            <li> No sensitivity, I noticed an improvement right</li>
            <li> I apply them right before I go to bed</li>
            <li> Sometimes this rather stick to your fingers, gums, lips, or tongue but will slip right off</li>
            <li> These strips may contain the right ingredients and work well at whitening, but a conservative guess is that 1/3 of the strips will end up</li>
            <li> so I use them right before going out</li>
            <li> It peels right off.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not like me, and don&#x27;t have mini-scissors handy, tearing 3 sides off first is key.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for whitening strips that were cheap, easy to apply and did not affect my daily life, and these are it!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t expect amazing results on the first day, but if you are consistent with the use of this product you will start seeing results shortly</li>
            <li> Had a kind of strange taste when dissolving.</li>
            <li> I really liked that these strips dissolved, so I didn&#x27;t have to worry about leaving them on for too long or pulling gooey plastic off my teeth.</li>
            <li> Luckily there are 56 of them, so you can try and try again to get one on straight.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply these strips and the instructions are clear.</li>
            <li> It s not messy, they strips dissolve easily in about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> Stains that used to be on my teeth have finally come off, and that makes me smile more.</li>
            <li> The whitening effect was not very dramatic; these strips are great if you want a less noticeable whitening.</li>
            <li> They are difficult to stick to bottom teeth for some reasonably they work beautifully on the top ones.</li>
            <li> Make sure to use clean, dry hands and to apply to your bottom teeth first.</li>
            <li> I was happy with how short the process took, and I actually felt like I noticed a difference on the first use.</li>
            <li> After the first 2 weeks of use, the price per day is very negligible and is so very worth spending on THESE Rembrandt Intense Stain Dissolving Strips.</li>
            <li> I only whiten twice a year, since colgate advanced clean toothpaste with the sandy stuff</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but crest seems to assume that everyone has a huge mouth with huge teeth and makes the upper strip way too large.</li>
            <li> Much more affordable than the Crest White Strips !</li>
            <li> But glad to use it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ready to go!  </li>
            <li> But, if you read the box before using, you&#x27;ll find instructions to put them on the lower teeth first --</li>
            <li> After you zip open the top, look at either side of the packet.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after the first treatment.</li>
            <li> Seems to work great as my teeth are brighter but not amazing like the Crest whitening strips.</li>
            <li> and i haven&#x27;t seen a noticeable enough difference for me to give it any more than three stars.</li>
            <li> love these strips because you simply apply them and you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product exactly two times.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, everything went well.</li>
            <li> If I want hot food, I wait until it&#x27;s lukewarm to eat it.</li>
            <li> I have recommended these to multiple friends and they love them as well.</li>
            <li> My first impression was that the instructions are really simple and the packaging was okay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get used to the sensation and get the hang of properly putting them on.</li>
            <li> but like I said it was my first try.</li>
            <li> I did use them two times a day for the first 3 days but my gums got sore</li>
            <li> It has been a week since I started and my teeth are not disgusting yellow anymore!</li>
            <li> The first couple of days using them, however, caused some sensitivity in a couple of my teeth and the surrounding gums.</li>
            <li> but if Im already spending this much I might as well go ahead and buy the Crest Whitestrips!</li>
            <li> After finally reading the instructions and using the strips properly, I found that I liked them!  </li>
            <li> You will need to be consistent and use these twice a day.  </li>
            <li> The whitening strips seem to work pretty well.</li>
            <li> I dread using these, as they melt in your mouth and taste pretty gnarly.</li>
            <li> I have used them 3 days in a row and can&#x27;t imagine how much whiter my teeth could get!</li>
            <li> First, you need to read and follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> The first time using them it took me a minute to get the hang of it, but after that all went well.  </li>
            <li> and I could see how much brighter my smile looked.</li>
            <li> Also they are more affordable than others I find in store and these never left spots on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Very displeased!</li>
            <li> Make sure you have opened the package all the way across the top, otherwise if you try pulling the strip out with the package ripped open only halfway or so...you might tear the strip.</li>
            <li> I love that the each strip is made to work for both upper or lower.</li>
            <li> At first this caused my stomach to become upset.  </li>
            <li> exactly the shower</li>
            <li> (and you get a lot more per box than with Crest&#x27;s similar product)!  </li>
            <li> These are different for everyone, but they took about 15 minutes for the bottom teeth to dissolve, and 30 for the top to dissolve.</li>
            <li> I have used these strips on and off over the last year and really am satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li> I am a satisfied customer and will keep using them as needed to keep my teeth white since I don&#x27;t plan on giving up my coffee.  </li>
            <li> Ok, I think I&#x27;ll be the first to actually comment on their functionality in addition to their ease of use.</li>
            <li> they really work what else can I say!</li>
            <li> I use them every few weeks to keep my teeth bright looking.</li>
            <li> I think these whitened okay, but they didn&#x27;t actually dissolve  in my mouth after&lt;</li>
            <li> if I&#x27;m able to get enough of them out of the packages.....</li>
            <li> tried my first dissolving strip set this morning.</li>
            <li> will likely buy these again when I run out, as I foresee myself liking them more.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used whitening strips</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> Be SURE the little triangle cutout is on your left hand side on your bottom teeth, and right hand side on your top teeth!...</li>
            <li> In general, easy to use and god effect for the price.</li>
            <li> Once i finish the box my teeth are a realistic white (not neon white) lol.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used any other kind</li>
            <li> I agree with other users that it is nice to brush teeth after use.</li>
            <li> Open your mouth wide lol and press them against your teeth.</li>
            <li> Not being a coffee or wine drinker nor a smoker may contribute to their lack of effectiveness as I don&#x27;t have much in the way of stains or yellowing to correct, but I was hoping for a brighter, more noticeable white.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product even more than its big name competitor.  </li>
            <li> The first box lasted me a good  months if not more because of the way that I use them (I&#x27;ll explain my routine at the end of this review).</li>
            <li> results are not what you would get if they were done professionally, but that&#x27;s ok because the look that they gave my teeth was a natural look.</li>
            <li> and it is especially quick and easy...not messy like some.</li>
            <li> Also, the strips tear very easily, so need to be careful in application.  </li>
            <li> Some of the strips in the second box did not come of of the packaging easily as was the case of my first box.  </li>
            <li> I gave the Rembrandt a try based on the positive reviews here</li>
            <li> and I got results pretty fast.  </li>
            <li> After that first use, they dont hurt as much.  </li>
            <li> Not unhappy with my purchase, was just expecting more given some of the other reviews.</li>
            <li> For the morning routine I just put them on before the shower and they were pretty much dissolved by the time I got out.</li>
            <li> BAM, a nice white, not to obvious smile.</li>
            <li> I have tried the zoom whitening system from the dentist and that just made my teeth so sensitive and this doesn&#x27;t cause any sensitivity and has no bad taste.</li>
            <li> My first box of Rembrandt Strips worked fine, but the second box I have had problems with.  </li>
            <li> The strips don&#x27;t come off very easily, they mostly come off in pieces - not happy about that.</li>
            <li> Complete rip off &amp; huge dissapointment as I&#x27;ve always heard that Rembrandt is a high quality product.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a person who it very particular about texture, you might not like this product.</li>
            <li> I really like pretty much all Rembrant products.</li>
            <li> Make sure your hands are completely dry.</li>
            <li> Make sure your hands are 100% dry before handling the strips.&lt;br /&gt;2)  </li>
            <li> To me, the packaging is easy to open.  </li>
            <li> Just have dry hands and rip the top of the package long-ways to peel the strip out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re easy to apply and definitely do not fall apart when you&#x27;re trying to put them on.</li>
            <li> Packaging is easy to open.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thirdly, it whitens teeth without making them super sensitive.</li>
            <li> Easy to open package</li>
            <li> You must read instructions as the strips must go on in a certain direction.</li>
            <li> The price for the Rembrandt strips is also very reasonable compared to other much more costly and less effective products.</li>
            <li> I think I did get a small result and more polished teeth but would have liked to see a brighter white result.</li>
            <li> Came In Such A Quick Amount Of Time!</li>
            <li> I believe these used to be sold as Listerine Strips and are certainly easier and more comfortable to use than the hard plastic trays.  </li>
            <li> i tried trimming to fit better, but no luck the product is just too delicate to work with.</li>
            <li> and they really are sooooo gentle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used up almost the whole package after 3 months.</li>
            <li> but I really wasn&#x27;t expecting anyhing.</li>
            <li> I really like these Rembrant strips.</li>
            <li> I could not keep it in my mouth for the directed time.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves a very gooey slimed film on teeth, took both 2 cycles brushing and gargling to remove film and taste.</li>
            <li> but anyway, no matter how much I brush my teeth</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really like these.</li>
            <li> so it is very bubbly.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and fast delivery</li>
            <li> I wish I had the attention span to use these for the whole two weeks, but I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I did not notice any difference on my teeth, after using the whole package diligently (twice a day as instructed)</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want it to dissolve too fast</li>
            <li> and you will have ABSOLUTELY without A SHADOW OF A DOUBT, noticeably whiter teeth, even after just 4 or 5 days you&#x27;ll notice something, and by day 14 you&#x27;re gonna be getting compliments.</li>
            <li> you really get what you pay for</li>
            <li> These worked... Not an intense change, but my teeth felt cleaner.  </li>
            <li> They could really use this product there.</li>
            <li> They REALLY DO WORK on surface stains from coffee, cigarettes, et al.</li>
            <li> In addition, it is important to use these strips daily.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much change in color on my teeth.</li>
            <li> I had a very unsightly trout pout.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used those in the past and were very satisfied with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If there was a phrase with which I could describe these whitening strips, it would be &amp;#34;an unusual experience.&amp;#34; They do the job, and do it well.</li>
            <li> expected better results</li>
            <li> These are so much easier and quicker to use.  </li>
            <li> That is, because they are so much easier to use, I use them.  </li>
            <li> I teamed these strips with the Rembrandt Intense Stain Tooth</li>
            <li> These really work.</li>
            <li> much so I threw them away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used wraps before that really were painful/uncomfortable, however, I haven&#x27;t had any issue with these.</li>
            <li> Rembrandt dissolving strips really work.</li>
            <li> With reviews I read I expected more result.  </li>
            <li> I could see the difference but did not notice how much of a difference until I would look at pictures of myself</li>
            <li> think that they are very well rounded set of strips.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I go a whole month without using them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sometimes I go a whole month without using them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really works...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for weeks now and they really seem to work.</li>
            <li> It should be noted that you need two strips per use, so it is really a 28 day program.</li>
            <li> B007RF1YZG Rembrandt Intense Stain Dissolving Strips, 56 Count]]&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Instead of fumbling around trying to tear it in a straight line, I use Swiss army knife scissors and cut 3 sides off the packaging.  </li>
            <li> The whitening effect is very MEH.</li>
            <li> The strips are very this and begin to melt if they touch anything with moisture on it: fingers, gums, lips, tongue, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like these strips.  </li>
            <li> and while I&#x27;m showering/getting ready for the day in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This product leaves a residue on your teeth and really does not whiten as well as Crest Strips.</li>
            <li> (they&#x27;re not noticeable unless someone is really looking at your teeth close up).  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t smoke, but I drink a lot of coffee, and I&#x27;ve invested a lot of money in my teeth, so this was the last (cheap) step.</li>
            <li> I put them on before my work commute, and before I started to get ready for bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got pulled over after I started using them, the officer thought I had my high-beams on, but it turns out I was really just smiling.</li>
            <li> and I see a very noticeable difference  in the color of my teeth almost immediately.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you can really swallow while using these.  </li>
            <li> And since those strips don&#x27;t dissolve, they cause so much gagging and can even induce vomiting at times.</li>
            <li> This product is much easier to use than theother whitening systems I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I thought these worked very well.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really find this to be the case, however I used some advice I had read.</li>
            <li> He used one whole box of these</li>
            <li> I have to wait 20 minutes (not 5-10 minutes) for them to dissolve as much as they can, and then I brush my teeth to remove the remaining film.</li>
            <li> liked these, bottom strip much larger than crest white  strips</li>
            <li> They apply easily enough and whiten nicely without making your teeth look paper white --</li>
            <li> I was a bit concerned after reading a few reviews, but I made sure my hands were dry and had no issues with the strips desolving anywhere except my teeth - I haven&#x27;t been using them consistently enough to say whether they are whitening my teeth or not, but they are easy to use :-)</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t hurt my teeth like most other strips do.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cheaper than other brands of strips, and work better for me.</li>
            <li> I used to use the listerine dissolving whitening strips and was so sad that they discontinued them, but these are the same exact product as the listerine, and very satisfied with it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other drugstore brands but Rembrandt is always my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I use a whitening toothpaste which may help, but this is better than any other OTC teeth whitening product I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I like these better than any of the 5 other products I&#x27;ve used to whiten teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the way it wraps around the back of my teeth to clean there, too.</li>
            <li> If you liked Listerine Whitening strips and were annoyed that they were discontinued, you&#x27;ll be happy to know that they&#x27;re back, exactly the same, just under a different name</li>
            <li> I have to imagine that anyone who likes these strips must have some kind of enormous horse mouth, or else very damp teeth and very dry lips.</li>
            <li> but they were outdated and no longer removed easily from foil and even if they did they no longer worked so need more.</li>
            <li> kind of sort of becomes less noticeable over a ridiculously long period of time, but never really goes away&amp;#34; kind of like racism in the South.</li>
            <li> These are so much easier to use than the normal strips.</li>
            <li> , I unintentionally fell asleep while wearing these strips and was surprised at much whiter my teeth looked in the morning!</li>
            <li> and you would have an awfully hard time putting the top ones on first and then fighting all that saliva!  </li>
            <li> I have tried others and these are the best as they really do disolve and do leave a bad taste.</li>
            <li> I find that they work much better than the 2 hour whitening tray treatment by Rembrandt and cause less tooth sensitivity than the trays.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, the product works for teeth, they are whiter, but now shows off my black tongue more.</li>
            <li> No intense sensitivity and easy to use.</li>
            <li> They disolve quickly and after just one use see a big difference.....</li>
            <li> ; That was when I knew i should stop and be satisfied with my white teeth, and they&#x27;ve been white ever since.</li>
            <li> On top of that, my inner lips (both upper and lower) were covered with sores.</li>
            <li> I did accidentally tear one of the strips while trying to pull it out, but that was mainly my fault</li>
            <li> the strips do indeed dissolve and leave a decent mint flavor in the mouth.</li>
            <li> is a very inexpensive way to keep your smile white.</li>
            <li> It would probably take two cartons to notice a decent difference, at which point you could&#x27;ve just bought Crest and done it in a shorter time period.&lt;br /&gt;Take</li>
            <li> I wil say as the strips settle themselves in during its 10 min dissolve i does sting a particular part of my mouth...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not every product is for everybody, but as I look at reviews I have to wonder how many people who struggle with using these actually read and follow the directions (which are very simple).  </li>
            <li> Just cut open the top and the two side panels, then peel back the packaging</li>
            <li> I really like them much better than the Crest White Strips which I have used for a long time.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even need a full weeks worth of product and now just use them occasionally to keep my teeth at the brighter white shade I like.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend  this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I think I got high.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> So i gave these a try based on the high rating.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> I expect far better from Rembrandt-save your money and use other well known brands</li>
            <li> whenever I had them on during that one week period I try to keep my mouth as dry as possible by smiling or by swallowing more often so that the strips dissolve much slower than 10 minutes that it says on the box.</li>
            <li> So far I have only used 1/2 of the box and my teeth are already significantly whitened.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product every few months to keep my smile looking fresh!</li>
            <li> I think they are milder than some of the others, too, and since they are also cheaper, using them a little longer or more often isn&#x27;t a problem.  </li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant, but I&#x27;m glad I gave these a shot.</li>
            <li> They have little notches on them - Tear the top off, then the sides, and then just take the strip out.</li>
            <li> It did it&#x27;s job, however the leading brands are a little more pricey</li>
            <li> From the $200+ Glo from sephora to toothpaste and nothing&#x27;s worked better for me than these dandy little strips.</li>
            <li> I love these little boogers and would recommend them to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li> I figure that if they remain intact for 20 minutes or more, they are whitening a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I found that it took more than the 5-10 min advertised for the strips to disintegrate, and they would frequently leave little bits that wouldn&#x27;t really dissolve.</li>
            <li> they work well, and do not bother my sensitive teeth as much as crest whitestrips.</li>
            <li> The strips worked great for the front of my teeth, but unfortunately did not reach in between my teeth.</li>
            <li> I have done 3 applications with these strips, and was really surprised at how much whiter my teeth are.  </li>
            <li> I will try them again just to see if they can get my teeth even whiter, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re worth the effort currently.</li>
            <li> However, the directions tell you to use them 2 times per day, so there are actually 14 days worth.  </li>
            <li> These are the first white strips I&#x27;ve ever used, and I really like them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I just had a dentist visit and they told me to stop whitening because my shade is now out of the normal teeth spectrum</li>
            <li> I was advised to only do a touch up (a week&#x27;s worth of strips) in about three months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then normal size would practically fully wrap around my teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a heavy tea and coffee drinker, so my teeth have seen better days.</li>
            <li> You definitely get your money&#x27;s worth from this</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, these Rembrandt strips are an exact replica of the old Listerine dissolving ones.  </li>
            <li> However, I did notice better results with the crest 9maybe because my teeth used to be less white the first time).</li>
            <li> While they are not as strong as the 20%/30% trays they work well for brightening several shades, dont irritate, plus you will actually use them!</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t white white, but they do look pretty natural and unstained and now I can wear lipstick again and my teeth don&#x27;t appear more yellow.</li>
            <li> White enough to give me a bright smile, but not super white to the point that it looked unnatural.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Crazy good deal at the time!</li>
            <li> or if they are being sold under another new name?!!!!???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They dissolve easily, well within half an hour.</li>
            <li> At first to get a noticeable result in whiteness, I would use one set of strips per day everyday for a full week.</li>
            <li> No fuss, no wasted time, you can use as many or as few as you need, and save the rest.</li>
            <li> put my teeth together without overbiting and apply one strip the the front which covers my upper and lower, hold my mouth shut for about 1 minute and that gives the strip time to get wet and seperate itself from the top and bottom teeth</li>
            <li> These strips, by following the directions, took the stains AWAY and keeps new stains from forming!!!</li>
            <li> not professional but close enough for a day to day basis and easy on your teeth enamel</li>
            <li> I heard from other review that this product works great, however i have a hard time with the taste</li>
            <li> After the last application, I expect to see a nice patch of pearly white on my right canine, my lower left cuspid, and possibly some bleaching of my upper gums.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They do dissolve after about 10 minutes and you just have to rinse or brush to get the last remnants of the taste of the strip out of your mouth, which is pretty convenient.  </li>
            <li> As far as using this product: READ THE INSTRUCTIONS PEOPLE!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for the past week and half,and i just love it.  </li>
            <li> I give these a 4 star only because I have used other whiteneing strips that I like better.  </li>
            <li> Instant results with no burning, and no weird flavor.</li>
            <li> I am into my first week using these strips and I already see solid results.</li>
            <li> They brightened my teeth 1-2 shades (although my teeth are already pretty white).</li>
            <li> I am an avid tea/coffee drinker so white strips are a must.</li>
            <li> The application is pretty simple.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t even think there was anything in each individual packet.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth, get these now!</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re willing to put in the technical effort and accept the trial-and-error process, they might work for you as well -- and for a fraction of the price of Crest Whitestrips.</li>
            <li> These are the first and only strips I will probably ever use.</li>
            <li> I did exactly what the instructions said - twice a day for two weeks, and I can definitely see a difference.</li>
            <li> you can see why I was hesitent to try it one again, but I&#x27;m getting married and I feel like my teeth are way too yellow.  </li>
            <li> These are EXACTLY the same!</li>
            <li> It was pretty necessary to rip off all three sides of the packaging to prevent the strip from tearing (which still happened often).</li>
            <li> I think they&#x27;re really easy to get out of the package and use, and with just a little practice you can get them right to the edge of the teeth and avoid contact with the gums, which is a major source of irritation with goopy trays and big, waxy strips.  </li>
            <li> Keep a stiff upper lip is a great statement for the English, it helps hide those crooked chompers.</li>
            <li> Faintly sour, nothing overwhelming, definitely does not stop me from using them.</li>
            <li> I have not, however, been able to get rid of one stain between two of my teeth, but it is too deep of a stain, going down layers into the tooth, for anything to remove it.</li>
            <li> I have loved these strips since finding them in our local Walmart store but they no longer carry them:( Can always count on Amazon to offer up everything I want :)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I make sure that i take a kleenex and dry my teeth and inside lips and tongue before I apply the strips because they do start dissolving as soon as they get wet.</li>
            <li> They worked fine, but one night I put them in and fell asleep for a few minutes</li>
            <li> I pure chased these based on other positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are not horribly discolored, just enough wear &amp; tear to want something a little brighter.</li>
            <li> They are not as strong as others I have used, but they will take off daily coffee buildup, or other stains that natural foods can give anyones teeth.</li>
            <li> others reviewers note, the strips tear easily, and if you don&#x27;t open the packages VERY carefully, you might tear a strip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They dissolve completely</li>
            <li> Your teeth will fall out from old age before you can whiten them.</li>
            <li> : gradually whitens teeth if used daily for 5days straight.</li>
            <li> Does not make teeth sensitive nor appear see through.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> In some cases by the time I removed them they were rip or torn and in some cases nearly unusable.  </li>
            <li> been only using it for 1 week, it did whitened my teeth a little...though not as much as i would have like...</li>
            <li> My dentist told me it&#x27;s from antibiotics that stained my teeth when I was young.  </li>
            <li> As far as whiteness goes, my teeth still aren&#x27;t pearly whites (nor did I expect them to be)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it would really bring your teeth up several shades though.  </li>
            <li> but absolutely a pain in the ass to open the package</li>
            <li> it is completely dissolved</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 76 years old.</li>
            <li> They melt on your teeth like the old listermint breath strips.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give 4.5 stars if I could because of that, but otherwise I&#x27;d recommend them completely.</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> This time they must be old or expired.</li>
            <li> They did not bother my sensitive teeth at all.</li>
            <li> Take the side that doesn&#x27;t have the strip on it completely off.</li>
            <li> Overall, these strips were very effective.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> used a whole box, and now I am halfway through my second box.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much experience with white strips, but I just received these today.</li>
            <li> This is completely ineffective.</li>
            <li> They claim to be 10 minute strips, but my drive is 30 minutes, and the strips are just about completely dissolved by then.  </li>
            <li> thing I noticed was that the strips did not dissolve completely on my teeth that have veneers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years now, I don&#x27;t use them according to directions, they make my teeth to sensitive (all whitening products do).</li>
            <li> If your teeth are sensitive to whitening products you won&#x27;t have a problem with these.</li>
            <li> All is left is see the results after using the whole box.</li>
            <li> The strips end up almost completely dissolving in about 30 minutes with my method.</li>
            <li> After the week of what  I call intense whitening, I only have to do touch ups from that point.</li>
            <li> and it helped the effects last for much longer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The strips end up almost completely dissolving in about 30 minutes with my method.</li>
            <li> After the week of what  I call intense whitening, I only have to do touch ups from that point.</li>
            <li> and it helped the effects last for much longer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are just like the old listerine whitening strips.  </li>
            <li> mine must have been 7,000 years old cause when i opened the package the strips were like fused to the sides of the packaging.</li>
            <li> They just disappear.&lt;br /&gt;These have whitened my teeth considerably after using for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> After tearing off the top of an individual strip packet, cut open the sides of the packet with scissors so that the strip is fully exposed, then carefully peel it off.  </li>
            <li> comparable to professional strength without the pain to the teeth &amp; wallet</li>
            <li> brush my teeth with sensodyne, because I have sensitive teeth and that has worked for me-</li>
            <li> Before I even ordered this product I read the reviews and kept hope alive.</li>
            <li> These whitening strips don&#x27;t hurt my sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth from grinding</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money</li>
            <li> Unlike Crest, the Rembrandt strips did not make my teeth sensitive AT ALL, even when I used two sets in one day - and I have fairly sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> These were old strips, brittle, off-taste... old.</li>
            <li> The strips had a visible effect on me, but towards the end of the two week period my teeth became quite sensitive.</li>
            <li> So far too soon to see results as I am on day 5, although I saw faster results with the Listerine</li>
            <li> the old Listerine melt-in-your-mouth strips.</li>
            <li> Came fast, not a big fan of the product though.</li>
            <li> After using the Rembrandt strips twice a day for nearly a month, I now apply them once a day for maintenance.</li>
            <li> These whitening strips perform as they say, however they do not dissolve completely and leave a film on your teeth.</li>
            <li> Those people smile with their mouhts closed.</li>
            <li> Overall the product does what it says it will do, but for a few dollars more the Crest strips are the way to go.</li>
            <li> a waste of a third or more of the box.....frustrating.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know if these work effectively to whiten teeth, because they upset my stomach and nauseated me.</li>
            <li> the dissolving feature of these is both nice and annoying, sure you don&#x27;t have to throw anything away</li>
            <li> mentioned by others, it is a little difficult to open the individual strips from its wrapping, but I&#x27;ve learned to estimate the size of the actual strips inside the wrapping, so I just cut the edges off and am able to get to the strips far more easily.  </li>
            <li> In other words, if you were to imagine the packet as an envelope and the strip as a letter, open the top and sides of the envelope and fold it back before removing the letter.&lt;br /&gt;3)  </li>
            <li> Previous reviews had said they weren&#x27;t noticeable, which was aesthetically true</li>
            <li> Generally speaking i have VERY sensitive teeth and can never use any of these products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Somewhere down the line, the item was probably placed somewhere super hot.&lt;br /&gt;Cant</li>
            <li> I usually buy the plus white whitening gel and put it in my retainers and that seems to work better for me, and is cheaper.</li>
            <li> I noticed slight sensitivity on my gums after the 5 days in a row of treatment but after being more careful when applying the strips I haven&#x27;t had that problem again.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s important to have dry hands when applying the strips -- they&#x27;re meant to dissolve in your mouth, so if you touch them with wet hands</li>
            <li> All you do is tear open the thinner seal, then you can simply tear down the length of the packet, leaving the strip completely exposed for easy extraction.</li>
            <li> Besides the slightly unpleasant texture/taste, I am pretty satisfied with the product and hope they work!</li>
            <li> At first it looked like the packets were empty but no - on closer inspection</li>
            <li> Used other brands previously which were much better and noticeable</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are less powerful than the Crest strips.  </li>
            <li> I would buy them again, but only for a daily use, not for whitening  the teeth intensely.</li>
            <li> By that I mean my coffee and tea stains are gone and i receive many complements on ho white</li>
            <li> I have used other strips that have visibly worked for me in the first three uses....</li>
            <li> (In a previous update, I had to cut open the top and 2 sides of each packet and very carefully pry up the edge of the strip with my fingernail and then try to peel the strip off the backing in one piece.)  </li>
            <li> So I amazing, that I try not to tell anyone my secret!</li>
            <li> The box says they will dissolve in 5-10 minutes, but it generally took at about 20 for me.</li>
            <li> basically, it&#x27;s very yellow towards the gumline and lightens as it reaches the far end of the teeth.</li>
            <li> These things wad up as soon as they get near your mouth and refuse to stick to teeth properly.</li>
            <li> I will be using the last ones tomorrow and my teeth look considerably whiter than they did.  </li>
            <li> You have to really look once you open up the sachet and use your nails to try to peal back the actual strip.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY whitening product out there that doesn&#x27;t leave my teeth hurting &amp; ridiculously sensitive afterwards.</li>
            <li> So I was pleasantly surprised to see the return of dissolving strips, albeit under a different brand name.  </li>
            <li> I do use scissors to cut the packets open but have no trouble using the strips.  </li>
            <li> It only takes 15 minutes for them to dissolve completely</li>
            <li> Then take the two halves left and completely remove the one without the strip attached.</li>
            <li> If you are looking to achieve a noticeable white far beyond just stain removal</li>
            <li> but then I learned that if I brush my teeth first with Sensodyne or a similar product I can then apply these strip with absolutely no sensitivity during or after the application.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Putting them on:&lt;br /&gt;Ok, getting them on my bottom teeth is always kind of difficult, but I&#x27;ve never ruined a strip.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other whitening strips and those help significantly more (crest white strips) but are a little pricier</li>
            <li> There are the ONLY white strips that do not bother my mouth or make my teeth sensitive!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not messy, and even opening the little packages that each individual strip comes in is made simple that you can just slip them right</li>
            <li> there were any other brands on the market (and don&#x27;t much care, either).  </li>
            <li> Your teeth will be whiter, but very marginally since the strips aren&#x27;t as harsh/strong as other brands.</li>
            <li> and really does the job without costing a lot like the other strips.</li>
            <li> The wraps cover all the teeth visible when I smile; I recall that Crest&#x27;s were just a little too short</li>
            <li> /&gt;The strips are pretty fragile, so be careful removing them from their individual packs, but it&#x27;s not rocket</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about them is that when I use them for the first treatment, my teeth become extremely sensitive and HURT after a few minutes when the strip is applied.  </li>
            <li> I have only used them twice so far and a friend of mine commented on how white my teeth are.</li>
            <li> So, if you are young, before deep stains set in, use these strips NOW so you won&#x27;t end up with stains too deep to get rid of.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect a professional whitening, but this did white one bit from my naked eye.  </li>
            <li> At $129 and up, I&#x27;ll just say &#x27;no thanks&#x27; and continue to use the older ones</li>
            <li> Their dry right out of the box, not slimy like other brands  </li>
            <li> Work well but taste a little funny</li>
            <li> When I first used these I saw little results, but with continued used I did start seeing results.</li>
            <li> Tastes a little funny though.</li>
            <li> After a little under two weeks of consistent use, my teeth are noticeably whiter.</li>
            <li> Yes, there is definite improvement, but it&#x27;s pretty slight.</li>
            <li> I had mild whitening, but not as extreme as other whiteners, but they caused sensitivity so I would rather use this as a safer dental choice.</li>
            <li> Manual says it only takes about 5-10 min to dissolve completely, but mine took well over 30 min for it to dissolve, good thing the taste isnt all that bad</li>
            <li> The films completely melted on to the packaging LONG BEFORE I EVEN GOT THEM</li>
            <li> If each box gives a few shades of white, resulting in a cumulative whitening effect, it would be worth it at this price to buy several boxes, so we&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did experience a slight bitter taste during the process, but it went away quickly.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a slight change but not as much as I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li> These are thin, but still easy to use.</li>
            <li> This went away shortly after removal of strips, and didn&#x27;t even occur after the first few days.</li>
            <li> Got them again a month ago and found them to be so thin they tear son easily</li>
            <li> When putting them on, though, I carefully do it by putting the strip on one tooth and then carefully and gently push it between two teeth as far as possible without ripping the strip, cover the next tooth, then carefully and gently push it between two teeth, and etc.(starting with a front tooth and going back on one side of the array of teeth and then continuing with the other side) thereby getting at the stains between the front teeth.</li>
            <li> I bought this with a little hesitation after reading a review of a lady whose mouth got really swollen.</li>
            <li> The Rembrandt box accurately says that the strips &amp;#34;noticeably whitens tough stains, like coffee...</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and spend a little extra on the Crest ones that don&#x27;t dissolve; they work very well.</li>
            <li> They dissolved immediately on my tongue and inner cheeks and were incredibly goopy and very painful.</li>
            <li> really like that they dissolve and you don&#x27;t have to take them out after some odd minutes, but they do not completely dissolve like you&#x27;d think-</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re easy to use, so I&#x27;m not sure why some people are having trouble opening and applying them.</li>
            <li> This product is not strong but gentle on your gums.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I was tired of paying too much for crest whitestrips-- which don&#x27;t work anymore because of the advanced seal they have created in the recent past.</li>
            <li> be careful when using this if you have sensitive teeth or dont leave it on for a long period of time</li>
            <li> Also, open the package the long way AND the short way</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth and large lips..</li>
            <li> When I opened the first two packages, I thought the strips were missing - they are clear, stuck to the foil, and pretty difficult to see if you happen to not be wearing your glasses.</li>
            <li> Rembrandt&#x27;s Intense Stain Dissolving Strips are fragile and less convenient to use than other whitening strips on the market.  </li>
            <li> I usually use the Crest Gentle Routine</li>
            <li> but I also have a stripe across all the middle of my teeth from when I had braces a long time ago</li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t stay white for as long as they did with Listerine strips.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it for long enough to see any results just yet</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lately, the price...after I paid 29.99 for these on Amazon, I did a search to find some information on how to properly use them because its not clear which side of the strip you are supposed to use and found that you can buy them directly from Rembrant for considerably less (22.99 - 5.00 coupon &#x3D;</li>
            <li> Not a major inconvenience, which is why I give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The strips are also very wide, to the extent that if your teeth are of a decent enough size, you could probably cut one strip in half and use that for all of your mouth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used one whole box now, and I can say my teeth are definitely one shade at the least brighter/</li>
            <li> I then use them less frequently.</li>
            <li> To difficult to apply on the teeth and the strip are easy to tear</li>
            <li> I compare this product to dissolvable toilet paper that is used for camping.</li>
            <li> I have a few uses left, and I switched over to Crest Professional effects.</li>
            <li> I like them easy to use,and not so harsh they irritate my gums,which has happened in the past with other brands.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even write about effectiveness cuz they taste so bad I couldn&#x27;t use them more than 2 times!</li>
            <li> I cut each strip lengthwise and put the narrow half on the bottom teeth and the slightly wider half on the top.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t ever go back to using the more expensive whitening products!</li>
            <li> I tried to make my last box of them last as long as I could as I was dreading having to buy the \\&quot;other kind\\&quot; of strips.  </li>
            <li> My teeth look brighter, and clean, and very very naturally white, not at all fake.</li>
            <li> I have such sensitive teeth that using other white strips after one use usually leaves me in such pain</li>
            <li> Difficult to fit.  </li>
            <li> so I might just use these in the long run.</li>
            <li> I will defiantly keep using these as long as there manufactured.</li>
            <li> The strips are individually packaged and you do need to be careful taking the strip out.</li>
            <li> Dissolves and tasted strange.</li>
            <li> I can see minimal difference between the teeth covered with these and my back teeth..</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the thing, since using this product, I have developed a Black Tongue!</li>
            <li> After about two or three days of coffee etc.... teeth were back to less than white.</li>
            <li> I learned from the last time I used it that my gums felt raw and turned a pale shade of pinkish gray after the whole process, hence the decision of doing it the night before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will definitely use these again and perhaps other Rembrandt products as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all sorts of whitening products, such as mouthwash, other brands of strips, and toothpastes.  </li>
            <li> but they actually do make my teeth look whiter, but the other considerations don&#x27;t make up for this.</li>
            <li> FIRST, IT WAS VERY HARD TO REMOVE FROM PACKAGING, AND APPLYING THE STRIPS WITHOUT HAVE THEM STICK TO YOUR LIP, OR</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on your teeth very long, just melts off.</li>
            <li> If you have dry hands</li>
            <li> These strips seem to whiten your teeth fairly well, but they are almost impossible to get on!</li>
            <li> the strips completely prevent you from properly articulating the letter &amp;#34;s.&amp;#34; At least my teeth got</li>
            <li> And as for sensitivity so far all I have had has been a little gum irritation, that&#x27;s all!</li>
            <li> Pleasant taste &amp; works as well as my trays from dentist without the painful &amp;#34;zings&amp;#34; !</li>
            <li> They are a hassle to get out of their individual wraps, they are extremely difficult to place on the bottom row of teeth due to the quick dissolve.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the Crest strips in the past and those things made my teeth so sensitive I couldn&#x27;t even breathe without my teeth being in pain, so I avoided whitening strips altogether.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback is, with frequent use, especially after brushing teeth, they can feel irritating to the gums.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost impossible for your tongue not to involuntarily want to touch something on your teeth for 10 or more minutes.</li>
            <li> I have seen a slight difference in the whiteness (comparing to a back tooth that doesn&#x27;t get whitened).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s only a 10 minute thing, unlike Crest Whitestrips that take about a half hour.</li>
            <li> the record: I have pretty sensitive teeth(to cold) and didn&#x27;t notice any increased sensitivity.</li>
            <li> With my mouth closed and dry, it was sore.</li>
            <li> From my experience, these strips do not dissolve entirely, even after half an hour.  </li>
            <li> After 2 times, my inside upper lip is sore and slightly swollen.  </li>
            <li> You should also dry your hands before using these, as they stick to anything that is wet.</li>
            <li> but they arent super expensive either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going for black light glowing white/ fake looking teeth, just to counteract my morning coffee addiction.</li>
            <li> Having never used any other whitening strips, I&#x27;m not sure how it stacks up against them as far as whitening goes.  </li>
            <li> I felt a little gum sensitivity and the strips could be a bit longer, but at this rate, my teeth are going to be amazingly white when I&#x27;m finished with the kit!</li>
            <li> but then they would stick to my top teeth and the would also get stuck to my bottom lip or my gums and they take a lot longer than 10 minutes to dissolve and they taste bad.</li>
            <li> Also, I had to refrain from running my tongue over it, which wasn&#x27;t too bad, but meant I couldn&#x27;t really talk for 5-10 minutes especially if I didn&#x27;t want to swallow the gross mixture of dissolving dental strips and saliva.&lt;br /&gt;After 5-10 minutes had passed, the strips dissolved only at the front of my teeth.</li>
            <li> rather then when I did the aquafresh one where it was clearly too late and my teeth and gums were damaged for months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The strips could not be removed from the individual packs, appeared to be dried out.</li>
            <li> Seeing an improvement after only a few days of use.</li>
            <li> Also a couple of these dissolved partially by the time I applied</li>
            <li> so u have to be really careful before it even touches one tooth</li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite what others have said, I have absolutely no issue getting the strips out of the foil.</li>
            <li> and the box is almost empty so...</li>
            <li> You have to be careful when opening the package not to rip the strip.</li>
            <li> Be careful.</li>
            <li> used it the night before a military gala at my husband&#x27;s work.</li>
            <li> When I gargled off my morning breath, I realized how much worse it really was.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the crest strips and was annoyed when I could no longer find the Listerine dissolving strips.</li>
            <li> strips had no real issue sticking to my teeth.</li>
            <li> You could see a difference in how white my teeth were within a few days of using.  </li>
            <li> No thanks.  </li>
            <li> I almost didn&#x27;t see them and thought it was empty.</li>
            <li> They also don&#x27;t irritate my gums and work after only a few applications.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a total waste of 20 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These were tiny and messy to use.</li>
            <li> CAREFUL DON&#x27;T CUT YOUR TONGUE OR INSIDE OF YOUR LIPS!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;FOR</li>
            <li> I get compliments on how white my teeth are after a few days of using these things....</li>
            <li> and I really do not see a noticeable difference as I did with Crest.  </li>
            <li> They dissolve after a few minutes,then I brush what&#x27;s left off-</li>
            <li> If you do it this way, it&#x27;s dead simple to remove from the packaging.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not much.</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;m here to tell you all to not worry because they do not tear, unless you&#x27;re being rough with them.</li>
            <li> No really, I do.</li>
            <li> If your fingers get even remotely wet, then the strips immediately start to dissolve</li>
            <li> What I mean by touch ups is that I only have to use the strips about once a week if necessary.</li>
            <li> What I mean by touch ups is that I only have to use the strips about once a week if necessary.</li>
            <li> The certainly DO NOT dissolve in 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several other whitening products but none have given me so much trouble as these strips.  </li>
            <li> The packaging isn&#x27;t that hard to open, as long as your careful.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t whiten as quickly as a gel, but are less expensive and will eventually get the job done.  </li>
            <li> My teeth only whitened slightly but no significant change.</li>
            <li> I think other brands (crest) may work faster</li>
            <li> I usually use Crest white strips but this time I was strapped for cash.  </li>
            <li> One side has a thicker seal than the other.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried any other whitening product so I can&#x27;t make a comparison.</li>
            <li> I bought these recently to whiten my teeth after a few years after using the Listerine version, and I went through 2 boxes of the listerine and my mom was like &amp;#34;Woah!</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have mentioned that you can swallow the saliva that builds up in your mouth after putting these in.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any problems opening the strips or applying them, unlike other reviewers.</li>
            <li> like you get when using other whitening strips.</li>
            <li> On 1st use these made an extreme difference.</li>
            <li> Pull one side of your lip out of your way, and finish attaching one side, then do the other.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have drool coming out of your mouth caused by trays or other non-dissolving strips.</li>
            <li> Although It Says 2 Weeks You Can See Minimal Results After Every Try!</li>
            <li> Unlike other posters on here I have had no problems with opening the package or tearing the strips.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, they dissolve and require very minimal maintenance.</li>
            <li> The strips are a little unpleasant to get off if you want to do a shorter treatment, and the strips only cover the front teeth, what you would see when you smile.</li>
            <li> Also, these strips are supposed to &amp;#34;dissolve&amp;#34; but I had to brush after each use, due to the thick film still left on.</li>
            <li> And Amazon typically has them cheaper than other places.  </li>
            <li> I never got the whiteness I wanted, and all it did was eroded my gumline from years of brushing too hard to try to achieve my white teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Crest white strips are hard to handle.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is taking out the strips from packaging..</li>
            <li> I try to stay away from dark soda&#x27;s or coffee and wine as well to try and prolong the results from these strips.</li>
            <li> I try to stay away from dark soda&#x27;s or coffee and wine as well to try and prolong the results from these strips.</li>
            <li> I just used them once a day on average 6 days a week.</li>
            <li> They, however, were even more annoying to wear.</li>
            <li> The working strip tightly adheres to the containing pocket (on its &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; side) and it might need a sharp blade or tweezers to start to separate the two surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> strips must be old stock ,they will stick to the packaging making it near impossible to use.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s b/c your salivary glands are down there</li>
            <li> I had people chase me down just for a photo.</li>
            <li> The moment the inside of my lips come down around my teeth, and thus the strip, the strip sticks to my lips rather than my teeth.</li>
            <li> Peel down your bottom lip with your fingers, pulling it away from your mouth.  </li>
            <li> I start with my lower teeth and hold both sides of my lip down with my ring fingers then apply the strips.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well!</li>
            <li> The packages are a little hard to open</li>
            <li> /&gt;The strips were a little hard to get to stick to my teeth, but that&#x27;s just something you get with any white strip.</li>
            <li> I have used other kinds when these were not available and none are as convenient to use.</li>
            <li> (other brands were too harsh).  </li>
            <li> At that price, the Crest Strips are actually less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought these for 14 dollars less, convinced they wouldnt work.</li>
            <li> For me, these things do not dissolve in 10 mins, much less 5.  </li>
            <li> but I forgot to use them for a while and discovered I still have a half box.</li>
            <li> Yay me, I still have half a box!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s name really is Black Hairy tongue and is a yeast infection on the tongue that turns black.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll see the results in less than a week.</li>
            <li> Less to waste&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used Crest whitening strips a couple of times, but decided to try Rembrandt because they are less than half the price and take less time each day.  </li>
            <li> and ive seen a slight difference</li>
            <li> I used half the box &amp; am just beginning to notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I paid less for this brand, yes.</li>
            <li> Hard to open, just sealed very tightly &amp; if you tear the tiny packaging on these the wrong way they either don&#x27;t open or you tear the strip itself..</li>
            <li> I was a huge fan of the Listerine Dissolving Whitening Strips and was disappointed when they were discontinued.  </li>
            <li> It is awkward to put the strips in at first</li>
            <li> or it creates mess.</li>
            <li> or you&#x27;ll end up with a mess on your hands.</li>
            <li> Yes, their products can be pricey, but you don&#x27;t want to mess around when it comes to your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mean think about it, these things are MADE to dissolve so if you hold onto them too long they will start melting on your hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used for a few days now and have noticed a slight difference</li>
            <li> Applying the strips was annoying but fairly easy.</li>
            <li> but I just keep a pair of little beauty scissors nearby.</li>
            <li> Lightened my teeth a little after just one use.  </li>
            <li> They did make my gums a little sore</li>
            <li> a little bleachy, I like how it foams in my mouth too.  </li>
            <li> This left white teeth with stains in the middle and in now looks like I have things stuck in between my teeth :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little time consuming.  </li>
            <li> I do notice a little improvement.  </li>
            <li> I think they helped a little bit to whiten</li>
            <li> It takes a little practice to get used to opening the packets and liberating the strips.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little practice to get used to putting them on and remembering when the notch should be where.  </li>
            <li> There was little to no sensitivity caused by this product for me.</li>
            <li> Yes, they can be a little tricky to apply</li>
            <li> I stayed awake until the strips were gone but in the morning, the underside of my tongue is a little swollen.</li>
            <li> the strips take away the morining coffee stains and bring the shade of your teeth a little whiter with each use.  </li>
            <li> Also, remembering which corner to have the notch on took a little time.</li>
            <li> how little time it takes.  </li>
            <li> Not having the largest mouth, I find it impossible to get my lips far enough out of the way to use these.</li>
            <li> These strips are individually packaged in foil wrappers, they are clear, stuck to the sides and are impossible to take out without tearing, stretching, or having the strip fold over on itself.</li>
            <li> You will end up throwing away about half of the strips that self destruct either when you open the poorly designed pacakage, attempt to remove them from the package, or place them in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I have tried other strips, gooey trays, and even this awful stuff you brush on your teeth and have to hold your lips back for over several minutes while it dries - NONE of those worked at all and were, for the most part, messy, expensive, and quite a hassle.</li>
            <li> Try not to get the strip on anything but your teeth because it is a little harsh on the gums.</li>
            <li> There will always be little chunks left behind that you might want to floss out or brush</li>
            <li> There will always be little chunks left behind that you might want to floss out or brush</li>
            <li> I could notice a difference with my teeth after using just a few times.</li>
            <li> used them now.. waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also a heavy coffee/tea</li>
            <li> These used to be sold by Listerine as their dissolving strips, and I couldn&#x27;t find those anymore after a few years of not using them</li>
            <li> Not as harsh on your teeth/gums/enamel, but works.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s because people had worse teeth back then.</li>
            <li> I use these about once a year, they work well, not too harsh and not overly whirring</li>
            <li> I am now heavy into the scene.</li>
            <li> I drink a lot of green tea and it has improved the whiteness a bit.</li>
            <li> My teeth got whiter but after a few days of using it puffed my lips up.</li>
            <li> They dissolve after a few minutes contact with teeth.</li>
            <li> I can see a difference on a few teeth after 2 uses.  </li>
            <li> changed my review from one star to 4 with the missing star because of the taste.</li>
            <li> This is money wasted.</li>
            <li> will not buy these again a waste of money for me...</li>
            <li> Can tell a difference after just a few days of use.</li>
            <li> The packaging is not ideal, the strips fall out if you are not careful so can drop on floor, etc.  </li>
            <li> guess what I&#x27;m trying to say is... if you are scared to use a harsh at home teeth whitening kit.  </li>
            <li> I wasted three for every one that I got to work.</li>
            <li> Did not notice any change in a few days...</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t use this product it does nothing but waste your time and money.</li>
            <li> Works within a few applciations.&lt;br /&gt;Apply and go</li>
            <li> Oh well - $15 wasted.</li>
            <li> I was just looking for a few shades whiter</li>
            <li> Impossible!&lt;br /&gt;Have returned to crest strips, as these are seriously frustrating and a total waste of money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen these for sale in years, but when I bought them they were less than $20 for 58 strips!  </li>
            <li> The only thing I recommend is cutting three sides of the packet to prevent tearing when getting the strip out, but I didn&#x27;t feel the need to knock off a star for such a small thing.</li>
            <li> They would rip, tear or just plain not come out no matter what I did.</li>
            <li> main disappointment was the dissolve-time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The strips do have a very slight taste, like the taste in your mouth after you drink milk and wait about two hours.</li>
            <li> Behind my teeth all the residue remains and small white remnants were on the corners of the front of my teeth.</li>
            <li> This was extremely annoying as I had to brush my teeth before the application to provide clean teeth for the strips to adhere to</li>
            <li> a couple of these were dried up when I opened them also :/.</li>
            <li> from few times i did put it on, i noticed a small difference</li>
            <li> Docked it a star because you will lose a couple to a few strips due to sticking to the packaging and tough packaging.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally mystified... and very annoyed that I wasted money on these strips.</li>
            <li> The strips are very delicate and if your fingers are wet the strip will not stick to your teeth.</li>
            <li> The Crest brand is messy and hard to use in my opinion.</li>
            <li> These strips can be difficult to take out of the packaging, but a little patience goes a long way.</li>
            <li> there was a small strip firmly glued to the inside of the packet which was hard to remove and tore.  </li>
            <li> Too bad they don&#x27;t sell it in stores anymore because it really works.</li>
            <li> This has the most disgusting taste ever!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sending these back.. just wrong to throw all strip into a box..</li>
            <li> I do have a problem with getting it to stay on my bottom teeth, since my mouth is rather small.</li>
            <li> They were difficult to apply, they have these tiny notches to show you which teeth</li>
            <li> In others I was not able to find them in the packaging.  </li>
            <li> Well they did work, even faster than Crest and without the pain, weird taste, talking funny, having your mouth look weird and having to remove and rinse the stuff.  </li>
            <li> and I am not pleased.</li>
            <li> teeth are so white&amp;#34; and I got a dental implant and my teeth are so white, when the dentist was trying to match the fake tooth when ordering it, he had to go to &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> They dissolve away in your mouth in about 15 minutes and you don&#x27;t have to brush or rinse if it doesn&#x27;t happen to be convenient, although I usually do rinse.</li>
            <li> im not sure I&#x27;m sold on this.</li>
            <li> I did have a difficult time opening them and getting them on my teeth properly.  </li>
            <li> I do not love the packaging</li>
            <li> As the artificial mint flavor permeates your taste buds, and after checking five times you still feel like you&#x27;ve covered your teeth in wet paper, the dream of whitening loses just a tiny bit of luster.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not using it excessively, twice a day and will discontinue use now that the source of this infection has been found.</li>
            <li> I never had an issue with this product in the past, and not sure why I had this reaction now.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure there is a material change in the color of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I usually wear these while driving to the office</li>
            <li> I usually buy.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll stick with it.</li>
            <li> In the past I used Crest whitening strips, and they were alright..</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has noticeably reduced the amount of staining I usually get on my teeth from drinking coffee.  </li>
            <li> They DO whiten, but just a little ...have used them twice a day for 4-5 days &amp; see a very small difference.</li>
            <li> regardless, I haven&#x27;t seen any improvements and I&#x27;ve already used almost half the strips!!</li>
            <li> epic fail Rembrandt!</li>
            <li> My dentists have advised me that I have thin enamal due to improper/ lack of brushing as a child.  </li>
            <li> These did not work as advertised or at least they are extremely weak compared to other brands that I have tried</li>
            <li> not sure if they chose this for marketing reasons, but it makes it really hard to sometimes stick to your teeth.</li>
            <li> But now, I am unable to eat anything cold or hot without experiencing severe discomfort.</li>
            <li> they are alright at whitening but they are very hard to put on without destroying the.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in any stores</li>
            <li> They are hard to get off of the packaging and sometimes get ripped.</li>
            <li> /&gt;People say they had a hard time opening it.</li>
            <li> I learned the hard way.</li>
            <li> hard to find now.</li>
            <li> The strips were hard to peel off and often ended up melting in my hand.</li>
            <li> Hard to peel.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t agree with the reviews that say these are hard to handle.  </li>
            <li> There are tons of users here that are complaining about how hard they are to use.</li>
            <li> Not that hard...</li>
            <li> People were saying they&#x27;re hard to put on but that is not the case.</li>
            <li> Hard to beat.</li>
            <li> Strips are too hard to get out without breaking them.</li>
            <li> they are too hard to put on.  </li>
            <li> But, placing them on my teeth is really hard.  </li>
            <li> with the little notch going behind my teeth.</li>
            <li> Frustrating rip -off with little whitening power.</li>
            <li> They were so delicate and hard to handle.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: almost 3 weeks of using these I see VERY LITTLE results as far as whitening :-(</li>
            <li> I use the strips at least twice a year.</li>
            <li> these strips might work, but i will never know because they are SO delicate</li>
            <li> They dissolve away in 10-15 minutes and do not leave an icky taste.  </li>
            <li> and I had to brush my teeth or at least vigorously rinse my mouth to get out the residue.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ruin at least one every time I use them.</li>
            <li> And the strips cover at least 8 of my teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I am slowly seeing the results.</li>
            <li> Extremely difficult (for me) to wriggle out the clear thin plastic working strip from its thin plastic container.  </li>
            <li> You know what I mean.  </li>
            <li> Since they are difficult to use, I&#x27;m not consistent with using them.</li>
            <li> I purchased these because they were less expensive</li>
            <li> The strip then self-destructs, pulling into little shards and clumping up in random places.</li>
            <li> They feel really gross when they are on your teeth and leave a bad aftertaste in your mouth though.</li>
            <li> Removing the excess is a bit awkward due to the texture of the strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> disappointed that I can&#x27;t find them in store or online and called the customer service for Rembrandt and basically got told they are just simply discontinued and not under any othe Brand!</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth, and they&#x27;re difficult to apply without sticking to my lips.  </li>
            <li> very difficult to apply ...tends to get glued to other parts of the mouth, lips or tongue and dislocate from the teeth.</li>
            <li> My mouth felt numb and my lips felt like they were stretch a tad too tightly.</li>
            <li> What a WASTE of $$$$!!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s tedious, slightly uncomfortable, and a little gross.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I saw minimal results (though my teeth weren&#x27;t too bad to begin with).</li>
            <li> The strips dissolved poorly.</li>
            <li> I found spitting out the saliva buildup frustrating until I began applying them before getting in the shower, as someone suggested in the reviews.</li>
            <li> As the strips dissolve they leave behind a plastic film in my saliva.  </li>
            <li> had switched for a while to the whitening that comes in a syringe with molding trays but those were the worse for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know if they whiten or not they taste too terrible to leave them in your mouth over 5 seconds,</li>
            <li> And because the product works slowly, over the course of 2 weeks... I feel like if something were to go wrong...</li>
            <li> Unlike Crest, they don&#x27;t leave behind a film that you have to peel off.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money - you will get 56 packages but they are all EMPTY - what a waste of money !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1</li>
            <li> On one hand I like the Rembrandt strips, but on the other I am disappointed with the packaging issues.</li>
            <li> Too difficult to apply, poor directions!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A little disappointed, probably would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, but these users are simply not very bright.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> .. wrong</li>
            <li> they go on &amp; were difficult to see &amp; place.</li>
            <li> Instead they appeared to be stuck in the packaging material and extremely difficult to see or remove.  </li>
            <li> They also have a weird taste that takes some getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> morning after, I woke up and immediately sensed that something was wrong.</li>
            <li> It was the least painful solution.</li>
            <li> If would recomend this product to anyone who is skeptical of whitening strips just because they are inexpensive and if you don&#x27;t like them you aren&#x27;t out $50 like you would be using Crest strips.</li>
            <li> Utterly useless.</li>
            <li> Added to this, the strips are extremely difficult to remove from the packaging.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it looks like they are now discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> Worked well, but takes longer to dissolve than what it says on the box and leaves a weird taste in your mouth.</li>
            <li> THE WRONG PART OF YOUR TEETH, REQUIRED SKILLS</li>
            <li> I am not impressed with these &amp; would not buy them again.</li>
            <li> Whitening strips were fused to the foil wrapper, rendering them useless.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Rembrandt.</li>
            <li> Potentially the worst packaging of strips</li>
            <li> For the people who say they rip when you try to take them out of the foil, what are you doing wrong?</li>
            <li> I had read online that they are difficult to get out of the package without breaking.</li>
            <li> The strips are very thin and conform to every surface of the teeth.  </li>
            <li> I find these difficult to use - especially hard to locate and remove from the foil packet without pulling or tearing them, which the instructions warn you not to do.  </li>
            <li> The are hard to get out of packet and they are impossible to stick!</li>
            <li> My teeth were awful and so grossly yellow that I couldn&#x27;t even wear lipstick because it just made them look bad.</li>
            <li> And they leave a horrible filmy mess on your teeth until you brush it off with your tooth brush.</li>
            <li> The film doesn&#x27;t taste bad but its uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> No ice cream or anything cold for me either.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t really cutting it</li>
            <li> However, the horribly yellowed tops of my front lower teeth are so pale now that I don&#x27;t mind laughing since doing so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mad at myself because the Crest whitening kit had reduced in price</li>
            <li> They taste like mint, by the way---not unpleasant at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a very difficult time putting these on.  </li>
            <li> Very frustrating!</li>
            <li> A very uncomfortable feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s almost impossible to get them onto your teeth.</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> Also they don&#x27;t taste bad, they don&#x27;t burn my gums &amp; they dissolve, saving you from peeling them off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a REALLY bad taste.</li>
            <li> I like how it dissolves, the taste isn&#x27;t too bad,</li>
            <li> Was hesitant because some reviews were bad and the competitions</li>
            <li> The taste isn&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li> mentioned reasons, either price is prohibitive, teeth in pain, shifting and bunching or bad taste.</li>
            <li> the taste is so bad you have to keep spitting it out, so</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a drastic whitening change, but not as bad as the paint on whitening brushes i&#x27;ve used before.  </li>
            <li> a bad combo for putting on whitening strips.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed  to see.. that all the strips were tossed into the box.. with directions..</li>
            <li> I was highly disappointed when Target quit carrying them.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I was disappointed in my purchase.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It feels as if my gums recede all the way to the base of my teeth as my teeth simultaneously crack.</li>
            <li> This product is worthless.</li>
            <li> It is SO annoying.</li>
            <li> I AM an idiot.</li>
            <li> so you won&#x27;t have annoying residue during the day.</li>
            <li> Kinda disappointed in that since I wanted to wear them to school in the morning!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED.  </li>
            <li> Tastes terrible.</li>
            <li> DO NOT put them on your gums because it will burn them (very painful !).  </li>
            <li> Absolutely a terrible product.</li>
            <li> Worst strips ever.  </li>
            <li> : terrible chemical taste.</li>
            <li> I would rather use strips that you have to take off because these taste TERRIBLE.</li>
            <li> this is the worst teeth whitening product I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> they have a horrible flavor and the fact that they dissolve in your mouth</li>
            <li> is disgusting.  </li>
            <li> Horrible packaging.</li>
            <li> Terrible product.</li>
            <li> and if i did find this product, the price was outrageous.  </li>
            <li> and they tasted horrible!!</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
            <li> Rips and sticks to the side and tastes disgusting.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Not like going to the dentist for a pro job but these do work great and are easy to use.</li>
            <li> Delivery of the product was quick.  The only thing that didn&#x27;t make me happy was that the expiration date on the box is 12/2014.</li>
            <li> I have such sensitive teeth that using other white strips after one use usually leaves me in such pain I can&#x27;t eat. I used to buy these at cvs from listerine and when I realized Rembrandt bought them out I literally only buy this specific one from Amazon. They are amazing. They dissolve completely so I don&#x27;t have to further agitate my teeth by peeling them off and they really are sooooo gentle. I have had no problems with these whatsoever and have been faithfully using this brand for years. Also I am a heaaaavvy tea drinker and these keep my teeth looking awesome!</li>
            <li> Love these strips.  They don&#x27;t hurt my teeth like most other strips do.</li>
            <li> I wore them as instructed and only noticed my teeth whiten a bit, I&#x27;m not impressed. I usually buy the plus white whitening gel and put it in my retainers and that seems to work better for me, and is cheaper.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice a huge difference but very easy to use.  I love the fact that it dissolves in your mouth.</li>
            <li> Tastes terrible. Gives me a stomachache</li>
            <li> I pure chased these based on other positive reviews.  I was not disappointed!  These strips are very easy to use. I didn&#x27;t experience any issues getting them out of the package that others reported.  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have used these strips before and I got results pretty fast.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about them is that when I use them for the first treatment, my teeth become extremely sensitive and HURT after a few minutes when the strip is applied.  After that first use, they dont hurt as much.  DO NOT put them on your gums because it will burn them (very painful !).  Overall though I would give this product a 9/10.  Much more affordable than the Crest White Strips !</li>
            <li> This has the most disgusting taste ever!!!!!!!! It feels as though you vomited in your mouth while they are dissolving.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until about the time I had finished with the whole box that I started noticing a difference, but that&#x27;s OK.  Results are results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main disappointment was the dissolve-time.  Box says 5-10 minutes to dissolve.  I have a 45 minute drive to work, and they don&#x27;t get dissolved in that time.  It was always a good hour or so for me.  So, I started just using them at night.  I&#x27;d put them on, read for about an hour, and notice there was still about 10% remaining when I turned out the light.  Not a hassle since I used them this way.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and not too much discomfort.  I could notice a difference with my teeth after using just a few times.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed  to see.. that all the strips were tossed into the box.. with directions.. no box as seen in picture.. when I open the directions.. there was an expired coupon from 2014. I&#x27;m sending these back.. just wrong to throw all strip into a box.. I&#x27;m thinking these strips were definitely  expired. .. wrong</li>
            <li> The strips always wrinkled up before I could get them on my gums. It could have been my technique, but I&#x27;m not buying again. Though I love Rembrandt toothpaste and mouthwash.</li>
            <li> These are amazing! I love to drink iced coffee so I like to use these every couple months to keep my teeth nice and white. I find that they work much better than the 2 hour whitening tray treatment by Rembrandt and cause less tooth sensitivity than the trays. They dissolve in about 7 minutes or so which is really nice because you can use them quickly while you&#x27;re getting ready in the morning and theres no globby tray to clean or strips to remove- they&#x27;re hassle free! The packages are a little hard to open but I just keep a pair of little beauty scissors nearby.</li>
            <li> Absolutely a terrible product. The strips could not be removed from the individual packs, appeared to be dried out. I tried 4 packs with the same result. Your teeth will fall out from old age before you can whiten them.</li>
            <li> Quality product &amp; excellent service. Chiaroscuro. I get what they were getting at when they chose his name for their teeth-whitening products. Much more fun than brushing with horseradish.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use. Seeing an improvement after only a few days of use.</li>
            <li> Having never used any other whitening strips, I&#x27;m not sure how it stacks up against them as far as whitening goes.  I noticed a slight change but not as much as I was hoping for.  Not being a coffee or wine drinker nor a smoker may contribute to their lack of effectiveness as I don&#x27;t have much in the way of stains or yellowing to correct, but I was hoping for a brighter, more noticeable white.  I am going to try a second box and see if the problem was my expectations or the product itself.  If each box gives a few shades of white, resulting in a cumulative whitening effect, it would be worth it at this price to buy several boxes, so we&#x27;ll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do dissolve after about 10 minutes and you just have to rinse or brush to get the last remnants of the taste of the strip out of your mouth, which is pretty convenient.  Not unhappy with my purchase, was just expecting more given some of the other reviews.</li>
            <li> Work well but taste a little funny</li>
            <li> Worst strips ever.  Gave up after 3.  At first it looked like the packets were empty but no - on closer inspection there was a small strip firmly glued to the inside of the packet which was hard to remove and tore.  Difficult to fit.  Tasted vile and did nothing.  I&#x27;m sticking to Crest White Strips.  In fact I don&#x27;t think this product can even be purchased anymore.</li>
            <li> great buy for the price</li>
            <li> liked these, bottom strip much larger than crest white  strips</li>
            <li> These suck-I have been using them for 2 months and have not noticed any difference at all- Used other brands previously which were much better and noticeable difference- Also just unwrapping them is a pain, the packaging it crappy and 25% of the time the strip rips while you are trying to remove it from it&#x27;s package..I expect far better from Rembrandt-save your money and use other well known brands</li>
            <li> Love these teeth strips!</li>
            <li> I love that these strips dissolve on your teeth! Easy to use &amp;#34;on-the-go&amp;#34;. You&#x27;ll start to see differences in about a week...</li>
            <li> Its a good product, I especially like how it just dissolves away. I do have a problem with getting it to stay on my bottom teeth, since my mouth is rather small. But glad to use it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Please note that rating it okay means that it&#x27;s good, but I&#x27;m not sure any products truly whiten teeth like they claim. I&#x27;ve used up almost the whole package after 3 months. When I opened the first two packages, I thought the strips were missing - they are clear, stuck to the foil, and pretty difficult to see if you happen to not be wearing your glasses. Super easy to apply, and plenty of room to wrap all the way from below your gums up over the tooth. The wraps cover all the teeth visible when I smile; I recall that Crest&#x27;s were just a little too short so this is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strips do have a very slight taste, like the taste in your mouth after you drink milk and wait about two hours. Faintly sour, nothing overwhelming, definitely does not stop me from using them. I do get some excess saliva when using, and so as another reviewer suggests I just wear them while doing my morning beauty routine and the sink&#x27;s right there. Love that the strips just dissolve away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now whiteness...my teeth are yellowed from tea and I don&#x27;t know what, food I guess. Not badly, but I see it. I have seen a slight difference in the whiteness (comparing to a back tooth that doesn&#x27;t get whitened). Yes, there is definite improvement, but it&#x27;s pretty slight. Maybe I should have used them daily instead of 3-4 times a week, or maybe I consume food too soon after using? I will try them again just to see if they can get my teeth even whiter, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re worth the effort currently.</li>
            <li> These work great for the price. I think other brands (crest) may work faster but I am slowly seeing the results.</li>
            <li> Just started using it.  It&#x27;s great so far.  Lightened my teeth a little after just one use.  I used it twice before my sisters wedding and my teeth looked great in all the photos.</li>
            <li> This is the best value I have found for this kind of product. I love that they don&#x27;t burn my gums like many other of this kind and they definitely make my teeth brighter.</li>
            <li> They are okay. I didn&#x27;t see a huge difference but I really wasn&#x27;t expecting anyhing. The reason I&#x27;m giving 3 stars is because they didn&#x27;t dissolve. I waited over an hour and then removed them with a paper towel. Kinda disappointed in that since I wanted to wear them to school in the morning!</li>
            <li> Great well worth the money.my grandson loves this book and Thomas.I&#x27;m  planning buying more Thomas products from Amazon great online shopping I&#x27;m never dissapointed</li>
            <li> These did not work as advertised or at least they are extremely weak compared to other brands that I have tried</li>
            <li> I really like these Rembrant strips. I won&#x27;t ever go back to using the more expensive whitening products! They don&#x27;t work as well to me as the Rembrant nor are they as cost effective as the Rembrandt. I like the way I can just leave them on and they dissolve and then brush the rest of the it off too!</li>
            <li> Great product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> There are 56 strips, which is actually 28 applications.  However, the directions tell you to use them 2 times per day, so there are actually 14 days worth.  At that price, the Crest Strips are actually less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are less powerful than the Crest strips.  That is obvious to the user over a week&#x27;s use.  Which means they are even MORE expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others reviewers note, the strips tear easily, and if you don&#x27;t open the packages VERY carefully, you might tear a strip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the concept of dissolving strips, but with the price/performance results, I&#x27;ll be going back to Crest.  Too bad.</li>
            <li> Works well if you follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know if these work effectively to whiten teeth, because they upset my stomach and nauseated me. I used them for two days and will throw out the remaining product.</li>
            <li> The only whiting strips easy to use and effective!!</li>
            <li> used for the first 2 weeks..very good! but seems that after awhile it doesn&#x27;t go much better ... the results wont improve much more after 3 weeks!</li>
            <li> Hmmm trying to figure these out. My teeth were not particularly yellow but just not sparkly white so thought I&#x27;d give these a try. Hard to open, just sealed very tightly &amp; if you tear the tiny packaging on these the wrong way they either don&#x27;t open or you tear the strip itself..a couple of these were dried up when I opened them also :/. They DO whiten, but just a little ...have used them twice a day for 4-5 days &amp; see a very small difference. Also they don&#x27;t taste bad, they don&#x27;t burn my gums &amp; they dissolve, saving you from peeling them off. So there are positives to these strips. They were difficult to apply, they have these tiny notches to show you which teeth they go on &amp; were difficult to see &amp; place. Also a couple of these dissolved partially by the time I applied or AS I was applying so DEF not whitestrips..next time I&#x27;ll order something else but for now these will do, I guess....</li>
            <li> Please ring this product back! Great value and excellent product!</li>
            <li> The strips are very delicate and if your fingers are wet the strip will not stick to your teeth. I  noticed a difference in whiter teeth quickly at first and then not much more improvement.</li>
            <li> a lot of strips..&lt;br /&gt;Pros: gradually whitens teeth if used daily for 5days straight. Does not make teeth sensitive nor appear see through.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: terrible chemical taste. I could not keep it in my mouth for the directed time.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves a very gooey slimed film on teeth, took both 2 cycles brushing and gargling to remove film and taste.</li>
            <li> My first box of Rembrandt Strips worked fine, but the second box I have had problems with.  Some of the strips in the second box did not come of of the packaging easily as was the case of my first box.  Instead they appeared to be stuck in the packaging material and extremely difficult to see or remove.  In some cases by the time I removed them they were rip or torn and in some cases nearly unusable.  In others I was not able to find them in the packaging.  I don&#x27;t know why this would happen as it did.  At the cost of a box of strips this should not happen.  I have mixed feelings because of this.  On one hand I like the Rembrandt strips, but on the other I am disappointed with the packaging issues.</li>
            <li> been only using it for 1 week, it did whitened my teeth a little...though not as much as i would have like...&lt;br /&gt;it takes a while to dissolve too. Manual says it only takes about 5-10 min to dissolve completely, but mine took well over 30 min for it to dissolve, good thing the taste isnt all that bad</li>
            <li> Works! Just give it some time</li>
            <li> I have &#x27;candy corn&#x27; teeth - basically, it&#x27;s very yellow towards the gumline and lightens as it reaches the far end of the teeth. My dentist told me it&#x27;s from antibiotics that stained my teeth when I was young.  of course I don&#x27;t remember, but anyway, no matter how much I brush my teeth I never got the whiteness I wanted, and all it did was eroded my gumline from years of brushing too hard to try to achieve my white teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the Crest strips in the past and those things made my teeth so sensitive I couldn&#x27;t even breathe without my teeth being in pain, so I avoided whitening strips altogether.  I gave the Rembrandt a try based on the positive reviews here and I am very happy with the product.  No sensitivity, I noticed an improvement right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As mentioned by others, it is a little difficult to open the individual strips from its wrapping, but I&#x27;ve learned to estimate the size of the actual strips inside the wrapping, so I just cut the edges off and am able to get to the strips far more easily.  As far as whiteness goes, my teeth still aren&#x27;t pearly whites (nor did I expect them to be), I can still notice the candy corn effect on my teeth, but they are lessened, so I am happy.  I can&#x27;t expect a roughly $20 product to get rid of years of stained teeth, but for the price and the result I&#x27;ve seen, I&#x27;d say the product worked to the best of its ability.</li>
            <li> Great over the counter whitening system.</li>
            <li> It is awkward to put the strips in at first but you get used to it after a couple of times. It is a mild whitener and does not hurt you gums.</li>
            <li> They are amazing. I love how well they stick to my teeth. Very easy to use. They did make my gums a little sore so when you put them on try to get them mostly on your teeth. Had a kind of strange taste when dissolving. I had to rinse my mouth out after. So far I love them.</li>
            <li> whiter teeth :) i have sensitive teeth but this is great! no pain!</li>
            <li> I love this product because it is so easy to use. I brush my teeth in the morning and then just throw the strips on while I&#x27;m in the shower.  By the time I get out, they&#x27;re mostly dissolved.  I can definitely see a difference in the whiteness level of my teeth.</li>
            <li> The films completely melted on to the packaging LONG BEFORE I EVEN GOT THEM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somewhere down the line, the item was probably placed somewhere super hot.&lt;br /&gt;Cant used them now.. waste of money. Just go buy from a store.</li>
            <li> I love these whitening strips.  Perfect for those who don&#x27;t have perfectly straight teeth. I highly recommend  this product.</li>
            <li> very useful, just one week you will see the difference!!! love this product.&lt;br /&gt;recommend it to my friends and parents</li>
            <li> Better instruction needed and bleaching</li>
            <li> these certainly whiten and make your teeth appear clean a good quick fix! not professional but close enough for a day to day basis and easy on your teeth enamel</li>
            <li> Works Great !  I&#x27;ve tried more expensive brands like Crest but don&#x27;t get the results I want. I&#x27;m a smoker and these work great !  Rembrandts are great because the dissolve in your mouth. I put &#x27;em on before I take my pre-work nap, get up and brush my teeth to remove any residue and I&#x27;m ready to go!  Also, no teeth-sensitivity to deal with. You must read instructions as the strips must go on in a certain direction. Their dry right out of the box, not slimy like other brands  Hard to find in any stores so I&#x27;m very happy to order them here</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen these for sale in years, but when I bought them they were less than $20 for 58 strips!  At $129 and up, I&#x27;ll just say &#x27;no thanks&#x27; and continue to use the older ones (my last box has an expiration date of March 2013, but they still work like a charm).  I had no idea there were any other brands on the market (and don&#x27;t much care, either).  But, if you read the box before using, you&#x27;ll find instructions to put them on the lower teeth first -- that&#x27;s b/c your salivary glands are down there and you would have an awfully hard time putting the top ones on first and then fighting all that saliva!  Bottom line:  I love them, but not at their latest price.  If I ever find them again at a fair price, I&#x27;ll certainly stock up again.</li>
            <li> I can tell these work as they do whiten your teeth, but getting them on your teeth is another story. They stick to everything. Literally everything. You&#x27;d best have a friend put them on for you or something because this is not a one man job.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm for removing daily coffee stains.  I don&#x27;t think it would really bring your teeth up several shades though.  I like that they take about 15 minutes to dissolve — but you do need to brush your teeth after or you have filmy teeth.</li>
            <li> I found these at Walmart for 20 bucks. I usually use Crest white strips but this time I was strapped for cash.  I bought these for 14 dollars less, convinced they wouldnt work. Well they did work, even faster than Crest and without the pain, weird taste, talking funny, having your mouth look weird and having to remove and rinse the stuff.  It was the opposite.  I only whiten twice a year, since colgate advanced clean toothpaste with the sandy stuff keeps my teeth pretty clean. I used to whiten just once a year but I drink more coffee now to reduce my appetite, so now my bi annual whitening will be with Rembrandt!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used for a few days now and have noticed a slight difference (I took a before picture to compare).  Couple of things to note:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- For me, these things do not dissolve in 10 mins, much less 5.  Easily 30 mins and I still have to brush off the excess.  So unless I let my mouth pool with saliva, I don&#x27;t see how these things can possibly dissolve in the time they claim.  But maybe that&#x27;s a good thing as they spend more time on your teeth cleaning them.  Who knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- For the people who are packet challenged, gotta think outside the packet, literally.  After you zip open the top, look at either side of the packet.  One side has a thicker seal than the other.  All you do is tear open the thinner seal, then you can simply tear down the length of the packet, leaving the strip completely exposed for easy extraction.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really like these. They are hard to get off of the packaging and sometimes get ripped. And they leave a horrible filmy mess on your teeth until you brush it off with your tooth brush. Oh wee ;-( Back to crest strips!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using thsee for 3 days and I am not pleased. The strips tear when you try to remove them from the packaging.  They stick to the inside of your lips and when you move it pulls the strip, now balled up goo, off your teeth. No wonder Crest is the leader in this market. Will not be buying these again.</li>
            <li> They whiten ok.....but absolutely a pain in the ass to open the package and then get them on your teeth properly. Pay the extra ten to twenty bucks and get the crest whitestrips. They work so much better and are easier to use.</li>
            <li> I used these strips with crest whitening toothpaste &amp; whitening mouthwash for faster and noticeable results. My teeth weren&#x27;t as white as I wanted them,so I bought these. There is mostly hydrogen peroxide in here so it is very bubbly. It does burn if you have an open sore on your gums. When I first used these I saw little results, but with continued used I did start seeing results. I noticed my teeth getting whiter and brighter. I used these twice a day,brushing my teeth twice a day, as well as flossing twice a day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these a couple times. I noticed a difference after the first treatment. The strips are a little unpleasant to get off if you want to do a shorter treatment, and the strips only cover the front teeth, what you would see when you smile. I do wish the strips were longer but overall I do like them.</li>
            <li> These strips do the job and so easy! I have loved these strips since finding them in our local Walmart store but they no longer carry them:( Can always count on Amazon to offer up everything I want :)&lt;br /&gt;Still had some but they were outdated and no longer removed easily from foil and even if they did they no longer worked so need more. happy to find them.&lt;br /&gt;If you want an easy way to whiten then these strips are it! They disolve quickly and after just one use see a big difference.....</li>
            <li> they work well, and do not bother my sensitive teeth as much as crest whitestrips. I like to use them during the day because they dissolve.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even write about effectiveness cuz they taste so bad I couldn&#x27;t use them more than 2 times! It&#x27;s a REALLY bad taste. Also the strips cannot be moved once placed on ur teeth so u have to be really careful before it even touches one tooth or it creates mess.</li>
            <li> I started this last night.  I like how it dissolves, the taste isn&#x27;t too bad, a little bleachy, I like how it foams in my mouth too.  Super easy to use and I saw a difference in 1 use.</li>
            <li> Seems to work great as my teeth are brighter but not amazing like the Crest whitening strips. This comes with more and is cheaper though so I might just use these in the long run.</li>
            <li> I noticed results after 1 week. Inexpensive and fast delivery and it dissolves so I can put it in and leave for work and by the time I get to work it is completely dissolved</li>
            <li> I ordered this product as a cheap alternative to the crest whitening strips, They are OK... they work but the stips do not dissolve fully as they should. Removing the excess is a bit awkward due to the texture of the strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall.. worth the money in that they do indeed whiten your teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 76 years old. My teeth were taking on a light mahogany color (ick!). The very first application of the strips showed a remarkable improvement! After four days of 2-times-a-day applications I&#x27;m pleased at the continued whitening but my teeth are probably not going to get much whiter. Remains to be seen. As far as using this product: READ THE INSTRUCTIONS PEOPLE! It&#x27;s very simple. The strips are tasty and caused me not the slightest irritation. Considering the ease of use and my satisfaction thus far I think this is a nice, reasonably priced product. I&#x27;ve never tried any other whitening product so I can&#x27;t make a comparison.</li>
            <li> This is very affordable and easy to use it.  In a week you can see the effects.  I love it and am planning to purchase more.</li>
            <li> I love these.  They melt on your teeth like the old listermint breath strips.  Put them on, forget about them and next thing you know they are gone.  Unlike Crest strips that get slimmy and you have to slid them off your teeth at the prescribed time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People are ALWAYS commenting..... &amp;#34;your teeth are so white&amp;#34; and I got a dental implant and my teeth are so white, when the dentist was trying to match the fake tooth when ordering it, he had to go to &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; teeth samples to find the color!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I cut each strip lengthwise and put the narrow half on the bottom teeth and the slightly wider half on the top.  I only use them for a month  and then every now and then and they stay white</li>
            <li> they work, but they stick to the wrapper and tear</li>
            <li> I have only used them twice so far and a friend of mine commented on how white my teeth are. I like that it&#x27;s only a 10 minute thing, unlike Crest Whitestrips that take about a half hour.</li>
            <li> These Rembrandt strips stick to everything but your teeth &amp; disinigrates in seconds. Complete rip off &amp; huge dissapointment as I&#x27;ve always heard that Rembrandt is a high quality product.</li>
            <li> I wish I had the attention span to use these for the whole two weeks, but I don&#x27;t. I was definitely seeing results but I forgot to use them for a while and discovered I still have a half box. Yay me, I still have half a box!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite what others have said, I have absolutely no issue getting the strips out of the foil.</li>
            <li> Seems to be doing a nice job.</li>
            <li> Worked great, noticeable whitening, the dissolving backer made them much easier to use than other whiteners I have tried, just put them on and go, no waiting to take them off and throw away to backer, normally I would put them on and go to sleep, worked great.</li>
            <li> Easy to use (contrary to some reviews) but what good is that if they don&#x27;t remove stains or yellowing on the teeth? I did not notice any difference on my teeth, after using the whole package diligently (twice a day as instructed)</li>
            <li> I compare this product to dissolvable toilet paper that is used for camping. You don&#x27;t want it to dissolve too fast or you&#x27;ll end up with a mess on your hands. This product sticks to your fingers rather than your teeth. It&#x27;s as if the strips start dissolving and sticking to your fingers before you can even get them in your mouth. Luckily there are 56 of them, so you can try and try again to get one on straight.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for the past week and half,and i just love it.  I have also been using Rembrandt tooth paste.</li>
            <li> I reaaly liked the ease of use and the results these strips gave me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used any other kind but these do make a difference, and they are pretty easy to use. They dissolve away in your mouth in about 15 minutes and you don&#x27;t have to brush or rinse if it doesn&#x27;t happen to be convenient, although I usually do rinse. I brush before using them.</li>
            <li> These are the first white strips I&#x27;ve ever used, and I really like them. I&#x27;ve used one whole box now, and I can say my teeth are definitely one shade at the least brighter/whiter.&lt;br /&gt;(For the record: I have pretty sensitive teeth(to cold) and didn&#x27;t notice any increased sensitivity. I&#x27;m also a heavy coffee/tea drinker.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like that they dissolve and you don&#x27;t have to take them out after some odd minutes, but they do not completely dissolve like you&#x27;d think- they do leave a film on your teeth but it&#x27;s easily brushed off with a toothbrush. I&#x27;d give 4.5 stars if I could because of that, but otherwise I&#x27;d recommend them completely.</li>
            <li> I give these a 4 star only because I have used other whiteneing strips that I like better.  These are thin, but still easy to use. They are not as strong as others I have used, but they will take off daily coffee buildup, or other stains that natural foods can give anyones teeth. I would buy them again, but only for a daily use, not for whitening  the teeth intensely.</li>
            <li> be careful when using this if you have sensitive teeth or dont leave it on for a long period of time</li>
            <li> This product is good.</li>
            <li> im not sure I&#x27;m sold on this. we tried this and i haven&#x27;t seen a noticeable enough difference for me to give it any more than three stars. and the box is almost empty so...</li>
            <li> These used to be sold by Listerine as their dissolving strips, and I couldn&#x27;t find those anymore after a few years of not using them, I thought they had been taken off the market but nope it looks like Rembrandt picked up on these awesome things. 14 days and you will have ABSOLUTELY without A SHADOW OF A DOUBT, noticeably whiter teeth, even after just 4 or 5 days you&#x27;ll notice something, and by day 14 you&#x27;re gonna be getting compliments. I bought these recently to whiten my teeth after a few years after using the Listerine version, and I went through 2 boxes of the listerine and my mom was like &amp;#34;Woah! Your teeth! When did they get so white?! they&#x27;re almost... TOO WHITE!&amp;#34; That was when I knew i should stop and be satisfied with my white teeth, and they&#x27;ve been white ever since. These things are powerful using dental grade activated peroxide, which is safe orally and can be swallowed because it converts into Oxygen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To address those of you who cannot open the individual strip packaging.. its extremely easy. There are tear notches all around the product, with DRY Hands tear the LENGTH wise side all the way across, then tear the WIDTH Side on either side, you don&#x27;t need to do both but you can, then WALLAH! Full access to the strip, just make sure your hands ARE DRY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super easy to apply, and the rest is history.</li>
            <li> Not as harsh on your teeth/gums/enamel, but works. Your teeth will be whiter, but very marginally since the strips aren&#x27;t as harsh/strong as other brands.</li>
            <li> they are alright at whitening but they are very hard to put on without destroying the. not just that, they are hard to get all the residue off when you are done too, not the best strips out there but they arent super expensive either. you really get what you pay for</li>
            <li> great product. quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Waste of money. I noticed no difference in my teeth after using these. Very disappointed. Do not order.</li>
            <li> I used em all as directed. After about two or three days of coffee etc.... teeth were back to less than white. Great to use for short term WOW.</li>
            <li> These worked... Not an intense change, but my teeth felt cleaner.  They dissolved easily and quickly.  They are easy to use.</li>
            <li> This product provided the results I would have expected and the price was was the best I found anywhere online</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s because people had worse teeth back then. Or he painted English people alot. They could really use this product there. Especially if it helped to straighten crooked teeth. Have you been there. Those people smile with their mouhts closed. Keep a stiff upper lip is a great statement for the English, it helps hide those crooked chompers.</li>
            <li> I use these about once a year, they work well, not too harsh and not overly whirring so you look freaky. I usually wear them too bed or while working out, I love love them!  My teeth look brighter, and clean, and very very naturally white, not at all fake.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I ordered this item.  First time was fantastic which is why I ordered it again.  This time they must be old or expired. Cannot get the strips out of the individual packing without them ripping and when you put them on your teeth, they do not stick because what glue there is on them sticks to your fingers.  VERY DISAPPOINTED.  Should ask for refund.  Don&#x27;t think I will reorder again.</li>
            <li> Instantly I got results with this product. I agree with other users that it is nice to brush teeth after use. They really do work wonderfully. Instant results with no burning, and no weird flavor. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I am into my first week using these strips and I already see solid results. They are difficult to stick to bottom teeth for some reasonably they work beautifully on the top ones. Generally speaking i have VERY sensitive teeth and can never use any of these products. but then I learned that if I brush my teeth first with Sensodyne or a similar product I can then apply these strip with absolutely no sensitivity during or after the application.</li>
            <li> The strips worked great for the front of my teeth, but unfortunately did not reach in between my teeth. This left white teeth with stains in the middle and in now looks like I have things stuck in between my teeth :( Gotta fix this somehow</li>
            <li> This was product was very easy to use, and didn&#x27;t cause me any teeth sensitivity,but the results were good, not great. I had mild whitening, but not as extreme as other whiteners, but they caused sensitivity so I would rather use this as a safer dental choice.</li>
            <li> I did have a difficult time opening them and getting them on my teeth properly.  It&#x27;s a little time consuming.  You have to be careful when opening the package not to rip the strip. Also, make sure your mouth is very moist when applying them or they stick to your gums and lips before you can apply them.  Whitened well.</li>
            <li> Great whiting kit. I used both boxes and once done I was in Hollywood before I knew it. I had people chase me down just for a photo. All cause I hide blinding white teeth. I am now heavy into the scene. Lost my family, kids, and on a big addiction I rather not mention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good while it lasted.</li>
            <li> Good price and actually work.  Was hesitant because some reviews were bad and the competitions so, so much more but I&#x27;m very happy with these.</li>
            <li> I usually use the Crest Gentle Routine but they were sold out. These are definitely a worthy replacement! They did not bother my sensitive teeth at all. They did bother my gums a bit about a week in but I just took a break for a couple days and it was fine. They didn&#x27;t seem to whiten quite as well as the Crest but I liked that I only had to use them for 2 weeks instead of a month. They do take quite a bit longer to dissolve than 5-10 minutes but that didn&#x27;t bother me. I put them on before bed and went to sleep with no problems in the morning. For the morning routine I just put them on before the shower and they were pretty much dissolved by the time I got out. I will definitely get them again!</li>
            <li> The strips dissolved poorly. It took over 40 mins and left gunk in my mouth. My teeth only whitened slightly but no significant change. I was dissatisfied with the results and wouldn&#x27;t purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> When first starting, be sure to follow the directions to use them 2x a day - this is very important if you really want them to work for you. When that time is over, just use them 1x each day - I use them after I am done eating or drinking anything for the day (except water) and at the end of my night ablutions. They REALLY DO WORK on surface stains from coffee, cigarettes, et al. I&#x27;ve smoked for 40 years and have 2 mugs of coffee each morning. These strips, by following the directions, took the stains AWAY and keeps new stains from forming!!! I am greatly impressed and have used them for months now. When putting them on, though, I carefully do it by putting the strip on one tooth and then carefully and gently push it between two teeth as far as possible without ripping the strip, cover the next tooth, then carefully and gently push it between two teeth, and etc.(starting with a front tooth and going back on one side of the array of teeth and then continuing with the other side) thereby getting at the stains between the front teeth. I have not, however, been able to get rid of one stain between two of my teeth, but it is too deep of a stain, going down layers into the tooth, for anything to remove it. However, the horribly yellowed tops of my front lower teeth are so pale now that I don&#x27;t mind laughing since doing so does show that area of our teeth that otherwise we can hide. So, if you are young, before deep stains set in, use these strips NOW so you won&#x27;t end up with stains too deep to get rid of. For older people, I am in my 50s and my teeth are whiter than they have been for a good 20+ years!!! I have tried other strips, gooey trays, and even this awful stuff you brush on your teeth and have to hold your lips back for over several minutes while it dries - NONE of those worked at all and were, for the most part, messy, expensive, and quite a hassle. In addition, it is important to use these strips daily. After the first 2 weeks of use, the price per day is very negligible and is so very worth spending on THESE Rembrandt Intense Stain Dissolving Strips.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product twice. Its an affordable easy way to whiten teeth. I do not love the packaging so I gave it 4 stars. Sometimes the strips tear while removing them from plastic or placing them on teeth. Be careful. Otherwise they whiten nicely and are more affordable then other whitening products on the Market. Overall satisfied/good purchase.</li>
            <li> I thought it would whiten much more quickly but I think I will go back to crest strips. These tear so easily and then i end up wasting one each time i try to whiten.</li>
            <li> I saw minimal results (though my teeth weren&#x27;t too bad to begin with). The certainly DO NOT dissolve in 5-10 minutes. This morning I put them on before I got in my car for work. My commute is around a 1/2 hour. I got to work and it still hasn&#x27;t dissolved. They also have a weird taste that takes some getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People say they had a hard time opening it. I understand why but here&#x27;s a tip. Open the ENTIRE strip. Take the side that doesn&#x27;t have the strip on it completely off. In the reviews it seems as if some people were trying to slip it out of the packaging. It&#x27;s sticky. That won&#x27;t work without tearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the box they tell you not to run your tongue across it. Good luck with that. It&#x27;s almost impossible for your tongue not to involuntarily want to touch something on your teeth for 10 or more minutes. Not unless you&#x27;re used to have stuff stuck in your teeth. I finally got used to it and can sort of resist the urge but now, every time I use them, my lips get incredibly chapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I would not recommend these and would not purchase them again. I&#x27;m mad at myself because the Crest whitening kit had reduced in price and I didn&#x27;t get it because I had just bought these and wanted to see the results. I&#x27;ll just have to suck it up and pay the extra $.</li>
            <li> I would rather use strips that you have to take off because these taste TERRIBLE.</li>
            <li> I do notice a little improvement.  I drink a lot of green tea and it has improved the whiteness a bit.</li>
            <li> Overall, these strips were very effective.&lt;br /&gt;I love these strips because you simply apply them and you&#x27;re done. Since they dissolve on their own, you don&#x27;t have to worry about finding a place to throw them out. This works great for me because I&#x27;m always so busy. I apply them right before I go to bed or before I drive to school, and they dissolve by the time I arrive.&lt;br /&gt;They also stick in place so you don&#x27;t have to walk around making a horse face to avoid lip-to-strip contact during whitening.&lt;br /&gt;I used a whole box, and now I am halfway through my second box.&lt;br /&gt;However, I just had a dentist visit and they told me to stop whitening because my shade is now out of the normal teeth spectrum - I am one shade away from the brightest bleach shade they carry on file. The dental hygienist told me, &amp;#34;IF YOU OVER-WHITEN, YOUR TEETH WILL BECOME TRANSLUCENT AND BLUE.&amp;#34; Once you reach this whitening level, your teeth can&#x27;t go back to how they were, and the only thing the dentist can do is cap them. I was advised to only do a touch up (a week&#x27;s worth of strips) in about three months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I am very pleased with the results, but I am glad I had a checkup when I did because I might have over done it.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions exactly as described. Didn&#x27;t see much change in color on my teeth. A little disappointed, probably would not buy again.</li>
            <li> My teeth got whiter but after a few days of using it puffed my lips up. I discontinued use and they puffiness went away. They do stay put on the teeth, unlike Crest strips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product exactly two times. The first time I used it, everything went well. My teeth were noticeably whiter, I was happy. The second time however wasn&#x27;t as dandy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it the night before a military gala at my husband&#x27;s work. I learned from the last time I used it that my gums felt raw and turned a pale shade of pinkish gray after the whole process, hence the decision of doing it the night before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The morning after, I woke up and immediately sensed that something was wrong. My mouth felt numb and my lips felt like they were stretch a tad too tightly. Kind of like that feeling you get after a dentist appointment and you just had a root canal or a filling done. So I ran to the bathroom to see what the heck was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mouth was swollen. I had a very unsightly trout pout. On top of that, my inner lips (both upper and lower) were covered with sores. And my gums were bleeding and sloughing off as if it was burned. When I gargled off my morning breath, I realized how much worse it really was. With my mouth closed and dry, it was sore. But when I start to move it, or attempt to eat or drink, it was incredibly painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this happened on a weekend, I had no choice but to suck it up until I saw a dentist on Monday. I did not eat that entire weekend. I consumed crushed ice, popped it directly into my tongue to avoid any contact with my gums or my lips. It was the least painful solution. It was horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward 1 year later, the cosmetic damage to my lips and gums have healed. But now, I am unable to eat anything cold or hot without experiencing severe discomfort. It feels as if my gums recede all the way to the base of my teeth as my teeth simultaneously crack. If I want hot food, I wait until it&#x27;s lukewarm to eat it. No ice cream or anything cold for me either. And no, toothpaste made for sensitivity DOES NOT help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So beware when you use this. It doesn&#x27;t say on the box, but, IT CAN CAUSE PERMANENT ORAL DAMAGE.CAUSE PERMANENT ORAL DAMAGE.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply these strips and the instructions are clear. The strips are getting dissolved after 5 minutes. I could see my teeth are getting brighter after 20 applications.</li>
            <li> These things wad up as soon as they get near your mouth and refuse to stick to teeth properly.</li>
            <li> Excellent was beautiful and wonderful, but after experience pain in the teeth of cold water&lt;br /&gt;Experience more of the wonderful thank you</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like how these slipped compared to Crest Strips. Didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
            <li> After two weeks , people noticed a big difference. Buy them!</li>
            <li> I like the way it wraps around the back of my teeth to clean there, too.</li>
            <li> I have to imagine that anyone who likes these strips must have some kind of enormous horse mouth, or else very damp teeth and very dry lips. Not having the largest mouth, I find it impossible to get my lips far enough out of the way to use these. The moment the inside of my lips come down around my teeth, and thus the strip, the strip sticks to my lips rather than my teeth. The strip then self-destructs, pulling into little shards and clumping up in random places. After the last application, I expect to see a nice patch of pearly white on my right canine, my lower left cuspid, and possibly some bleaching of my upper gums. This product is worthless.</li>
            <li> I love these strips!!! Whiter teeth in days and I have sensitive teeth, these didn&#x27;t bother me at all. I have recommended these to multiple friends and they love them as well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much experience with white strips, but I just received these today. My first impression was that the instructions are really simple and the packaging was okay. I did accidentally tear one of the strips while trying to pull it out, but that was mainly my fault and I just stuck it back together on my teeth. The strips themselves were interesting. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get used to the sensation and get the hang of properly putting them on. If you&#x27;re a person who it very particular about texture, you might not like this product. I am able to ignore it. Especially since it&#x27;s only for about 10 minutes. After the 10 minutes was up I still felt like they didn&#x27;t dissolve all the way, but like I said it was my first try. Besides the slightly unpleasant texture/taste, I am pretty satisfied with the product and hope they work!</li>
            <li> My teeth were awful and so grossly yellow that I couldn&#x27;t even wear lipstick because it just made them look bad. I have been using whitening toothpaste but it wasn&#x27;t really cutting it so I got these whitestrips because of the price, I too like other reviewers didn&#x27;t realize you had to use them twice a day best results. I did use them two times a day for the first 3 days but my gums got sore so I reduced it to once a day, like the box said to if it caused irritation. It has been a week since I started and my teeth are not disgusting yellow anymore! They aren&#x27;t white white, but they do look pretty natural and unstained and now I can wear lipstick again and my teeth don&#x27;t appear more yellow. I am a smoker and a coffee drinker but I also have a stripe across all the middle of my teeth from when I had braces a long time ago now I don&#x27;t even notice that. I think these are really a great bargain, I read one reviewer used just one strip by putting thier teeth together and then slapping it on like that until it begins to dissolve. I think I am going to try that, if that works I can buy one box and the strips could last me 56 days! That&#x27;s more bang for my buck I like that. I make sure that i take a kleenex and dry my teeth and inside lips and tongue before I apply the strips because they do start dissolving as soon as they get wet. I also don&#x27;t swallow while I am waiting for them to dissolve I kind of just let my saliva and the disolved strip just pool around my teeth and so even my molars get the benifit of the whitening. If would recomend this product to anyone who is skeptical of whitening strips just because they are inexpensive and if you don&#x27;t like them you aren&#x27;t out $50 like you would be using Crest strips.</li>
            <li> I think they helped a little bit to whiten but my teeth were already whiten beforehand, I think it was a quick fix and I would repurchase!</li>
            <li> These strips look well and work quickly. They dissolve after a few minutes contact with teeth. The only drawback is, with frequent use, especially after brushing teeth, they can feel irritating to the gums. I then use them less frequently.</li>
            <li> These strips worked great! They whitened my teeth beautifully, and I didn&#x27;t even need to use all of them to get my desired results, so I am saving them for the future! The first couple of days using them, however, caused some sensitivity in a couple of my teeth and the surrounding gums. This went away shortly after removal of strips, and didn&#x27;t even occur after the first few days. Also, these strips are supposed to &amp;#34;dissolve&amp;#34; but I had to brush after each use, due to the thick film still left on. Despite these flaws, I would still purchase again for the great whitening they provide.</li>
            <li> Extremely difficult (for me) to wriggle out the clear thin plastic working strip from its thin plastic container.  I trashed several before I got the hang of it. The working strip tightly adheres to the containing pocket (on its &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; side) and it might need a sharp blade or tweezers to start to separate the two surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;But once the working strip is extracted, it is easy to apply to teeth, and works as advertised</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the crest strips and was annoyed when I could no longer find the Listerine dissolving strips. These are just like the Listerine strips and they work great.  I drink coffee every day and the dentist asks me what I use because my whitening looks great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years!!! I would love to know if they are completely discontinued or if they are being sold under another new name?!!!!???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These strips are AMAZING!! So I amazing, that I try not to tell anyone my secret! It&#x27;s literally like an instant change!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So disappointed that I can&#x27;t find them in store or online and called the customer service for Rembrandt and basically got told they are just simply discontinued and not under any othe Brand!</li>
            <li> Used this about 4 days and noticed whitening already. So thats great.&lt;br /&gt;What I didnt like was how there is no designated sticky side or top/bottom strips.&lt;br /&gt;Im not sure if they chose this for marketing reasons, but it makes it really hard to sometimes stick to your teeth. Sometimes this rather stick to your fingers, gums, lips, or tongue but will slip right off your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe wetting your teeth will help</li>
            <li> These stick to teeth SO much better than Crest. Once they touch your teeth, you better not need to move them because they are officially stuck. They dissolve quickly, maybe 5-10 mins. I think my smile is brighter, but not dramatically. It did reduce some coffee stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these when they were $14. I would never pay $33 for them.</li>
            <li> Save your money for the crest white strips.  This is completely ineffective.</li>
            <li> The Rembrandt strips work great for me.  I put them in before I leave for work.  They claim to be 10 minute strips, but my drive is 30 minutes, and the strips are just about completely dissolved by then.  I like them because they don&#x27;t irritate my teeth or gums like gels have done.  Also, when I have used a gel at night, it has awakened me during the night.  These are almost unnoticeable once you put them on.  They don&#x27;t whiten as quickly as a gel, but are less expensive and will eventually get the job done.  There are 56 strips in a box.  28 days of treatment.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THESE! After one use, you see improvements. After a week, my teeth looked like a movie stars! I drink coffee, soda, energy drinks, smoke, eat chocolate. These are amazing!</li>
            <li> I started using these because the Listerine Dissolving Strips were discontinued for whatever reason. While these are easy to use and dissolve, they aren&#x27;t as good as the Listerine version. My teeth don&#x27;t get nearly as white and they don&#x27;t stay white for as long as they did with Listerine strips.</li>
            <li> I did notice a difference when I finished using the product, but it wasn&#x27;t as nice of a difference as I was hoping/wanting/expecting. The price (&amp;#60;$20) was great, but in retrospect it may have been more worthwhile to spend a bit more (e.g. ~$30) to get Crest Whitestrips. I&#x27;ve used those in the past and were very satisfied with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding Rembrandt specifically... the strips do indeed dissolve and leave a decent mint flavor in the mouth. However, I found that it took more than the 5-10 min advertised for the strips to disintegrate, and they would frequently leave little bits that wouldn&#x27;t really dissolve. Instead, I&#x27;d need to rinse my mouth with water to wash away everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strips had no real issue sticking to my teeth. I once accidentally put a strip on backwards, which thankfully didn&#x27;t ruin the strip as it didn&#x27;t even stick to my teeth! Definitely nice to know that. The strips are also very wide, to the extent that if your teeth are of a decent enough size, you could probably cut one strip in half and use that for all of your mouth. Then normal size would practically fully wrap around my teeth. Doubling up on the strips would definitely increase the value and my star rating for the product.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for! These worked ok but not as well as I had hoped! I would use them again but if Im already spending this much I might as well go ahead and buy the Crest Whitestrips! They work better!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used these once and I can see a diffrence.  These are amazing.  I&#x27;m using the whole Rembrandt system and I&#x27;m very happy with this.</li>
            <li> If there was a phrase with which I could describe these whitening strips, it would be &amp;#34;an unusual experience.&amp;#34; They do the job, and do it well. But wearing them is kind of like high school health class- it&#x27;s tedious, slightly uncomfortable, and a little gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The definition of &amp;#34;dissolving&amp;#34; with one of these strips should be &amp;#34;it kind of sort of becomes less noticeable over a ridiculously long period of time, but never really goes away&amp;#34; kind of like racism in the South. As the artificial mint flavor permeates your taste buds, and after checking five times you still feel like you&#x27;ve covered your teeth in wet paper, the dream of whitening loses just a tiny bit of luster. After a while, I gave up and rinsed with water, satisfied that this was Rembrandt&#x27;s intention. I can&#x27;t imagine trying to speak to anyone while wearing these, while your mouth becomes a mass of sticky white spit and the strips completely prevent you from properly articulating the letter &amp;#34;s.&amp;#34; At least my teeth got whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, I found these under the sink in my bathroom, in a box meant for whitening strips from Crest. I assumed they were bought by my brother, and the copyright date was from 2011. So perhaps the strips were less than ideal for use after sitting in the household equivalent of a moist cave for three years. Still, I believe they performed admirably enough. Just try to avoid swallowing bits of &amp;#34;dissolving&amp;#34; strip while you wear them- I think I got high.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Why can&#x27;t I find it on the store shelves anymore?!?!?!</li>
            <li> These are great! I really like them much better than the Crest White Strips which I have used for a long time. The Crest brand is messy and hard to use in my opinion. These strips are not a &amp;#34;gooey&amp;#34; and can easily and quickly be applied to your teeth and they stay put! On top of that, they work! I could literally see my teeth whitening shortly after applying the strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I noticed was that the strips did not dissolve completely on my teeth that have veneers. I just brushed my teeth and the residue came off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend these strips.</li>
            <li> absolutely love these!</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the thing, since using this product, I have developed a Black Tongue! It&#x27;s name really is Black Hairy tongue and is a yeast infection on the tongue that turns black. Caused from Peroxide in the formula. I&#x27;m not using it excessively, twice a day and will discontinue use now that the source of this infection has been found. I now need to brush my tongue twice a day to get rid of this. Otherwise, the product works for teeth, they are whiter, but now shows off my black tongue more. I never had an issue with this product in the past, and not sure why I had this reaction now.</li>
            <li> Excellent when using the toothpaste and Rembrandt whitening mouth wash!</li>
            <li> I really liked the Listerine Whiting strip&#x27;s, but they were discontinued, these are very close to the Listerine.  You could see a difference in how white my teeth were within a few days of using.  I will purchase these again.</li>
            <li> expected better results</li>
            <li> I used these strips for a couple of years when they were made by Listerine, and I was heartbroken when they went off the market.  I only recently discovered by reading a review on Amazon that they are now being distributed by Rembrandt.  It takes a little practice to get used to opening the packets and liberating the strips.  I use scissors to remove all four sides of the packet and find that easier.  It takes a little practice to get used to putting them on and remembering when the notch should be where.  But get over it!  These are so much easier and quicker to use.  I am delighted to find them on the market again and wish I&#x27;d realized sooner that these are the ones I used to use.  I don&#x27;t know if they are the best choice in terms of radical whitening, but they&#x27;re the ones I prefer in terms of the total package.  That is, because they are so much easier to use, I use them.  I think they are milder than some of the others, too, and since they are also cheaper, using them a little longer or more often isn&#x27;t a problem.  All in all, they work well for me.</li>
            <li> These are some pretty good whitening strips and I have noticed a several shade difference since using them. I will suggest that you read the instructions before using for the first time - I put them in backwards and got a mouth full of foam!  After finally reading the instructions and using the strips properly, I found that I liked them!  You will need to be consistent and use these twice a day.  I did not experience any gum sensitivity and I am pleased with the result. I teamed these strips with the Rembrandt Intense Stain Tooth Paste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A pro for me is that the strips dissolve and there is no goop to brush out of my mouth like when dealing with trays of gel strips.&lt;br /&gt;A con is that you have to use these twice a day.</li>
            <li> These really work. They brightened my teeth 1-2 shades (although my teeth are already pretty white). I didn&#x27;t even need a full weeks worth of product and now just use them occasionally to keep my teeth at the brighter white shade I like. I am an avid tea/coffee drinker so white strips are a must. I noticed slight sensitivity on my gums after the 5 days in a row of treatment but after being more careful when applying the strips I haven&#x27;t had that problem again. For the price you cannot beat them!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, no need to peel off and really whitened my teeth. I highly recommend this product. I bought 3 boxes for my sisters family to use.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my order</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years now, I don&#x27;t use them according to directions, they make my teeth to sensitive (all whitening products do). I just use them once or twice a week or so along with a whitening toothpaste for up keep. I&#x27;m not going for black light glowing white/ fake looking teeth, just to counteract my morning coffee addiction. I like to pop them on unbrushed teeth before I get in the shower, then brush when I get out and BAM, a nice white, not to obvious smile. They dissolve mostly on there own, but I never have a problem since I brush after. I really like pretty much all Rembrant products. I will defiantly keep using these as long as there manufactured.</li>
            <li> Utterly useless. I went through the entire 56 strips and noted zero change. People who sees results have got to be fooling themselves. Added to this, the strips are extremely difficult to remove from the packaging.</li>
            <li> I will say first off, dissolving were a good idea. But in reality, they suck. They fall apart way to easy, the don&#x27;t stay on well, and, unless you like the taste of toothpaste, they&#x27;re gross. Do yourself a favor and spend a little extra on the Crest ones that don&#x27;t dissolve; they work very well. I gave this 2 stars because it might actually whiten teeth, it&#x27;s just not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> Impossible!&lt;br /&gt;Have returned to crest strips, as these are seriously frustrating and a total waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;So much so I threw them away.</li>
            <li> I was intensely shopping lightning deals before Christmas and these strips were available!  They are terrific.  They whiten really nicely without any pain, are minty tasting and there were 56 strips in this box!  Crazy good deal at the time!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re effective. Easy to apply, and dissolve in about 10 minutes. If your teeth are sensitive to whitening products you won&#x27;t have a problem with these. I&#x27;ve used wraps before that really were painful/uncomfortable, however, I haven&#x27;t had any issue with these. Other reviewers have mentioned that you can swallow the saliva that builds up in your mouth after putting these in. I personally don&#x27;t like doing that. I found spitting out the saliva buildup frustrating until I began applying them before getting in the shower, as someone suggested in the reviews. Spit at will, my friends, it&#x27;ll be dissolved by the time you step out.</li>
            <li> These strips are incredible! I&#x27;ve only been using them for three days and I can already see a difference -- I can&#x27;t wait to see what my teeth will look like at the end of the two week treatment. I&#x27;m a heavy tea and coffee drinker, so my teeth have seen better days. Six strips in (2 a day, as directed), I can already see a difference in my teeth. These strips are easy to apply, dissolve quickly, and are very effective. I haven&#x27;t had any problems opening the strips or applying them, unlike other reviewers. I think it&#x27;s important to have dry hands when applying the strips -- they&#x27;re meant to dissolve in your mouth, so if you touch them with wet hands I imagine they&#x27;d fall apart. If you have dry hands there&#x27;s no problem whatsoever! I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product, especially at the price.</li>
            <li> The whitening strips seem to work pretty well. They feel really gross when they are on your teeth and leave a bad aftertaste in your mouth though.</li>
            <li> Overall the product does what it says it will do, but for a few dollars more the Crest strips are the way to go.</li>
            <li> I dread using these, as they melt in your mouth and taste pretty gnarly. But they do work IF you are persistent.</li>
            <li> Rembrandt does the trick. Put it on when  heading out of the house and before you reach your destination the strip will have dissolved.&lt;br /&gt;Easiest and most affordable way to deal with unwanted stains.</li>
            <li> Love this product!! Too bad they don&#x27;t sell it in stores anymore because it really works. I&#x27;ve never had tooth sensitivity like you get when using other whitening strips.</li>
            <li> not too sure this worked for me.. my teeth were already &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; but did not see any difference after using this product.. not for someone who already has &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; teeth.</li>
            <li> For the money?  No thanks.  A $.58 bottle of hydrogen peroxide is working much better for me than this.  They DO work.  But not for the price.  I&#x27;d rather swish with HP after brushing and throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Easy to use...does the job well.</li>
            <li> this is the worst teeth whitening product I have ever bought. I never write reviews but I felt the need to warn everyone not to buy</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any change.</li>
            <li> I like everything about these whitening strips. The only complaint I have is taking out the strips from packaging..that&#x27;s all. My teeth didn&#x27;t get sensitive and not having to take off the strips after I&#x27;m done is nice as well compared to the crest. All is left is see the results after using the whole box.</li>
            <li> I really like this product even more than its big name competitor.  The strips are very thin and conform to every surface of the teeth.  They melt away, so you just apply the strip and go about your business.  I did experience a slight bitter taste during the process, but it went away quickly.  I was impressed with the great results achieved also.  At this great price I am surprised more people don&#x27;t ditch that other popular brand and switch to Rembrandt!  So much easier to use and really great results.  I will definitely use these again and perhaps other Rembrandt products as well.</li>
            <li> I am having a heck of a time getting these on my teeth.  They stick to everything! Fingers, lips, etc.  I keep wrinkling them and having to start over, burning through strips.  Even getting them out of the package leaves them wrinked and torn.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and cheap vs alternatives but I&#x27;ve used it for about 2 weeks and I&#x27;m not sure there is a material change in the color of my teeth. Still worth the money given the price vs Crest products for example.</li>
            <li> I used these in lieu of Crest 3D White Strips, which I use every 12 months or so.  I did not like these at all- they have a horrible flavor and the fact that they dissolve in your mouth is disgusting.  They didn&#x27;t seem to make my teeth as white as the Crest products do.  I would not purchase these again.</li>
            <li> Love the dissolvable! No fuss no muss.</li>
            <li> These strips are great to use since they dissolve while in your mouth. Unfortunately, it looks like they are now discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;After Listerine discontinued these, I was happy to see the Rembrandt folks carry them. Oh well.....my teeth look good for now,</li>
            <li> Love them! They are the easiest strips to use to clean your teeth!</li>
            <li> I have used crest whitening strips and I&#x27;ve used these. I get compliments about my white teeth all the time and I loved that these desolved in 5 minutes so you don&#x27;t have to keep them in for too long. However, I did notice better results with the crest 9maybe because my teeth used to be less white the first time). Nonetheless these worked and I&#x27;m content!</li>
            <li> they almost melt before putting them on. They stick to your fingers.</li>
            <li> These work much better than Crest strips. I was highly disappointed when Target quit carrying them. Hope they don&#x27;t quit making them.</li>
            <li> Rembrandt dissolving strips really work. You&#x27;ll see the results in less than a week. Make sure you follow the directions on how to put them on your teeth..</li>
            <li> These things are amazing!!! I haven&#x27;t whitened my teeth in over 10yrs. On 1st use these made an extreme difference. These are so much easier to use than the normal strips. I have used them 3 days in a row and can&#x27;t imagine how much whiter my teeth could get! Hello again 25yr old smile :)</li>
            <li> With reviews I read I expected more result.  I think I did get a small result and more polished teeth but would have liked to see a brighter white result.</li>
            <li> I use the strips at least twice a year. They do a good job, if you re not expecting professional whitening. It s not messy, they strips dissolve easily in about 20 minutes. Good product.</li>
            <li> First, you need to read and follow the instructions. The first time using them it took me a minute to get the hang of it, but after that all went well.  I will be using the last ones tomorrow and my teeth look considerably whiter than they did.  This has been a good product for me and the price is right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought these twice. I&#x27;m on my second box. The first box lasted me a good  months if not more because of the way that I use them (I&#x27;ll explain my routine at the end of this review). My teeth definitely were whitened by this product. Of course the results are not permanent and they are gradual. You can&#x27;t expect amazing results on the first day, but if you are consistent with the use of this product you will start seeing results shortly after.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth were a couple shades whiter after use. I could see the difference but did not notice how much of a difference until I would look at pictures of myself and I could see how much brighter my smile looked. Not only that but I would get compliments on my smile more often.&lt;br /&gt;The results are not what you would get if they were done professionally, but that&#x27;s ok because the look that they gave my teeth was a natural look. White enough to give me a bright smile, but not super white to the point that it looked unnatural.&lt;br /&gt;This is a very inexpensive way to keep your smile white. There was little to no sensitivity caused by this product for me. The application is pretty simple. It&#x27;s not messy, and even opening the little packages that each individual strip comes in is made simple that you can just slip them right out.&lt;br /&gt;I think that they are very well rounded set of strips. You definitely get your money&#x27;s worth from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said I can tell you a bit about my routine of how I used them and how I got them to work for me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. At first to get a noticeable result in whiteness, I would use one set of strips per day everyday for a full week. If i felt I needed more whitening, I would use them a couple days more. I don&#x27;t use them as recommended on the box (which is applying the strips  twice a day for 2 weeks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. whenever I had them on during that one week period I try to keep my mouth as dry as possible by smiling or by swallowing more often so that the strips dissolve much slower than 10 minutes that it says on the box. The strips end up almost completely dissolving in about 30 minutes with my method. There will always be little chunks left behind that you might want to floss out or brush out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. After the week of what  I call intense whitening, I only have to do touch ups from that point. What I mean by touch ups is that I only have to use the strips about once a week if necessary. Sometimes I go a whole month without using them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. I try to stay away from dark soda&#x27;s or coffee and wine as well to try and prolong the results from these strips. I know that it may not be easy so give up some of these things for some people, for example coffee since it may be part of a person&#x27;s morning routine... but I did this coupled with the treatment and it helped the effects last for much longer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Whenever I feel that my teeth are not as bright as they were when I started the treatment, I restart the process all over. I repeat the steps I just listed and keep the cycle going.uch slower than 10 minutes that it says on the box. The strips end up almost completely dissolving in about 30 minutes with my method.

            <li> These are just like the old listerine whitening strips.  I loved those just as much as I love these.  I like putting them on and being able to leave my house and even drink water with it in.  Also they are more affordable than others I find in store and these never left spots on my teeth.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Horrible packaging. At first I didn&#x27;t even think there was anything in each individual packet. You have to really look once you open up the sachet and use your nails to try to peal back the actual strip. At one time the strip even broke. Furthermore, it tastes like cr@p... I haven&#x27;t used it for long enough to see any results just yet but my first impression is not favorable! (Keep in mind that you have to use 2 at a time so 56 strips is actually 28 uses!)</li>
            <li> They are a hassle to get out of their individual wraps, they are extremely difficult to place on the bottom row of teeth due to the quick dissolve.</li>
            <li> Not painfull. Tastes a little funny though.</li>
            <li> Best white strip I&#x27;ve ever tried.  If you have sensitive teeth, get these now!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on your teeth very long, just melts off.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for this product at all. Did not seem to whiten.</li>
            <li> These are great but use them up fast or they dry up.  I learned the hard way.</li>
            <li> I love it! Really works... I have always used listerine strips but they are no longer&lt;br /&gt;or hard to find now. Took a chance and I&#x27;m glad I did! Will be buying some more for sure, thank you.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY whitening product out there that doesn&#x27;t leave my teeth hurting &amp; ridiculously sensitive afterwards. I also love that they&#x27;re dissolving, I put them on right before I go to bed &amp; they dissolve while I sleep. Definitely a high quality, convenient &amp; effective product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for weeks now and they really seem to work. Stains that used to be on my teeth have finally come off, and that makes me smile more. It should be noted that you need two strips per use, so it is really a 28 day program. I didn&#x27;t realize this when I got it, but it is still a great value.</li>
            <li> These strips are individually packaged in foil wrappers, they are clear, stuck to the sides and are impossible to take out without tearing, stretching, or having the strip fold over on itself. I end of throwing away one or two strips every time I try to use them. These strips may contain the right ingredients and work well at whitening, but a conservative guess is that 1/3 of the strips will end up unusable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest getting a non-dissolvable kind of strip -- one with a plastic backing that needs to be removed. The Rembrandt dissolving strip may seem convenient, but it is not.</li>
            <li> After trying for over a week, some stips would come out of the package &amp; some wouldn&#x27;t. They would rip, tear or just plain not come out no matter what I did. Anyway, I was disappointed in my purchase.</li>
            <li> I purchased these and can not use them[[ASIN:B007RF1YZG Rembrandt Intense Stain Dissolving Strips, 56 Count]]&lt;br /&gt;I could never get them to fit on my teeth.  They were so delicate and hard to handle.  I wish I could get my money back and another product.  I would not advise anyone to purchase these!  Very displeased!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super happy with my purchase. I was a little hesitant, but I&#x27;m glad I gave these a shot. The strips are individually packaged and you do need to be careful taking the strip out. Make sure you have opened the package all the way across the top, otherwise if you try pulling the strip out with the package ripped open only halfway or so...you might tear the strip. Application is super easy and quick. I love that the each strip is made to work for both upper or lower. It took about 7 or 8 minutes for the strips to dissolve. So nice not having anything left that I have to peel off! These are perfect for putting on while I run errands or walk the dog. They seem to do a good job of whitening so far...although I haven&#x27;t finished my 2 weeks worth yet.</li>
            <li> I have beautiful white teeth.  This product is not strong but gentle on your gums.</li>
            <li> mine must have been 7,000 years old cause when i opened the package the strips were like fused to the sides of the packaging. I almost didn&#x27;t see them and thought it was empty. the dissolving feature of these is both nice and annoying, sure you don&#x27;t have to throw anything away but you still have to rinse your moth after they are done to get that taste out of your mouth.  they seem to work well though, them along with the toothpaste and the mouthwash have greatly improved the color of my teeth. probably not as good as the nice crest ones but these did a good job.</li>
            <li> I love these dissolving strips because you can put them on and go. They also don&#x27;t irritate my gums and work after only a few applications.</li>
            <li> As the strips dissolve they leave behind a plastic film in my saliva.  At first this caused my stomach to become upset.  Then, I decided to not swallow my saliva for the 10 minutes that it&#x27;s in my mouth, and spit after the 10 minutes.  This got annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I later read the ingredients, and one of them is shellac.  I don&#x27;t want to swallow shellac, and I don&#x27;t beleive you do either.</li>
            <li> There are the ONLY white strips that do not bother my mouth or make my teeth sensitive! I cannot find them in the store any longer, so I buy them on Amazon. And they are a great price as well. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> These strips work great! They&#x27;re easy to use, so I&#x27;m not sure why some people are having trouble opening and applying them. Read directions people! Make sure your hands are completely dry. They have little notches on them - Tear the top off, then the sides, and then just take the strip out. There&#x27;s a notch on the strip that tells you which side to apply to your teeth. Open your mouth wide lol and press them against your teeth. That&#x27;s it! They just disappear.&lt;br /&gt;These have whitened my teeth considerably after using for 2 weeks. I&#x27;m going to do another 2 weeks now. I also have resin bonding on my top front teeth. The box, and my dentist, told me I can&#x27;t bleach the bonding, but I&#x27;m telling you it lightened my front and bottom teeth evenly, so I&#x27;m impressed! Will definitely buy on a regular basis. They&#x27;re cheaper than other brands of strips, and work better for me. What else can I say? I love them!</li>
            <li> Rembrandt&#x27;s Intense Stain Dissolving Strips are fragile and less convenient to use than other whitening strips on the market.  Adapting the instructions saved me from wasting strips and gave me my money&#x27;s worth.  Here are some tips that are worth considering and are not included in the instructions on the packaging:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  Make sure your hands are 100% dry before handling the strips.&lt;br /&gt;2)  After tearing off the top of an individual strip packet, cut open the sides of the packet with scissors so that the strip is fully exposed, then carefully peel it off.  In other words, if you were to imagine the packet as an envelope and the strip as a letter, open the top and sides of the envelope and fold it back before removing the letter.&lt;br /&gt;3)  The dryer your teeth and surrounding gums, the more successful you will be in positioning the strips.  Eliminate saliva from your bottom teeth as best as possible.  Peel down your bottom lip with your fingers, pulling it away from your mouth.  Position the strip against your bottom teeth and then pull your bottom lip out and reposition it over your bottom teeth.&lt;br /&gt;4)  Repeat for your upper teeth.&lt;br /&gt;5)  Do not move your mouth for 10-15 minutes, even if it feels like your lips are sticking to your teeth and you&#x27;re pouting.&lt;br /&gt;6)  Have mouthwash or water handy to rinse thoroughly once the 10-15 minutes are up.  From my experience, these strips do not dissolve entirely, even after half an hour.  They left a flaky, white residue on the surface of my teeth and in between, which I rinsed away with mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These strips effectively whitened my teeth and reduced staining!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re willing to put in the technical effort and accept the trial-and-error process, they might work for you as well -- and for a fraction of the price of Crest Whitestrips.</li>
            <li> I used to use the listerine dissolving whitening strips and was so sad that they discontinued them, but these are the same exact product as the listerine, and very satisfied with it!!</li>
            <li> I love these! I have been looking for whitening strips that were cheap, easy to apply and did not affect my daily life, and these are it! Yes, they can be a little tricky to apply but if you follow the directions you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem. So far I have only used 1/2 of the box and my teeth are already significantly whitened. These are very comfortable to wear, nearly invisible and have a very pleasant taste. Application tips: 1. Follow the instructions! 2. I found that it helps if you lick your teeth before applying these. 3. Make sure to use clean, dry hands and to apply to your bottom teeth first. And as for sensitivity so far all I have had has been a little gum irritation, that&#x27;s all! Happy whitening! Ps. I WILL buy these again!</li>
            <li> Plus- I can see a difference on a few teeth after 2 uses.  (Not all of them, though)&lt;br /&gt;  - Easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Minus- After 2 times, my inside upper lip is sore and slightly swollen.  I&#x27;m going to take a day off.&lt;br /&gt;  - Strips leave a gel residue on your teeth, even after 15 minutes.  I wiped it off.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product&#x27;s effectiveness. Easy to use. I agree that it is best to open up 3 sides to easily remove the strip from the package.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t move which is nice. I haven&#x27;t seen a big difference 7 days in. I will keep trying</li>
            <li> I CANNOT get these things to stick to my teeth instead of my fingers, lips, tongue... It is SO annoying. I have had them work and stick to my teeth maybe two times-and I&#x27;ve yet to figure out what the deciding factor is between whether they stick to my fingers or teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am applying them correctly- with the little notch going behind my teeth. I&#x27;m totally mystified... and very annoyed that I wasted money on these strips. I&#x27;ve spat out more mangled whitening strips than I care to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy. It&#x27;s a total waste of 20 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED 5/14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yep... I AM an idiot. I was applying backwards! Be SURE the little triangle cutout is on your left hand side on your bottom teeth, and right hand side on your top teeth!... changed my review from one star to 4 with the missing star because of the taste.</li>
            <li> These were tiny and messy to use. The strips were hard to peel off and often ended up melting in my hand. No noticeable difference to my teeth.</li>
            <li> Hard to peel.  We couldn&#x27;t get them off the  paper...waste of money...</li>
            <li> It did it&#x27;s job, however the leading brands are a little more pricey but I got better results that lasted longer</li>
            <li> I bought this with a little hesitation after reading a review of a lady whose mouth got really swollen. They worked fine, but one night I put them in and fell asleep for a few minutes, I jolted awake because I was worried about the strips being in my mouth, and I realized my underside of my tongue was leaning on the strip. I stayed awake until the strips were gone but in the morning, the underside of my tongue is a little swollen. So I think these work great, I&#x27;m seeing a difference, but DO NOT fall asleep with these in your mouth. It obviously depends on the constant unconscious movement of saliva to not be harmful vs the stagnant saliva when you sleep. I will definitely buy again when I need another whitening!</li>
            <li> def not the crest strips</li>
            <li> these strips might work, but i will never know because they are SO delicate i can&#x27;t get them on my teeth. peeling them off the foil stretches them and they are too large to fit on my teeth. fighting to get them in place makes them get ruined. i tried trimming to fit better, but no luck the product is just too delicate to work with. epic fail Rembrandt!</li>
            <li> I was a huge fan of the Listerine Dissolving Whitening Strips and was disappointed when they were discontinued.  I tried to make my last box of them last as long as I could as I was dreading having to buy the \\&quot;other kind\\&quot; of strips.  So I was pleasantly surprised to see the return of dissolving strips, albeit under a different brand name.  As far as I can tell, these Rembrandt strips are an exact replica of the old Listerine dissolving ones.  Same quality, size, same whitening effect, and yes, same type of foil packaging.  The packaging to me is not a deal-breaker at all.  The strips are fragile (as one might expect), so tearing into the packaging IS a risky maneuver.  Instead of fumbling around trying to tear it in a straight line, I use Swiss army knife scissors and cut 3 sides off the packaging.  If you&#x27;re not like me, and don&#x27;t have mini-scissors handy, tearing 3 sides off first is key.  I have no problem getting the whitening strip off the foil and on to my teeth when I do it that way.  That lil&#x27; bit of extra work is worth it to me in exchange for being able to leave an effective whitening strip on my teeth that will cleanly dissolve away.  I&#x27;m also very happy to see the pricing on these (much more reasonably priced than the \\&quot;other kind\\&quot; of whitening strips I was looking at).</li>
            <li> Worked well, but takes longer to dissolve than what it says on the box and leaves a weird taste in your mouth. I typically brushed my teeth after using.</li>
            <li> Rembrandt Intense Stain Dissolving Strips, 56 Count works better than cheaper products. SEE THE SMILE ON MY FACE BRIGHTER WHITER TEETH!!! I leave it on my teeth for 30 minutes. THE ONLY DOWNSIDE IS APPLYING THE STRIPS INSIDE YOUR MOUTH: YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO PLACE THE ALUMINUM FOIL INSIDE YOUR MOUTH FOR THE WHITENING SOLUTION TO STAY ON YOUR TEETH AND LEAVE THE FOIL INSIDE YOUR MOUTH FOR THE SOLUTION TO DISOLVE. CAREFUL DON&#x27;T CUT YOUR TONGUE OR INSIDE OF YOUR LIPS!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;FOR THE PRICE THIS MANUFACTURER SHOULD IMPROVE THE DESIGN OF THE APPLICATION!!!!!</li>
            <li> God forbid you attempt to put these on in your bathroom, where there might be any moisture from a sink or shower, or have remotely damp/sweaty hands, and please get your saliva glands removed from your mouth before attempting to use this uber moisture sensitive product, that will recoil like a shrinky-dink if it even senses moisture. You will end up throwing away about half of the strips that self destruct either when you open the poorly designed pacakage, attempt to remove them from the package, or place them in your mouth. The whitening effect is very MEH. Frustrating rip -off with little whitening power.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t smoke but do drink coffee (with cream) and my teeth are a good color but with all the media hype for chicklet-like teeth, I felt compelled to try whiteners.  I&#x27;ve tried other drugstore brands but Rembrandt is always my favorite.  They apply easily enough and whiten nicely without making your teeth look paper white -- You know what I mean.  The taste isn&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li> I lay out my surgical instruments in preparation of an immaculate surgical removal of these &amp; based on some reviews- I don&#x27;t understand what all the fuss is about? These are perfect in every way.&lt;br /&gt;Price - Reasonable, so maybe it doesn&#x27;t come in a fancy plastic box but who cares? Less to waste&lt;br /&gt;strips - Brilliant they stick to the teeth and don&#x27;t move about and shift and cause me to want to spit every two seconds. I wear them before I hop in the shower  in the am and by the time I am done they&#x27;ve dissolved. I don&#x27;t know how many minutes that takes but exactly the shower time.&lt;br /&gt;Whitening- comparable to professional strength without the pain to the teeth &amp; wallet&lt;br /&gt;I brush my teeth with sensodyne, because I have sensitive teeth and that has worked for me- I don&#x27;t know if that also curbs on the pain from these strips but I would always quit using strips for one of the afore mentioned reasons, either price is prohibitive, teeth in pain, shifting and bunching or bad taste. These avoid all those problems.&lt;br /&gt;I had switched for a while to the whitening that comes in a syringe with molding trays but those were the worse for me. So if I had to rate this in comparison with the syringe filled whitening or crest I&#x27;d say these win by a landslide.&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully they&#x27;ll keep the price at bay and we can continue to use these.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  I&#x27;d recommend this to others.  Complaints about strip application are overblown.</li>
            <li> Terrible product. Too difficult to apply, poor directions!&lt;br /&gt;I want my money back.</li>
            <li> You can see the difference in two weeks</li>
            <li> The do the job at a great price, and the fact they dissolve is a great feature.  Are these the strongest whitening strips? No there are stronger, but these do the trick and remove most of you coffee/tea stains.</li>
            <li> c.  The strips are very this and begin to melt if they touch anything with moisture on it: fingers, gums, lips, tongue, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a very difficult time putting these on.  I&#x27;ve used several other whitening products but none have given me so much trouble as these strips.  While trying to put them on they stick to my lips and begin melting.  At that point, the strip starts to tear and more attaches to my lips.  Soon, more of this strip is on the inside of my mouth than on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and pass these up.</li>
            <li> Taste yucky but they work!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  You can see results almost immediately and for the price, it&#x27;s a great alternative to higher prices strips.  The packaging isn&#x27;t that hard to open, as long as your careful.  I would buy this product again and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Dissolves and tasted strange.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t agree with the reviews that say these are hard to handle.  Crest white strips are hard to handle.  These are a snap...but I&#x27;m not seeing any difference in my teeth color.</li>
            <li> Before I even ordered this product I read the reviews and kept hope alive. Once received  I found the strips were easy to use and had a ok taste,but didn&#x27;t show much improvement. I do like the Rembrandt toothpaste and maybe I will order the 2 hour whitening kit in the future.</li>
            <li> I really like these strips.  I&#x27;ve used all sorts of whitening products, such as mouthwash, other brands of strips, and toothpastes.  However, these strips seem to be the most convenient.  To me, the packaging is easy to open.  Just have dry hands and rip the top of the package long-ways to peel the strip out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I place the strips on my teeth and the rest is history.  They simply dissolve and no kidding, after one application I can see the difference.  I do find that I&#x27;d rather not swallow the &amp;#34;juiciness&amp;#34; effect that these strips create in my mouth.... I prefer to spit it out, which works for me since I put them in after I brush and while I&#x27;m showering/getting ready for the day in my bathroom.  I am close to a sink which is what I prefer when wearing these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these as a convenient and quick way to get noticeably whiter teeth.  I get compliments on how white my teeth are after a few days of using these things.... They&#x27;re my go-to teeth whitening product.</li>
            <li> Rembrandt is known as pretty much the best onthe market. Yes, their products can be pricey, but you don&#x27;t want to mess around when it comes to your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product does what it says it will do. It whitens your teeth. Not as good as going to the dentist, for obvious reasons, but for a home kit it&#x27;s very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strips are pretty fragile, so be careful removing them from their individual packs, but it&#x27;s not rocket science.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellant product. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> These strips work effectively and stick on better than any other kind.  Also more invisible.  They dissolve away in 10-15 minutes and do not leave an icky taste.  I have used other kinds when these were not available and none are as convenient to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use whitening strips. Disolve after 5 to 10 minutes and improve the whiteness of teeth by several shades over two weeks. Also great for maintaining a white smile/ use a couple times a week. More convenient than trays or strips that you must remove. While they are not as strong as the 20%/30% trays they work well for brightening several shades, dont irritate, plus you will actually use them!</li>
            <li> Works great will buy again.</li>
            <li> This product leaves a residue on your teeth and really does not whiten as well as Crest Strips. I truly regret this purchase. This is money wasted.</li>
            <li> Defintiely whitened the teeth substantially in two weeks.  Docked it a star because you will lose a couple to a few strips due to sticking to the packaging and tough packaging.  They are also not the easiest to apply, often getting stuck on skin as I try to apply it to my teeth.</li>
            <li> works well, noticing a difference, easy to use. Like that they dissolve. Would buy again</li>
            <li> These whitening strips don&#x27;t hurt my sensitive teeth (other brands were too harsh).  Plus these are cheaper (and you get a lot more per box than with Crest&#x27;s similar product)!  I also like that you can wear these while talking on the phone without sounding muffled!  I usually wear these while driving to the office (they&#x27;re not noticeable unless someone is really looking at your teeth close up).  If there&#x27;s any portion that hasn&#x27;t fully dissolved by the time I reach the parking lot, I just take a quick swipe with a tissue and - voila - my teeth look whiter!  I&#x27;m guessing that Rembrandt purchased this design from the Listerine brand, because these strips are almost identical to the ones I used to buy from Listerine (I don&#x27;t see that brand of strips in the stores anymore).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 11/7/13:  I&#x27;m glad to report that the strips I&#x27;m now using are easy to peel away from the backing.  (In a previous update, I had to cut open the top and 2 sides of each packet and very carefully pry up the edge of the strip with my fingernail and then try to peel the strip off the backing in one piece.)  I&#x27;m pleased that Rembrandt is now manufacturing these so the strips are easier to remove from the packets!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I unintentionally fell asleep while wearing these strips and was surprised at much whiter my teeth looked in the morning!</li>
            <li> I bought these strips thinking \\&quot;I could wear them and not even worry they will just dissolve\\&quot; No way! the taste is so bad you have to keep spitting it out, so I don&#x27;t really know if they whiten or not they taste too terrible to leave them in your mouth over 5 seconds, will not buy these again a waste of money for me...</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this online and now ordered more. It works great</li>
            <li> Wish the whiting lasted longer but good results</li>
            <li> Caused sensitivity in my teeth had to stop using it. But it did make them whiter</li>
            <li> These are the first and only strips I will probably ever use. I have sensitive teeth from grinding so I only use the strips once a day and on day 3, I&#x27;m seeing noticeably white teeth. The only thing I recommend is cutting three sides of the packet to prevent tearing when getting the strip out, but I didn&#x27;t feel the need to knock off a star for such a small thing. I&#x27;ll come back and update when I am through with the box!</li>
            <li> So i gave these a try based on the high rating.  In terms of the dissolving, in my opinion they never truly dissolve as after a while you just end up feeling like you need to brush your teeth.  As for the effectiveness I would rate them a 6 out of 10.  I didn&#x27;t see a drastic whitening change, but not as bad as the paint on whitening brushes i&#x27;ve used before.  My biggest issue with these is that while applying them they may occasionally stick to your lip prior to your teeth, ruining the structure of the strip prior to applying.</li>
            <li> I love these things! I did exactly what the instructions said - twice a day for two weeks, and I can definitely see a difference. I don&#x27;t smoke, but I drink a lot of coffee, and I&#x27;ve invested a lot of money in my teeth, so this was the last (cheap) step. Yes, you should use scissors when opening the packages, but just cut two packages at once, and it&#x27;s easy. You should also dry your hands before using these, as they stick to anything that is wet. After the first couple of applications, it&#x27;s very easy to do. These are different for everyone, but they took about 15 minutes for the bottom teeth to dissolve, and 30 for the top to dissolve. I put them on before my work commute, and before I started to get ready for bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One warning - I got pulled over after I started using them, the officer thought I had my high-beams on, but it turns out I was really just smiling.</li>
            <li> If you liked Listerine Whitening strips and were annoyed that they were discontinued, you&#x27;ll be happy to know that they&#x27;re back, exactly the same, just under a different name (I believe both brands are under the P&amp;G umbrella).</li>
            <li> FIRST, IT WAS VERY HARD TO REMOVE FROM PACKAGING, AND APPLYING THE STRIPS WITHOUT HAVE THEM STICK TO YOUR LIP, OR THE WRONG PART OF YOUR TEETH, REQUIRED SKILLS I DON&#x27;T HAVE.</li>
            <li> I heard from other review that this product works great, however i have a hard time with the taste and I don;t like what it feels like when the strips dissolve in my mouth. I know it says on the package that it is safe and no side effects were reported, but i guess i am little freaked out by swallowing all the stuff they put in it to make my teeth nice ad white.&lt;br /&gt;So i haven&#x27;t been using it regularly,&lt;br /&gt;But from few times i did put it on, i noticed a small difference and if i stick with it I bet it would work. My gums were ok and i didn&#x27;t feel irritation, except the taste.&lt;br /&gt;So if you don&#x27;t mind they taste I think this product will work.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite.  And Amazon typically has them cheaper than other places.  Can tell a difference after just a few days of use.</li>
            <li> I have used Crest whitening strips a couple of times, but decided to try Rembrandt because they are less than half the price and take less time each day.  They recommend using daily for 14 days.  Today is day 11 of diligent use (actually keep them on longer than the recommended 5-10 minutes until they dissolve, which by the way, they do not ever fully dissolve, you still need to brush to remove residue) and I really do not see a noticeable difference as I did with Crest.  The packaging is not ideal, the strips fall out if you are not careful so can drop on floor, etc.  Also, the strips tear very easily, so need to be careful in application.  I will spend the additional money and go back to Crest.</li>
            <li> Every couple months I use these to keep my teeth white.  I drink about 6 plus cups of coffee a day and my teeth get discolored after awhile.  I have used these strips on and off over the last year and really am satisfied with the results.  I use them twice a day for two weeks at a time and I see a very noticeable difference  in the color of my teeth almost immediately.  I used to use the Listerine strips but I think these are made by the same company and work the same way.  I do use scissors to cut the packets open but have no trouble using the strips.  It only takes 15 minutes for them to dissolve completely so I use them right before going out and my teeth feel and look great.  I am a satisfied customer and will keep using them as needed to keep my teeth white since I don&#x27;t plan on giving up my coffee.  My friend is the one who got me hooked on these because he always has the nicest smile and his teeth were always so white and these seems so easy to use and inexpensive to me.  I have tried the zoom whitening system from the dentist and that just made my teeth so sensitive and this doesn&#x27;t cause any sensitivity and has no bad taste.</li>
            <li> These are a great price compared to some other brands- based on the reviews here I gave them a try- I like them easy to use,and not so harsh they irritate my gums,which has happened in the past with other brands. They dissolve after a few minutes,then I brush what&#x27;s left off- have used them 3-4 times so far,and I see a solid improvement in whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I was tired of paying too much for crest whitestrips-- which don&#x27;t work anymore because of the advanced seal they have created in the recent past. I used just one of these Rembrandt  strips and I can already see a huge difference!!! If you&#x27;re on the fence about them, like I was, just get them. You will NOT regret it. They&#x27;re easy to apply and definitely do not fall apart when you&#x27;re trying to put them on. They almost resemble a piece of plastic, but they just stick to your teeth. Malleable but don&#x27;t rip easily. They do leave a film after about 15 mins, but that can easily be brushed off or rinsed off. Definitely worth the 20$! You get 56 strips!! Whereas crest only gives you about 12 strips for 26$.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it already.</li>
            <li> Ok, I think I&#x27;ll be the first to actually comment on their functionality in addition to their ease of use. There are tons of users here that are complaining about how hard they are to use. I&#x27;m sorry, but these users are simply not very bright. I have a small mouth and large lips.. a bad combo for putting on whitening strips. But I have no issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opening the package:&lt;br /&gt;Rip the top all the way across. Then each side. Then take the two halves left and completely remove the one without the strip attached. You should now be left with just the strip and the backing. It peels right off. If you do it this way, it&#x27;s dead simple to remove from the packaging. Not that hard...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Putting them on:&lt;br /&gt;Ok, getting them on my bottom teeth is always kind of difficult, but I&#x27;ve never ruined a strip. I line up the middle and stick it on my two front bottom teeth. Pull one side of your lip out of your way, and finish attaching one side, then do the other. You should be able to avoid it sticking to your lip. I&#x27;ve never had an issue with the top teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actual results:&lt;br /&gt;To be honest.. I have a few uses left, and I switched over to Crest Professional effects. While I had no issue with these strips, I saw almost no results after almost a full carton. I can see minimal difference between the teeth covered with these and my back teeth.. but it&#x27;s not much. It would probably take two cartons to notice a decent difference, at which point you could&#x27;ve just bought Crest and done it in a shorter time period.&lt;br /&gt;Take that for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> My dentists have advised me that I have thin enamal due to improper/ lack of brushing as a child.  That being said, as an adult I&#x27;ve tried my best to take care of my teeth.  I have hesitatingly tried whitening my teeth before with at home kits with disaterous results.  My teeth and gums had hurt for months only after using three strips from an aquafresh brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you can see why I was hesitent to try it one again, but I&#x27;m getting married and I feel like my teeth are way too yellow.  I can&#x27;t speak for as this works well or not for whitening, as I&#x27;m only on my third set of strips.  BUT I can say... that my teeth don&#x27;t hurt at all.  I wil say as the strips settle themselves in during its 10 min dissolve i does sting a particular part of my mouth... but I chock it up to the product working.  And it stops hurting after its dissovled.  I have no sesitivity in my teeth, and... though not white yet... I feel my teeth look cleaner.  And because the product works slowly, over the course of 2 weeks... I feel like if something were to go wrong... I could stop it quickly, and recover quickly.... rather then when I did the aquafresh one where it was clearly too late and my teeth and gums were damaged for months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess what I&#x27;m trying to say is... if you are scared to use a harsh at home teeth whitening kit.  This is probably your best bet.</li>
            <li> What a WASTE of $$$$!!! You get what you pay for. They stick to the foil and to your fingers getting it out of the package. I wasted three for every one that I got to work. Fool me once shame on You!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Used to by it at a retailer that stopped selling it. As long as you tear carefully, no problems getting to the actual strips. The whitening works great and I love that the strips dissolve.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for good whitening strips since they stopped selling the Listerine ones at Target. These are EXACTLY the same! Takes 2 weeks to work, immediate results after 1 use. Wear them to sleep so you won&#x27;t have annoying residue during the day. Also, open the package the long way AND the short way (there are two perforations) for easy access to the strip.</li>
            <li> Did not notice any change in a few days...I think you need two PhD&#x27;s to figure out how to use these things..figured it out after two days and still no results days later.  Do not waste your money</li>
            <li> Teeth were not visibly whiter after weeks of use. I&#x27;ve used other whitening strips and those help significantly more (crest white strips) but are a little pricier</li>
            <li> was pleased with the price and the amount of the product that the package contained.  i have had a problem finding the dissolving strips at the stores and if i did find this product, the price was outrageous.  the strips take away the morining coffee stains and bring the shade of your teeth a little whiter with each use.  hope the price stays the same. i will order more of this if it does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of whitening. From the $200+ Glo from sephora to toothpaste and nothing&#x27;s worked better for me than these dandy little strips. They&#x27;re prefect in every way. Some reviewers were complaining about tearing, taste and ability to put them on. Well I&#x27;m here to tell you all to not worry because they do not tear, unless you&#x27;re being rough with them. I mean think about it, these things are MADE to dissolve so if you hold onto them too long they will start melting on your hands. The taste isn&#x27;t the greatest when you first start using them but it&#x27;s not earth shattering. People were saying they&#x27;re hard to put on but that is not the case. They&#x27;re probably just over thinking it. I start with my lower teeth and hold both sides of my lip down with my ring fingers then apply the strips. Same with my upper teeth then BAM. You now have strips on your teeth to make them even more beautiful. Packaging is easy to open. They&#x27;ll melted within 30 minutes. You don&#x27;t have drool coming out of your mouth caused by trays or other non-dissolving strips. Results can be seen by the 2nd or 3rd use depending on how discolored your teeth are. I love these little boogers and would recommend them to anyone and everyone. And the best part? They&#x27;re under $20 so give them a chance and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll love them just as much as I do. :)</li>
            <li> They were good the first couple of days but then they would stick to my top teeth and the would also get stuck to my bottom lip or my gums and they take a lot longer than 10 minutes to dissolve and they taste bad. ive only been using them for a week and ive seen a slight difference</li>
            <li> Applying the strips was annoying but fairly easy. It was pretty necessary to rip off all three sides of the packaging to prevent the strip from tearing (which still happened often). Also, remembering which corner to have the notch on took a little time. Regardless, the strips stuck very well and were easy to stick on my teeth. They, however, were even more annoying to wear. Previous reviews had said they weren&#x27;t noticeable, which was aesthetically true but I could taste them as they dissolved and they tasted horrible!! Also, I had to refrain from running my tongue over it, which wasn&#x27;t too bad, but meant I couldn&#x27;t really talk for 5-10 minutes especially if I didn&#x27;t want to swallow the gross mixture of dissolving dental strips and saliva.&lt;br /&gt;After 5-10 minutes had passed, the strips dissolved only at the front of my teeth. Behind my teeth all the residue remains and small white remnants were on the corners of the front of my teeth. This was extremely annoying as I had to brush my teeth before the application to provide clean teeth for the strips to adhere to and I had to brush my teeth or at least vigorously rinse my mouth to get out the residue.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been 10 days of day and night wear of this product and I have seen no change.&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, my teeth a pretty yellow from a childhood of yellowing...&lt;br /&gt;But regardless, I haven&#x27;t seen any improvements and I&#x27;ve already used almost half the strips!!</li>
            <li> Loved it.  Great product.  Noticeable difference within only a week.  First of many purchases.  Hard to beat.</li>
            <li> Came In Such A Quick Amount Of Time! Although It Says 2 Weeks You Can See Minimal Results After Every Try! Very Easy And Convenient!</li>
            <li> Took a before and after pic... did not notice any change</li>
            <li> Strips are too hard to get out without breaking them.</li>
            <li> very difficult to apply ...tends to get glued to other parts of the mouth, lips or tongue and dislocate from the teeth. a waste of a third or more of the box.....frustrating.</li>
            <li> Will not work for everybody, but it works for me. Once i finish the box my teeth are a realistic white (not neon white) lol. By that I mean my coffee and tea stains are gone and i receive many complements on ho white my teeth are. If you are looking to achieve a noticeable white far beyond just stain removal i recommend seeing you dentist to get celebrity florescent white teeth.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money - you will get 56 packages but they are all EMPTY - what a waste of money !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1</li>
            <li> strips must be old stock ,they will stick to the packaging making it near impossible to use.</li>
            <li> they really work what else can I say!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as effective as spending hundreds at a dentist&#x27;s office. But then, you&#x27;re not spending hundreds at a dentist&#x27;s office. They work well for what they are and they don&#x27;t taste horrid.</li>
            <li> I like these strips don&#x27;t have to take them out good in 10 minutes vanish. And help your teeth and breathe smelling fresh.</li>
            <li> Have been using them for a week jury is still out</li>
            <li> better than the rembrandt 2-hour trays, best in general so far!  No fuss, no wasted time, you can use as many or as few as you need, and save the rest. great product.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and really does the job without costing a lot like the other strips. I use them every few weeks to keep my teeth bright looking.</li>
            <li> These work great, easy use, noticeable changes in a few uses.  Price is great, product is great.  I would recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I tried this product as a less-expensive alternative to Crest Whitestrips, which I have used several times over the years. Unlike Crest, the Rembrandt strips did not make my teeth sensitive AT ALL, even when I used two sets in one day - and I have fairly sensitive teeth. I really liked that these strips dissolved, so I didn&#x27;t have to worry about leaving them on for too long or pulling gooey plastic off my teeth. The box says they will dissolve in 5-10 minutes, but it generally took at about 20 for me. The whitening effect was not very dramatic; these strips are great if you want a less noticeable whitening. My teeth were definitely whiter after a few days, but they didn&#x27;t continue to get much whiter after that. I will continue to use this product every few months to keep my smile looking fresh!</li>
            <li> This worked pretty good! It does leave some residue of sticky goo, but my teeth look great!!! I&#x27;m buying more today!</li>
            <li> I have used other strips that have visibly worked for me in the first three uses....I used half the box &amp; am just beginning to notice a difference. My teeth are not horribly discolored, just enough wear &amp; tear to want something a little brighter. I am not impressed with these &amp; would not buy them again. I paid less for this brand, yes. Obviously the cheapest way is not always the most effective!</li>
            <li> These were the MESSIEST strips I have ever used. I couldn&#x27;t wait to just use them up so I could move on to the Crest and Colgate Whitestrips I usually buy. I purchased these because they were less expensive and now I know why. They dissolved immediately on my tongue and inner cheeks and were incredibly goopy and very painful. They left a burning sensation in my mouth for hours to come. I noticed no whitening effect either. I will stick to the Crest and Colgate brands for now!</li>
            <li> After a little under two weeks of consistent use, my teeth are noticeably whiter. My sister raved about how bright my smile was at a wedding. I felt a little gum sensitivity and the strips could be a bit longer, but at this rate, my teeth are going to be amazingly white when I&#x27;m finished with the kit! I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> I find these difficult to use - especially hard to locate and remove from the foil packet without pulling or tearing them, which the instructions warn you not to do.  I have a small mouth, and they&#x27;re difficult to apply without sticking to my lips.  They definitely do not dissolve within 5-10 minutes for me.  More like 20, and even then I&#x27;ll have bits stuck to my gums so I have to brush my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do leave a nice taste and my teeth feel good afterwards.  I have no idea if they whiten like they claim; this is only day 3 for me and I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll stick with it.</li>
            <li> I think these whitened okay, but they didn&#x27;t actually dissolve  in my mouth after&lt;br /&gt;10 minutes.  I don&#x27;t think you can really swallow while using these.  I put them on and&lt;br /&gt;then brushed the residual off.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Works extremely well!</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t care for these, didn&#x27;t find them all that effective.  I miss the original Crest White Strips, they were the best, I don&#x27;t know why they stopped making those.</li>
            <li> I DIDNT LIKE THE WAY IT MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH.  ONLY USED IT ONCE</li>
            <li> I love these strips. No really, I do. They are a lot better than the crest ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, they dissolve and require very minimal maintenance. Just put them on and you can continue about your day within 10-15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second of all, the strips are the perfect size. I don&#x27;t know why, but crest seems to assume that everyone has a huge mouth with huge teeth and makes the upper strip way too large. And since those strips don&#x27;t dissolve, they cause so much gagging and can even induce vomiting at times. Especially in the morning. Plus the crest strips are a pain to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirdly, it whitens teeth without making them super sensitive. (For me at least).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall, I&#x27;d give this product 5/5 stars</li>
            <li> These strips seem to whiten your teeth fairly well, but they are almost impossible to get on! I ruin at least one every time I use them. Very frustrating! I will NOT buy these again.</li>
            <li> Horrible. Sticks to everything but my teeth.  Lips, fingers, gums etc. would rate lower if possible.</li>
            <li> Whitening strips were fused to the foil wrapper, rendering them useless.</li>
            <li> I used these last year and liked them. Got them again a month ago and found them to be so thin they tear son easily they are too hard to put on.  Will try another brand.</li>
            <li> Amazing results with this product!</li>
            <li> Great product, it works well and it is especially quick and easy...not messy like some. I recommend it, I have whole family using it now, which means I have to hurry &amp; order more.</li>
            <li> These were old strips, brittle, off-taste... old.</li>
            <li> The strips had a visible effect on me, but towards the end of the two week period my teeth became quite sensitive. In general, easy to use and god effect for the price.</li>
            <li> works great takes a while for results</li>
            <li> This is the only kind of whitner to buy. easy, not bulky. just put them on and forget them.</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast delivery!!</li>
            <li> Terrible. Rips and sticks to the side and tastes disgusting. I&#x27;ll be returning to the crest brand. You get what you pay for I suppose.</li>
            <li> To difficult to apply on the teeth and the strip are easy to tear</li>
            <li> These melted before I could position them on my teeth.</li>
            <li> It is identical to the Listerine whitening strips that I was looking for at the time.  They taste the same as well.</li>
            <li> This product works great! I love it. Whitens teeth quickly.</li>
            <li> Best whitening product for the money. I think these used to be Listerine Whitening Strips.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I will continue to purchase these from you.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t use this product it does nothing but waste your time and money.</li>
            <li> I loved the listerine brand, they seemed to actually whiten my teeth but I no longer can find them so I am trying these Rembrandt since they seem to be similar. So far too soon to see results as I am on day 5, although I saw faster results with the Listerine brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always use just ONE strip! it seems a lot easier this way, who needs the back side of their teeth where no one nor yourself sees anyways? If you do this the strips will last longer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put my teeth together without overbiting and apply one strip the the front which covers my upper and lower, hold my mouth shut for about 1 minute and that gives the strip time to get wet and seperate itself from the top and bottom teeth so I can then seperate my teeth without loosing the strip. I use my tongue to get any extra strip and push it to the back side of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll come back and update once I finish the box to tell if they whitened or not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: almost 3 weeks of using these I see VERY LITTLE results as far as whitening :-(</li>
            <li> This product is much easier to use than theother whitening systems I&#x27;ve used.  Works within a few applciations.&lt;br /&gt;Apply and go, that&#x27;s all it takes!</li>
            <li> These strips can be difficult to take out of the packaging, but a little patience goes a long way. Easy application on the teeth provide for a great experience. The taste of the strips is great (typical mouth was taste) and they dissolve on your teeth within 20 minutes. I&#x27;m only on day 3 and I can see a huge difference. I would definitely purchase again. The price is also very fair when compared to other whitening strips. Five stars!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still in the process of using these whitening strips.  I have tried others and these are the best as they really do disolve and do leave a bad taste.</li>
            <li> The strips were easy to apply and dissolved within 5-10 minutes. However, the strips did not work as promised.</li>
            <li> I thought these worked very well. No intense sensitivity and easy to use. I just used them once a day on average 6 days a week.</li>
            <li> I have done 3 applications with these strips, and was really surprised at how much whiter my teeth are.  I use a whitening toothpaste which may help, but this is better than any other OTC teeth whitening product I&#x27;ve used.  The strips dissolve, and they have a minty taste that is pleasant.  However, even after 15 minutes, they did not dissolve all the way.  I had to brush my teeth afterwards.  Not a major inconvenience, which is why I give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I like these better than any of the 5 other products I&#x27;ve used to whiten teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got more whitening from 3 days of these than my wife got from 10 days of a whitening kit she got from the dentist.  Rembrandt strips were 1/3 the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not every product is for everybody, but as I look at reviews I have to wonder how many people who struggle with using these actually read and follow the directions (which are very simple).  I think they&#x27;re really easy to get out of the package and use, and with just a little practice you can get them right to the edge of the teeth and avoid contact with the gums, which is a major source of irritation with goopy trays and big, waxy strips.  Be SURE your hands are VERY DRY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found them a lot easier to apply than Crest strips, and am glad they take longer than 10 minutes to dissolve (which, if you&#x27;re patient, they do completely).  I figure that if they remain intact for 20 minutes or more, they are whitening a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An effective product that is easy to use---very well thought out.  They taste like mint, by the way---not unpleasant at all.</li>
            <li> Best white strips on the market</li>
            <li> Love these, easy &amp; they work!</li>
            <li> the old Listerine melt-in-your-mouth strips. These are easy to use, respond rapidly and the price is right. You can&#x27;t go wrong with Rembrandt.</li>
            <li> I was a bit concerned after reading a few reviews, but I made sure my hands were dry and had no issues with the strips desolving anywhere except my teeth - I haven&#x27;t been using them consistently enough to say whether they are whitening my teeth or not, but they are easy to use :-)</li>
            <li> I used the strips and saw some improvement!</li>
            <li> Great experience. Fast shipping. Great product.</li>
            <li> I got the strips quickly and they were just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Love it ! Pleasant taste &amp; works as well as my trays from dentist without the painful &amp;#34;zings&amp;#34; ! Great for people with sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Potentially the worst packaging of strips I&#x27;ve ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used 4 now...but only two ended up in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;When you open the package you have to tear it all open and that is very likely to rip the strip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll post an update on how the strips work...if I&#x27;m able to get enough of them out of the packages.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far...not a happy customer.</li>
            <li> Came fast, not a big fan of the product though.</li>
            <li> These are the best white strips I&#x27;ve ever used. Unlike Crest, they don&#x27;t leave behind a film that you have to peel off. With these, you can wear them out and not have to worry about taking them off in public (gross!). I still prefer to brush my teeth afterwards however, but it&#x27;s not necessary. Teeth look instantly whiter! The price is also great. I love these strips, best buy I&#x27;ve made. I highly recommend them if you are looking for good quality white strips. For the people who say they rip when you try to take them out of the foil, what are you doing wrong? These are easier to take out of the package than Crest strips because they don&#x27;t have that gummy, sticky gel on them. They feel like plastic until they begin to \\&quot;melt\\&quot; on the teeth. They are very easy and enjoyable to use.</li>
            <li> The strips don&#x27;t come off very easily, they mostly come off in pieces - not happy about that. Try not to get the strip on anything but your teeth because it is a little harsh on the gums. Since they are difficult to use, I&#x27;m not consistent with using them. I&#x27;ve used the kind that you take off after about 20 minutes - will go back to that type of strip</li>
            <li> They were easy to use and put on.  However, I didn&#x27;t notice any whitening of my teeth in the 2 weeks I&#x27;ve used them.  Disappointed.  I didn&#x27;t expect a professional whitening, but this did white one bit from my naked eye.  Oh well - $15 wasted.</li>
            <li> Dissolves in ten minutes and you can see the results after only a couple of times</li>
            <li> In the past I used Crest whitening strips, and they were alright.. but they were really short (only covered 4 teeth practically), and gave me sensitivity issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried my first dissolving strip set this morning. I had read online that they are difficult to get out of the package without breaking. I didn&#x27;t really find this to be the case, however I used some advice I had read. Just cut open the top and the two side panels, then peel back the packaging and you should be able to remove the strip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strips were a little hard to get to stick to my teeth, but that&#x27;s just something you get with any white strip. I was happy with how short the process took, and I actually felt like I noticed a difference on the first use. I will be using them again later today. The good thing about this box is that you get SO many strips and for sooo little compared to Crest. And the strips cover at least 8 of my teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will likely buy these again when I run out, as I foresee myself liking them more.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used whitening strips and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product. They work great. 4 days in and I already see a difference. They dissolve in 10-15 mins and the taste is minty. I don&#x27;t have any pain or sensitivity issues after. Unlike other posters on here I have had no problems with opening the package or tearing the strips.</li>
            <li> These do NOT stick to my teeth.  I purchased Rembrandt and Dental Source and it is night and day.  The box says they expire in 1 month so maybe that is the problem.  The are hard to get out of packet and they are impossible to stick!</li>
            <li> I am allergic to all Crest whitening products, so I am very happy to have found an inexpensive, easy to use alternative. After using the Rembrandt strips twice a day for nearly a month, I now apply them once a day for maintenance. They dissolve easily, well within half an hour. Great product.</li>
            <li> I believe these used to be sold as Listerine Strips and are certainly easier and more comfortable to use than the hard plastic trays.  There is also nothing to throw away except for the wrappers.  They truly work!</li>
            <li> It did not work on my daughter&#x27;s teeth.  We saw no difference.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous types of stain removing products for my teeth and this one works the best.  Easy to open package allows easy access to the stain removing strip which is also very easy to apply to teeth.&lt;br /&gt;It has noticeably reduced the amount of staining I usually get on my teeth from drinking coffee.  It does not, however, magically remove all stains and the product must be used once or twice a day to get results.  In defense of the product, the advertising on the box promotes the product as being for &amp;#34;intense stain&amp;#34; but does not promise to remove all stains and &amp;#34;magically&amp;#34; whiten your teeth.  The Rembrandt box accurately says that the strips &amp;#34;noticeably whitens tough stains, like coffee... in just minutes a day&amp;#34; which is accurate.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is the best product out there for stain removal and keeping teeth white based on my experience with about 10 different products.  The price for the Rembrandt strips is also very reasonable compared to other much more costly and less effective products.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think these whiten as effectively as Crest WhiteStrips, but the convenience of the quick dissolving means that even my fiance will use them at nighttime (he would never put up with having the WhiteStrips on for 30 minutes and then having to remove them). He used one whole box of these and I definitely notice a difference, although we&#x27;re going to get another box so he can keep using them until he&#x27;s happy with the level of whitening. He hasn&#x27;t experienced any sensitivity or pain while using them.</li>
            <li> Product was delivered on time,works great as stated,I will be buying again from Amazon, thanks!</li>
            <li> I was just looking for a few shades whiter and I&#x27;ve been getting a lot of compliments on my teeth! It&#x27;s also nice to be able to talk while you&#x27;re wearing these strips and they dissolve (for the most part) so you can just forget about them! I&#x27;ve been using them for about two weeks but now I can wear my red lipstick without worrying about if my teeth look yellow.</li>
            <li> I do like the results these give and how little time it takes.  But, placing them on my teeth is really hard.  If your fingers get even remotely wet, then the strips immediately start to dissolve and it&#x27;s almost impossible to get them onto your teeth.</li>
            <li> Does not compare with the whitestrips ....price is good but rather pay more and get better product. Worth a try to see what you think</li>
            <li> These whitening strips perform as they say, however they do not dissolve completely and leave a film on your teeth. I have to wait 20 minutes (not 5-10 minutes) for them to dissolve as much as they can, and then I brush my teeth to remove the remaining film. The film doesn&#x27;t taste bad but its uncomfortable. I also notice I get stomach upset from using these strips, likely from the dissolved chemical used in the whitening treatment that my body attempts to \\&quot;flush\\&quot; out. A very uncomfortable feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lately, the price...after I paid 29.99 for these on Amazon, I did a search to find some information on how to properly use them because its not clear which side of the strip you are supposed to use and found that you can buy them directly from Rembrant for considerably less (22.99 - 5.00 coupon &#x3D; not 29.99).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be purchasing these again. I would have given them 1 star but they actually do make my teeth look whiter, but the other considerations don&#x27;t make up for this.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
