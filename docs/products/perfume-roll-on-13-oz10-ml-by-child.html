            <li>Also I think it is the best thing that I have ever smelled, but I am repulsed by the smell of something like Chanel no. 5.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful fragrance !</li>
            <li>I also use the wonderful lotion of this product.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful for about 30-45 minutes, and then all traces of the fragrance are gone.  </li>
            <li>This is the best fragrance yet.  </li>
            <li>Great scent, great service</li>
            <li>Great winter perfume.</li>
            <li>And if you don&#x27;t - well, thats just more for me!!</li>
            <li>It smells so good</li>
            <li>LOVE this beautiful scent.</li>
            <li>What a lovely scent!  </li>
            <li>Just lovely!  </li>
            <li>I love fragrances!  </li>
            <li>just ok!</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this scent on my lady and she does too!</li>
            <li>I had heard of how amazing this perfume was and how it is made with each bottle being hand poured etc...</li>
            <li>Its a beautiful fragrance that makes you feel so fresh and feminine.</li>
            <li>Often I find myself purchasing fragrances from the niche market and having short-lived affairs with them, loving the chase and the purchase more than the scent itself.</li>
            <li>It lasts forever and is the perfect blend of feminine soft powder floral tones.</li>
            <li>Very Very light...</li>
            <li>I went to e-bay and was able to buy a sample vial for $8.00.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad that I did.  </li>
            <li>I wore it for a couple of days and boy am I glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I love to smell myself &#x3D; ).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hooked &#x3D; )</li>
            <li>&quot; I thought I&#x27;d love this scent.  </li>
            <li>It smells cheap to me (which it is not!)</li>
            <li>This stuff is fabulous!  </li>
            <li>I just love it.  </li>
            <li>...thought it was going to be better..</li>
            <li>So sexy.</li>
            <li>Love this scent and came</li>
            <li>Child lingers on my skin and clothes and smells entirely unique, like clean, warm skin</li>
            <li>Refreshing and sexy, with a light and cool, funky vibe..</li>
            <li>Oil is easy to apply and carry with you.</li>
            <li>Makes it so easy to have on hand when I can just order it here.</li>
            <li>I get that quality oils do not fade off easily</li>
            <li>It is light but has body.</li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>So clean.</li>
            <li>With the economy the way it is, I no longer wear Child every day, but rather save it for special occasions.</li>
            <li>but I feel like it&#x27;s my own lush pheremones.  </li>
            <li>If you are seriously thinking about this and having any doubts - rest assured you&#x27;re looking at probably one the best  \\&quot;cult\\&quot; oils out there.</li>
            <li>But vendor shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>I bought Child over a year ago and was not crazy about the scent because it smelled sticky sweet like gardenia.  </li>
            <li>I love the way the oil melts into my skin, as if I&#x27;m naturally emitting the fragrance.</li>
            <li>On some, it stays sweet and floral; on others, fresh, like newly washed laundry.</li>
            <li>I adore gardenia scents like Monyette Paris and Kai, so I thought I&#x27;d love this too, but no such luck.  </li>
            <li>Use as a first layer of fragrance</li>
            <li>Its a clean, classy scent!</li>
            <li>This is such a unique fragrance!</li>
            <li>My friend and I both purchased the large roll on Child Perfume along with the body cream.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and clean and slightly floral.  </li>
            <li>Downside is that some people are really allergic to it and they sneeze non-stop around it.  </li>
            <li>but this was too intense.  </li>
            <li>so fast thank you</li>
            <li>That being said, it does smell differently on each person which makes it so unique.  </li>
            <li>I have a dresser full of various perfumes, oils, etc.  </li>
            <li>I could never detect any other notes to soften seemingly pure Gardenia into a unique fragrance.</li>
            <li>At $47 for a 10ml, Child&#x27;s smaller roll-on version is not inexpensive, but for me, definitely worth the price (although $92 for the 1.3oz is the way to go).</li>
            <li>From the first day that I put child on, I have recieved compliments and countless people have stopped to ask me what I am wearing.  </li>
            <li>However, it is incredibly strong and seemed to have a single note of Pikaki/Hawaiian Jasmine which smelled very similar to Gardenia.  </li>
            <li>I rarely ever use a fragrance but found this a few years ago and like it very much.</li>
            <li>It is soft, feminine and floral.  </li>
            <li>&quot; blows all of the others completely out of the water and</li>
            <li>Give it a second and third chance if you don&#x27;t take to the scent right away.  </li>
            <li>It is tropical, lush, sweet, and fresh - a dead ringer for Hawaiian pikake - and it really does dry down differently on everyone who wears it.</li>
            <li>Lasting power isn&#x27;t as long for me as say, Sage Machado&#x27;s oils, but I don&#x27;t mind the reapplication, and if I apply it very closely to my clothes and on the back of my neck, on my hairline, it does last some time longer.</li>
            <li>Not very long lasting</li>
    </ol>

            <li> What a lovely scent!  I get compliments on it every time I wear it.  It&#x27;s light and clean and slightly floral.  Just lovely!  My husabnd chose well on this one.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Child for three years now.  I initially found out about it on a show from the style network called \\&quot;Stripped\\&quot;.  I was curious, but did not want to shell out the money that it costs.  I went to e-bay and was able to buy a sample vial for $8.00.  I am so glad that I did.  From the first day that I put child on, I have recieved compliments and countless people have stopped to ask me what I am wearing.  I cannot believe that everyone would not love this fragrance.  That being said, it does smell differently on each person which makes it so unique.  Also I think it is the best thing that I have ever smelled, but I am repulsed by the smell of something like Chanel no. 5.  Perfume is a very personal thing.  I would suggest searching the internet for samples before buying.  With the economy the way it is, I no longer wear Child every day, but rather save it for special occasions.</li>
            <li> I love fragrances!  I have a dresser full of various perfumes, oils, etc.  I recently heard about Child, and I knew that I had to try it.  It is soft, feminine and floral.  I would recommend this product in spite of the cost!  I will purchase again, when I run out!</li>
            <li> If you want to smell like heaven, you&#x27;ve found your scent!</li>
            <li> Wonderful fragrance ! Oil is easy to apply and carry with you. I also use the wonderful lotion of this product.</li>
            <li> My friend and I both purchased the large roll on Child Perfume along with the body cream.  It smells wonderful for about 30-45 minutes, and then all traces of the fragrance are gone.  I would have thought it might have been my body chemistry, but it is the same for my friend.  I will say, she has the smaller size perfume, and for whatever reason, it seems to stay on longer.  For such an expensive perfume ($98), I really expected more.</li>
            <li> I bought Child over a year ago and was not crazy about the scent because it smelled sticky sweet like gardenia.  I put it away and forgot about it.  Recently, I read in another magazine about its cult following and I pulled it out to give it another try.  I wore it for a couple of days and boy am I glad I did.  Child lingers on my skin and clothes and smells entirely unique, like clean, warm skin but I feel like it&#x27;s my own lush pheremones.  Give it a second and third chance if you don&#x27;t take to the scent right away.  Child will change your mind.</li>
            <li> Often I find myself purchasing fragrances from the niche market and having short-lived affairs with them, loving the chase and the purchase more than the scent itself. At $47 for a 10ml, Child&#x27;s smaller roll-on version is not inexpensive, but for me, definitely worth the price (although $92 for the 1.3oz is the way to go). It is tropical, lush, sweet, and fresh - a dead ringer for Hawaiian pikake - and it really does dry down differently on everyone who wears it. On some, it stays sweet and floral; on others, fresh, like newly washed laundry. This is as close to a signature scent as I&#x27;ll ever get - I love the way the oil melts into my skin, as if I&#x27;m naturally emitting the fragrance. Lasting power isn&#x27;t as long for me as say, Sage Machado&#x27;s oils, but I don&#x27;t mind the reapplication, and if I apply it very closely to my clothes and on the back of my neck, on my hairline, it does last some time longer. I&#x27;ve also tried to layer with the body lotion, which smells identical in the first few minutes, but then sadly turns to a sharp gardenia very quickly. Perhaps I&#x27;ll eventually try the limited edition spray perfume, if I could be guaranteed it will be a twin to the oil.</li>
            <li> Over the last few days I went on a bit of perfume shopping frenzy ordering up all types of \\&quot;cult oils\\&quot;.  Some of those included Child, Kai, Monyette Paris, and Sage Machado&#x27;s - Amethyst, Moon, Black Onyx.  \\&quot;Child\\&quot; blows all of the others completely out of the water and as far as I&#x27;m concerned the money that I spent on the other crap was a waste and I could have racked up on Child.  This is the best fragrance yet.  It really is addictive.  I love to smell myself &#x3D; ). I have never been that crazy about any other scent.  Its a beautiful fragrance that makes you feel so fresh and feminine. I mean, you&#x27;re not running around smelling like a bouquet - Its a clean, classy scent! If you are seriously thinking about this and having any doubts - rest assured you&#x27;re looking at probably one the best  \\&quot;cult\\&quot; oils out there. You should get it today!! And if you don&#x27;t - well, thats just more for me!! I&#x27;m hooked &#x3D; )</li>
            <li> Great scent, great service</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorites!!! Great winter perfume. Always have compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> After all the raves and \\&quot;cult status\\&quot; I thought I&#x27;d love this scent.  I adore gardenia scents like Monyette Paris and Kai, so I thought I&#x27;d love this too, but no such luck.  It smells cheap to me (which it is not!) so I sent it back.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fabulous!  It smells so good you won&#x27;t believe it-- I just love it.  Downside is that some people are really allergic to it and they sneeze non-stop around it.  Still, it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> Very Very light...cant smell unless you&#x27;re up close...thought it was going to be better..just ok! Use as a first layer of fragrance</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t understand why the bag is 6 + times larger than the small parfume bottle.....so the bag will be used for something else!</li>
            <li> LOVE this beautiful scent. Makes it so easy to have on hand when I can just order it here. I won&#x27;t ever have to run out, and then run all over town fighting traffic to go buy some.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this scent on my lady and she does too! Refreshing and sexy, with a light and cool, funky vibe..</li>
            <li> So clean. So sexy. Not very long lasting so I have to reply after a couple hours.</li>
            <li> I rarely ever use a fragrance but found this a few years ago and like it very much. It is light but has body. Subtle but with a hint of mystery. Does not remind me of anything else on the market.</li>
            <li> But vendor shipped quickly.  No issues at all with vendor, just with the actual scent of the perfume.  That&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> I do not doubt that this is made of the finest ingredients.  I had heard of how amazing this perfume was and how it is made with each bottle being hand poured etc... However, it is incredibly strong and seemed to have a single note of Pikaki/Hawaiian Jasmine which smelled very similar to Gardenia.  That may not be the case but it is how it smelled. I get that quality oils do not fade off easily but this was too intense.  I could never detect any other notes to soften seemingly pure Gardenia into a unique fragrance. I appreciate perfumes that do not fade but this gave me a two day headache because it wouldn&#x27;t go away.</li>
            <li> This is such a unique fragrance! It lasts forever and is the perfect blend of feminine soft powder floral tones.</li>
            <li> Love this scent and came so fast thank you</li>
