            <li>Amazon is the most affordable and dependable company to purchase from.</li>
            <li>I love this smell.</li>
            <li>I especially love it in the summer months when traditional perfumes are too heady and strong.</li>
            <li>It is a fresh, clean and light smell.</li>
            <li>I was very concerned purchasing online, but felt confident with Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Nice night out with my husband at a lounge and a young man walked in and this cologne hit my nose immediately.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;M A 23 YEAR OLD MALE.</li>
            <li> I hate nothing more than a cloying perfume that is too much.</li>
            <li> and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I usually order this perfume directly from Bond</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ll be ordering other bond#9 soon</li>
            <li> it was old &amp; stale or maybe counterfeit.  </li>
            <li> I wear it too work because it is just soft enough and won&#x27;t make people sick.</li>

            <li> I wear it often, at least 4 days a week</li>
            <li> This cologne is not for everyone who ever has something bad to say about is honestly no right</li>
            <li> But the worst part for me , It smells just like cat urine.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this for my man, and he absolutely loves it! I love it, too! It has a unisex smell, but not too feminine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M A 23 YEAR OLD MALE. I BOUGHT THIS FRAGANCE STRAIGHT FROM AMAZON.COM LLC THE COLOGNE IS LEGIT. BUY W/ CONFIDENCE, I GET COMPLIMENTS ALL THE TIME ON THIS COLOGNE. :-)</li>
            <li> I find this beautiful scent to be unisex. My Boyfriend and I refer to it as \\&quot;our scent\\&quot;. We both wear it. It is a fresh, clean and light smell. It melds with your skin&#x27;s personal chemistry and smells differently on him and on me. I especially love it in the summer months when traditional perfumes are too heady and strong. This is always perfect and appropriate. I wear it too work because it is just soft enough and won&#x27;t make people sick. I hate nothing more than a cloying perfume that is too much. Hamptons is truly perfect for anyone.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and so does everyone else?</li>
            <li> This perfume Is repulsive. It&#x27;s is extemely synthetic. But the worst part for me , It smells just like cat urine. If you mixed cat urine , Silver mountain water , and grass that&#x27;s been cut that&#x27;s old this is what you get. no idea how this is a popular juice. !</li>
            <li> I usually order this perfume directly from Bond No 9 or Sak&#x27;s online at $220.  So I was concerned that paying only $175 on amazon might mean there was something wrong  -either it was old &amp; stale or maybe counterfeit.  Also since there was a no-return policy on this purchase i was worried. But no - it was perfect and in exactly the same packing as prior orders directly from Bond No 9.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy I found this great source for discounted Hamptons.  Love the scent - always get compliments on it.  Seems to have some staying power unlike a lot of perfumes on me which fade fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend both the perfume and amazon as seller!</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this fragrance at least 7 years ago. love the price I paid here. I wear it often, at least 4 days a week and I&#x27;m only about half way through the bottle (which I&#x27;ve had for a year). Perfect for the day when I don&#x27;t want something too strong. elegant, classy, refined, summery. fantastic!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like a horses patoot!  Not like the sex panther I was looking for. It works 0 percent of the time all the time!!!</li>
            <li> This is such a unique scent and always grabs people&#x27;s attention. Its smooth and elegant, perfect for a nice dinner date or night on the town. Excellent EDP and it lasts a long time. Would love to try more from Bond</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Bond No. 9 Hamptons for about 3 years.  This does not smell like what I have been wearing.  I wonder if it is counterfeit.</li>
            <li> This cologne is not for everyone who ever has something bad to say about is honestly no right everyone loves this cologne every time I pass by people they stop to ask what kind I&#x27;m wearing.  It really is worth the money</li>
            <li> teriible small dhont hes something like Naturality, nhot recomended, a had i boght bond i love ny blu was great nice i am gann bay again</li>
            <li> Excellent scent.  Originally tried in store and loved it.  Appears to be very concentrated so requires only small amount for full day of smelling great.  I was very concerned purchasing online, but felt confident with Amazon.  Always a trusted merchant.</li>
            <li> This was just ok,nothing special,not too many comments like what you wearing?i will not order it again unless it&#x27;s on sale for a very low price</li>
            <li> Nice night out with my husband at a lounge and a young man walked in and this cologne hit my nose immediately. We got acquainted with the male and by the end of the night he handed over the bottle of cologne to a drunk women who then gave it to my husband (That&#x27;s the short story). When he ran out I had to get him more.  Amazon is the most affordable and dependable company to purchase from.</li>
            <li> I love this smell. I&#x27;ll be ordering other bond#9 soon</li>
            <li> Well I gave it a star because the bottle looks nice but other then that . I think I got a fake bottle smell don&#x27;t last no more then 5 hrs I men for the price this thing should last all day if its the original but next time I&#x27;m just gonna go to joe brand and pay 250.00 for the real thing.</li>
            <li> Unique long lasting scent. I always get compliments.</li>
