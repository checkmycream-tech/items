    <ol>
            <li>The shave from this Wilkinson is excellent.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Improving&amp;#34; something that was perfect makes no sense.</li>
            <li>Best razor I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>My man was very happy of Wilkinson</li>
            <li>Best razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li>My husband, daughter and I love this razor!!!  </li>
            <li>Great razor.</li>
            <li>It works great</li>
            <li>However, I can honestly say that I was impressed.</li>
            <li>Great razors for the price.  </li>
            <li>and so glad that I did!!</li>
            <li>LOVE it!!</li>
            <li>This is better than the most pricey one!!!</li>
            <li>this blade does a good job.</li>
            <li>Good product good delivery time</li>
            <li>They are amazing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;With kindly records,&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li>Maybe they&#x27;re not as good as the original, coming form China or maybe shaving</li>
            <li>For the money you can not find a better shave.  </li>
            <li>love it  razor and  Wilkinson blades much more usage vs others</li>
            <li>The handle has more &amp;#34;heft&amp;#34; than most and feels sturdy.</li>
            <li>They are simply the best - great shave, reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>What more can I say?  </li>
            <li>Purchased this after reading rave reviews of how much better and cheaper this was compared to mach 3.</li>
            <li>Handle&#x27;s identical, but blades maybe somewhat better than the Schick version, which I used for years.  </li>
            <li>These blades don&#x27;t seem to have the trimmer blade on top, though, like my Schicks did.  </li>
            <li>These I am considering buying monthly because it is so much better of an experience than the throw-away razors I&#x27;ve been using and juggling between.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was paying $16.00 for a pack of four cartridges of another brand and they are great razor blades, but as of this writing, I can get a pack of four Tech 4 razor blades for $4.50...a fraction of the price of the high tech blades and just as effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>just as good as razors that cost 3x&#x27;s as much.</li>
            <li>Smooth shave every time</li>
            <li>Glad to find this economical alternative.</li>
            <li>And I plan to continue to enjoy it from now on.</li>
            <li>However, I get the best results by shaving right after taking a shower, leaving my face wet until after I have shaved.</li>
            <li>Blade released hair very easily under the faucet with almost no tapping on the sink and the over-sized blade guarding cover is very easy to pull off and put back on.</li>
            <li>Getting a reasonably close shave from an easy to use and clean, cartridge replaceable razor on the cheap?</li>
            <li>So much that I bought two four-cartridge packs and one more razor/cartridge set...one to use at home and another set to use while traveling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Quickly ate through what was a 2, almost 3 week beard and mustache for me in under 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Mach3 blades forever -- hundreds of dollars worth.  </li>
            <li>$6 blades is way better than nearly $40 Gillete blades.  </li>
            <li>Sharp, smooth, easy to clean, inexpensive!  </li>
            <li>If Wilkinson Sword / Schick keeps making them, I&#x27;ll keep buying them as the price to performance ratio is better than any other razor currently available.</li>
            <li>Amazon is the only place I&#x27;ve been able to find this razor</li>
            <li>Replacement blades are priced about the same as these shave club razors popping up everywhere, but the performance is much better.</li>
            <li>Thanks Wilkinson!</li>
            <li>It does an excellent job and the replacement blades are half the prices as other brands.  </li>
            <li>I finally could not find them anywhere and switched to more modern blades/</li>
            <li>I suppose some things are never as good as you thought they were in the past.  </li>
            <li>I prefer razor 3, much cheaper and better&lt;br /&gt;Paul</li>
            <li>Product was shipped fast and arrived intact.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper</li>
            <li>The replacement blades are reasonably priced,as well.</li>
            <li>Sword.&lt;br /&gt;It is very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>really?)</li>
            <li>I totally recommend this to anyone needing a close smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>Considering the company sells replacement cartridges and they are extremely reasonably priced, this razor is a legitimate competitor with Gillette.</li>
            <li>Definitely something I enjoy.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>Brand spankings new!</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t get the same smooth shave, you don&#x27;t get near the closeness.  </li>
            <li>have an old Schick Quattro handle that I love to death, and I bought a pack of Tech 4 cartridges and they look identical to the normal (non-titanium) Schick Quattro refills (the black ones with the turquoise strip) and work just as well.  </li>
            <li>(figuring I&#x27;d get a new Mach3).  </li>
            <li>This razor, and it&#x27;s refills, are *exactly* the same as the Schick Quattro.  </li>
            <li>Not a big deal, just something to be aware of, if that matters to you.</li>
            <li>The are difficult to keep in the right position with the right amount of pressure to get a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I am 64 years old with a heavy beard and the blade last me for a month or more before changing.</li>
            <li>Shaves well, if you shave nearly every day, but don&#x27;t go 4-5 days and expect it to work well.</li>
            <li>I figured for the low price I didn&#x27;t have much to lose.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s no &#x27;worst to worst&#x27; scenario here -- this razor is AMAZING!  </li>
            <li>Was exactly as advertised and expected</li>
            <li>Had to go back to my old Gillette M3 to finish up a 4 day growth.</li>
            <li>Technically, Schick razors are re-branded Wilkinson Sword razors, and the Quattro/Tech 4 series is completely identical and interchangeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>has improved with all of the lubricants, etc.; but it took a while to get back to shaving with the old style blades.</li>
            <li>was a new Wilkinson 4 blade razor with 2 extra blades for $5.00 and a 4 pack of replacements for only $6.00.  </li>

            <li> was a new Wilkinson 4 blade razor with 2 extra blades for $5.00 and a 4 pack of replacements for only $6.00.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Fusion razor since I was 18 almost a decade ago and have never bought replacement cartridges for it because they were simply overpriced and didn&#x27;t last long enough for what you paid for them.</li>
            <li> A few months ago I ran across an online ad for a &#x27;generic&#x27; razor with a 2 pack of 5 cartridges and trashed my old mach3 ($40 a pop for replacements?  </li>
            <li> Its harder to get a close shave and the blades don&#x27;t last as long.  </li>
            <li> For entire time the tech 4 has been on the market I would not use any other razor .</li>
            <li> I dry the blade after every shave and store it in baby oil.</li>
            <li> Blades stay sharp a long time.</li>
            <li> Not at all what I had hoped for or expected.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really careful not to irritate my skin while shaving.</li>
            <li> Facial hair is easier to shave off, there&#x27;s hardly any irritation, less chances of infections from a cut and blades last longer.</li>
            <li> I tried other brands in the past but then went back to the overpriced razors of Gillete.  </li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewer before mine.</li>
            <li> The slight difference I saved was NOT worth it.</li>
            <li> Holy cow, this is the Holy Grail of razors!  </li>
            <li> The blades seem set too deeply and pressing firmly still fails to remove my daily growth.</li>
            <li> These were not like the Wilkinson razors I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> Not better than the Tech 3 it replaces.</li>
            <li> Just picked these razors up and for the price, they&#x27;re unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the Schick Quattro in years due to how expensive they were.</li>
            <li> The Tech 4 may also be less expensive compared to the Schick-branded blades.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money expensive razor.</li>
            <li> Poor design.</li>
            <li> I am unable to get a close shave.  </li>
            <li> mediocre and will look for an alternative</li>
            <li> The blades clog up and won&#x27;t rinse out, which causes the blades to skip badly.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when you couldn&#x27;t get Wilkinson in the USA after they were bought out.  </li>
            <li> Terrible!</li>
            <li> thinking if worst came to worst I could always start the search over when I used up the Wilkinson blades...  </li>

            <li> My husband, daughter and I love this razor!!!  It does an excellent job and the replacement blades are half the prices as other brands.  Amazon is the only place I&#x27;ve been able to find this razor and so glad that I did!!</li>
            <li> I prefer razor 3, much cheaper and better&lt;br /&gt;Paul</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Like the razor . It was shipped promptly and meets my expectations.</li>
            <li> gift to my husband and he loves it</li>
            <li> I started buying Wilkinson Sword razors and blades several years ago because of the cost.  They are amazing.  Wal-Mart in Williamston, NC stopped carrying the Tech 4 blades, they only have Tech 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I ordered from Amazon to get the replacement blades.  For the money you can not find a better shave.  I tried them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 64 years old with a heavy beard and the blade last me for a month or more before changing.</li>
            <li> I change the blade every Sunday and I shave every day this blade does a good job. I lather up and it works well.</li>
            <li> love it  razor and  Wilkinson blades much more usage vs others</li>
            <li> Product was shipped fast and arrived intact. Great razor.</li>
            <li> I like the razor. The handle has more &amp;#34;heft&amp;#34; than most and feels sturdy. Blades work well. Wilkinson seems to sell at a discpunt compared to Gilette while the product is comparable.</li>
            <li> They are simply the best - great shave, reasonable price.  What more can I say?  I&#x27;ve been using Wilkinson blades for years and now I can get them delivered.</li>
            <li> These were not like the Wilkinson razors I&#x27;ve used in the past.  The are difficult to keep in the right position with the right amount of pressure to get a smooth shave.  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase these again.</li>
            <li> Purchased this after reading rave reviews of how much better and cheaper this was compared to mach 3. It&#x27;s much cheaper but it does not shave close at all. I have to use several strikes just to get visibly closer but need to shave every day, as opposed to every 3 days with mach 3</li>
            <li> I purchased the Wilkenson Sword Tech 4 razor to replace my Gillette Fusion. This product works just as well for me and I purchased both the razor and replacement blades for a fraction of the cost of the Gillette.</li>
            <li> for the money, can&#x27;t be beat. just as good as razors that cost 3x&#x27;s as much.</li>
            <li> Good product good delivery time</li>
            <li> The shave from this Wilkinson is excellent. The replacement blades are reasonably priced,as well. I haven&#x27;t had to buy replacements yet,because I have made the two blades that came with my razor last for months. I dry the blade after every shave and store it in baby oil. I replace the baby oil occasionally, that&#x27;s all. Smooth shave every time</li>
            <li> Not at all what I had hoped for or expected.</li>
            <li> what out gillette ......</li>
            <li> Not better than the Tech 3 it replaces. More expensive than the Tech 3.  Why was this made?  Schick/Wilkinson should have lewft well enough alone. &amp;#34;Improving&amp;#34; something that was perfect makes no sense.</li>
            <li> Terrible! Poor design. I won&#x27;t buy that again.</li>
            <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve found.  Blades stay sharp a long time.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the Schick Quattro in years due to how expensive they were. The Wilkinson Sword Tech 4 is a rebranded Schick Quattro; the cartridges are interchangeable. When I last used them, the performance was on par with the Gillette Fusion and Mach 3 Turbo. They still perform as well, but at a fraction of the price. Replacement blades are priced about the same as these shave club razors popping up everywhere, but the performance is much better. If Wilkinson Sword / Schick keeps making them, I&#x27;ll keep buying them as the price to performance ratio is better than any other razor currently available.</li>
            <li> My man was very happy of Wilkinson Sword.&lt;br /&gt;It is very good.&lt;br /&gt;It was also soon here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With kindly records,&lt;br /&gt;Your Arja</li>
            <li> I am unable to get a close shave.  The blades seem set too deeply and pressing firmly still fails to remove my daily growth.</li>
            <li> Best razor I have ever used. Forget using the Venus for women.. this one takes the cake!!! LOVE it!!</li>
            <li> Shaves well, if you shave nearly every day, but don&#x27;t go 4-5 days and expect it to work well. The blades clog up and won&#x27;t rinse out, which causes the blades to skip badly. Had to go back to my old Gillette M3 to finish up a 4 day growth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Mach3 blades forever -- hundreds of dollars worth.  A few months ago I ran across an online ad for a &#x27;generic&#x27; razor with a 2 pack of 5 cartridges and trashed my old mach3 ($40 a pop for replacements?  really?) and when I ran out of blades for the generic, I took a look-see in WalMart (figuring I&#x27;d get a new Mach3).  There hanging in all it&#x27;s glory was a new Wilkinson 4 blade razor with 2 extra blades for $5.00 and a 4 pack of replacements for only $6.00.  What a bargain!  So I took it home thinking if worst came to worst I could always start the search over when I used up the Wilkinson blades...  BUT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no &#x27;worst to worst&#x27; scenario here -- this razor is AMAZING!  Sharp, smooth, easy to clean, inexpensive!  Holy cow, this is the Holy Grail of razors!  I totally recommend this to anyone needing a close smooth shave.  And a bargain to boot!</li>
            <li> Advertised as &amp;#34;the same&amp;#34; as Schick Titanium Quatro.  They are not.  You don&#x27;t get the same smooth shave, you don&#x27;t get near the closeness.  The slight difference I saved was NOT worth it.</li>
            <li> Was exactly as advertised and expected</li>
            <li> This razor, and it&#x27;s refills, are *exactly* the same as the Schick Quattro.  Technically, Schick razors are re-branded Wilkinson Sword razors, and the Quattro/Tech 4 series is completely identical and interchangeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an old Schick Quattro handle that I love to death, and I bought a pack of Tech 4 cartridges and they look identical to the normal (non-titanium) Schick Quattro refills (the black ones with the turquoise strip) and work just as well.  The Tech 4 may also be less expensive compared to the Schick-branded blades.</li>
            <li> I tried other brands in the past but then went back to the overpriced razors of Gillete.  However I came across this product at Walmart and it had the same features as Gillete (multiple blades, aloe strip on pivoting head).  It works great and I plan to keep buying this product from now on. $6 blades is way better than nearly $40 Gillete blades.  I agree with the other reviewer before mine.</li>
            <li> Handle&#x27;s identical, but blades maybe somewhat better than the Schick version, which I used for years.  Glad to find this economical alternative. These blades don&#x27;t seem to have the trimmer blade on top, though, like my Schicks did.  Not a big deal, just something to be aware of, if that matters to you.</li>
            <li> For entire time the tech 4 has been on the market I would not use any other razor . William fousek</li>
            <li> Just picked these razors up and for the price, they&#x27;re unbelievable. Quickly ate through what was a 2, almost 3 week beard and mustache for me in under 5 minutes. Blade released hair very easily under the faucet with almost no tapping on the sink and the over-sized blade guarding cover is very easy to pull off and put back on. Considering the company sells replacement cartridges and they are extremely reasonably priced, this razor is a legitimate competitor with Gillette. I&#x27;ve had a Fusion razor since I was 18 almost a decade ago and have never bought replacement cartridges for it because they were simply overpriced and didn&#x27;t last long enough for what you paid for them. These I am considering buying monthly because it is so much better of an experience than the throw-away razors I&#x27;ve been using and juggling between. Getting a reasonably close shave from an easy to use and clean, cartridge replaceable razor on the cheap? Definitely something I enjoy. And I plan to continue to enjoy it from now on. Thanks Wilkinson!</li>
            <li> I started using Wilkinson Tech 4 blades after seen them at Big Lots for $4.50 for the razor and two cartridges. I figured for the low price I didn&#x27;t have much to lose. However, I can honestly say that I was impressed. So much that I bought two four-cartridge packs and one more razor/cartridge set...one to use at home and another set to use while traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was paying $16.00 for a pack of four cartridges of another brand and they are great razor blades, but as of this writing, I can get a pack of four Tech 4 razor blades for $4.50...a fraction of the price of the high tech blades and just as effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: I&#x27;ve been shaving almost daily since 1975 when I joined the Army and I&#x27;m really careful not to irritate my skin while shaving. I&#x27;ve used countless of shaving products and different types of blades. However, I get the best results by shaving right after taking a shower, leaving my face wet until after I have shaved. Facial hair is easier to shave off, there&#x27;s hardly any irritation, less chances of infections from a cut and blades last longer.</li>
            <li> mediocre and will look for an alternative</li>
            <li> Father loves it! Brand spankings new!</li>
            <li> Great razors for the price.  Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I suppose some things are never as good as you thought they were in the past.  I was very disappointed when you couldn&#x27;t get Wilkinson in the USA after they were bought out.  I used to buy a year&#x27;s supply in Canada on vacation and bring them home.  I finally could not find them anywhere and switched to more modern blades/razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw these and had to try them.  Maybe they&#x27;re not as good as the original, coming form China or maybe shaving has improved with all of the lubricants, etc.; but it took a while to get back to shaving with the old style blades. Its harder to get a close shave and the blades don&#x27;t last as long.  You can&#x27;t go home again.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money expensive razor. This is better than the most pricey one!!!</li>
