            <li>/&gt;It is light, but my hairdresser expressed to me the need to spray lighly, let dry, and spray again for the best hold.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Regardless - Big and Sexy Hair Spray is a great product.  </li>
            <li>This is the best hairspray I&#x27;ve ever had hands down.</li>
            <li>Yes, it holds, but I have fine hair.</li>

            <li>..doesnt break or damage ur fine hair...</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length fine hair that tends toward curly...</li>
            <li>it holds the hair perfectly fine</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and tends not hold a style - using this spray</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just amazing with volumizing and holding down those fly always.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are others out there that are great, but I love that this doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, and holds my hair in place without looking &amp;#34;sprayed&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Nice large can.</li>
            <li>Spray lightly</li>
            <li>If I just want a day look, I light up sections of my hair and spray the root.</li>
            <li>This hair spray is not always available in our stores.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh refreshing &amp; pretty&lt;br /&gt;Always sprays lightly, dries quickly, and holds well.  </li>
            <li>I sell beauty supply on a daily basis and have tried many hair sprays, but this is definitely my top pick!</li>
            <li>I am a loyal user of this product and it was quick and easy to buy it on-line for use.</li>
            <li>If you need it right away - just be advised that if you are a Prime member - you might be waiting around 5-days to receive your product!</li>
            <li>Love the product and thank you for getting it to me fast.</li>
            <li>Im a hairstylist and this by far was one of the best buys i have spent money on in a while.</li>
            <li>I love all the Big Sexy Hair products and their hairspray is no exception.</li>
            <li>Hands tremendous texture and body but not sticky.</li>
            <li>Love this product, i have been using it for years, one of the products every girls should have owned it, highly recommend.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is just something about its ability to hold and live through touching of the hair and wind that keep me coming back.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My husband loves Big &amp; Sexy Hair Spray!&lt;br /&gt;Be blessed on this Spring Day!</li>
            <li>last all day amazing product</li>
            <li>worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>Other than an occasional sale somewhere, Amazon has the best price.</li>
            <li>Holds nice but just a little crunch but not bad.  </li>
            <li>Works pretty good, haven&#x27;t used it too much yet but seems to hold pretty well (not an extreme hold) and does seem to be pretty flexible.</li>
            <li>..sticky at first</li>
            <li>I like all of the products I have tried from Big Sexy Hair.</li>
            <li>I have used many, many hair sprays in the past.  </li>
            <li>And I have had many, many styles in the past.  </li>
            <li>I cant even tell you how many different types of hairsprays I&#x27;ve tried .</li>
            <li>But not Big and Sexy.</li>
            <li>Love this hairspray and recommend it anyone who is looking for a quality hairspray that actually works!</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t tried Big Sexy Hair Spray products, do it.</li>
            <li>i have tried many others, and always end up coming back to Big Sexy Spray &amp; Play.  </li>
            <li>and I use Big Sexy Hair Teasing Spray and then finish with this.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do and does it well</li>
            <li>This spray gives a good hold without looking stiff.</li>
            <li>I have very long, very fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get what all the positive reviews are about.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Should get it at Marshall or Ross for a real deal;)</li>
            <li>I really love this stuff and will continue to use it as long as they continue to sell it.</li>
            <li>Brushes out really easily and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky after being brushed out.</li>
            <li>It holds so nicely and at first you think it will be crisp and hard</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get sticky and drys fast.</li>
            <li>Big Sexy Spray &amp; Play regular is my favorite and only hair spray.  </li>
            <li>I really like this spray compared to the Moroccan Oil one I was using.</li>
            <li>A can lasts me almost a year, but I use only a light spritz 5 days a week.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Hands down, my favorite hairspray.  </li>
            <li>Wish they would come down on the price, I think it&#x27;s overpriced but works better than any hairspray I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>favorite spray, half the cost</li>
            <li>Somehow I keep coming back to Big, Sexy Hairspray.  </li>
            <li>I only use Big Sexy Hair hair spray.  </li>
            <li>They have different strengths etc for different styles and hair types so make sure you know what you&#x27;re choosing.</li>
            <li>Hardly no smell and makes hair stand up or keeps hair set.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried others, then go right back to this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for keeping the fly-aways tamed in an updo, but when I curl my hair and spray the mid-shaft and ends, it gets ugly real fast.</li>
            <li>but it softens up and is very natural.  </li>
            <li>It holds hair well and does not leave residue in hair (important if you have dark hair and don&#x27;t want to look like you have lots of dandruff).  </li>
            <li>I have thick but very fine hair and this product gives me lots of texture and volume.</li>
            <li>The scent is not bad either compared to other sprays I have used.</li>
            <li>Also, it is not stiff.  </li>
            <li>You can still style you hair after you use it and its not terribly stiff.</li>
            <li>This spray gives my hair body and holds all day whether I wear it natural or styled.  </li>
            <li>It does very well for the Big hair that texan women like</li>
            <li>The can so far has lasted almost 2 months, I spray every day.</li>
            <li>This leaves my hair bouncy , natural looking ( not crunchy) and almost soft even.</li>
            <li>and then woke up with my curls still completely intact.</li>
            <li>and it looks perfectly natural.</li>
            <li>Absolutely professional grade.  </li>
            <li>This brand of hairspray and also Adorn are the only 2 brands that really work in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Not too heavy but just enough to keep my curls in for the day :)</li>
            <li>If you live in Florida, few things besides super glue keep your &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; from falling.</li>
            <li>If I have a more subtle style then I just spray for hold.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the Gold Standard, but quite the reliable hair spray at a decent price.</li>
            <li>YOU can&#x27;t go wrong with BIB SEXY!</li>
            <li>though price is little high but it really works as Volume adding hair spray</li>
            <li>I have very thick, fine hair and this spray allows me run my fingers through it and make it look like I just styled it.</li>
            <li>Some might find it a little too stiff but for fine hair</li>

            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried Big Sexy Hair Spray products, do it.</li>
            <li> i have tried many others, and always end up coming back to Big Sexy Spray &amp; Play.  </li>
            <li> and I use Big Sexy Hair Teasing Spray and then finish with this.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do and does it well</li>
            <li> This spray gives a good hold without looking stiff.</li>
            <li> I have very long, very fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get what all the positive reviews are about.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Should get it at Marshall or Ross for a real deal;)</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff and will continue to use it as long as they continue to sell it.</li>
            <li> Brushes out really easily and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky after being brushed out.</li>
            <li> It holds so nicely and at first you think it will be crisp and hard</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get sticky and drys fast.</li>
            <li> Big Sexy Spray &amp; Play regular is my favorite and only hair spray.  </li>
            <li> I really like this spray compared to the Moroccan Oil one I was using.</li>
            <li> A can lasts me almost a year, but I use only a light spritz 5 days a week.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Hands down, my favorite hairspray.  </li>
            <li> Wish they would come down on the price, I think it&#x27;s overpriced but works better than any hairspray I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> favorite spray, half the cost</li>
            <li> Somehow I keep coming back to Big, Sexy Hairspray.  </li>
            <li> I only use Big Sexy Hair hair spray.  </li>
            <li> They have different strengths etc for different styles and hair types so make sure you know what you&#x27;re choosing.</li>
            <li> Hardly no smell and makes hair stand up or keeps hair set.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried others, then go right back to this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for keeping the fly-aways tamed in an updo, but when I curl my hair and spray the mid-shaft and ends, it gets ugly real fast.</li>
            <li> but it softens up and is very natural.  </li>
            <li> It holds hair well and does not leave residue in hair (important if you have dark hair and don&#x27;t want to look like you have lots of dandruff).  </li>
            <li> I have thick but very fine hair and this product gives me lots of texture and volume.</li>
            <li> The scent is not bad either compared to other sprays I have used.</li>
            <li> Also, it is not stiff.  </li>
            <li> You can still style you hair after you use it and its not terribly stiff.</li>
            <li> This spray gives my hair body and holds all day whether I wear it natural or styled.  </li>
            <li> It does very well for the Big hair that texan women like</li>
            <li> The can so far has lasted almost 2 months, I spray every day.</li>
            <li> This leaves my hair bouncy , natural looking ( not crunchy) and almost soft even.</li>
            <li> and then woke up with my curls still completely intact.</li>
            <li> and it looks perfectly natural.</li>
            <li> Absolutely professional grade.  </li>
            <li> This brand of hairspray and also Adorn are the only 2 brands that really work in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy but just enough to keep my curls in for the day :)</li>
            <li> If you live in Florida, few things besides super glue keep your &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; from falling.</li>
            <li> If I have a more subtle style then I just spray for hold.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the Gold Standard, but quite the reliable hair spray at a decent price.</li>
            <li> YOU can&#x27;t go wrong with BIB SEXY!</li>
            <li> though price is little high but it really works as Volume adding hair spray</li>
            <li> I have very thick, fine hair and this spray allows me run my fingers through it and make it look like I just styled it.</li>
            <li> Some might find it a little too stiff but for fine hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Big Sexy products that I liked, but this one is awful.</li>
            <li> She sometimes finds it for less in a discount store, but we find it on Amazon for less than it costs in the big department stores that stock it consistently.</li>
            <li> This hairspray leaves my hair so dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> Love the hair spray, just wish it was less expensive!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s just too much for my poor hair to handle.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite hairspray it holds well and doesn&#x27;t leave that nasty build up like other hair sprays do.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Wonder if it would work with other brands???????</li>
            <li> bought this based on all the other reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the other brands.</li>
            <li> Your style will last a few days with a little bit of care.</li>
            <li> I have thick, straight hair, and it&#x27;s hard for me to get any body into it, but this spray does the trick for me.</li>
            <li> i have dark hair).  </li>
            <li> Product turn sticky and heavy even with minimal use.</li>
            <li> then hair settles down..</li>
            <li> I have even laid down for a nap</li>
            <li> Hair does not have that glued down appearance with this spray.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair that I often like to curl.</li>
            <li> You can spray a ton on for the &amp;#34;AquaNet&amp;#34; effect and it holds; or spray a little</li>
            <li> A little sticky.</li>
            <li> My wife tries every fancy expensive hair spray that her hair dresser suggests, but she keeps coming back to this one.  </li>
            <li> Firm hold without the helmet head or crunchy texture.  </li>
            <li> Holds your hair with just a little spray without making it stiff.</li>
            <li> Does give a stiff feel.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if I like my hair being as stiff and sticky as this makes it.</li>
            <li> as well b/c there is no better hairspray than this.</li>
            <li> Strangely however I was unable to receive this product through my Prime shipping.  </li>
            <li> Sticky and makes my hair very stiff.</li>
            <li> It does wonders to my hair and does not make your hair hard or flaky, but keeps the style of your hair.</li>
            <li> It is the only hair spray that gives me a crazy amount of volume without making me look like I have a beehive on my head.</li>
            <li> In spite of the frivilous title, this is serious hair spray.  </li>
            <li> This hair spray is sickly.</li>
            <li> I need hold, but hate feeling like my hair is plastered.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get what all the positive reviews are about. This hairspray leaves my hair so dry and frizzy. Yes, it holds, but I have fine hair. I think it&#x27;s just too much for my poor hair to handle. It&#x27;s great for keeping the fly-aways tamed in an updo, but when I curl my hair and spray the mid-shaft and ends, it gets ugly real fast.</li>
            <li> My husband loves Big &amp; Sexy Hair Spray!&lt;br /&gt;Be blessed on this Spring Day!</li>
            <li> The only hair spray my daughter will use.....she loves it.  It arrived in a timely fashion and was well packaged to prevent damage.  Would definitely recommend to others</li>
            <li> I loved this stuff until I moved to a humid climate. Just doesn&#x27;t hold up well in humidity as described. Product turn sticky and heavy even with minimal use.</li>
            <li> Best hair spray ever.  It has great hold and is great if you have a spikey style.  I spray it on my fingers and then spike up my hair.  If I have a more subtle style then I just spray for hold.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price!</li>
            <li> love this stuff..once u use this u never wanna be without..works well if u use nexus with too..sticky at first then hair settles down..fine hair styles last all day amazing product..doesnt break or damage ur fine hair...</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length fine hair that tends toward curly...sometimes.  This spray gives my hair body and holds all day whether I wear it natural or styled.  Some might find it a little too stiff but for fine hair it&#x27;s great.  I like all of the products I have tried from Big Sexy Hair.</li>
            <li> I have used many, many hair sprays in the past.  And I have had many, many styles in the past.  Somehow I keep coming back to Big, Sexy Hairspray.  There is just something about its ability to hold and live through touching of the hair and wind that keep me coming back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is light, but my hairdresser expressed to me the need to spray lighly, let dry, and spray again for the best hold.  That has worked miracles for me.  Wonder if it would work with other brands???????</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray!!!! It is one of my favorites!!! It does very well for the Big hair that texan women like</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and offer no complaints - it provides a lot of holding power but my hair still moves.  The price was better than department stores.  Strangely however I was unable to receive this product through my Prime shipping.  When I contacted Amazon about the delivery delay - I was advised that it couldn&#x27;t be sent via the 2-day delivery since it had to be mailed via ground travel.  What was weird was that I also ordered Sebastian Shaper Plus Hairspray which was able to be received through 2-day shipping.  I have no idea why two different hairsprays would require two different shipping methods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless - Big and Sexy Hair Spray is a great product.  If you need it right away - just be advised that if you are a Prime member - you might be waiting around 5-days to receive your product!</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray !!</li>
            <li> This is the one and only hairspray that I have stuck with for a couple of years now.  I&#x27;ve tried others, then go right back to this.</li>
            <li> I like it better than any spray that I have ever used.  Better than mouse, too.  Hardly no smell and makes hair stand up or keeps hair set.  Also, it is not stiff.  The can so far has lasted almost 2 months, I spray every day.</li>
            <li> Love the hair spray, just wish it was less expensive!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hairspray of all time! I sell beauty supply on a daily basis and have tried many hair sprays, but this is definitely my top pick! It gives you all the volume and hold you need whether you&#x27;re going out or just working all day!</li>
            <li> If you live in Florida, few things besides super glue keep your &amp;#34;do&amp;#34; from falling. This spray works well. Good product.</li>
            <li> I love this hair spray!  I won&#x27;t use anything else.  A little goes a long way. It doesn&#x27;t get sticky and drys fast. Perfect for frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> My wife tries every fancy expensive hair spray that her hair dresser suggests, but she keeps coming back to this one.  She sometimes finds it for less in a discount store, but we find it on Amazon for less than it costs in the big department stores that stock it consistently.</li>
            <li> Best hairspray on the market!  Shipped as promised. You can still style you hair after you use it and its not terribly stiff.</li>
            <li> Best hairspray around! Does not stiffen hair, it really does allow you to &amp;#34;spray and play&amp;#34; as stated, wonderful!!</li>
            <li> In spite of the frivilous title, this is serious hair spray.  Use sparingly.  Your style will last a few days with a little bit of care.</li>
            <li> I cant even tell you how many different types of hairsprays I&#x27;ve tried . None have worked for me besides this hairspray! I have long thick hair that I often like to curl. So many hairsprays dont hold the curls or they hold them but leave my hair greasy and looking crunchy. But not Big and Sexy. This leaves my hair bouncy , natural looking ( not crunchy) and almost soft even. This spray keeps my hair curly all day. I have even laid down for a nap and then woke up with my curls still completely intact. Love this hairspray and recommend it anyone who is looking for a quality hairspray that actually works!</li>
            <li> I only use Big Sexy Hair hair spray.  It holds so nicely and at first you think it will be crisp and hard but it softens up and is very natural.  I always get questions about how I get my curls to hold all day and I always tell people it is the hair spray!</li>
            <li> Im a hairstylist and this by far was one of the best buys i have spent money on in a while. It was an awesome price and works incredible</li>
            <li> Love the spray and play. Firm hold without the helmet head or crunchy texture.  I have bought over and over again.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried Big Sexy Hair Spray products, do it. You will be glad you did. They have different strengths etc for different styles and hair types so make sure you know what you&#x27;re choosing.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this hairspray for about 10 or more years and Ive never had problems with it. It does wonders to my hair and does not make your hair hard or flaky, but keeps the style of your hair. All my friends use this as well b/c there is no better hairspray than this.</li>
            <li> I love any of the &amp;#34;BIG SEXY Hair&amp;#34; products. And it keeps my hair in place thru out the day. It&#x27;s not sticky or gooey like some hairspray&#x27;s are. YOU can&#x27;t go wrong with BIB SEXY!</li>
            <li> Big Sexy Spray &amp; Play regular is my favorite and only hair spray.  It is the best and works&lt;br /&gt;for me.  I can spray and then rebrush and spray again and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Holds nice but just a little crunch but not bad.  Good smell.  I really like this spray compared to the Moroccan Oil one I was using.</li>
            <li> This is the best hairspray I&#x27;ve ever had hands down. It&#x27;s just amazing with volumizing and holding down those fly always. Make your hair look very sexy! I&#x27;ve been using for years and I always go back to repurchase when I&#x27;m getting low. Go for it!</li>
            <li> I use this hair spray all the time.  it is the vest hair spray on the market.  A A A</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hairspray.  i have tried many others, and always end up coming back to Big Sexy Spray &amp; Play.  I have very long, very fine hair.  I need hold, but hate feeling like my hair is plastered.  This gives me the perfect amount of hold.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good, haven&#x27;t used it too much yet but seems to hold pretty well (not an extreme hold) and does seem to be pretty flexible. Purchase and shipping was a breeze. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> I been using this brand for last 8 years .Even though price is little high but it really works as Volume adding hair spray</li>
            <li> My wife loves this hair spray and has been using it for years. Other than an occasional sale somewhere, Amazon has the best price. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> it holds the hair perfectly fine and I personally like it</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite hairspray it holds well and doesn&#x27;t leave that nasty build up like other hair sprays do. I can get this cheaper on Amazon than in stores so I always order from here. I tease my hair almost on a daily basis and I use Big Sexy Hair Teasing Spray and then finish with this. It holds all day.</li>
            <li> I was only given 8 ounces when it is labeled 10 ounces, and it smells rancid.</li>
            <li> Moveable and moldable hair. That&#x27;s the words that come to mind when trying to describe this hairspray. I have very thick, fine hair and this spray allows me run my fingers through it and make it look like I just styled it. It&#x27;s like my hair has memory.</li>
            <li> Review by Wife-&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t help it. Love this product solely on the scent.  It&#x27;s fresh refreshing &amp; pretty&lt;br /&gt;Always sprays lightly, dries quickly, and holds well.  Plus, no residue (&amp; i have dark hair).  it does tend to get a bit sticky &amp; tacky if you&#x27;re generous with the spraying.  Especially when re-spraying the same area.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the Gold Standard, but quite the reliable hair spray at a decent price. with a lovely un-bothersome scent</li>
            <li> I love all the Big Sexy Hair products and their hairspray is no exception. It hold all styles that I love to play with and holds all through the night!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best hairspray I have ever used bar none! I&#x27;ve been using this for about 10 yrs and nothing comes close to it&#x27;s awesomeness!</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray. It holds my hair without leaving it overly sticky.</li>
            <li> favorite spray, half the cost</li>
            <li> I am a loyal user of this product and it was quick and easy to buy it on-line for use.</li>
            <li> Really love this spray.</li>
            <li> the only hairspray my daughter will use</li>
            <li> Just what she wanted. Good product. Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do and does it well</li>
            <li> Sticky and makes my hair very stiff. I prefer Bumble and Bumble hairspray to this.</li>
            <li> I have used this spray for years.  My hair is fine and tends not hold a style - using this spray helps hold a curl.</li>
            <li> Love this product, i have been using it for years, one of the products every girls should have owned it, highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Should get it at Marshall or Ross for a real deal;)</li>
            <li> This spray gives a good hold without looking stiff.</li>
            <li> Good hold. Does give a stiff feel.</li>
            <li> Great spray. Makes your hair look and smell great. bought this based on all the other reviews. Hair does not have that glued down appearance with this spray.</li>
            <li> Love this hair spray. You can spray a ton on for the &amp;#34;AquaNet&amp;#34; effect and it holds; or spray a little and it looks perfectly natural. Brushes out really easily and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky after being brushed out. Very light to almost no scent. A can lasts me almost a year, but I use only a light spritz 5 days a week.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Don&#x27;t over spray though or you will have &amp;#34;helmet&amp;#34; hair.  Spray lightly and you will be happy.</li>
            <li> Happy wife Happy life!!!</li>
            <li> Love this hair spray. I would not use anything else. Holds your hair with just a little spray without making it stiff.</li>
            <li> best hair spray on the market in my opinion.  This bottle will last for three months.  worth every penny.  thanks</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It is the only hair spray that gives me a crazy amount of volume without making me look like I have a beehive on my head. I love that I can spray this and be able to move my hair. The scent is not bad either compared to other sprays I have used. This is a staple is my hair routine especially when going out. If I just want a day look, I light up sections of my hair and spray the root. If I was a look for night time, I just flip my hair over and spray it all over. I really love this stuff and will continue to use it as long as they continue to sell it.</li>
            <li> A little sticky. Don&#x27;t know if I like my hair being as stiff and sticky as this makes it. Love the size.</li>
            <li> This hairspray made my hair so brittle.  It was breaking off all over the place.  I&#x27;ve used other Big Sexy products that I liked, but this one is awful.</li>
            <li> Holds well, never sticky.... this is the only hairspray I use. I have thick, straight hair, and it&#x27;s hard for me to get any body into it, but this spray does the trick for me. I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Absolutely professional grade.  It holds hair well and does not leave residue in hair (important if you have dark hair and don&#x27;t want to look like you have lots of dandruff).  However, it is on the pricey side of hairspray.</li>
            <li> Fantastic! Great job on my hair.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and keeps hair neat for better part of the day.</li>
            <li> This is the best hairspray I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Great product!  Holds hair in place.  Nice large can.</li>
            <li> Love the product and thank you for getting it to me fast. I will continue to buy from you</li>
            <li> I wont use anything else. Makes my hair look great!</li>
            <li> Hands down, my favorite hairspray.  I&#x27;m sure there are others out there that are great, but I love that this doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, and holds my hair in place without looking &amp;#34;sprayed&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Been using this hairspay for years. Great product. Wish they would come down on the price, I think it&#x27;s overpriced but works better than any hairspray I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Best hairspray I have ever used. Hands tremendous texture and body but not sticky.</li>
            <li> Great hair spray!  Not too heavy but just enough to keep my curls in for the day :)</li>
            <li> Most amazing hairspray.  I have thick but very fine hair and this product gives me lots of texture and volume. Love the autoship feature</li>
            <li> This brand of hairspray and also Adorn are the only 2 brands that really work in my opinion. I&#x27;ve tried the other brands.</li>
            <li> This hair spray is not always available in our stores.  Great hold and pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> great price and product</li>
            <li> I prefer Rusk w8less.  This hair spray is sickly.</li>
            <li> I have been using this hairspray for a couple of years and think it is great!  I have fine hair and this hairspray does a great job holding my style.</li>
