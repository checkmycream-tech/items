            <li> This perfume smells soft and lastest me all day.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage daughter who loves JWOWW and Snooki, I didn&#x27;t expect much when I bought it.....</li>

            <li> And it last long on me too.</li>
            <li> I love Jwow but this perfume stinks.</li>

            <li> .. will be ordering another one, as long as its an add-on item and is 8 bucks and some change!</li>
            <li> I bought it because of the good reviews; but the scent is terrible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s advertised as &#x27;shimmering&#x27; but when applied you can&#x27;t hardly see the glitter.</li>
            <li> but i do like to apply it at least twice a day.</li>
            <li> My only disappointment is with the lotion.</li>
            <li> but this perfume hits the spot its not strong like all the other crap perfumes.  </li>
            <li> I was a little bit afraid of doing a blind buy on this one.</li>
            <li> I was wrong</li>
            <li> Smelled awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this scent. It is my favorite and the perfume scent lasts all day, instead of some perfumes that tend to wear off.</li>
            <li> Smelled awful. Kind of like rubbing alcohol. I give this two stars because the lotion smelled pretty good. Nothing like the perfume.</li>
            <li> I love this scent!!  it smells like Bubblegum &amp; Pear. Its not overpowering either.  scent fades alot after awhile but i still love it!  Thanks Jwoww</li>
            <li> Will not order again wad not what was said</li>
            <li> Love it great scent fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells like an old person. I bought it because of the good reviews; but the scent is terrible.</li>
            <li> I took a chance on this because I have been wearing Fred Haymen 273 for years. I&#x27;m so happy i took that chance the perfume smells soo good with a light hint of coconut, and the lotion smells the same and has a illuminating glitter look to it. I did not have to reapply as much as i did with my old perfume i apply once in the am and if i&#x27;m going somewhere then once in the pm. Or if i just want to smell good sitting around the house i will apply 3 times a day. My hubby loves the way this smells on me!! The lotion is not greasy but i do like to apply it at least twice a day. Total 5 star stuff. This set just makes me feel good! I&#x27;m ordering at least 2 more for myself and it&#x27;s going to make great Christmas gifts this year. It arrived right on time for my Birthday i was smelling myself all day :)</li>
            <li> I love it . smells great. Great deal! &amp; love jWOWW to.. (:</li>
            <li> I must admit...I was a little bit afraid of doing a blind buy on this one. Not because it&#x27;s Jwoww, but Australian Gold is not a perfume company and non-designer perfumes can sometimes be...not so great. My worries were for nothing. I love this scent! After I sprayed it on my wrist I could not stop sniffing it. It reminded me of a warm, sunny day at the beach. If I close my eyes I can almost feel the sun on my face...and it&#x27;s actually the dead of winter where I live! I can&#x27;t wait to wear this scent in the summer...I think that is when it will be at it&#x27;s best, but it sure is nice to have that beachy feel in the winter as well. Thanks Jwoww for an awesome perfume! I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited to add 1/25/12: I just wanted to add that since my review was written this has become my go-to fragrance. It is such a warm, fun scent and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness!!! Smells so good I wish I could eat it!!! Very fast shipping also</li>
            <li> When I receive I was scared it wasn&#x27;t gone smell good lol bit I was wrong it smells good lol bough for a Christmas gift :) I&#x27;m sure she going to like it</li>
            <li> I bought the set in hopes that the perfume would smell like the lotion...it smells exactly the same!!! I have worn it every day since I received it! Love it!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how good this is, considering its pricetag. EVERYONE has had something to say about it! Whenever I wear it, someone asks me what it is or comments on how good it smells. Buying two more!!</li>
            <li> Luv it will buy again</li>
            <li> I like this set, especially for the low price (around 15 dollars at the time of purchase last year), the perfume bottle is cute with little gold charm on it and the lotion truly has a glow to it. I almost like the lotion better than the perfume actually, the scent stays on well.</li>
            <li> 5 Stars because my wife loves the Fragrance and it was very inexpensive. Good size for the price as well. I would recommend anyone that wants to smell sexy and turn heads to purchase this!!!</li>
            <li> I love it it smells great!!!!</li>
            <li> This smells like bubblegum pear and is so fresh. The bottle is cute. I suggest everyone get it! It comes with a lotion.</li>
            <li> This was alright.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not shocked it smells this way.&lt;br /&gt;The only way I can describe this is that it smells exactly like bubblegum. Smells nice, but wouldn&#x27;t really wear it.</li>
            <li> It was a birthday gift and she loved it!</li>
            <li> I love the way this set smells! Cute packaging and worth the $10. My only disappointment is with the lotion. It&#x27;s advertised as &#x27;shimmering&#x27; but when applied you can&#x27;t hardly see the glitter. Other than that, I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> Decent quality fragrance and lotion, cheap.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this fragrance nice fruity smell .. Also the lotion was great too nice and silky. Thanks for a wonderful experience!</li>
            <li> Really nice scent for the price. Love shimmering lotions so I just bought another</li>
            <li> I have been wearing jwow perfume its just right smells so good I mean great and it lasts all day and once you try it you will want to order it</li>
            <li> I love this so much. I love it so much that I tend to spray some from time to time on my blanket. This so great. Love the smell. And it last long on me too. Thank u</li>
            <li> I bought the Jwoww gift set from the tanning salon I used to frequent and it was $25. I bought the last one before they stopped carrying it. I was so happy to find this online because they don&#x27;t sell it in the salon I go to now either. The shipping was on time and when I got my package it was sealed and in its original packaging. It smells just as great as I remember. I like to use it when I get out of the tanning bed. It is a nice fresh scent and it lasts. My husband and friends complimented me on it when I saw them later on! I am very happy I made this purchase, and when I run out I will be buying it again!</li>
            <li> i love the sent it smells like you are at the beach .... i love the cream that you get with it also smells just like the perfume . just wish the purfume came in a bigger size .</li>
            <li> thank you.  she now has the complete jersey shore &amp;#34;girls&amp;#34; set and she&#x27;s very happy... alot of compliments on how good the scent is...</li>
            <li> Smells like this banana indoor tanner I used long ago. But I like that! Great smell for the summer! The lotion doesn&#x27;t glitter, but is super smooth and smells like the perfume, which a lot of times isn&#x27;t the case.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and the lotion is nice and has a little glitter in it but you can&#x27;t see that on your skin.</li>
            <li> Love this can never find it anywere around here,  shipped fast and was very excited to get it no problems at all and it smells great!</li>
            <li> absolutely amazingggg! it smells soooo good and my fiance&#x27; loves the smell too! for the price, you cant beat it AT ALL.. will be ordering another one, as long as its an add-on item and is 8 bucks and some change!</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance !!</li>
            <li> I love Jwow but this perfume stinks. I cant explain the smell just not meant for young people..</li>
            <li> Bought it for the low price point. It is a great summer scent and is reminiscent of suntan lotion/beach smell. The lotion is nice and has a gold tint to it.</li>
            <li> Im from Phoenix Arizona aka The Valley of the Sun and on these surprising winter days that are below freezing I want to remember the days where my hands and teeth dont shake. I spray just once on my neck and Im ready to go.  I dont really have a good nose but this perfume hits the spot its not strong like all the other crap perfumes.  This perfume smells soft and lastest me all day. So THANK YOU JWOWW!!!</li>
            <li> I was going to buy this at a local tanning salon 3x this price! Thankfully I found one on here. Can&#x27;t beat 8 bucks! I love to spray it on me after I go tanning. It reminds me of summer.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage daughter who loves JWOWW and Snooki, I didn&#x27;t expect much when I bought it.....especially at this price. I was quite surprised, its a very nice fragrance and my daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> Thank you, fast delivery, great price &amp; not my first order, live this scent.....you will have more orders from me...received item as described!</li>
            <li> Omg it smells soooo good! I had to buy 2 gift sets i love it so much! It smells like fresh bananas, the lotion smells like the perfume and has light glitter that you can see more in the sunlight! Its a fun summer time scent! I recommend this scent for going to the beach. (;</li>
            <li> I never smelled it before so I was taking a chance, for 8 bucks it didn&#x27;t matter if it was&lt;br /&gt;bad or good to me. I am sooooo happy though! I love the aroma! It&#x27;s like tanning lotion meets classy&lt;br /&gt;fruity perfume! Buy it! I promise you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
