            <li>Thanks so much</li>
            <li>and I really believe it improves the way my skin feels and looks</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really see any difference in her skin complexion, but I don&#x27;t think this type of cream is supposed to improve those things.</li>
            <li>They are scented, and the night cream is very perfumed, although in a way it reminds me of my grandmother and I like that.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
            <li>I really like the packaging and the scent; however, it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li>Much smoother and NOT&lt;br /&gt;Greased.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t believe it is the real stuff and not sealed.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and leAves face feeling great.</li>
            <li>Night cream jar is full, Day cream jar is half full.</li>
            <li>I liked the cream well enough to go looking for it on Amazon and was surprised to find it at an enormously reduced price.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff have ordered previously.  </li>
            <li>Considerando el precio make it a highly recomended product</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>As good, if not better, as the high end brands I have spent far too much on at Sephora!</li>
            <li>so I decided to buy a new supply for her.</li>
            <li>The texture and results are almost exactly the same!  </li>
            <li>and I took a chance, the original price being $100 for the Day and Night cream (Supposedly a half priced bargain).  </li>
            <li>Even my daughter commented on how soft my face feels.</li>
            <li>Just a tiny bit gets the job done &amp; therefore product is very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Terrific price as well and fast, efficient service.  </li>
            <li>and my face completely broke out.</li>
            <li>they fixed it in my favor.</li>
            <li>I had completely forgotten about this Vivo Per</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m typically very sensitive to such things and it didn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li>I am 68 y old and have dry skin.</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really see any difference in her skin complexion, but I don&#x27;t think this type of cream is supposed to improve those things.</li>
            <li> They are scented, and the night cream is very perfumed, although in a way it reminds me of my grandmother and I like that.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
            <li> I really like the packaging and the scent; however, it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li> Much smoother and NOT&lt;br /&gt;Greased.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe it is the real stuff and not sealed.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and leAves face feeling great.</li>
            <li> Night cream jar is full, Day cream jar is half full.</li>
            <li> I liked the cream well enough to go looking for it on Amazon and was surprised to find it at an enormously reduced price.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff have ordered previously.  </li>
            <li> Considerando el precio make it a highly recomended product</li>

            <li> As good, if not better, as the high end brands I have spent far too much on at Sephora!</li>
            <li> so I decided to buy a new supply for her.</li>
            <li> The texture and results are almost exactly the same!  </li>

            <li> Even my daughter commented on how soft my face feels.</li>
            <li> Just a tiny bit gets the job done &amp; therefore product is very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Terrific price as well and fast, efficient service.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this product. It all started with just a sample and I was hooked. My face feels so soft and smooth I cant stop touching it. Even my daughter commented on how soft my face feels.</li>
            <li> I love these creams. As good, if not better, as the high end brands I have spent far too much on at Sephora! I wish I had known about these earlier. I could have saved a substantial amount of money. I also started purchasing them for my mother, and she has become a big fan of the brand.</li>
            <li> Feels wonderful on my skin.</li>
            <li> great day and night creams definitely satisfied</li>

            <li> What&#x27;s not to love?!!!! Great product, fabulous price!!</li>
            <li> I received my day and night cream and was very pleased with the product. I have no idea why someone would say it smells &amp;#34;Perfumey&amp;#34;. I cannot detect a scent in either one. My jars were both full. The night cream is very luxurious and it works great on my fine lines around my eyes. I am 50 and I constantly get compliments on my skin and youthful appearance!</li>
            <li> Really love this product. Work great, skin feels great and looks  great. Will buy again and again.  Well worth the price, excellent bargin.</li>
            <li> Because is a good price and excellent product. I love this product so much! Thanks a lot for everything you sell.</li>
            <li> My wife has used the day cream for awhile and loves it.  Now she has tried the night cream and it very happy with the results.  She recommends both products very highly.</li>
            <li> My skin reacted to the lotion. the scent was too strong and after a day of use I broke out. Had to stop using and throw it away.</li>
            <li> I notice a lot of clogged pores from these products. After that I switched to sub d product line. luv it!</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after a day of use. Skin feels smooth and soft. Dryness is gone, will purchase again. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> I had bought this product for my wife before and she liked it but was running out of it so I decided to buy a new supply for her. She is happy. Thanks</li>
            <li> Vivo per lei best stuff ever. I used to break out whenever I put something on my face. I am able to use this and have no negative effects only postive. A little goes a long way and leAves face feeling great.</li>
            <li> Used it before, to big on the smell of the night time product. I still use it. Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> I like both the day &amp; night formulas.  Just a tiny bit gets the job done &amp; therefore product is very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> The product is luxurious not only in its presentation packaging but in the product itself. My skin feels lovely and I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I have been using lots of very expensive creams. So far this is the best priced, and the best creams</li>
            <li> I have used many products, but this one is by far the best. I use it after the milk and the cleanser at night  right before I go to sleep, and in the morning my skin looks brighter, cleaner and smoother. Buy it, you will not regret it!</li>
            <li> The night cream never showed up and my attempts to contact people about this don&#x27;t seem to have gone anywhere.</li>
            <li> This is a great face cream product set and I love these products.  Terrific price as well and fast, efficient service.  Thanks so much</li>
            <li> Good product, day and night creams used together, improved the skin texture and help&lt;br /&gt;to even your complexion.Considerando el precio make it a highly recomended product</li>
            <li> the night cream does have a odor to it but is not noticeable after a couple minutes. I well probably only use the day cream during the winter months as it does not have any sun protection.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it and keeps asking for more.</li>
            <li> I purchase those two after being given a sample and I really believe it improves the way my skin feels and looks</li>
            <li> Love this stuff have ordered previously.  A bit heavy if you don&#x27;t have dry skin but otherwise really nice.  Only need a small dab so lasts forever.</li>
            <li> I use it every day and does not irritate my rosacea.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use these products but my wife does and she likes them very much.  This is the second time that I have ordered them for her.</li>
            <li> Night cream jar is full, Day cream jar is half full. If this is the reason &amp;#34;SALE&amp;#34;  please explain . I hope it is not used product.</li>
            <li> Great product but would like less scent.</li>
            <li> Great creams for less than the original cost! Came within acouple days. Perfect gift idea for any woman! Thank you</li>
            <li> Love the product! Arrived exactly as stated.</li>
            <li> I got these because my ex bought me the face scrub as a valentine&#x27;s day present and I loved that one so much I wanted to try something else and I had been looking for a good moisturizer. And I was not disappointed! This stuff is great, it keeps your skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my 55 year old mom and she&#x27;s loving it. It doesn&#x27;t really see any difference in her skin complexion, but I don&#x27;t think this type of cream is supposed to improve those things. However, she feels that her skin is super hydrated and it&#x27;s perfect to use under makeup. She uses it on top of Vitamin C serum and claims that her skin feels really good.</li>
            <li> Makes you break out after discontinued use. I went on vacation for a week and forgot this stuff at home and my face completely broke out. It does more harm than good.</li>
            <li> I was very unhappy. Only one product was shipped and I paid for both. Though I was reimbursed for half, I purchased both because I would end up saving.</li>
            <li> My mom and I use several of these products and we love them!</li>
            <li> Very lovely item.  These creams are great on my sensitive dry flaky skin and perfect for the cooler weather.  They are scented, and the night cream is very perfumed, although in a way it reminds me of my grandmother and I like that.  I also love how smooth it makes my face and neck! I&#x27;ll probably buy their hand cream too...</li>
            <li> I love all the products.  I bought a lot of different ones when I found them so affordable.  I gave to my 2 daughters for birthday gifts. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> These creams have a nice scent.  They provide great moisture to my skin.  Good price when you can get 2 products at once.</li>
            <li> I still don&#x27;t know what is in them... but I love their texture, they feel good! I am 68 y old and have dry skin. These products seem to &amp;#34;revive&amp;#34; it a lot...&lt;br /&gt;Why are they so expensive when they try to sell them to you at the Mall?? Great prices on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And they are so nicely packaged!</li>
            <li> Actually, i bought the set but only received the night cream, then i called Amazon about this mistake. they fixed it in my favor. Customer always comes first. I appreciate it .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyway, the day cream just makes my face so soft and smooth. first day used it , I love it already. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I too fell victim to those scary mall sales people.  In fact, I think my bad sales experience may have affected how I viewed the product the first time.  I typically use Dior skin products, but my face was dry, flakey and it seemed they were no longer doing anything.  I have sensitive skin, sun damage and some wrinkles :(.  A friend recommended this product again so I looked on Amazon to see if it were less expensive.  I was pleasantly surprised (and angry with myself for paying the mall price!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to make this an ongoing review, but I received the products yesterday.  I washed my face and used the night cream.  This morning when I woke up, my face was softer than it has been in years.  I don&#x27;t see any of the flaking that was on my forehead.  I will say that I don&#x27;t like the perfumey smell though it is not that bad.  I&#x27;m typically very sensitive to such things and it didn&#x27;t bother me.  Regardless, my skin feels great today.  I&#x27;ll keep you updated on my progress, but as of now I can say:  1.  I received my products in a timely fashion and they look and smell exactly like what I got at the mall  2.  The night cream works great so far  3.  No one accosted me as I was purchasing :)</li>
            <li> I love it it was exactly what I wanted. And the prices were great .  They try to sell in the mall for a lot more mo ey</li>
            <li> Love it! Great Price!</li>
            <li> Moisturizes but leaves my face greasy</li>
            <li> I had been using this product for a while now. I am so happy with this stuff. I use both night and day cream and like them both. Will recommend it to my friends and co-workers.</li>
            <li> After using a sample offered by a kiosk in the mall. I loved the fragrance. Read some reviews that said it didn&#x27;t smell the same, but thought I would take a chance. Product came nicely wrapped an in boxes. Smells heavenly and the night cream is just what I wanted. You don&#x27;t need to use much. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizers for the price</li>
            <li> This irritated my skin so bad I had to go to the dermatologist</li>
            <li> Excellent face treatment!!!!!</li>
            <li> When I first purchased this product, it was at a mall kiosk and I took a chance, the original price being $100 for the Day and Night cream (Supposedly a half priced bargain).  I liked the cream well enough to go looking for it on Amazon and was surprised to find it at an enormously reduced price.  At Amazon&#x27;s price, I will certainly purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I really like the packaging and the scent; however, it&#x27;s not for me. I woke up with really oily face and after a few days applying both day and night cream, I started breaking out. My pores were clogged and my face were super oily - which wasn&#x27;t the case before using the creams. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to people who&#x27;s pores are easily clogged.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price and delivered speedily.</li>
            <li> Product came sealed and full. No results,might as well use an over the counter cream</li>
            <li> love the scent and the hydration!  Not to mention the great price.</li>
            <li> The Night cream only fills up half of the container,it looks like it&#x27;s used. I could not give it to someone (for a gift).</li>
            <li> I have previously purchased product from Vivo. this was my first time purchasing this particular product.l was not disappointed! It made my skin feel soft and look amazing. I love their products, they are higher end products at a decent price. I would recommend this product again and again.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this product for about a year. This is the first time I have had to replenish my supply. It makes my skin look and feel great.  People always think I&#x27;m 15 to 20 years younger than I am. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> light, not greasy, will order again</li>
            <li> I like very much how these creams make my face feel. Was disappointed that they did not come with any directions or any descriptions of the product. Would have liked to know what benefits to expect from using them.</li>
            <li> Love the feeling of my skin when I use the day and night creams.  definitely a difference.  Much smoother and NOT&lt;br /&gt;Greased.</li>
            <li> Got chased down in a mall, and received a sample of the day cream, that I used when I ran out of my own. It&#x27;s fabulous and I found it on Amazon for such a great price! Plus people keep telling me how nice my skin looks since using it. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> when I ordered this I paid for the day cream and the night cream when I received my package I only received the night cream there was no day cream and no way to call and complain and ask for the day cream</li>
            <li> This is the only product my face likes, Cant use nothing else on my super sensitive skin, This stuff Keeps it nice and moist and smooth.</li>
            <li> I feel like both creams are great, and would buy them again.  Great value for your money. I would like a list of ingredients.</li>
            <li> i love everything about these products, the smell, the texture is not greasy, and the price..you can&amp;#34;t go wrong.........infact don&amp;#34;t buy it will leave more for me .!!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe it is the real stuff and not sealed.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff - beats the Rosa Graf products I unfortunately purchased last month for 8 times the price of a 1.6 jar of face cream.  The texture and results are almost exactly the same!  The smell is even better as well!  I had completely forgotten about this Vivo Per Lei face cream line, until the weather cooled down and became dryer.  I do not wear a lot of moisturizer during the warmer seasons - maybe a light dual moisturizer/sunblock, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> Love these creams make skin feel skiny smooth.  I love the price and it works as well as department store brands.  Belive me I have paid the husty price in the past.</li>
            <li> i use more day cream than night, wished you could just order what you need</li>
            <li> Love the cream. Going to buy another one.</li>
            <li> Started using the Vivo collection. Love the texture, aroma and feel of my skin. Recommended to friends.</li>
            <li> This product works excellently.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a moisturizer like other moisturizer cream..</li>
    </ol>
