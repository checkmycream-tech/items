            <li> Of course, with the rain we have had and not a lot of dry weather</li>
            <li> It seems a bit pricey, but I do not know how rare this plant is, or how difficult to distill the oil.</li>
            <li> I got this to mix with other oils for my dog&#x27;s flea spray.  </li>
            <li> I am never  let  down by this seller!</li>
            <li> I use this oil in a combination with a few others to make an allergy roll-</li>
            <li> I thought that it had a hint of a woody, faint, pine-like aroma mixed in with the lemony pickle touch.  </li>
            <li> and I was left with bone on bone which is painful.  </li>
            <li> the fleas are not that bad yet.  </li>
            <li> You will  not  be  disappointed!</li>
            <li> I like Edens Garden but this Elemi oil in my opinion is horrible!  </li>
