            <li>It seems to brush the top surface to be pretty</li>
            <li>Unique brush I like the design and color of the brush.</li>

            <li>My daughter has super tangly hair.</li>
            <li>Did she cry with this brush, yes, but did it help better than a normal brush</li>
            <li>and i love the design and color of it, as pink is my favorite color.</li>
            <li>Well worth it</li>
            <li>It feels very nice when brushing through my hair and de-tangles my messy hair early in morning easily</li>
            <li>I quickly discovered that this detangling brush is wonderful for cutting right through the sprayed hair, quickly and painlessly.  </li>
            <li>First, it was called a detangling brush</li>
            <li>but I tried it on me first.</li>
            <li>It untangles wet hair nicely.</li>
            <li>My hair is curly and thick so this brush would work great on many different hair types and textures.</li>
            <li>And I love the bright pink color, easy to find in a messy preteens bedroom!!</li>
            <li>This brush worked through the tangles pretty fast.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find my miracle in a pain free brush but at least it works quickly and effectively detangles without having to go over the same spots!</li>
            <li>Overall this is an amazing detangling brush that can be used on different hair types and gets rid of the tangles.</li>
            <li>but this brush is so much easier to manage.</li>
            <li>I asked my family member with straight hair to use this brush to get her point of view.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this if you have tried them all too!</li>
            <li>The fact that it was in my daughters favorite color of pink was just a bonus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This brush really does work.</li>
            <li>Works the best when your hair is wet, but if you have thick hair</li>
            <li>new brush was the first priority along with detangling products.</li>
            <li>White this brush it improves things significantly.</li>
            <li>Also my hair is very soft and shiny after using this brush.</li>
            <li>I love that I can use it on wet or dry hair without feeling like I&#x27;m damaging my hair.</li>
            <li>Also her hair is shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>With a regular brush there is so much hair lose in the brush probably because it breaks off my hair where it is tangled.</li>
            <li>but I at least needed to find a better one than what we had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It still hurts if you have a lot of knots, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as using a regular brush or comb.</li>
            <li>Works well on my daughter&#x27;s sensitive head.</li>
            <li>Sometimes when I get up in the morning my hair feels terribly stiff, especially the top of it.  </li>
            <li>Works fantastic on wet or dry hair.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical when I ordered this brush, but we both love it!  </li>
            <li>I was surprised and wish i had this earlier .The</li>
            <li>My hair has become really tatty lately due to dryness &amp; hell to detangle.</li>
            <li>My niece has long hair and it generally appears to get tangled.</li>

            <li> My niece has long hair and it generally appears to get tangled.</li>
            <li> I have long and frizzy hai and tangles hair is my every morning issue.</li>
            <li> My daughter has long, thick but straight hair that is always tangled in knots.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for dry hair.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what its supposed to do, my daughter has long thin hair, that always tangles.</li>
            <li> With this detangling brush there is a few pieces of hair left in the brush.&lt;br /&gt;Since there are short and longer bristles</li>
            <li> Bought this for my second half</li>
            <li> Dissimilar to the film Tangled, when it happens with her it is a major battle that ordinarily closes in tears.</li>
            <li> She said that she loves how this brush doesn&#x27;t make her hair frizzy when she brushes it with her hair wet.</li>
            <li> so the real challenge was going to be her thin, tangly hair that takes chlorine abuse!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But this brush did the trick with minimal hair breakage.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t poke a hole in your scalp sharp - just a bit sharper.</li>
            <li> The shape of the brush is different from usual brushes  allows it to massage the scalp while it removes knots, increasing blood flow to the skin to nourish the hair follicles and skin cells.</li>
            <li> I have a black Curve brush almost identical to this.</li>
            <li> I also have noticed less fly-aways when I use this brush.  </li>
            <li> so it took less than half the time.</li>
            <li> It seems like my daughter&#x27;s hair is a tangled mess even after she takes a bath.</li>
            <li> but underneath it was still a mess.</li>
            <li> Since she has gotten this brush a few days ago I had not put any leave in conditioner in her hair.</li>
            <li> I usually put leave in conditioner in her hair after she takes a shower so that her hair won&#x27;t have tangles in it.</li>
            <li> I always have a hard time trying to get my daughter to brush her hair because of the tangles she gets.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and when using this I felt like it wasn&#x27;t brushing my hair!</li>
            <li> I have had those bad hair days where my hair is tangled, I have tried using combs and brushes to help get rid of tangles but its so hard to manage with the handles.</li>
            <li> I mean it is awful!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say its painless because getting tangles out is always painful</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the worst part of my</li>

            <li> I purchased this brush for my Goddaughter, she had never used any type of detangling brush.  She was quite pleased with the way this brush detangled her hair.  She is very tender headed and was quite happy that this brush would detangle and brush out all her hair with no pain.  Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what its supposed to do, my daughter has long thin hair, that always tangles. This brush is great</li>
            <li> It seems like my daughter&#x27;s hair is a tangled mess even after she takes a bath. I usually put leave in conditioner in her hair after she takes a shower so that her hair won&#x27;t have tangles in it. Since she has gotten this brush a few days ago I had not put any leave in conditioner in her hair. This brush has made it to easy to brush through her hair. She said that the brush doesn&#x27;t make her head hurt either. We have tried out a lot of different brushes with her and this brush has been the best for her hair. I even tried out the brush on my hair and it took out a snare also. I&#x27;m so thankful that this brush really helps her hair look great. I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was offered this product for a great deal to try and give my honest opinion. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I have had those bad hair days where my hair is tangled, I have tried using combs and brushes to help get rid of tangles but its so hard to manage with the handles. This brush works great, helping me brush the tangles out with easy the bristles are spread out evenly catching the tangles. I like the shape of the brush allowing me to hold it the way I need to to get to the tangles and brush out. I won&#x27;t say its painless because getting tangles out is always painful but this brush is so much easier to manage.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and with regular brushes it gets all frizzy and looks damaged. With this detangling brush my hair doesn&#x27;t get frizzy and it had no tangles. Also my hair is very soft and shiny after using this brush. I asked my family member with straight hair to use this brush to get her point of view. She said that she loves how this brush doesn&#x27;t make her hair frizzy when she brushes it with her hair wet. Also her hair is shiny and soft. I love that I can use it on wet or dry hair without feeling like I&#x27;m damaging my hair. With a regular brush there is so much hair lose in the brush probably because it breaks off my hair where it is tangled. With this detangling brush there is a few pieces of hair left in the brush.&lt;br /&gt;Since there are short and longer bristles your hair is contacting the brush at different point which is what&#x27;s helping with having no tangles. Overall this is an amazing detangling brush that can be used on different hair types and gets rid of the tangles. I received this detangle brush for free to review and give my honest feedback.</li>
            <li> I have a black Curve brush almost identical to this. This one has a bit longer handle which I like. The &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; or bristles on this brush are a bit sharper which I don&#x27;t find bothersome - They aren&#x27;t poke a hole in your scalp sharp - just a bit sharper. The Curve brush might be better for a child&#x27;s hair. I think this one edges out the Curve just a tad (for me) but both will remain on my counter.</li>
            <li> I have heard amazing thing about these brushes. I bought one awhile back and lost it. I was so upset. Its one of my favorites. So when I saw this, i jumped at the chance and ordered it. Its fantastic. It easily brushes out tangles without pain quickly. My kid loves it too. Theres no longer a fight to brush her hair. This brush isnt flimsy or cheaply made. Its a great quality brush. I am very happy I got this at a discount for my honest review. I will be recommending. Love this brush!!</li>
            <li> I recently got this and i have to say one of the most amazing pair of brushes i own from my collections. It feels very nice when brushing through my hair and de-tangles my messy hair early in morning easily and i love the design and color of it, as pink is my favorite color. The shape makes it easier to hold it too!</li>
            <li> Super pleasant brush. My niece has long hair and it generally appears to get tangled. Dissimilar to the film Tangled, when it happens with her it is a major battle that ordinarily closes in tears. White this brush it improves things significantly. Despite everything she gets tangles, however now we can traverse them and for the most part don&#x27;t have the tears. I am happy I was sufficiently fortunate to get this item for survey, and ready to give my fair sentiment on it.</li>
            <li> The brush does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome hair brush!  I always have a hard time trying to get my daughter to brush her hair because of the tangles she gets.  This brush has quickly become her favorite go to detangling brush.  If you have a fussy kid that hates to brush their hair because it&#x27;s &amp;#34; painful&amp;#34; definitely give this a try, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have very fine hair that tangles easily.  I have tried many brushes and combs and she hates them all.  I was skeptical when I ordered this brush, but we both love it!  She doesn&#x27;t cry when I comb her hair anymore.  Works fantastic on wet or dry hair.  I also have noticed less fly-aways when I use this brush.  Highly recommend this if you have tried them all too!</li>
            <li> Super nice and cute brush. I have long and frizzy hai and tangles hair is my every morning issue. When i used this  brush it  detangling my hair so easily and  effortlessly separating knots.I was surprised and wish i had this earlier .The plastic bristles  resist breakage and bends easily without breaking and losing  their shape.The shape of the brush is different from usual brushes  allows it to massage the scalp while it removes knots, increasing blood flow to the skin to nourish the hair follicles and skin cells. The brush  almost glides on the hair and now that i dont have any tangles hair  - I have healthy and shiny hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I was lucky enough to receive this product for review, and able to give my honest opinion on it.</li>
            <li> My daughter has super tangly hair. I mean it is awful! It is constantly a daily battle to brush it. It&#x27;s the worst part of my every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I decided to make it a priority to find something that worked for her. I wasn&#x27;t holding my breath on finding the perfect solution but I at least needed to find a better one than what we had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A new brush was the first priority along with detangling products. This brush appealed to me for a couple different reasons. First, it was called a detangling brush so I knew it was designed for that. The fact that it was in my daughters favorite color of pink was just a bonus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the way the brush fit in the palm of my hand. It was designed with ergonomics in mind and since brushing hair is a daily chore, I want something that is comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paige was excited to try it but I tried it on me first. It went through my hair easily and pulled out the tangles quickly and without pain. I have thicker hair and it doesn&#x27;t tangle a lot so the real challenge was going to be her thin, tangly hair that takes chlorine abuse!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not going to lie. It still hurt. I was hoping for a miracle but realistically when you have tangly hair and you pull on it, it&#x27;s gonna hurt! I start at the bottom and work my way up to minimize the pain but it still hurt her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is that it did pull through the tangles much more quickly than her old brush so it took less than half the time. I didn&#x27;t find my miracle in a pain free brush but at least it works quickly and effectively detangles without having to go over the same spots!</li>
            <li> Works great!!!! Gets all the  tangles out!</li>
            <li> I use lots of hair spray between weekly visits to my hair dresser.  Sometimes when I get up in the morning my hair feels terribly stiff, especially the top of it.  It almost feels like I could snap pieces of it off.  I quickly discovered that this detangling brush is wonderful for cutting right through the sprayed hair, quickly and painlessly.  It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> It untangles wet hair nicely.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my second half and she said it was the best she&#x27;s used of the kind. She rated it 10/10 in it&#x27;s feel and usability. Great price for a great product, would recommend</li>
            <li> This brush worked through the tangles pretty fast. It sounds like it&#x27;s ripping all my hair out, but its not. I thought the handle looked funky and wasn&#x27;t sure how I would feel holding it, but its actually quite nice to hold. It still hurts if you have a lot of knots, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as using a regular brush or comb. *I received this product at discount in exchange for my honest opinion/review.</li>
            <li> This brush really does work. I was astonished when I used it. My hair has become really tatty lately due to dryness &amp; hell to detangle. But this brush did the trick with minimal hair breakage. Well worth it I say...😉</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to purchase this item at a discount in exchange for an honest review. My daughter LOVES this brush! And I love the ergonomic handle to help her brush her hair (she doesn&#x27;t let me often cause she is 11 now) It glides through her tangled hair with ease, she no longer fights me to brush her hair. And I love the bright pink color, easy to find in a messy preteens bedroom!!</li>
            <li> feels so good  I love it</li>
            <li> Works well on my daughter&#x27;s sensitive head.</li>
            <li> Well not quite as amazing as I had hoped. My daughter has long, thick but straight hair that is always tangled in knots. Did she cry with this brush, yes, but did it help better than a normal brush yes.  It seems to brush the top surface to be pretty but underneath it was still a mess.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and when using this I felt like it wasn&#x27;t brushing my hair! Works the best when your hair is wet, but if you have thick hair I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for dry hair.</li>
            <li> Unique brush I like the design and color of the brush. It did a good job detangling my hair without ripping or pulling at my hair. Also like how the teeth of the brush are short so my hair doesn&#x27;t get stuck in the brush while trying to detangle. My hair is curly and thick so this brush would work great on many different hair types and textures. I received this product at a discount for my honest review and opinion.
