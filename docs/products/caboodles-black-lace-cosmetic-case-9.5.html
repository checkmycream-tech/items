    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This case is great!!</li>
            <li>Its just perfect.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s awesome because it keeps everything so organized and neat.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also really beautiful on my dresser and keeps prying eyes from accessing all my stuff.</li>
            <li>This makes for a great gift too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite happy with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very nice case, just wish it was as described.</li>
            <li>but aside from that the case is good though</li>
            <li>I received this wonderful cosmetic case well before my delivery estimate, and am very pleased with how useful and cute it is!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this!</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>it is really travel size and very nice in person!</li>
            <li>It is so nice to know where everything is, and to be able to find it at a moments notice.</li>
            <li>It works perfectly for what I need and holds my large collection of make up easily.</li>
            <li>We love this caboodle.  </li>
            <li>so I was not to pleased with that.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of makeup, but have no problem fitting all of it in this conveniently sized portable case.</li>
            <li>I need to fit in while traveling!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d make use of those keys...</li>
            <li>I love it...</li>
            <li>Considering what happens to my makeup case, I think I&#x27;ll look for something more indestructable and</li>
            <li>definitely more cleanable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I store most of my makeup and makeup accessories inside of this case with the exception of lip products because I have too much to fit in here.</li>
            <li>and I loved it so much..</li>
            <li>The design is perfect for a young girl starting out with her own makeup.  </li>
            <li>I use mineral eyeshadows, so it&#x27;s really important that they are kept level, and the drawers are perfect for that, those all fit on one drawer, and I use the other for my glosses.</li>
            <li>Pretty, fits nice on my counter, but can&#x27;t fit my make up.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for that perfect organizer that will keep your Bare Escentuals makeup from tumbling over, as would happen in a normal makeup bag, this organizer is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>Also, the Caboodles cases I looked at did not close smoothly or evenly.  </li>
            <li>box also seems pretty well made, I love that it latches shut.</li>
            <li>I feel that if you are selling an item you should tell the true color and let the buyer make the choice as to if they want it or not.</li>
            <li>first of all this bag is an easy 22 dollars at a target store</li>
            <li>nothing extraordinary.</li>
            <li>The case is very pretty and has has plenty of room for all my cosmetics.</li>
            <li>This is a great little cosmetic case for the price.  </li>
            <li>The design outside is pretty and very cute.</li>
            <li>Target, can you pls get it right this time?  </li>
            <li>price is right for the product you get.</li>
            <li>All of my makeup has a \\&quot;home\\&quot; and it is so much easier to stay clean</li>
            <li>The price is also very reasonable.</li>
            <li>and I wanted my desk back to be able to focus on schoolwork.</li>
            <li>For my age I have quite a large array of makeup and this case fits everything JUST right.</li>
            <li>Additionally, not the most... solid structure.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small and compact, so it doesn&#x27;t take up much room in the bathroom, &amp; it&#x27;s good for those weekend trips as well.  </li>
            <li>and then a large bottom compartment...</li>
            <li>Fortunately my makeup habit hasn&#x27;t rubbed off on my boyfriend, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about locking it (though I&#x27;m sure that would be the least of my problems).</li>
            <li>The metal that supports the extended drawers can be bent by a gentle touch from a finger.  </li>
            <li>-_- wouldnt pay so much for this knowing its wayyyy cheaper...</li>
            <li>Do not expect too much.</li>
            <li>The shelves overlap so that I have to empty the whole shelf to get what&#x27;s hiding underneath the top</li>
            <li>I love the look, but the little shelves are exactly that</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not the only girl in THAT boat, so think about how much you really need, a smaller case could be a blessing in disguise.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m entering High School</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This box is not to little and not to big, it can sit right on top my dresser and not take up to much space.</li>
            <li>love the little drawers for my eyeshadow and brushes.</li>
            <li>I have an extensive makeup collection and this fits all of it, though it is a tight fit, that actually forces me to keep it better organized, and prevents me from going on another \\&quot;OMG Mac released their fall line???!?\\&quot; spending spree.</li>
            <li>Its large enough for all my makeup (which is a lot) and yet doesn&#x27;t take up much room.</li>
            <li>We returned the first one and reordered on the phone what we wanted and the reordered case was still hot pink.</li>
            <li>The top tiers are okay because there&#x27;s room above them, but the second tier is almost impossible to fit anything in.</li>
            <li>I do love the look of these cases and am tempted to keep the black lace on grey, but I really need this hot pink one to complete the set!  </li>
            <li>I was instantly drawn to this feminine, sexy little case.  </li>
            <li>The lace fabric is just so classy and chic.</li>
            <li>Mechanisms work well and details and stitching on outside of case are clean and complete with no gaps or loose ends.</li>
            <li>I keep my look pretty simple, so much of the money I spend on sprees like that ends up being a waste...</li>
            <li>I was having trouble deciding which size to get because i didnt want the case to be too small however this case is the perfect size its a mmedium size case not to small and not to big.</li>
            <li>Clear caboodle next on my list!</li>
            <li>It suits my needs very well but the one I received was hot pink with black lace.</li>
            <li>The black lace is accurate in the picture, but under that, it&#x27;s pink!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as thought the brackets and moving parts are either low quality or not very tight.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the drawers over the \\&quot;bulk storage\\&quot; this little case seems like something out of Mary Poppins or Dr. Who.</li>

            <li> and I received a case that was hot pink with black lace.</li>
            <li> Funny because other reviews indicate just the opposite...that they order the grey and got the pink.  </li>
            <li> (apparently they are the only store that even carries the pink).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so small, I had to leave out my small acrylic kit and my jewels because they just don&#x27;t fit.  </li>
            <li> This holds all my essential make up, minus the brushes.</li>
            <li> I got grey w/black lace.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting this item to be black, that is what was stated in the discription, but when I got it it was red</li>
            <li> The picture shows gray or off white under black lace.  </li>
            <li> exterior actually has black lace fabric over it.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion it is even cuter with the pink background.  </li>
            <li> hinges are loose and extremely flimsy.  </li>
            <li> I also ordered the larger version which is actually black lace on black.  </li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S PINK!  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very difficult to fit products in there.</li>
            <li> Make-up in bottom tray gets lost with dark interior.</li>
            <li> just like any other case!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the shelves that pop out are a little unstable but they still work.</li>
            <li> The drawers unfold unevenly - you go to lift up a drawer and one side comes up while the other gets stuck.</li>
            <li> inside has the  brand design and black.</li>
            <li> so...I came on here..and found it in a minute...for less than half the price</li>
            <li> And they said it was black on black</li>
            <li> Unfortunately there&#x27;s no room for my collection to grow any further, but there&#x27;s only one other complaint.  </li>
            <li> --little.  </li>
            <li> If you order this item expecting to get what is shown (hot pink w/ black lace) then you will be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> The bottom row of shelves is also partially blocked by the one above it, making it difficult to pull out items.  </li>
            <li> I can not fit my four color Chanel eye shadow compact on one shelves.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m by no means unhappy, but I do feel a little hoodwinked especially because of the color.</li>
            <li> All of my blush, foundation and face powders go in the bulk storage area along with fake eyelashes and other packaged goodies.</li>
            <li> The tiers of shelves are EXETREMELY shallow.</li>
            <li> and it was really expensive...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I was extremely disappointed in the quality.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Bought this for my sister and she loves it! it is really travel size and very nice in person!</li>
            <li> This case is great!! Its large enough for all my makeup (which is a lot) and yet doesn&#x27;t take up much room. My only complaint is that the shelves that pop out are a little unstable but they still work.</li>
            <li> This box is not to little and not to big, it can sit right on top my dresser and not take up to much space. It holds all my make up which is alot along with all the accessories. I like the fact that it has a lock, so I won&#x27;t accidently spill the contents and to keep people out. Love it!!</li>
            <li> We love this caboodle.  There is plenty of room for all my daughter&#x27;s makeup and brushes.  The design is perfect for a young girl starting out with her own makeup.  Would recommend it to all moms to get for their girls.</li>
            <li> The case is very pretty and has has plenty of room for all my cosmetics. It is compact enough to throw into an &#x27;on-board&#x27; duffel bag for plane or train travel.</li>
            <li> I was expecting this item to be black, that is what was stated in the discription, but when I got it it was red so I was not to pleased with that. I feel that if you are selling an item you should tell the true color and let the buyer make the choice as to if they want it or not.</li>
            <li> I got this to hold all of my nail tools, my files and clippers, silk wraps, treatments, nail art supplies, etc.  It&#x27;s so small, I had to leave out my small acrylic kit and my jewels because they just don&#x27;t fit.  The shelves overlap so that I have to empty the whole shelf to get what&#x27;s hiding underneath the top one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And let&#x27;s not forget, IT&#x27;S PINK!  The black lace is accurate in the picture, but under that, it&#x27;s pink!</li>
            <li> I received this wonderful cosmetic case well before my delivery estimate, and am very pleased with how useful and cute it is! I have a lot of makeup, but have no problem fitting all of it in this conveniently sized portable case. The price is also very reasonable. I am considering purchasing another one for my sister! I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this to transfer all of my makeup out of my desk drawer. I&#x27;m entering High School and I wanted my desk back to be able to focus on schoolwork. For my age I have quite a large array of makeup and this case fits everything JUST right. Unfortunately there&#x27;s no room for my collection to grow any further, but there&#x27;s only one other complaint.  The tiers of shelves are EXETREMELY shallow. They&#x27;re only an inch deep and it&#x27;s very difficult to fit products in there. The top tiers are okay because there&#x27;s room above them, but the second tier is almost impossible to fit anything in.</li>
            <li> Nice product. It reminds me of the caboodles from my childhood. It&#x27;s not too bulky but still gives enough room for whatever make-up dooda  I need to fit in while traveling!</li>
            <li> I like this case a lot. The lace fabric is just so classy and chic. This holds all my essential make up, minus the brushes. At this price, I would definitely recommend it. This makes for a great gift too.</li>
            <li> If you order this item expecting to get what is shown (hot pink w/ black lace) then you will be disappointed.  I got grey w/black lace.  Funny because other reviews indicate just the opposite...that they order the grey and got the pink.  I reported this to Target and they will hopefully correct the site soon, but you may want to check with them before ordering.  btw- I also ordered the larger version which is actually black lace on black.  I do love the look of these cases and am tempted to keep the black lace on grey, but I really need this hot pink one to complete the set!  Target, can you pls get it right this time?  (apparently they are the only store that even carries the pink).  If anyone knows otherwise, pls let me know!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for that perfect organizer that will keep your Bare Escentuals makeup from tumbling over, as would happen in a normal makeup bag, this organizer is fabulous.  It&#x27;s small and compact, so it doesn&#x27;t take up much room in the bathroom, &amp; it&#x27;s good for those weekend trips as well.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite happy with my purchase.  It works perfectly for what I need and holds my large collection of make up easily.</li>
            <li> I was having trouble deciding which size to get because i didnt want the case to be too small however this case is the perfect size its a mmedium size case not to small and not to big. The design outside is pretty and very cute. inside has the  brand design and black. Its just perfect.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the drawers over the \\&quot;bulk storage\\&quot; this little case seems like something out of Mary Poppins or Dr. Who. I have an extensive makeup collection and this fits all of it, though it is a tight fit, that actually forces me to keep it better organized, and prevents me from going on another \\&quot;OMG Mac released their fall line???!?\\&quot; spending spree. I keep my look pretty simple, so much of the money I spend on sprees like that ends up being a waste...and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not the only girl in THAT boat, so think about how much you really need, a smaller case could be a blessing in disguise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the little drawers for my eyeshadow and brushes. I&#x27;m kindof a maniac when it comes to brushes and tools, two of the drawers are dedicated to just my brushes! I use mineral eyeshadows, so it&#x27;s really important that they are kept level, and the drawers are perfect for that, those all fit on one drawer, and I use the other for my glosses. All of my blush, foundation and face powders go in the bulk storage area along with fake eyelashes and other packaged goodies. It is so nice to know where everything is, and to be able to find it at a moments notice. All of my makeup has a \\&quot;home\\&quot; and it is so much easier to stay clean now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box also seems pretty well made, I love that it latches shut. If I was still living with my sisters I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d make use of those keys...Fortunately my makeup habit hasn&#x27;t rubbed off on my boyfriend, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about locking it (though I&#x27;m sure that would be the least of my problems). I bought mine at a store, so I also didn&#x27;t have any confusion about which one I was going to receive.</li>
            <li> I love the look, but the little shelves are exactly that--little.  I can not fit my four color Chanel eye shadow compact on one shelves.  The bottom row of shelves is also partially blocked by the one above it, making it difficult to pull out items.  Pretty, fits nice on my counter, but can&#x27;t fit my make up.</li>
            <li> I had purchased one of these for my Sister....and I loved it so much..I had bought it at a store in the mall...and it was really expensive...so...I came on here..and found it in a minute...for less than half the price.....I love it...it has six drawers..and then a large bottom compartment...I would recommend this to anyone....</li>
            <li> I like this make-up case. It suits my needs very well but the one I received was hot pink with black lace. Not sure why.   Additionally, not the most... solid structure. It&#x27;s as thought the brackets and moving parts are either low quality or not very tight. I&#x27;m by no means unhappy, but I do feel a little hoodwinked especially because of the color.</li>
            <li> This is a great little cosmetic case for the price.  Mechanisms work well and details and stitching on outside of case are clean and complete with no gaps or loose ends. The only problem is that the color is not as shown.  The case is actually hot pink with black lace.  The picture shows gray or off white under black lace.  We returned the first one and reordered on the phone what we wanted and the reordered case was still hot pink.</li>
            <li> The train case is a bit wobbley. And they said it was black on black and I received a case that was hot pink with black lace. It&#x27;s a very nice case, just wish it was as described.</li>
            <li> I was instantly drawn to this feminine, sexy little case.  In my opinion it is even cuter with the pink background.  Unfortunately I was extremely disappointed in the quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hinges are loose and extremely flimsy.  The drawers unfold unevenly - you go to lift up a drawer and one side comes up while the other gets stuck. The metal that supports the extended drawers can be bent by a gentle touch from a finger.  It is literally about the thickness and strength of a soda pop can.  The hardware is loose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The exterior actually has black lace fabric over it.  Considering what happens to my makeup case, I think I&#x27;ll look for something more indestructable and definitely more cleanable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Also, the Caboodles cases I looked at did not close smoothly or evenly.  The sides had to be coerced into position to line up properly.  The metal latch needs to be fiddled with to get it to catch.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this! I put everything in this case from makeup brushes to mascaras and eyeshadows. I store most of my makeup and makeup accessories inside of this case with the exception of lip products because I have too much to fit in here. I use this daily and it&#x27;s awesome because it keeps everything so organized and neat. It&#x27;s also really beautiful on my dresser and keeps prying eyes from accessing all my stuff.</li>
            <li> Make-up in bottom tray gets lost with dark interior. Clear caboodle next on my list! I keep my caboodle open on my dresser...it holds my 8 lipsticks, 2 mid size bottles of foundation, 5 eye &amp; lip pencils, 3 -4x2 inch eye shadow cases,  2 powder compacts, 3 foundation brushes &amp; that&#x27;s about it. For the girl who has a smaller make-up collection.</li>
            <li> first of all this bag is an easy 22 dollars at a target store and i want to know why they want double that amount -_- wouldnt pay so much for this knowing its wayyyy cheaper...but aside from that the case is good though</li>
            <li> nothing extraordinary. just like any other case! price is right for the product you get. Do not expect too much.</li>
