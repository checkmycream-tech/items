            <li>Hair illusion is great</li>
            <li>Product is great and doesn&#x27;t have any chemicals that causes your head to itch.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that it also works great with clients experiencing Alopecia, and is a great confidence booster.&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li>This is a really great product.</li>
            <li>Works great for me.</li>
            <li>This is the best product of its kind on the market.</li>
            <li>Stuff is great.</li>
            <li>However it&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li>He is so happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Great Product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Turns out hair illusion works great.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing!</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product!</li>
            <li>Amazing !</li>
            <li>have tried most hair concealers on the market and Hair Illusion is one of the best for value for money.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works like magic, I was very happy with this product and the seller.</li>
            <li>This is an awesome product the best thatI have come across thus far.</li>
            <li>remember once you apply it use a good hold hair spray an a hand held mirror</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved how it looks on your hair and people</li>
            <li>Over all its a good product</li>
            <li>His barber recommended it and he saw there were a lot of good reviews for the product, so he gave it a try.</li>
            <li>Then i tried Dermmatch which i loved and still like a lot</li>
            <li>but then i wondered how the hell the guys on instagram made it look so good.</li>
            <li>and it was STILL good.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t know it&#x27;ll work this good</li>
            <li>it&#x27;ll  be a good time to put on hair illusion</li>
            <li>but my sides grow really quick so this product was perfect for me.</li>
            <li>Overall a wonderful excellent product</li>
            <li>Product works great, cut the cut you want, apply some hair spray, wait about 10 seconds and apply from a distance, like about a foot and when done apply some more hair spray.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with seller as well.</li>
            <li>I think that hair illusion is the best product on the market right now.</li>
            <li>and this product does magic for me!</li>
            <li>I have used on my clients and they love it!</li>

            <li>Great product for concealing bold spots.</li>
            <li>I can now postpone the thought of surgical hair restoration for many more years to come!</li>

            <li>and my wife sees, this is the best so far.  </li>
            <li>The bottle holes are also good size to lightly sprikle - takes longer but</li>
            <li>This one look the best by far.</li>
            <li>Used it for an old friend of mine who was thinning out and had a fitness competition and gave him one of the best bald fades he&#x27;d ever had.</li>
            <li>My clients and fellow barbers are beyond impressed with the natural look of this product when applied.</li>
            <li>I wasn’t happy about the ingredients in Toppik and thought a natural product would be a good choice to try.</li>
            <li>I was once even given a free bottle by the owner i love the company and brand !</li>
            <li>Synthetic keratin products work 100X better.</li>
            <li>This product is  excellent, I do not use it daily</li>
            <li>All my friends love it as well..</li>
            <li>it provides more even coverage.</li>
            <li>Outstanding hair concealer</li>
            <li>I used it on myself to insure that it is good enough, and I was extremely happy.</li>
            <li>Make sure you explain to your clients that they MUST take care of it.  </li>
            <li>Its like putting hair trimmings on top of your head.</li>
            <li>I give it four stars because I wish it could lock with the hair better.</li>
            <li>Thank you for creating such an awesome product!</li>
            <li>Would love to talk about doing more business with the company.</li>

            <li>an see if you&#x27;re satisfied or not.</li>
            <li>i love this stuff.</li>
            <li>As a barber I love this product.</li>
            <li>My clients love it</li>
            <li>he was very excited about his cut.</li>
            <li>I tried looking at it up close in the mirror under very bright lights and it seems the brighter the light, the more natural it looks.</li>
            <li>This product is pretty good, it gave me some confidence iam on propecia and for the time being this will do the trick ,  and people I was not paid for</li>
            <li>Totally love the product would love to get the free bottle to use on my clients better than topik</li>
            <li>Caboki is pretty good too, but from what I see</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it and its amazing, magic right before your eyes</li>
            <li>and i am able to get a nice crisp edge when I use hair illusion.</li>
            <li>I order one for my husband he loved it so much.</li>
            <li>Great product, easy to use has a natural look when applied.</li>
            <li>For its sole purpose, Hair Illusion is definitely THE BEST product on the market!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s perfect for men and woman in need of a non surgical, yet very realistic temporary fix.&lt;br /&gt;Struggling with the insecurity of my receding hair line has now become a thing of the past!&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li>My clients love it puts a smile on there faces!</li>
            <li>Great Product!, would recommend this over any other products that&#x27;s on the market today.</li>
            <li>I tried other products and I like this one the best.</li>
            <li>it has the most authentic look with a fresh application.</li>
            <li>A couple of negatives: I wish it sprayed on and it wiped of easy.</li>
            <li>I wear contacts and this product comes out way too easy.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li>I get 3 to 4 days use per application with hair spray with a strong hold.</li>
            <li>In addition to excellent coverage, it doesn&#x27;t coat everything in the area with a fine dust like the other brands do, or get aspirated by the user.</li>
            <li>This brand is by far the best and most natural looking hair fiber product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such an easy fix!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not super impressed, though it did give me some peace of mind for a bit as I wasn&#x27;t so worried about my widening part.</li>
            <li>sure you know your hair color and get some of that super hold spray so that way when you sprinkle hair illusion on your hairline or bald spot</li>
            <li>,I WOULD NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE WALKING INTO THE OFFICE WITH THIS STUFF ON MY HEAD AND PEOPLE</li>
            <li>After a few applications you will learn the perfect way to apply on hair.</li>
            <li>Its an obvious great product, but</li>
            <li>that in the day light.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised how good it looked.</li>
            <li>When you get it right,... nothing looks better than this.</li>
            <li>High Quality product plus amazing customer service.</li>
            <li>This product works nicely and highly recommended&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Victor</li>
            <li>I am reading all the reviews here on how great this product is I have used Toppik for many years now and it stays on all day with no problems I purchased this product after all the reviews on how it stays better than other hair fiber products and looks more natural</li>
            <li>Oh, I must say this with the fact that I do have significant hair still</li>
            <li>One of the better, more natural looking products out.</li>
            <li>What can I say man there is something special about this hair illusion in</li>
            <li>Blends right in with my hair &amp; cant even tell a difference!</li>
            <li>but my beard isn&#x27;t as full as I would like it to be</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply and gives a very natural look.</li>
            <li>It is best if you use multiple mirrors while applying to you can apply as evenly as possible.</li>
            <li>Not only is it safe to use but the appearance is much better.</li>
            <li>It Looks more realistic than hair dye.</li>
            <li>I Highly Recommend this product to those who losing their hairline or bald spot it works like magic just make</li>
            <li>but I do use it for special occasions especially when I want to take nice pictures.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and very affordable.</li>
            <li>Im glad somebody finally got it right!!</li>
            <li>definitely going to get more!</li>
            <li>I like the product because I can choose when to use it as most of the time I don&#x27;t really care about any bald spots except in certain situations like when there&#x27;s pictures being taken.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing, it completely resembles real hair.</li>
            <li>Better for bald spots Great for covering up the thin spots</li>
            <li>but it definitely worth a try</li>
            <li>, It&#x27;s worth it...</li>
            <li>No one can tell I have it in my hair and my barber says this is the most natural product out there..</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the money in my opinion</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this with a strong hairspray to keep it locked in.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s real hair, and like real hair right after a cut, it clings to your skin (much better than it binds to your hair itself) and itches like hell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the good thing about it, its not messy and does not mess the scarfs, cloth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about four months now, and compared to other similar type products, I like this one the best.</li>
            <li>Used other brands before none is as good as Hair Illusion.</li>
            <li>but like i said, when you get it right...</li>
            <li>It works very well on my thinning hair look fuller and thicker, make sure using a lot of strong hold fritz to hold hair until next shampoo, Voila !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure HAIR ILLUSION will be one of Amazon top seller in the near future.</li>
            <li>Amazing product it looks amazing would definitely recommend to other people.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good, would give 5stars but comes out without a spray to hold it down...</li>
            <li>I first came across this product on Instgram and despite my hesitation I received it as a gift after telling my friend I was thinking of trying it.</li>
            <li>I used a white towel  at the gym just to be sure.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how I got my first bottle.</li>
            <li>this review iam a first time user</li>
            <li>Takes about 10 minutes to apply and that&#x27;s being real particular about everything.</li>
            <li>It works really well!</li>
            <li>i knew i would&#x27;ve ordered more than one for someone needs it for daily use</li>
            <li>but it was evident</li>
            <li>The coverage is fantastic, it looks so natural.</li>
            <li>I tried Toppik a while back and thought is was OK.</li>
            <li>I love the look of having all my hair back.</li>
            <li>Real hair fibers!</li>
            <li>Other then that I love using it on special events...</li>
            <li>However, I am very pleased with the black color that I purchased.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not messy at all, unlike caboki I used or those others that make a mess or stains hair illusion is fabulous!!!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re curious, follow hairillusionllc on instagram, they&#x27;re always posting good deals and offers.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple, natural, and effective.</li>
            <li>Having alopecia  spots, I have tried alot of products this is by far the most natural looking.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first day of using this product he received so much in tips and so much positive feedback.</li>
            <li>works well, need more colors, a grey perhaps, is there a way to make the product softer?</li>
            <li>Even after sweating and some exposure to waves at a water park today my hair remained pretty much intact.</li>
            <li>received item fast and its exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>When i first tried it, I didnt like it much</li>
            <li>I am a barber of 15 years that has searched high and low for a product to help encourage and make my clients confident with age</li>
            <li>Since the product is made of natural hair fibers, it looks more natural and holds better than some of the other fibers I have tried.</li>
            <li>Very high quality product, I regained my confidence and self-esteem.</li>
            <li>And by far I would say this is the most easy to use, realistic, and less time consuming product out there.</li>
            <li>This stuff is beyond amazing definitely will be purchasing again in the future</li>
            <li>THE ONLY PLACE I WOULD FEEL COMFORTABLE</li>
            <li>This product has worked very well for me.</li>
            <li>The point of it is for it to blend with your real hair that grows out.</li>
            <li>Hair illusion looks like real hair when you pour it from the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product, I&#x27;m not going bald</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s like a miracle this product is for real</li>
            <li>I was very dissatisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to workout and sweat with confidence and the product last until I completely wash it out.  </li>
            <li>and it seemed kind of messy</li>
            <li>Same could be said in the Sun, looks more natural in the sun.</li>
            <li>Way better than any other concealer.</li>
            <li>Works better than the other concealers.</li>
            <li>better use some other product.</li>
            <li>, I am pleased to say after many trials and errors with dye and other lesser hair concealers I have finally found the winner give it a try you have nothing to lose but all to gain </li>
            <li>Your hands are full of the fibers and the fibers are very coarse for my skin.</li>
            <li>it is nice, doesnt clot, covers all areas but the bottle is small</li>
            <li>He says it actually has an incredibly natural look and even after sleeping with it in, it was still fine in the morning.</li>
            <li>At any rate, I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this for barbers or anyone wishing to conceal bald area&#x27;s without the use of harmful chemicals and dyes.</li>
            <li>This product is by far better than any other fibers I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Even though it costs little more money</li>
            <li>VIA instagram on nick young&#x27;s page !!</li>
            <li>My onlly problem is the product is a little more costly than the others.</li>
            <li>QUESTION: it use to come in a clear glass where you can see how much is in it.</li>
            <li>It  looks real and natural.</li>
            <li>Looks 100% natural &amp; real.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for a few of my clients and they love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more natural looking than Toppik or Caboki, and the color that I use (black) blends in with my hair quite well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s takes some time and practice to get right, but it definitely will change the appearance of thinning areas in the hair.</li>
            <li>Getting the right color is essential...</li>
            <li>The fibers are a little more fine than other similar type products, thus I have to take some extra time for clean up after using it.</li>
            <li>I have tried EVERY other product available for thinning hair</li>
            <li>your new look</li>
            <li>Everyone I&#x27;ve used this on felt like a new man.  </li>
            <li>a new look!&lt;br /&gt;The product is hair fibers that is applied to a balding area in the form of maybe sprinkling salt on food.</li>
            <li>I credit this to the very strong hair spray i used called Bed Head, hard Head.</li>
            <li>Illuision is a safe and efficient way to blend the thinning hair in little to no time!</li>
            <li>Very natural looking.</li>
            <li>It looks very natural in the sunlight.  </li>
            <li>Looks very natural and doesn&#x27;t come off or run like the spray powders do.</li>
            <li>No cheesy sprays that rub off on pillows and such.</li>
            <li>and yes it does look natural but did not stay on my hair!</li>
            <li>I have had a single application last several days, the main thing to do is wear a stocking cap at night and in the morning just very lightly sprinkle some hair illusion</li>
            <li>I just started using this product this week and so far it has looked very natural after every use.</li>
            <li>and it has totally change my confidence in a positive way.</li>
            <li>Not great for filling in completely bald areas, but for small patches and thinning areas it is perfect!</li>
            <li>i tried almost entire hair loss product an none work tried to be a little more patient</li>
            <li>My hair is thinning up top and hardly grows</li>
            <li>I gave it to my barber and it makes the line look super sharp.</li>
            <li>It is made out of human hair and looks real on my head.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t nothing around like this because of how natural it looks</li>
            <li>Arrived early.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s and</li>
            <li>I developed a trick.</li>
            <li>I have a bald spot that is completely bald.</li>
            <li>Completely hides noticeable bald spots.</li>
            <li>I was blown away on how natural looking and durable this product is.</li>
            <li>To all the guys with thinning hair that want a natural cover up look.</li>
            <li>All i can say is wow</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 30 yrs old</li>
            <li>Really brings back your confidence.</li>
            <li>Natural looking</li>
            <li>It conceals thinning areas with a natural appearance.</li>
            <li>I primarily tried this product to cover a small (but growing) bald spot on the top of my head as well as a strip on the back of my head from a scar from a previous surgery where I had some nerve damage.</li>
            <li>but it gets all over the sink though so expect a little clean up.</li>
            <li>It stayed on (more or less) through and intense gym session but definitely have to be careful not to touch it when you&#x27;re wiping the sweat off your face.</li>
            <li>Hair Illusion definitely delivers on its claims and now pictures, even from high angles in the sun, look like there&#x27;s no bald spot at all.  </li>
            <li>and you will be back to normal.</li>
            <li>I simply add gel or whatever product to my hair first, sprinkle the hair illusion, line up my hairline as desired and spray hair spray or whatever other product to hold it steady.</li>
            <li>Natural human hair that blends in seamlessly to cover desired areas.</li>
            <li>I really wished it could be more durable for the careless customer which I come in contact with a lot.  </li>
            <li>No other word to describe it.  </li>
            <li>I want to say this product has changed my confidence in general.  </li>
            <li>I use the product on my beard area because it doesn&#x27;t completely fill out, and I must admit it not only gave the result I was hoping for, but it gave the look that I have always wanted....</li>
            <li>I am a hair care professional and I service mostly African American men who quite frequently experience hereditary receding hair line and hair loss patterns.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something that&#x27;s looks natural, I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li>The product final stage of applying it looks natural.</li>
            <li>Hair Illusion is the most natural by far ( I have black hair with little grey)  </li>
            <li>I personally would apply fresh everyday</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this above all other alike brands.</li>
            <li>Too much can make your service irregular, too little can still show balding areas.</li>

            <li> Hair illusion is great</li>
            <li> Product is great and doesn&#x27;t have any chemicals that causes your head to itch.  </li>

            <li> Works great for me.</li>

            <li> This is an amazing product!</li>
            <li> Amazing !</li>
            <li> have tried most hair concealers on the market and Hair Illusion is one of the best for value for money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works like magic, I was very happy with this product and the seller.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product the best thatI have come across thus far.</li>
            <li> remember once you apply it use a good hold hair spray an a hand held mirror</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved how it looks on your hair and people</li>
            <li> Over all its a good product</li>
            <li> His barber recommended it and he saw there were a lot of good reviews for the product, so he gave it a try.</li>
            <li> Then i tried Dermmatch which i loved and still like a lot</li>
            <li> but then i wondered how the hell the guys on instagram made it look so good.</li>
            <li> and it was STILL good.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t know it&#x27;ll work this good</li>
            <li> it&#x27;ll  be a good time to put on hair illusion</li>
            <li> but my sides grow really quick so this product was perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Overall a wonderful excellent product</li>
            <li> Product works great, cut the cut you want, apply some hair spray, wait about 10 seconds and apply from a distance, like about a foot and when done apply some more hair spray.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with seller as well.</li>
            <li> I think that hair illusion is the best product on the market right now.</li>
            <li> and this product does magic for me!</li>

            <li> This one look the best by far.</li>
            <li> Used it for an old friend of mine who was thinning out and had a fitness competition and gave him one of the best bald fades he&#x27;d ever had.</li>
            <li> My clients and fellow barbers are beyond impressed with the natural look of this product when applied.</li>
            <li> I wasn’t happy about the ingredients in Toppik and thought a natural product would be a good choice to try.</li>
            <li> I was once even given a free bottle by the owner i love the company and brand !</li>
            <li> Synthetic keratin products work 100X better.</li>
            <li> This product is  excellent, I do not use it daily</li>
            <li> All my friends love it as well..</li>
            <li> it provides more even coverage.</li>
            <li> Outstanding hair concealer</li>
            <li> I used it on myself to insure that it is good enough, and I was extremely happy.</li>
            <li> Make sure you explain to your clients that they MUST take care of it.  </li>
            <li> Its like putting hair trimmings on top of your head.</li>
            <li> I give it four stars because I wish it could lock with the hair better.</li>
            <li> Thank you for creating such an awesome product!</li>

            <li> and i would buy more in bulk.</li>

            <li> an see if you&#x27;re satisfied or not.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff.</li>
            <li> As a barber I love this product.</li>
            <li> My clients love it</li>
            <li> he was very excited about his cut.</li>
            <li> I tried looking at it up close in the mirror under very bright lights and it seems the brighter the light, the more natural it looks.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good, it gave me some confidence iam on propecia and for the time being this will do the trick ,  and people I was not paid for</li>
            <li> Totally love the product would love to get the free bottle to use on my clients better than topik</li>
            <li> Caboki is pretty good too, but from what I see</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it and its amazing, magic right before your eyes</li>
            <li> and i am able to get a nice crisp edge when I use hair illusion.</li>
            <li> I order one for my husband he loved it so much.</li>
            <li> Great product, easy to use has a natural look when applied.</li>
            <li> For its sole purpose, Hair Illusion is definitely THE BEST product on the market!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s perfect for men and woman in need of a non surgical, yet very realistic temporary fix.&lt;br /&gt;Struggling with the insecurity of my receding hair line has now become a thing of the past!&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li> My clients love it puts a smile on there faces!</li>
            <li> Great Product!, would recommend this over any other products that&#x27;s on the market today.</li>
            <li> I tried other products and I like this one the best.</li>
            <li> it has the most authentic look with a fresh application.</li>
            <li> A couple of negatives: I wish it sprayed on and it wiped of easy.</li>
            <li> I wear contacts and this product comes out way too easy.</li>
            <li> Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li> I get 3 to 4 days use per application with hair spray with a strong hold.</li>
            <li> In addition to excellent coverage, it doesn&#x27;t coat everything in the area with a fine dust like the other brands do, or get aspirated by the user.</li>
            <li> This brand is by far the best and most natural looking hair fiber product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such an easy fix!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not super impressed, though it did give me some peace of mind for a bit as I wasn&#x27;t so worried about my widening part.</li>
            <li> sure you know your hair color and get some of that super hold spray so that way when you sprinkle hair illusion on your hairline or bald spot</li>
            <li> ,I WOULD NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE WALKING INTO THE OFFICE WITH THIS STUFF ON MY HEAD AND PEOPLE</li>
            <li> After a few applications you will learn the perfect way to apply on hair.</li>
            <li> Its an obvious great product, but</li>
            <li> that in the day light.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised how good it looked.</li>
            <li> When you get it right,... nothing looks better than this.</li>
            <li> High Quality product plus amazing customer service.</li>
            <li> This product works nicely and highly recommended&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Victor</li>
            <li> I am reading all the reviews here on how great this product is I have used Toppik for many years now and it stays on all day with no problems I purchased this product after all the reviews on how it stays better than other hair fiber products and looks more natural</li>
            <li> Oh, I must say this with the fact that I do have significant hair still</li>
            <li> One of the better, more natural looking products out.</li>
            <li> What can I say man there is something special about this hair illusion in</li>
            <li> Blends right in with my hair &amp; cant even tell a difference!</li>
            <li> but my beard isn&#x27;t as full as I would like it to be</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply and gives a very natural look.</li>
            <li> It is best if you use multiple mirrors while applying to you can apply as evenly as possible.</li>
            <li> Not only is it safe to use but the appearance is much better.</li>
            <li> It Looks more realistic than hair dye.</li>
            <li> I Highly Recommend this product to those who losing their hairline or bald spot it works like magic just make</li>
            <li> but I do use it for special occasions especially when I want to take nice pictures.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and very affordable.</li>
            <li> Im glad somebody finally got it right!!</li>
            <li> definitely going to get more!</li>
            <li> I like the product because I can choose when to use it as most of the time I don&#x27;t really care about any bald spots except in certain situations like when there&#x27;s pictures being taken.  </li>
            <li> This product is amazing, it completely resembles real hair.</li>
            <li> Better for bald spots Great for covering up the thin spots</li>
            <li> but it definitely worth a try</li>
            <li> , It&#x27;s worth it...</li>
            <li> No one can tell I have it in my hair and my barber says this is the most natural product out there..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the money in my opinion</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this with a strong hairspray to keep it locked in.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s real hair, and like real hair right after a cut, it clings to your skin (much better than it binds to your hair itself) and itches like hell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the good thing about it, its not messy and does not mess the scarfs, cloth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about four months now, and compared to other similar type products, I like this one the best.</li>
            <li> Used other brands before none is as good as Hair Illusion.</li>
            <li> but like i said, when you get it right...</li>
            <li> It works very well on my thinning hair look fuller and thicker, make sure using a lot of strong hold fritz to hold hair until next shampoo, Voila !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure HAIR ILLUSION will be one of Amazon top seller in the near future.</li>
            <li> Amazing product it looks amazing would definitely recommend to other people.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good, would give 5stars but comes out without a spray to hold it down...</li>
            <li> I first came across this product on Instgram and despite my hesitation I received it as a gift after telling my friend I was thinking of trying it.</li>
            <li> I used a white towel  at the gym just to be sure.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how I got my first bottle.</li>
            <li> this review iam a first time user</li>
            <li> Takes about 10 minutes to apply and that&#x27;s being real particular about everything.</li>
            <li> It works really well!</li>
            <li> i knew i would&#x27;ve ordered more than one for someone needs it for daily use</li>
            <li> but it was evident</li>
            <li> The coverage is fantastic, it looks so natural.</li>
            <li> I tried Toppik a while back and thought is was OK.</li>
            <li> I love the look of having all my hair back.</li>
            <li> Real hair fibers!</li>
            <li> Other then that I love using it on special events...</li>
            <li> However, I am very pleased with the black color that I purchased.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not messy at all, unlike caboki I used or those others that make a mess or stains hair illusion is fabulous!!!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re curious, follow hairillusionllc on instagram, they&#x27;re always posting good deals and offers.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple, natural, and effective.</li>
            <li> Having alopecia  spots, I have tried alot of products this is by far the most natural looking.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first day of using this product he received so much in tips and so much positive feedback.</li>
            <li> works well, need more colors, a grey perhaps, is there a way to make the product softer?</li>
            <li> Even after sweating and some exposure to waves at a water park today my hair remained pretty much intact.</li>
            <li> received item fast and its exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> When i first tried it, I didnt like it much</li>
            <li> I am a barber of 15 years that has searched high and low for a product to help encourage and make my clients confident with age</li>
            <li> Since the product is made of natural hair fibers, it looks more natural and holds better than some of the other fibers I have tried.</li>
            <li> Very high quality product, I regained my confidence and self-esteem.</li>
            <li> And by far I would say this is the most easy to use, realistic, and less time consuming product out there.</li>
            <li> This stuff is beyond amazing definitely will be purchasing again in the future</li>
            <li> THE ONLY PLACE I WOULD FEEL COMFORTABLE</li>
            <li> This product has worked very well for me.</li>
            <li> The point of it is for it to blend with your real hair that grows out.</li>
            <li> Hair illusion looks like real hair when you pour it from the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product, I&#x27;m not going bald</li>
            <li> order came fast and on time ...</li>
            <li> THANKS 😎😎</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a life saver.</li>
            <li> , I am ready to order another one soon.</li>
            <li> thanks hair illusion&#x27;s</li>
            <li> NOW for my customers,  thanks.</li>
            <li> Hair illusion being real hair blends really well.</li>
            <li> I never heard of using real hair for a concealer</li>
            <li> I feel that you guys were really thinking with this product.  </li>
            <li> It really works for me.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.  </li>
            <li> Overall, fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I can cover it very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it really works</li>
            <li> I really wish I had an unlimited supply.</li>
            <li> It looks like my real hair.</li>
            <li> Thanks to this product, I don&#x27;t need to wear any hats anymore.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like a miracle this product is for real</li>
            <li> I was very dissatisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to workout and sweat with confidence and the product last until I completely wash it out.  </li>
            <li> and it seemed kind of messy</li>
            <li> Same could be said in the Sun, looks more natural in the sun.</li>
            <li> Way better than any other concealer.</li>
            <li> Works better than the other concealers.</li>
            <li> better use some other product.</li>
            <li> , I am pleased to say after many trials and errors with dye and other lesser hair concealers I have finally found the winner give it a try you have nothing to lose but all to gain </li>
            <li> Your hands are full of the fibers and the fibers are very coarse for my skin.</li>
            <li> it is nice, doesnt clot, covers all areas but the bottle is small</li>
            <li> He says it actually has an incredibly natural look and even after sleeping with it in, it was still fine in the morning.</li>
            <li> At any rate, I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this for barbers or anyone wishing to conceal bald area&#x27;s without the use of harmful chemicals and dyes.</li>
            <li> This product is by far better than any other fibers I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Even though it costs little more money</li>
            <li> VIA instagram on nick young&#x27;s page !!</li>
            <li> My onlly problem is the product is a little more costly than the others.</li>
            <li> QUESTION: it use to come in a clear glass where you can see how much is in it.</li>
            <li> It  looks real and natural.</li>
            <li> Looks 100% natural &amp; real.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a few of my clients and they love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more natural looking than Toppik or Caboki, and the color that I use (black) blends in with my hair quite well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s takes some time and practice to get right, but it definitely will change the appearance of thinning areas in the hair.</li>
            <li> Getting the right color is essential...</li>
            <li> The fibers are a little more fine than other similar type products, thus I have to take some extra time for clean up after using it.</li>
            <li> I have tried EVERY other product available for thinning hair</li>
            <li> your new look</li>
            <li> Everyone I&#x27;ve used this on felt like a new man.  </li>
            <li> a new look!&lt;br /&gt;The product is hair fibers that is applied to a balding area in the form of maybe sprinkling salt on food.</li>
            <li> I credit this to the very strong hair spray i used called Bed Head, hard Head.</li>
            <li> Illuision is a safe and efficient way to blend the thinning hair in little to no time!</li>
            <li> Very natural looking.</li>
            <li> It looks very natural in the sunlight.  </li>
            <li> Looks very natural and doesn&#x27;t come off or run like the spray powders do.</li>
            <li> No cheesy sprays that rub off on pillows and such.</li>
            <li> and yes it does look natural but did not stay on my hair!</li>
            <li> I have had a single application last several days, the main thing to do is wear a stocking cap at night and in the morning just very lightly sprinkle some hair illusion</li>
            <li> I just started using this product this week and so far it has looked very natural after every use.</li>
            <li> and it has totally change my confidence in a positive way.</li>
            <li> Not great for filling in completely bald areas, but for small patches and thinning areas it is perfect!</li>
            <li> i tried almost entire hair loss product an none work tried to be a little more patient</li>
            <li> My hair is thinning up top and hardly grows</li>
            <li> I gave it to my barber and it makes the line look super sharp.</li>
            <li> It is made out of human hair and looks real on my head.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t nothing around like this because of how natural it looks</li>
            <li> Arrived early.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s and</li>
            <li> I developed a trick.</li>
            <li> I have a bald spot that is completely bald.</li>
            <li> Completely hides noticeable bald spots.</li>
            <li> I was blown away on how natural looking and durable this product is.</li>
            <li> To all the guys with thinning hair that want a natural cover up look.</li>
            <li> All i can say is wow</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30 yrs old</li>
            <li> Really brings back your confidence.</li>
            <li> Natural looking</li>
            <li> It conceals thinning areas with a natural appearance.</li>
            <li> I primarily tried this product to cover a small (but growing) bald spot on the top of my head as well as a strip on the back of my head from a scar from a previous surgery where I had some nerve damage.</li>
            <li> but it gets all over the sink though so expect a little clean up.</li>
            <li> It stayed on (more or less) through and intense gym session but definitely have to be careful not to touch it when you&#x27;re wiping the sweat off your face.</li>
            <li> Hair Illusion definitely delivers on its claims and now pictures, even from high angles in the sun, look like there&#x27;s no bald spot at all.  </li>
            <li> and you will be back to normal.</li>
            <li> I simply add gel or whatever product to my hair first, sprinkle the hair illusion, line up my hairline as desired and spray hair spray or whatever other product to hold it steady.</li>
            <li> Natural human hair that blends in seamlessly to cover desired areas.</li>
            <li> I really wished it could be more durable for the careless customer which I come in contact with a lot.  </li>
            <li> No other word to describe it.  </li>
            <li> I want to say this product has changed my confidence in general.  </li>
            <li> I use the product on my beard area because it doesn&#x27;t completely fill out, and I must admit it not only gave the result I was hoping for, but it gave the look that I have always wanted....</li>
            <li> I am a hair care professional and I service mostly African American men who quite frequently experience hereditary receding hair line and hair loss patterns.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something that&#x27;s looks natural, I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The product final stage of applying it looks natural.</li>
            <li> Hair Illusion is the most natural by far ( I have black hair with little grey)  </li>
            <li> I personally would apply fresh everyday</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this above all other alike brands.</li>
            <li> Too much can make your service irregular, too little can still show balding areas.</li>
            <li> I was looking for other natural products when I came across Hair Illusion.</li>
            <li> Those things are the ultimate key to having it last long..</li>
            <li> Price point is a little high.</li>
            <li> On my way home.. it started raining pretty hard.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time as expected good product, however the price is too expensive for the little amount you get.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid that this product would not work well with those experiencing total or very significant hair loss.</li>
            <li> It works, looks natural but it is messy...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll see how long this bottle lasts.  </li>
            <li> ie I am not completely bald but thinning.  </li>
            <li> it also looks natural but stays on this product is a waste of money and if it doesn&#x27;t stay on the hair</li>
            <li> i should&#x27;ve bought this stuff long time ago</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend xFusion -- same stuff as Toppik (same manufacturer), half the price of the name brand.</li>
            <li> does the job well compared to other products having bigger holes which dispenses in blobs.</li>
            <li> It definitely looks natural and hard to tell.</li>
            <li> This is actually like actual and not cheap powder.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT WOULD BE IN A DARK SETTING SUCH AS A NIGHT CLUB.EVEN</li>
            <li> In short, not worth money.</li>
            <li> I was a little  skeptical from using black outs but ever since using this product I have more confidence  in myself.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, never tried a product like this until I seen Hair Illusion!</li>
            <li> I have used this on a few clients and some like it and some don&#x27;t I personally like it</li>
            <li> Heard about this product a few months back and immediately shot to Amazon to see if it was for sale</li>
            <li> A total waste of money, stick with Toppix</li>
            <li> Fiber is very coarse, not smooth to apply.</li>
            <li> how can they even say that it will not come off when you get it wet?</li>
            <li> It does not run off your head if wet.</li>
            <li> Now this last order the container is black and it feels lighter for some reason !</li>
            <li> and I have to shake harder compared to the other products.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s literally the same little bits of hair that make a mess of your sink after a shave, that&#x27;s all this product is.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, believe me.</li>
            <li> My haircuts always look razor sharp with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not wondering what people are thinking about my balding due to alopecia.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other &amp;#34;powder&amp;#34; products like Caboki, Toppik and now Hair Illusion.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands for years, but none of them compare.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical on trying the product at first by my barber stylist.</li>
            <li> I have never had anyone ask or detect that I was using this product to get the sharp hairline look</li>
            <li> I recommend it to other people.</li>
            <li> It is also not easy to take off my forehead, even when I wipe it with a moist or dry towel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried two other&#x27;s that looked like black coal dust on my head</li>
            <li> but this is the one a small amount goes a long way</li>
            <li> After experiencing a long and frustrating reoccurrence of alopecia arreata, I finally discovered your product.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Illusion has allowed me to feel complete confidence, with no worry of judgement.&lt;br /&gt;After years of using frustrating sprays and noticeable fill-ins.</li>
            <li> It has helped me achieve a feeling close to normalcy while my hair slowly regrows  back and helps minimize the stress that aggravates AA.</li>
            <li> If I lay down some will come off.</li>
            <li> hands down my customers</li>
            <li> i was also asked to take review down.</li>
            <li> The illusion is there, however, you can mess up a couch</li>
            <li> Leaves a mess and does not stick well...</li>
            <li> I tried Biotin and other all natural products as well as expensive prescriptions</li>
            <li> i used a little fiber hold spray before i applied it</li>
            <li> That thing locks it DOWN!.</li>
            <li> THOUGH ITS MADE FROM REAL HAIR FIBERS,IT STILL GIVES A CHALKY DULL FAKE APPEARANCE</li>
            <li> ITS MESSY AND WILL BE ALL OVER YOUR CLOTHES EVEN WITH THE FIBER SPRAY.</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t have anyone to apply it and you haven&#x27;t perfected doing it yourself, it&#x27;s really difficult to get it to look as natural as it appears in the videos and pictures</li>
            <li> I use it in my everyday function as a barber and it has changed my business.</li>
            <li> This product was a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s covers up and holds for a few days.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Once the price drops to $35.00 or less, sales are going to soar!</li>
            <li> Like I said, very poor binding with your natural hair, it basically just piles up on your scalp.</li>
            <li> so I purchased this product expecting very little.</li>
            <li> I usually tell my dad to wash it out week by week.</li>
            <li> Much better than the awful spray products.</li>
            <li> No more Lebron hairline for me..</li>
            <li> the holes in the bottle are too small.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t see many negative reviews because you get an email asking you to rate it and subtly hinting that any dissatisfied customers might want to resolve their issues by other means before writing something nasty.</li>
            <li> Falls everywhere hard to use when you shake it, it goes on your face and clothes</li>
            <li> Even holds up in the gym and sweating during a hard workout.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s hard to apply like a salt shaker.</li>
            <li> I wish it somehow bonded to the hair already on your head a little stronger especially when you&#x27;re taking a shower but for the price, it&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
            <li> This product sucks.</li>
            <li> Well, thanks for the refund guys but your product is still crap.</li>
            <li> I mean it.</li>
            <li> Its a mess!!!</li>
            <li> Not good for front hairline</li>
            <li> I hate that it goes into my ears, but I guess that&#x27;s what natural hair does.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s tough then when I tried hair illusion</li>
            <li> LAUGHING BEHIND MY BACK.PLUS</li>
            <li> I also have a weird hairline</li>
            <li> it looks fake.</li>
            <li> otherwise you look like that unfortunate John Travolta picture</li>

            <li> THE ONLY PLACE I WOULD FEEL COMFORTABLE WEARING THIS PRODUCT WOULD BE IN A DARK SETTING SUCH AS A NIGHT CLUB.EVEN THOUGH ITS MADE FROM REAL HAIR FIBERS,IT STILL GIVES A CHALKY DULL FAKE APPEARANCE ,I WOULD NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE WALKING INTO THE OFFICE WITH THIS STUFF ON MY HEAD AND PEOPLE LAUGHING BEHIND MY BACK.PLUS ITS MESSY AND WILL BE ALL OVER YOUR CLOTHES EVEN WITH THE FIBER SPRAY.</li>
            <li> The best thing to happen to the barbering business,&lt;br /&gt;I use it all the time</li>
            <li> I first came across this product on Instgram and despite my hesitation I received it as a gift after telling my friend I was thinking of trying it. I use the product on my beard area because it doesn&#x27;t completely fill out, and I must admit it not only gave the result I was hoping for, but it gave the look that I have always wanted.... I&#x27;m impressed</li>
            <li> Great product for concealing bold spots. It definitely looks natural and hard to tell. Way better than any other concealer. It stayed on (more or less) through and intense gym session but definitely have to be careful not to touch it when you&#x27;re wiping the sweat off your face. I used a white towel  at the gym just to be sure. I wish it somehow bonded to the hair already on your head a little stronger especially when you&#x27;re taking a shower but for the price, it&#x27;s not too bad. Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li> My hair is thinning up top and hardly grows but my sides grow really quick so this product was perfect for me. I gave it to my barber and it makes the line look super sharp. The only downside is that I wish they sold something to keep it in place. I had to purchase an adhesive from another company.</li>
            <li> This has been an excellent product for me. It does a very good covering thinning areas. Very natural looking.</li>
            <li> This product has worked very well for me. It is made out of human hair and looks real on my head. I don&#x27;t have to worry about anybody commenting on it. The point of it is for it to blend with your real hair that grows out. I would definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I primarily tried this product to cover a small (but growing) bald spot on the top of my head as well as a strip on the back of my head from a scar from a previous surgery where I had some nerve damage. Hair Illusion definitely delivers on its claims and now pictures, even from high angles in the sun, look like there&#x27;s no bald spot at all.  I like the product because I can choose when to use it as most of the time I don&#x27;t really care about any bald spots except in certain situations like when there&#x27;s pictures being taken.  At any rate, I highly recommend it.  If you&#x27;re curious, follow hairillusionllc on instagram, they&#x27;re always posting good deals and offers.  That&#x27;s how I got my first bottle.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, believe me. I&#x27;m also a Barber, so men&#x27;s hair is my specialty. After trying the product properly (read the instructions) I was amazed at what is stumbled across. Try it out for yourself, seeing is believing, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> This product is by far better than any other fibers I&#x27;ve ever used.  Toppik pales in comparison.  Caboki is great but it is second.  Hair illusion looks like real hair when you pour it from the bottle.  I actually use my Toppik applicator for part of my application.  GREAT product.</li>
            <li> This product sucks. You don&#x27;t see many negative reviews because you get an email asking you to rate it and subtly hinting that any dissatisfied customers might want to resolve their issues by other means before writing something nasty. Well, thanks for the refund guys but your product is still crap. Yes, it&#x27;s real hair, and like real hair right after a cut, it clings to your skin (much better than it binds to your hair itself) and itches like hell. It&#x27;s literally the same little bits of hair that make a mess of your sink after a shave, that&#x27;s all this product is. Like I said, very poor binding with your natural hair, it basically just piles up on your scalp. Synthetic keratin products work 100X better. I&#x27;d recommend xFusion -- same stuff as Toppik (same manufacturer), half the price of the name brand.</li>
            <li> Its a lifesaver, AWESOME, HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Blends right in with my hair &amp; cant even tell a difference!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product about 2 weeks and it has totally change my confidence in a positive way. It blends well and doesn&#x27;t leak or fade in heat. I definitely would recommend this product if you are looking for something to help with bales spots and your hairline</li>
            <li> Better for bald spots Great for covering up the thin spots but it gets all over the sink though so expect a little clean up.</li>
            <li> I am a barber of 15 years that has searched high and low for a product to help encourage and make my clients confident with age sometimes it&#x27;s inevitable, I am pleased to say after many trials and errors with dye and other lesser hair concealers I have finally found the winner give it a try you have nothing to lose but all to gain </li>
            <li> works well, need more colors, a grey perhaps, is there a way to make the product softer? it&#x27;s somewhat coarse.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, I&#x27;m not going bald but my beard isn&#x27;t as full as I would like it to be and this product does magic for me! I also have a weird hairline and i am able to get a nice crisp edge when I use hair illusion. Would definitely recommend this product</li>
            <li> this is the absolute best cosmetic solution for hair loss period.</li>
            <li> For its sole purpose, Hair Illusion is definitely THE BEST product on the market!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s perfect for men and woman in need of a non surgical, yet very realistic temporary fix.&lt;br /&gt;Struggling with the insecurity of my receding hair line has now become a thing of the past!&lt;br /&gt;Hair Illusion has allowed me to feel complete confidence, with no worry of judgement.&lt;br /&gt;After years of using frustrating sprays and noticeable fill-ins. I can now postpone the thought of surgical hair restoration for many more years to come!</li>
            <li> I have used this on a few clients and some like it and some don&#x27;t I personally like it I just wish it stayed in the hair longer.</li>
            <li> this product is amazing. I&#x27;ve used it for a few of my clients and they love it. definitely going to get more!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product the best thatI have come across thus far. Natural human hair that blends in seamlessly to cover desired areas.</li>
            <li> Best product ever.. I use it on my dad and I even recommended it the Barber Shop that I go to, and now all the babers use it for the perfect haircut! Great fill in.. I recommend that you should buy a durag when sleeping at night and a good spritz spray! Those things are the ultimate key to having it last long.. I usually tell my dad to wash it out week by week.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good, would give 5stars but comes out without a spray to hold it down... Other then that I love using it on special events...order came fast and on time ... THANKS 😎😎</li>
            <li> Amazing product it looks amazing would definitely recommend to other people. Definitely a life saver and confidence booster.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! It&#x27;s really a life saver. There isn&#x27;t nothing around like this because of how natural it looks</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good, it gave me some confidence iam on propecia and for the time being this will do the trick ,  and people I was not paid for this review iam a first time user and I will be back!!!</li>
            <li> It works very well on my thinning hair look fuller and thicker, make sure using a lot of strong hold fritz to hold hair until next shampoo, Voila ! You r good to go ! You look 10 year younger ! Even though it costs little more money but it definitely worth a try, I am ready to order another one soon.</li>
            <li> Best product for thinning</li>
            <li> Arrived early. Works great. Much better than the awful spray products.</li>
            <li> I look 10 years younger.  I wish I found this product 10 years ago.  It&#x27;s such an easy fix!!! I have told everybody about this product.</li>
            <li> It works well as advertised. Not great for filling in completely bald areas, but for small patches and thinning areas it is perfect!</li>
            <li> This product is  excellent, I do not use it daily but I do use it for special occasions especially when I want to take nice pictures. After a few applications you will learn the perfect way to apply on hair. It is best if you use multiple mirrors while applying to you can apply as evenly as possible. Or you can just give it to your Barber and have them apply once your done getting your haircut. I have had a single application last several days, the main thing to do is wear a stocking cap at night and in the morning just very lightly sprinkle some hair illusion and you will be back to normal. I personally would apply fresh everyday it has the most authentic look with a fresh application. Takes about 10 minutes to apply and that&#x27;s being real particular about everything. Overall a wonderful excellent product</li>
            <li> Great cosmetic product! My clients love it puts a smile on there faces!</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING.  No other word to describe it.  It&#x27;s definitely a must have for thinning and balding hair.  Don&#x27;t believe check out the results.  Takes 5min to apply. If that. AMAZING</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s and my hair line looks like I&#x27;m in my mid 40&#x27;s. This product works nicely and highly recommended&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Victor</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It gives my hair a fuller look and highlights my line. My haircuts always look razor sharp with this product. I&#x27;m able to workout and sweat with confidence and the product last until I completely wash it out.  All my friends love it as well.. Great product.</li>
            <li> Definitely a product that I continue to use! Very pleased with the way it looks and as a barber my clients continue to ask for it with every cut ! Keep it coming Hair Illusion !</li>
            <li> Its a mess!!! Doesn&#x27;t stay on at all.. Gets everywhere you could possibly imagine!!! Not recommendable</li>
            <li> My order came in perfect time and the product works really great!!! Im glad somebody finally got it right!! No more Lebron hairline for me..lol</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product! This product has given me back my confidence regarding my overall appearance. I&#x27;m not wondering what people are thinking about my balding due to alopecia. A couple of negatives: I wish it sprayed on and it wiped of easy.</li>
            <li> Like it...just need to figure out how to keep the hair on for longer. I hate that it goes into my ears, but I guess that&#x27;s what natural hair does. It works, looks natural but it is messy...I developed a trick. I put it on a shaving cream brush and shake it on my head with that...it provides more even coverage.</li>
            <li> Maybe I was supposed to use something to make it stay in place.  I didn&#x27;t see any difference and I couldn&#x27;t keep it where I needed it to be.  I tried using this on my teenager with alopecia areata and it would not stay in place on her bald spots.</li>
            <li> The best product ever invented. Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Outstanding hair concealer I&#x27;ve tried two other&#x27;s that looked like black coal dust on my head but this is the one a small amount goes a long way remember once you apply it use a good hold hair spray an a hand held mirror so you can view the back area an your good to go so hang up the baseball caps guy&#x27;s an enjoy your new look thanks hair illusion&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Not what I was expecting. I wear contacts and this product comes out way too easy. Your hands are full of the fibers and the fibers are very coarse for my skin. If I use my hands to brush off debris from my forehead I actually feel my skin burn.</li>
            <li> Its an obvious great product, but if you don&#x27;t have anyone to apply it and you haven&#x27;t perfected doing it yourself, it&#x27;s really difficult to get it to look as natural as it appears in the videos and pictures</li>
            <li> Avoid this product . Toppik is the best among all the products that I have used.</li>
            <li> This product is the truth. I used it on myself to insure that it is good enough, and I was extremely happy. NOW for my customers,  thanks.</li>
            <li> Illusions is the best product I&#x27;ve used in this genre. I use it in my everyday function as a barber and it has changed my business. awesome product.</li>
            <li> Totally love the product would love to get the free bottle to use on my clients better than topik</li>
            <li> This stuff is beyond amazing definitely will be purchasing again in the future</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, it completely resembles real hair. Works well when covering thining areas. Great product!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Product contained reddish brown hairs that don&#x27;t match, ordered twice and got the same thing.</li>
            <li> Heard about this product a few months back and immediately shot to Amazon to see if it was for sale and it was. Ever since I&#x27;ve gotten it I&#x27;ve loved how it looks on your hair and people cannot even tell you&#x27;re using it. For $40, you can&#x27;t beat this product, nothing comes close!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best product on he market! It works really well! I have used on my clients and they love it!</li>
            <li> Used this product again last night. If used correctly it goes completed undetected.  Make sure you explain to your clients that they MUST take care of it.  Everyone I&#x27;ve used this on felt like a new man.  Must use the holding spray and this stuff will look amazing.  I really wished it could be more durable for the careless customer which I come in contact with a lot.  Over all its a good product and I&#x27;d buy again</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Used it on my dad and it worked great! I&#x27;m a licensed barber for 5+ years and I definitely approve of this product! I can&#x27;t wait to try it on some of my clients</li>
            <li> I think that hair illusion is the best product on the market right now. My clientele has grown in week by using hair illusion I recommend this product to all barbers who is trying to take there barbering to the next level.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with this product. The best on the market by far. I&#x27;m sure HAIR ILLUSION will be one of Amazon top seller in the near future. I&#x27;ve used it and its amazing, magic right before your eyes</li>
            <li> i figured i would try Hair Illusion because of all the great reviews. I’ve ben using Toppik for years.I wasn’t happy about the ingredients in Toppik and thought a natural product would be a good choice to try. Not only is it safe to use but the appearance is much better. Even up close you can’t tell I’m using anything to conceal my thinning hair. I have a bald spot that is completely bald. i used a little fiber hold spray before i applied it and it help well all day. I was in the wind at the beach all day and nothing came off. Very Impressed with the natural Hair fibers.</li>
            <li> One of the better, more natural looking products out. Truly impressive. I get 3 to 4 days use per application with hair spray with a strong hold.</li>
            <li> Hair illusion is great</li>
            <li> This product is horrible. This product was a waste of time and money. Its like putting hair trimmings on top of your head. Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this. This is not Hair illusion its hair BS !!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other &amp;#34;powder&amp;#34; products like Caboki, Toppik and now Hair Illusion.  Hair Illusion is the most natural by far ( I have black hair with little grey)  It blend so well.  Toppik leaves a grey/blue tint on my head, this does not.  Caboki is pretty good too, but from what I see and my wife sees, this is the best so far.  My only gripe is that the product does not flow well and I have to shake harder compared to the other products.  Seems like the holes in the bottle are too small.  I&#x27;ll see how long this bottle lasts.  Oh, I must say this with the fact that I do have significant hair still ie I am not completely bald but thinning.  If you are bald bald there is no way any product will camouflage this.</li>
            <li> This is the worse product ever invented!! A total waste of money, stick with Toppix nothing beats that brand</li>
            <li> Great product, i have been using for over a year ! I found out about the product VIA instagram on nick young&#x27;s page !! Dont see myself not using it ! I was once even given a free bottle by the owner i love the company and brand !</li>
            <li> Product is great and doesn&#x27;t have any chemicals that causes your head to itch.  Very pleased!</li>
            <li> I love it!!!!!!  Used other brands before none is as good as Hair Illusion.</li>
            <li> The best hair loss concealer but I have tried.  I give it four stars because I wish it could lock with the hair better.</li>
            <li> Did not work.. Falls everywhere hard to use when you shake it, it goes on your face and clothes</li>
            <li> Yeah it does work. Its just that it will not stay on. If I lay down some will come off. But however im going to buy another bottle</li>
            <li> This is the best hair thinning fiber product that I have found online... Thank you for creating such an awesome product!</li>
            <li> Very great product. Would love to talk about doing more business with the company.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, never tried a product like this until I seen Hair Illusion! Product works great, cut the cut you want, apply some hair spray, wait about 10 seconds and apply from a distance, like about a foot and when done apply some more hair spray. Product clings to my hair well! And helps cover the thinning area! I introduced my Barber to it and he&#x27;s gonna order some soon for his shop!</li>
            <li> it is nice, doesnt clot, covers all areas but the bottle is small&lt;br /&gt;if i knew i would&#x27;ve ordered more than one for someone needs it for daily use&lt;br /&gt;the good thing about it, its not messy and does not mess the scarfs, cloth&lt;br /&gt;does not melt when I workout and sweat&lt;br /&gt;easy to apply no glue, just shake the bottle ontop the bald area&lt;br /&gt;I like it and recommend it</li>
            <li> I just started using this product this week and so far it has looked very natural after every use. Even after sweating and some exposure to waves at a water park today my hair remained pretty much intact. I use a spritz to help retain the fibers in place. Great product!</li>
            <li> Great Product!, would recommend this over any other products that&#x27;s on the market today.</li>
            <li> Since the product is made of natural hair fibers, it looks more natural and holds better than some of the other fibers I have tried. Even holds up in the gym and sweating during a hard workout. Wish it came in a gray color as I have salt and pepper hair. However, I am very pleased with the black color that I purchased. I also like that the bottle is transparent so you can see when you&#x27;re running out. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Fiber is very coarse, not smooth to apply.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s takes some time and practice to get right, but it definitely will change the appearance of thinning areas in the hair. It&#x27;s covers up and holds for a few days. Completely hides noticeable bald spots.</li>
            <li> I am a hair care professional and I service mostly African American men who quite frequently experience hereditary receding hair line and hair loss patterns. I&#x27;ve found that it also works great with clients experiencing Alopecia, and is a great confidence booster.&lt;br /&gt;Hair Illuision is a safe and efficient way to blend the thinning hair in little to no time! My clients are highly satisfied with its ease of use, and look forward to my application of this product. Thank you Hair Illusion!</li>
            <li> This is a really great product. I was using Toppik but it was evident that in the day light. Hair illusion being real hair blends really well. The bottle holes are also good size to lightly sprikle - takes longer but does the job well compared to other products having bigger holes which dispenses in blobs. Works great for me. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the best product of its kind on the market. In addition to excellent coverage, it doesn&#x27;t coat everything in the area with a fine dust like the other brands do, or get aspirated by the user. It&#x27;s simple, natural, and effective.</li>
            <li> Nothing else&#x27;s beats it! I recommend anyone with balding or thinning hair to buy this. It may not be the best, but nothing else beats this product!  It Looks more realistic than hair dye. Trust, It&#x27;s worth it...</li>
            <li> QUESTION: it use to come in a clear glass where you can see how much is in it. Now this last order the container is black and it feels lighter for some reason ! Are we being shorted or is it the same amount</li>
            <li> I am in my mid twenties and my hairline has been receding for a couple of years. I tried Biotin and other all natural products as well as expensive prescriptions and none of them worked. I was looking for other natural products when I came across Hair Illusion. I never heard of using real hair for a concealer so I purchased this product expecting very little. I was blown away on how natural looking and durable this product is. It blended so well my girlfriend of four years could not even tell what was different. I would recommend this product to anyone with thinning or receding hair.</li>
            <li> Best stuff on the market. If you are thinning this stuff will give you your confidence back.</li>
            <li> Stuff is great.Don&#x27;t have to wear a hat all the time. Feel more confident</li>
            <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve used other brands for years, but none of them compare. Price point is a little high. Once the price drops to $35.00 or less, sales are going to soar!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, He loves it! This is a great product! The coverage is fantastic, it looks so natural. It stays put, even in the rain. If you are looking for something that&#x27;s looks natural, I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about four months now, and compared to other similar type products, I like this one the best. It&#x27;s more natural looking than Toppik or Caboki, and the color that I use (black) blends in with my hair quite well. The fibers are a little more fine than other similar type products, thus I have to take some extra time for clean up after using it. However it&#x27;s a great product and I recommend it to those who have thinning areas of hair.  I&#x27;m afraid that this product would not work well with those experiencing total or very significant hair loss. Thank you Hair Illusion for your products!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This product is a bit misleading it covers but is blown off by the slightest movement or wind</li>
            <li> The product final stage of applying it looks natural. I like this product. Helps a lot for clients that are thinning. Also build your clients confidence back.</li>
            <li> this is what you are looking for. To all the guys with thinning hair that want a natural cover up look. Look no further I mean it. No cheesy sprays that rub off on pillows and such. Give it a try and you will be hooked. No gimmicks people.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. Everyone in the barbershop I work in uses this product on a regular basis. I learned how to properly apply to sharpen a haircut or literally give someone a new look!&lt;br /&gt;The product is hair fibers that is applied to a balding area in the form of maybe sprinkling salt on food. Too much can make your service irregular, too little can still show balding areas. This product will soon take over the entire market</li>
            <li> One of the best products I&#x27;ve ever purchased, it works great and is virtually undetectable even when up close. Follow the instructions and there are numerous YouTube videos on how to use it for perfect results.</li>
            <li> High Quality product plus amazing customer service.</li>
            <li> Having alopecia  spots, I have tried alot of products this is by far the most natural looking.&lt;br /&gt;Alittle bit goes along way.</li>
            <li> After experiencing a long and frustrating reoccurrence of alopecia arreata, I finally discovered your product. It has helped me achieve a feeling close to normalcy while my hair slowly regrows  back and helps minimize the stress that aggravates AA. I&#x27;m very happy with your product!</li>
            <li> A friend of mine tried this and said he&#x27;s still in shock. His barber recommended it and he saw there were a lot of good reviews for the product, so he gave it a try. He wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but was hopeful. He&#x27;s so happy with the results, he swears he&#x27;ll never wear a hat again!</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> I am a barber and also have male pattern baldness. I have tried EVERY other product available for thinning hair this one is thee BEST  hands down my customers love it o love it</li>
            <li> Hi my name is Eric.  My wife ordered this product for me.  I feel that you guys were really thinking with this product.  I thank you for it!  It really works for me.  I just have to perfect on using it, but its a life changer and it&#x27;s bringing my confidence and putting my self esteem back on the map.  It looks very natural in the sunlight.  It beats people looking and laughing at your head because of worn out sprays and dyes.  What ever you can do to keep enhancing this product, do so.  I love it!  Thanks.  Eric</li>
            <li> I am reading all the reviews here on how great this product is I have used Toppik for many years now and it stays on all day with no problems I purchased this product after all the reviews on how it stays better than other hair fiber products and looks more natural and yes it does look natural but did not stay on my hair! even after I used a fiber hold spray! not only was it coming off but it was all over my shoulders I cannot believe all the hype here with this product! it&#x27;s terrible!!!!! I will stick with Toppik it also looks natural but stays on this product is a waste of money and if it doesn&#x27;t stay on the hair how can they even say that it will not come off when you get it wet? there is nothing in this product that binds on the hair and they also say that it is made from human hair? how do we know that and what&#x27;s the difference if it is or isn&#x27;t wouldn&#x27;t you want a product that stays on your scalp?</li>
            <li> The illusion is there, however, you can mess up a couch and you can&#x27;t wear hats or it will take it off...</li>
            <li> A friend told me about this product. I was a little  skeptical from using black outs but ever since using this product I have more confidence  in myself.  No one can tell I have it in my hair and my barber says this is the most natural product out there..</li>
            <li> received item fast and its exactly as described.  works perfectly for me.  looks just about flawless in the sun  with matching and blending in bald areas.</li>
            <li> I tried Toppik a while back and thought is was OK. Then i tried Dermmatch which i loved and still like a lot but i saw the pictures on Hair Illusions instagram and decided to give it a shot. When i first tried it, I didnt like it much and it seemed kind of messy but then i wondered how the hell the guys on instagram made it look so good. I tried it again with hair spray and was more skillful with how i put it on, let me tell you. When you get it right,... nothing looks better than this. I was really surprised how good it looked. I tried looking at it up close in the mirror under very bright lights and it seems the brighter the light, the more natural it looks. Same could be said in the Sun, looks more natural in the sun. Another note on this, i went out one night with it on... On my way home.. it started raining pretty hard. I said to myself &amp;#34;Oh F**k&amp;#34; but i was going home anyway so whatever... when i got home i looked in the mirror and it was STILL good. I credit this to the very strong hair spray i used called Bed Head, hard Head. That thing locks it DOWN!. Overall, fantastic product. I highly recommend this with a strong hairspray to keep it locked in. Also, it takes some practice but like i said, when you get it right... Nothing looks better. The only downside i have about this is the price, Could be a bit cheaper and i would buy more in bulk. Lower the price is this would be perfect.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time as expected good product, however the price is too expensive for the little amount you get.</li>
            <li> One of the worst product ever!</li>
            <li> I persuade these items for my husband to use on his clients. The first day of using this product he received so much in tips and so much positive feedback. He is so happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Does the job well. I have thinning hair but not a bald spot. I can cover it very well.&lt;br /&gt;It is not a spray, it is a dusting powder like substance. It does not run off your head if wet. Although it&#x27;s hard to apply like a salt shaker.</li>
            <li> Great Product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried most hair concealers on the market and Hair Illusion is one of the best for value for money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colour was just as I thought it would be so no disappointments there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it, it might be just what your looking for.</li>
            <li> I order one for my husband he loved it so much. And now he wanted another one..hehehehe</li>
            <li> Leaves a mess and does not stick well... Once I sprayed the holding spray it removed the fibers in areas. I has to go back over the area to reapply.</li>
            <li> Works like magic, I was very happy with this product and the seller. After looking at 100’s of Hair Illusion photos on instagram i decided to give this a try. It works like the photos and I’m a believer.</li>
            <li> I want to say this product has changed my confidence in general.  All i can say is wow it really works u must try it!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical on trying the product at first by my barber stylist. But then I said what the heck. Turns out hair illusion works great. It  looks real and natural. 👍👍</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. Looks very natural and doesn&#x27;t come off or run like the spray powders do. You don&#x27;t have to seal it with hairspray like the spray powders either. You can style comb or brush your hair and it won&#x27;t scrape off. The best product i&#x27;ve tried. Very pleased with seller as well.</li>
            <li> Excellent deal on an excellent product. Looking forward to more business. This product is the next level.  Every barber and/or stylist needs this</li>
            <li> This brand is by far the best and most natural looking hair fiber product. I have never had anyone ask or detect that I was using this product to get the sharp hairline look I was always seeking. I really wish I had an unlimited supply. I simply add gel or whatever product to my hair first, sprinkle the hair illusion, line up my hairline as desired and spray hair spray or whatever other product to hold it steady. I highly recommend this above all other alike brands. This is actually like actual and not cheap powder.</li>
            <li> Works better than the other concealers. I&#x27;ve tried almost all the hair concealers on the market.This one look the best by far. It looks like my real hair. My onlly problem is the product is a little more costly than the others.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work. looks ugly. i was also asked to take review down. better use some other product. it looks fake.</li>
            <li> Absolute great product. Very easy to apply and gives a very natural look. I did not have any itching at all. It&#x27;s like a magic, it lasts all day and even through at night. I love the look of having all my hair back.Very high quality product, I regained my confidence and self-esteem. Thanks to this product, I don&#x27;t need to wear any hats anymore. I recommend it to other people.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money. Had a hair transplant and want to hide my scars. In short, not worth money.</li>
            <li> What can I say man there is something special about this hair illusion in my mid 20&#x27;s my hairline started to receding I&#x27;m 30 yrs old now it&#x27;s abandon my scalp. it had me frustrated i tried almost entire hair loss product an none work tried to be a little more patient but it&#x27;s tough then when I tried hair illusion it&#x27;s like a miracle this product is for real it&#x27;s very simple i should&#x27;ve bought this stuff long time ago didn&#x27;t know it&#x27;ll work this good I Highly Recommend this product to those who losing their hairline or bald spot it works like magic just make sure you know your hair color and get some of that super hold spray so that way when you sprinkle hair illusion on your hairline or bald spot it&#x27;ll work like a charm if you&#x27;re planning on going outdoors it&#x27;ll  be a good time to put on hair illusion but if you gonna be in your home all day you don&#x27;t have to use it only way it come off as if you decided to shampoo your hair it&#x27;s worth the money in my opinion take a chance try it for yourself an see if you&#x27;re satisfied or not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used different products, maybe 4 or 5 of them. And by far I would say this is the most easy to use, realistic, and less time consuming product out there. Thumbs up from me.</li>
            <li> Used it for an old friend of mine who was thinning out and had a fitness competition and gave him one of the best bald fades he&#x27;d ever had. he was very excited about his cut. i love this stuff. Power moves from here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Destini</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Really brings back your confidence. Easy to use and very affordable.</li>
            <li> Natural looking and I use it daily. Lasts, and doesn&#x27;t run off my head if I get caught in the rain. I tried other products and I like this one the best.</li>
            <li> I am extremely impressed! I won&#x27;t buy anything else!</li>
            <li> One of my dearest friends uses this product and says he was stunned at its amazing performance. He says it actually has an incredibly natural look and even after sleeping with it in, it was still fine in the morning. He calls it a life saver!</li>
            <li> Getting the right color is essential...otherwise you look like that unfortunate John Travolta picture...fakey.  Not good for front hairline or you get the Dracula effect. You can see the fibers....from a couple of feet away.  I&#x27;m not super impressed, though it did give me some peace of mind for a bit as I wasn&#x27;t so worried about my widening part.</li>
            <li> Great product, easy to use has a natural look when applied.</li>
            <li> Amazing ! Real hair fibers! Looks 100% natural &amp; real. Must get.</li>
            <li> As a barber I love this product. It conceals thinning areas with a natural appearance. My clients love it</li>
            <li> Great and innovate product! My clients and fellow barbers are beyond impressed with the natural look of this product when applied. Highly recommend this for barbers or anyone wishing to conceal bald area&#x27;s without the use of harmful chemicals and dyes.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work.....it doesn&#x27;t attach to hair follicles, it keeps falling off. I was very dissatisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> It works well, however it falls onto my forehead and is noticed. It is also not easy to take off my forehead, even when I wipe it with a moist or dry towel.</li>
            <li> Excellent!!! It&#x27;s real human hair fibers it&#x27;s not messy at all, unlike caboki I used or those others that make a mess or stains hair illusion is fabulous!!!</li>
