            <li> If you have skin that&#x27;s very dry and uncomfortable, try this product, it really does the job!!!!</li>
            <li> Has worked well to bring the skin on my legs and feet back from the cracking, dry skin</li>
            <li> i have had cold sores most of my life years ago a druggist told me to try this carmex</li>

            <li> &amp;  I have tried other over the counter ointments that just didn&#x27;t address the problems I was having with the dry itchy patches of skin.</li>

            <li> Now I can use this and it works as well if not better!</li>
            <li> i use it on my cold sores,fever blisters, chapped hands, and on my dogs sore spots...</li>

            <li> I hate the smell though, it&#x27;s like medicine.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff works great if you can get past the smell.  I can&#x27;t get it at the stores in my area any longer, so I ordered it thru Amazon.com.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Outstanding product, I have used their lip balm for years and this hand care does not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is like a, Aveda level product for a 1/3 of the cost, outstanding.</li>
            <li> This is a giant jar. Love it, use it for everything.</li>
            <li> first of all this is about me so i can&#x27;t speak for anyone else but i love this stuff... i use it on my cold sores,fever blisters, chapped hands, and on my dogs sore spots... and i find it works GREAT.... i have had cold sores most of my life years ago a druggist told me to try this carmex so i did, and it&#x27;s been in my health cabinet from that time forward. now i&#x27;m so glad they have these larger jars and i don&#x27;t have to stock up on the smaller ones... if you have never used it go to the drug store buy the small one. if you have used it and like it... well then there you go... get the bigger better one... good luck... sometimes it the things you don&#x27;t pay a lot for that work the best...</li>

Has worked well to bring the skin on my legs and feet back from the cracking, dry skin it was to almost normal.</li>
            <li> I put this on my skin everynight after I shower/bath and put socks on before bed. My feet are sooooo soft. I hate the smell though, it&#x27;s like medicine. I wish they had an unscented version, other wise I would have a jar at my desk. But the smell would collide with my perfume and that&#x27;s would not be good! It&#x27;s very strong!</li>
            <li> Great for winter rough hands and feet.</li>
            <li> I put this ointment on my hands at night.  I have dry skin and my fingers crack around the fingernails and bleed.  Using this ointment has made a big difference in my hands.  Before I found this I would take the Carmex lip balm and put around my fingernails at night.  Now I can use this and it works as well if not better!</li>

            <li> Very soothing ointment. I have eczema &amp;  I have tried other over the counter ointments that just didn&#x27;t address the problems I was having with the dry itchy patches of skin.
