            <li>All good just the shipping &amp; hand is took forever..</li>
            <li>Good Quality.</li>
            <li>Fit perfectly.</li>
            <li>It looks good but doesnt protect</li>
            <li>Product is great and is very light weight.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Great fit for my Samsung Galaxy Note 3.</li>
            <li>this let&#x27;s me get the best if both worlds it won&#x27;t save your phone from much</li>
            <li>Fits nicely on the phone.</li>
            <li>It is very comfortable to hold and is made of a &#x27;grippable&#x27; material that does not slip from your hands.</li>
            <li>i love it ,</li>
            <li>I love this case</li>
            <li>Would have provided better rating if shipment would not have taken weeks to receive.</li>
            <li>It seems to have an okay protection although it has not yet been tested or dropped.</li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t think its really a strong protector.</li>
            <li>But it covers the phone fine.</li>
            <li>Probably would be nice if it could cover a little more area on the edges, but out of that, good product.</li>
            <li>Fit on my phone good and protects it so far</li>
            <li>The holes for the camera and charging dock were not lined up with my phone, i had to cut parts of off for it to fit correctly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a snug fit for my phone without adding a lot of bulk.</li>
            <li>I threw it in the garbage because it didn&#x27;t even fit.</li>
            <li>, it make it very light and protect it very well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t drop my phone much and I have always loved the look and putting it in a normal case is a shame</li>
            <li>The delivery took what seemed like forever (over 4 weeks) but it was worth the wait for the price.</li>
            <li>I like the way it still reveals the natural design of the original note 3.</li>
            <li>Other that that, it&#x27;s ok, but it is definitely worth the cheap price, and because it came from china, took a long time to get here.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It sat strange over the camera spot to where it made it lopsided, and the hole for the charging dock was too close to the port for the charger to fit.</li>
            <li>The case fit well and did not affect the functioning of the buttons while covering them, which is frequently an issue with such phone cases.  </li>
            <li>So far I really like this cover.</li>
            <li>I got it mainly to keep the look of my original phone with a little protection.</li>
            <li>Product is a clear case that doesn&#x27;t wrap around phone snugly,but received as promised</li>
            <li>It allows to show off your phones&#x27; quality because of the clear case.</li>
            <li>The gel is soft and pliable which makes it easier to remove from my phone.</li>

            <li> The gel is soft and pliable which makes it easier to remove from my phone.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t snug enough around the entire phone, tends to curl back around edges, making it seem like it is loose, but it doesn&#x27;t fall off, however, when it is in my pocket, the case rubs on the buttons and unlocks my phone all the time and changes my screen icons, types things and whatnot.</li>
            <li> This case is SUPER thin rubber.</li>
            <li> I like this case; for long time I look for a case that were super thin and found it with this one.</li>
            <li> And loose around the bumper.</li>
            <li> Never really drop my phone.</li>
            <li> It was such a waste of time waiting for it to come.</li>
            <li> reviewers have marked this down as it does not provide rugged protection, but I feel this is unfair as it is not marketed to do</li>
            <li> Item is very thin and clear.</li>
            <li> But Slow shipping.</li>
            <li> Its nothing like I expected, it&#x27;s actually very very thin.</li>
            <li> It is also really thin.</li>

            <li> Great customer service.  Product is great and is very light weight.</li>
            <li> This case is SUPER thin rubber. Not what I was expecting. But it covers the phone fine. Just doesn&#x27;t protect it at all.</li>
            <li> The holes for the camera and charging dock were not lined up with my phone, i had to cut parts of off for it to fit correctly. It sat strange over the camera spot to where it made it lopsided, and the hole for the charging dock was too close to the port for the charger to fit.

It is very comfortable to hold and is made of a &#x27;grippable&#x27; material that does not slip from your hands. As promised, the case does not add bulk to the phone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers have marked this down as it does not provide rugged protection, but I feel this is unfair as it is not marketed to do so if you read the description.</li>
            <li> Item is very thin and clear. I like the way it still reveals the natural design of the original note 3. Never really drop my phone. But don&#x27;t think its really a strong protector. I got it mainly to keep the look of my original phone with a little protection.</li>

            <li> I just received it. It took ages to arrive. Its nothing like I expected, it&#x27;s actually very very thin. And loose around the bumper. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
