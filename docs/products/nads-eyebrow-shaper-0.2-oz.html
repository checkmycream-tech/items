            <li>Worked great.</li>
            <li>No risk of burning since it doesn&#x27;t get microwaved, and the \\&quot;wand\\&quot; type tool is really great for perfecting an eyebrow arch.  </li>
            <li>The applicator and the consistency of the wax are great for eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Great results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this product from Target, and have had nothing but great experiences using it to wax my eyebrows at home.</li>
            <li>so I let it sit in very warm water for 15 minutes and then warmed it again in my hands...</li>
            <li>The cloth can be washed under warm water and reused!  </li>
            <li>a very unique and wonderful product!</li>
            <li>The process is easy and the results are great!  </li>
            <li>Good product for $10 (I bought mine at Ulta).    </li>
            <li>I had bought Sally Hansen wax strips because someone told me that they were good.</li>
            <li>Product is as good as I remember</li>
            <li>Plus, it tastes good.  </li>
            <li>However, I wanted to add, to be fair, that I tried this on the area below the chin, and not the eyebrow area.   </li>
            <li>Good reviews</li>
            <li>Works good.</li>
            <li>good for a home product.</li>
            <li>Also, easy cleanup and smells good!</li>
            <li>applied the wax and was pretty impressed.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m really glad they&#x27;re washable!</li>
            <li>I love that you can wash and reuse the strips!</li>
            <li>Glad I gave it another chance!</li>
            <li>Today, I gave it a shot, and I&#x27;m really glad I did!  </li>
            <li>wand was perfect and went exactly where i needed it to go.</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>But once I was comfortable with it, it was great</li>
            <li>The nice thing about it is that you don&#x27;t have to wait for it to warm up like wax would.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m going to try the paper that comes with the wax and see if that works better than the cloth strips, but it&#x27;s still a good buy</li>
            <li>It is nice that you dont have to heat the wax.</li>
            <li>After having to clean up a jar of wax that melted in my microwave, i decided there must be an easier way to be hair-free !!</li>
            <li>There is no heating up of product required and the application to the face is very easy.  </li>
            <li>More effective than the microwave wax or those pre-made strips that you heat up by rubbing in your hands.  </li>
            <li>But if you are used to waxing at home this is by far the best product to consider.</li>
            <li>I have been waxing my own eyebrows myself for many years now, so i have had some practice with the application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the gel in the wand and find it easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is quick, easy, and the results are great.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t warm it up because it was easily oozing out on</li>
            <li>This is good if you want something quick or when you cant get to the beauty salon to get a waxed.</li>
            <li>I was able to remove all but just 1-2 straggling shorter hairs, which came off with tweezers.</li>
            <li>After reading all the reviews here at Amazon I though for sure I was going to be completely satisfied with Nad&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Went online to make sure I did it correctly.  </li>
            <li>Tried it the same night and it worked perfectly!!!!</li>
            <li>The tapes work much better before washing.  </li>
            <li>i like the strips better in this one too because they don&#x27;t fray</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s mostly ineffective.</li>
            <li>So many.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m just not as skilled, but this product didn&#x27;t work for me...</li>
            <li>this works the better of any I have used and will still use it.</li>
            <li>but it is more like nail polish, and it does not hold the hair does not remove the hair from the eyebrow or any place else</li>
            <li>the cap seals the gel in the tube perfectly so it doesn&#x27;t dry out.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the wax is fine</li>
            <li>To clean any leftover gel, you just use soap and water!  </li>
            <li>MOST IMPORTANT...</li>
            <li>Even though I had to use tweezers, I was still please because it&#x27;s so easy to wash off.  </li>
            <li>No heating, easily removed.  </li>
            <li>If it gets somewhere it doesn&#x27;t belong, it comes off easily and you don&#x27;t risk removing hair that you don&#x27;t want to remove.</li>
            <li>I microwaved it for 10 - 12 secs and it was fine.</li>
            <li>In less than 5 minutes I had perfectly groomed brows again.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t even warm the wax before I apply it, which in retrospect would probably make the job even EASIER, but even at that, it is very simple to use, easy to control and works like a charm.</li>
            <li>They worked great for me and I am totally sticking with this product.</li>
            <li>I use this for my eyebrows and it does such a great job.  </li>
            <li>So it is easy peasy to clean up.</li>
            <li>This time I lightly warmed the tube, as instructed in the product insert hoping this might help.  </li>
            <li>I figured that even though it was stored in a warm place the gel still wasn&#x27;t warm enough</li>
            <li>Well worth it for convenience and money saved!</li>
            <li>- It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>Wax glides on better if you run the tube under hot water for a 1-1 1/2 minutes.</li>
            <li>this new kind seals itself off when you close it</li>
            <li>I thought the concept was really cool-</li>
            <li>Also, it was incredibly sticky and messy to deal with.  </li>
            <li>First, it is very easy to use -- simply turn the knob at the bottom and gel comes out the top, smooth the gel onto the area, press on the enclosed cloth strip, and pull off.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to just swipe it on in the exact shape</li>
            <li>It is incredibly easy to apply exactly where you want it.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty fine hair</li>
            <li>Third, you will be able to use this for many applications.</li>
            <li>this is the most clever eyebrow/facial hair removing product ever designed.  </li>
            <li>It has worked very well on my eyebrows but no that great on my upper lip.</li>
            <li>Not as great as a salon wax, but hey costs less and you can do it at bedtime</li>
            <li>after one or two more goes it got pretty much all the hair.</li>
            <li>But, the stuff itself didn&#x27;t work worth anything.</li>
            <li>Oh well, was worth a try, I guess.</li>
            <li>I would prefer to use a fresh tape each time</li>
            <li>As it is marketed primarily for the eyebrow region, maybe one would have more success there, as it is a smaller area to work with.  </li>
            <li>By far, my favorite eye-brow product EVER.  </li>
            <li>Pull skin taut (very important) in direction of growth and pull the strip quickly the opposite way.</li>
            <li>The wax did not get warm enough when I rubbed with my palms/kept it under hot running water.</li>
            <li>the engineering in this little applicator is just amazing!</li>
            <li>I generally read reviews before purchasing a product, but had read so many at once trying to decide on a waxing product, that somehow I messed up on this one.  </li>
            <li>The only problem I have experienced is that there are not enough tapes and after they have been washed, they do not seem to work as well.  </li>
            <li>However it could come with more strips to use after I washed them after the first use they would not dry and got mold on them.</li>
            <li>no mess, easy process, etc.</li>
            <li>but I figured for less than $10 it was a worth a try, and I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li>After using other wax products at home (i.e. microwave wax, wax strips), I tried this product and am extremely satisfied!  </li>
            <li>First time I tried the product I noticed how unwieldy and gloppy it was.</li>
            <li>This is the only kit I have tried and am quite pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>Plus the wax isn&#x27;t hot, so there is no discomfort applying it to your eye</li>
            <li>I had to go over the same spot a couple of times but that was ok.</li>
            <li>Just becareful when using it the first time.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t all come out on the first run but</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>I did have to touch up just a little with the tweezers, but, being able to apply it with an easy wand</li>
            <li>It only works on fine hair and the applicator tip is too plasticky to aply wax the right way.</li>
            <li>I gave it a second try thinking maybe I hadn&#x27;t pulled the strips off quickly enough (one good thing I&#x27;ll say about Nad&#x27;s ...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly, Nads is so much easier to use than hot wax because it is water soluble.</li>
            <li>I normally use Nad&#x27;s facial wax strips and love them.  </li>
            <li>The mechanism could be better, but the product is so good that I&#x27;ll continue to purchase it despite the little bit of waste.</li>
            <li>they didn&#x27;t remove much if any hair at all.</li>
            <li>Also, if you use too much wax, I don&#x27;t think it works as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, they&#x27;re very convenient but not necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Only downside, I really wish they had a refill for the pen.</li>
            <li>I imagine it would not work very well for someone with coarser hair.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t really work</li>
            <li>The whole process could not have been quicker or easier.  </li>
            <li>and I really like the soothing wipes for after, too.</li>
            <li>very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You probably lose one whole brow-waxing use this way.</li>
            <li>- you simply run it under warm water, or rub it between your hands, to get the wax flowing, then twist the back of the \\&quot;pen\\&quot; to make wax come out of the tip.  </li>
            <li>Because the applicator is so small, it&#x27;s easy to be precise.</li>
            <li>Nads products used to only be order by phone or online, so I was excited to see their stuff in-store.  </li>
            <li>i used the dip-type wand before finding this one, and was relatively pleased with it, until it started getting crystallized due to exposure to air.</li>
            <li>This product is very reasonable since it comes in a complete kit....with waxing strips, alcohol pads and the wand.  </li>
            <li>This product was okay, but not worth ordering again.</li>
            <li>so I could buy them as refills instead of having to buy a whole new wand each time.  </li>
            <li>I have been seeing ads for this on tv since i was a teenager, and it only took me over 20 years, but i am so glad i finally tried this product.  </li>
            <li>This wand makes it super simple to apply to brows, and the combination of the nads and the included strips lift hair</li>
            <li>exactly how much wax I should put on a certain spot because I noticed that when I pressed down, the wax would sometimes go outside of its original edges (kind of like when you put a dab of liquid glue on paper and then press down).</li>
            <li>The wax was a little tricky at first, but I got the hang of it, and mistakes were easy to wash off with water.  </li>
            <li>Hot wax would usually leave me with red skin burns from removing the skin, but this attached directly to the hair and was easy to clean up!  </li>
            <li>The price $10 is high for the content of wax.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!</li>
            <li>The wax comes out kind of hard</li>
            <li>I might be a rare case of anti-success with waxing kits but this gel did nothing for me, my upper lip hair stood there laughing at the green product which didn&#x27;t remove more than 2 hairs.</li>
            <li>It comes out hard and is not application friendly!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only using it for my upper lip and the wand really makes application easy and not messy.</li>
            <li>I cut them into little strips and am able to remove nearly ALL  unwanted hairs around my eyebrows instead of tweezers.  </li>
            <li>but i will repost with new updates soon.</li>
            <li>Second, this really works very well.</li>
            <li>On the whole, I really do like Nads facial wand for hair removal and found it to do everything as is advertised.  </li>
            <li>It takes a little practice getting the thickness right, but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>I felt bad about buying the facial wand over the 6oz tub because you get so much more if you spend $10 more on the tub!</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>This is liquid gold in a tube as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li>I was about to drop $20 plus tip to get my brows professionally waxed, but decided to give this a try instead.</li>
            <li>It was pretty much just like putting slightly sticky goo on your face.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the second time around it didn&#x27;t grab as much - but tweezing was VERY easy.  </li>
            <li>The cold wax glides on easily, and hair is easily removed with the strips.  </li>
            <li>Bear in mind that my Asian eyebrows are super fine and thin.</li>
            <li>Of course i was skeptical, but this small size was the perfect trial</li>
            <li>The wax picked up all the fine hairs that are hard to get with tweezers.</li>
            <li>only thing i can figure with the negative reviews is that maybe they didn&#x27;t press firmly enough or often enough to warm the gel into the strip.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it works as well for that because it&#x27;s difficult too get super close and accurate, so I&#x27;ve just been tweezing closer to the actual brow and using the gel under the brow and in between.</li>
            <li>The wax/gel  was easy to apply but it only grabbed a few hairs and left many behind, leaving me to go back to my old method of tweezing or using the pre-waxed strips.  </li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B000RFRMAO Nad&#x27;s Natural Hair Removal Gel, Facial Wand, .2-Ounces]]    </li>
            <li>Very sticky and not really user-friendly.</li>
            <li>They came right off with just a little water.</li>
            <li>Very Frustrating as it seemed promising how easily the wand applies the gel.  </li>
            <li>still most of the hair was left behind.  </li>
            <li>Also, I (first) thought the little cloth strips were a joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it was when I first used it a few years ago.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why those with bad reviews had trouble -- it was very easy and effective for me.  </li>
            <li>I think the key is to really press down on the strips hard in the direction of the hair growth, and then to hold the area as taut as possible, and then pull very fast in the opposite direction of hair growth.</li>

            <li> I have been waxing my own eyebrows myself for many years now, so i have had some practice with the application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the gel in the wand and find it easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is quick, easy, and the results are great.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t warm it up because it was easily oozing out on</li>
            <li> This is good if you want something quick or when you cant get to the beauty salon to get a waxed.</li>
            <li> I was able to remove all but just 1-2 straggling shorter hairs, which came off with tweezers.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews here at Amazon I though for sure I was going to be completely satisfied with Nad&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Went online to make sure I did it correctly.  </li>
            <li> Tried it the same night and it worked perfectly!!!!</li>
            <li> The tapes work much better before washing.  </li>
            <li> i like the strips better in this one too because they don&#x27;t fray</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s mostly ineffective.</li>
            <li> So many.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just not as skilled, but this product didn&#x27;t work for me...</li>
            <li> this works the better of any I have used and will still use it.</li>
            <li> but it is more like nail polish, and it does not hold the hair does not remove the hair from the eyebrow or any place else</li>
            <li> the cap seals the gel in the tube perfectly so it doesn&#x27;t dry out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the wax is fine</li>
            <li> To clean any leftover gel, you just use soap and water!  </li>
            <li> MOST IMPORTANT...</li>
            <li> Even though I had to use tweezers, I was still please because it&#x27;s so easy to wash off.  </li>
            <li> No heating, easily removed.  </li>
            <li> If it gets somewhere it doesn&#x27;t belong, it comes off easily and you don&#x27;t risk removing hair that you don&#x27;t want to remove.</li>
            <li> I microwaved it for 10 - 12 secs and it was fine.</li>
            <li> In less than 5 minutes I had perfectly groomed brows again.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t even warm the wax before I apply it, which in retrospect would probably make the job even EASIER, but even at that, it is very simple to use, easy to control and works like a charm.</li>
            <li> They worked great for me and I am totally sticking with this product.</li>
            <li> I use this for my eyebrows and it does such a great job.  </li>
            <li> So it is easy peasy to clean up.</li>
            <li> This time I lightly warmed the tube, as instructed in the product insert hoping this might help.  </li>
            <li> I figured that even though it was stored in a warm place the gel still wasn&#x27;t warm enough</li>
            <li> Well worth it for convenience and money saved!</li>
            <li> - It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> Wax glides on better if you run the tube under hot water for a 1-1 1/2 minutes.</li>
            <li> this new kind seals itself off when you close it</li>
            <li> I thought the concept was really cool-</li>
            <li> Also, it was incredibly sticky and messy to deal with.  </li>
            <li> First, it is very easy to use -- simply turn the knob at the bottom and gel comes out the top, smooth the gel onto the area, press on the enclosed cloth strip, and pull off.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to just swipe it on in the exact shape</li>
            <li> It is incredibly easy to apply exactly where you want it.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty fine hair</li>
            <li> Third, you will be able to use this for many applications.</li>
            <li> this is the most clever eyebrow/facial hair removing product ever designed.  </li>
            <li> It has worked very well on my eyebrows but no that great on my upper lip.</li>
            <li> Not as great as a salon wax, but hey costs less and you can do it at bedtime</li>
            <li> after one or two more goes it got pretty much all the hair.</li>
            <li> But, the stuff itself didn&#x27;t work worth anything.</li>
            <li> Oh well, was worth a try, I guess.</li>
            <li> I would prefer to use a fresh tape each time</li>
            <li> As it is marketed primarily for the eyebrow region, maybe one would have more success there, as it is a smaller area to work with.  </li>
            <li> By far, my favorite eye-brow product EVER.  </li>
            <li> Pull skin taut (very important) in direction of growth and pull the strip quickly the opposite way.</li>
            <li> The wax did not get warm enough when I rubbed with my palms/kept it under hot running water.</li>
            <li> the engineering in this little applicator is just amazing!</li>
            <li> I generally read reviews before purchasing a product, but had read so many at once trying to decide on a waxing product, that somehow I messed up on this one.  </li>
            <li> The only problem I have experienced is that there are not enough tapes and after they have been washed, they do not seem to work as well.  </li>
            <li> However it could come with more strips to use after I washed them after the first use they would not dry and got mold on them.</li>
            <li> no mess, easy process, etc.</li>
            <li> but I figured for less than $10 it was a worth a try, and I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li> After using other wax products at home (i.e. microwave wax, wax strips), I tried this product and am extremely satisfied!  </li>
            <li> First time I tried the product I noticed how unwieldy and gloppy it was.</li>
            <li> This is the only kit I have tried and am quite pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> Plus the wax isn&#x27;t hot, so there is no discomfort applying it to your eye</li>
            <li> I had to go over the same spot a couple of times but that was ok.</li>
            <li> Just becareful when using it the first time.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t all come out on the first run but</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I did have to touch up just a little with the tweezers, but, being able to apply it with an easy wand</li>
            <li> It only works on fine hair and the applicator tip is too plasticky to aply wax the right way.</li>
            <li> I gave it a second try thinking maybe I hadn&#x27;t pulled the strips off quickly enough (one good thing I&#x27;ll say about Nad&#x27;s ...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, Nads is so much easier to use than hot wax because it is water soluble.</li>
            <li> I normally use Nad&#x27;s facial wax strips and love them.  </li>
            <li> The mechanism could be better, but the product is so good that I&#x27;ll continue to purchase it despite the little bit of waste.</li>
            <li> they didn&#x27;t remove much if any hair at all.</li>
            <li> Also, if you use too much wax, I don&#x27;t think it works as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , they&#x27;re very convenient but not necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Only downside, I really wish they had a refill for the pen.</li>
            <li> I imagine it would not work very well for someone with coarser hair.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t really work</li>
            <li> The whole process could not have been quicker or easier.  </li>
            <li> and I really like the soothing wipes for after, too.</li>
            <li> very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You probably lose one whole brow-waxing use this way.</li>
            <li> - you simply run it under warm water, or rub it between your hands, to get the wax flowing, then twist the back of the \\&quot;pen\\&quot; to make wax come out of the tip.  </li>
            <li> Because the applicator is so small, it&#x27;s easy to be precise.</li>
            <li> Nads products used to only be order by phone or online, so I was excited to see their stuff in-store.  </li>
            <li> i used the dip-type wand before finding this one, and was relatively pleased with it, until it started getting crystallized due to exposure to air.</li>
            <li> This product is very reasonable since it comes in a complete kit....with waxing strips, alcohol pads and the wand.  </li>
            <li> This product was okay, but not worth ordering again.</li>
            <li> so I could buy them as refills instead of having to buy a whole new wand each time.  </li>
            <li> I have been seeing ads for this on tv since i was a teenager, and it only took me over 20 years, but i am so glad i finally tried this product.  </li>
            <li> This wand makes it super simple to apply to brows, and the combination of the nads and the included strips lift hair</li>
            <li> exactly how much wax I should put on a certain spot because I noticed that when I pressed down, the wax would sometimes go outside of its original edges (kind of like when you put a dab of liquid glue on paper and then press down).</li>
            <li> The wax was a little tricky at first, but I got the hang of it, and mistakes were easy to wash off with water.  </li>
            <li> Hot wax would usually leave me with red skin burns from removing the skin, but this attached directly to the hair and was easy to clean up!  </li>
            <li> The price $10 is high for the content of wax.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!</li>
            <li> The wax comes out kind of hard</li>
            <li> I might be a rare case of anti-success with waxing kits but this gel did nothing for me, my upper lip hair stood there laughing at the green product which didn&#x27;t remove more than 2 hairs.</li>
            <li> It comes out hard and is not application friendly!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only using it for my upper lip and the wand really makes application easy and not messy.</li>
            <li> I cut them into little strips and am able to remove nearly ALL  unwanted hairs around my eyebrows instead of tweezers.  </li>
            <li> but i will repost with new updates soon.</li>
            <li> Second, this really works very well.</li>
            <li> On the whole, I really do like Nads facial wand for hair removal and found it to do everything as is advertised.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little practice getting the thickness right, but it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> I felt bad about buying the facial wand over the 6oz tub because you get so much more if you spend $10 more on the tub!</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> This is liquid gold in a tube as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> I was about to drop $20 plus tip to get my brows professionally waxed, but decided to give this a try instead.</li>
            <li> It was pretty much just like putting slightly sticky goo on your face.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the second time around it didn&#x27;t grab as much - but tweezing was VERY easy.  </li>
            <li> The cold wax glides on easily, and hair is easily removed with the strips.  </li>
            <li> Bear in mind that my Asian eyebrows are super fine and thin.</li>
            <li> Of course i was skeptical, but this small size was the perfect trial</li>
            <li> The wax picked up all the fine hairs that are hard to get with tweezers.</li>
            <li> only thing i can figure with the negative reviews is that maybe they didn&#x27;t press firmly enough or often enough to warm the gel into the strip.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it works as well for that because it&#x27;s difficult too get super close and accurate, so I&#x27;ve just been tweezing closer to the actual brow and using the gel under the brow and in between.</li>
            <li> The wax/gel  was easy to apply but it only grabbed a few hairs and left many behind, leaving me to go back to my old method of tweezing or using the pre-waxed strips.  </li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000RFRMAO Nad&#x27;s Natural Hair Removal Gel, Facial Wand, .2-Ounces]]    </li>
            <li> Very sticky and not really user-friendly.</li>
            <li> They came right off with just a little water.</li>
            <li> Very Frustrating as it seemed promising how easily the wand applies the gel.  </li>
            <li> still most of the hair was left behind.  </li>
            <li> Also, I (first) thought the little cloth strips were a joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it was when I first used it a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why those with bad reviews had trouble -- it was very easy and effective for me.  </li>
            <li> I think the key is to really press down on the strips hard in the direction of the hair growth, and then to hold the area as taut as possible, and then pull very fast in the opposite direction of hair growth.</li>
            <li> My first attempt resulted in a mess and not one single hair being removed!  </li>
            <li> While it was a little less messy this time around, and I did manage to remove 3 hairs after 2 attempts, I still had to resort to tweezing my eyebrows instead as I have way more than 3 hairs that needed to be removed.  </li>
            <li> To make matters worse, none of those were water soluble and it was an ordeal to clean up afterwards.  </li>
            <li> The gel seems to last a long time, so along with the reusable strips, I&#x27;d say this will last me 6 months plus.  </li>
            <li> Several weeks later, now with extremely long unwanted hairs under my eyebrow</li>
            <li> I am a red head and have blonde eyebrows so it is hard to see if it is really getting all of them.</li>
            <li> This will store well and last for a long time.</li>
            <li> The gel seems to last a long time as well....</li>
            <li> Make sure that you twist it slowly and wait for the goop to ooze out; I twisted the wand until the stuff oozed out, then too much came out.</li>
            <li> Quite a bit of the gel is actually absorbed into the thin strip, and doesn&#x27;t seem to stick to the hair well enough to remove it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The one disadvantage to the facial wand is that some of the product is wasted because the click up mechanism can no longer dispense it once it gets down to a certain level.</li>
            <li> you clean the area with the wipes provided, dry, twist the bottom of the tube to advance the gel (the tube is clear and the gel is green, so you can see it as it moves to the tip of the wand, so you don&#x27;t over-twist and waste product), apply the gel wherever you want the hair removed, place the strip, rub the strip into the gel firmly three or four times, pull, and voila!  </li>
            <li> (the strip is big enough to cover the entire eyebrow, pressed a few times, and pulled.</li>
            <li> The enclosed cloth strips are also reusable-- just rinse them off and let them dry.</li>
            <li> Very thick and does not melts in hot water even.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed with this because it would be so much easier than other options, but the other options just work better, hands down.</li>
            <li> After using Nad&#x27;s Hair Removal Get, Facial Wand I would never consider using any other product!  </li>
            <li> Removed most of the hairs and isn&#x27;t too painful as long as you hold the skin taut.</li>
            <li> I have a mix of coarser hairs and fine tiny blond hairs that are impossible to tweeze.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it is the same with larger size/jar.</li>
            <li> overall pretty messy with poor results</li>
            <li> Also you only need a little bit each time so the .2oz of goop in the wand is plenty.</li>
            <li> I only did it a little bit on my eyebrow</li>
            <li> The concept is great; execution horrible.</li>
            <li> Just wipe it off with a wet paper</li>
            <li> the strips don&#x27;t really stick too well AND were even worse after you cleaned them and tried to reuse&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li> I keep trying different upper lip hair removers with no good results.</li>
            <li> If you want this primarily for facial hair, you may be disappointed.</li>
            <li> After the first frustrating attempt, I decided to reread the insert, watch an online video, and try again in a few days.  </li>
            <li> so it is less messy for you, especially if you have never used anything like this before.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the other waxes that you microwave</li>
            <li> Used other products designed for the removal of hair .</li>
            <li> Unlike other waxes you can wash away with water, which will save you a lot of pain.</li>
            <li> The young lady who used this product, stated that it was a bit difficult to use properly in order to gain the results she was seeking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d ordered some of it earlier this year and what I received had already gotten so hard it was not usable.  </li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t run out as fast as those pre-made strips and it doesn&#x27;t get all weird and goopy like microwavable wax</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as expected, the gel was not easy to apply once the strips were placed on</li>
            <li> Only drawback is that since it doesn&#x27;t get heated, it is a bit thick and it took a few minutes to get a hang of the texture/application.  </li>
            <li> the wax is thick and keeps coming out LONG after you need it to stop&lt;</li>
            <li> The pre cut, no heat wax strips for the body by Nad don&#x27;t work at all, so I had little faith in this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how other reviewers have managed to have the wax stick to their skin but not adhere to the cloth strip</li>
            <li> The gel soaked through the little strip making my fingers all sticky.  </li>
            <li> Give it a try, a little goes along way.</li>
            <li> does after you&#x27;ve used it for a few times.</li>
            <li> Messy goo and no hairs removed.  </li>
            <li> and this was messy beyond belief and did not work.</li>
            <li> A waste of money.  </li>
            <li> messy bought it for my daughter</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s not any worse than regular waxing.</li>
            <li> do not understand how some people had trouble with it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There were some strays that were left behind that needed tweezing, but that happens even when waxing, so no problem.  </li>
            <li> I was left with a patchy &#x27;stache, which is worse than full-grown peach fuzz.</li>
            <li> I turned until a neat bead of wax came out, applied it to a small area of one eyebrow, pressed down the strip and pulled, as directed.  </li>
            <li> I wish there were plain tapes for sale at Amazon</li>
            <li> But from past usage, I knew it gets really messy</li>
            <li> Also, your skin does not look raw and swollen like with wax.  </li>
            <li> It has been 2 weeks now and very little regrowth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very little redness.  </li>
            <li> Goodbye messy Sally Hansen products!</li>
            <li> I usually use those pre cut wax strips but couldn&#x27;t find them, so settled for these instead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried doing my eyebrows using a Q tip with a cream and another time with Nair hard wax, and that was super annoying.</li>
            <li> And if you make a mistake you don&#x27;t need to lose half an eyebrow !!</li>
            <li> Not good for me, plus it is messy and comes with a very small amount of product.</li>
            <li> The gel is so sticky that it is hard to spread on the area with the wand.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s so hard to find!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product sucks.  </li>
            <li> I did find that all the leftover hair was easier to remove when I was forced to follow-up with tweezers.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;d tell anybody not to waste your money!!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed by the tiny amount of wax in the pen and the hard plastic tip.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t pull out a single hair- too bad</li>
            <li> Move the wand very slowly in the direction of the hair growth, then apply the strip, rub the strip in the direction of the hair growth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have to go behind it with tweezers.  </li>
            <li> I usually use the Sally Hanson wax, which is annoying, and I usually end up burning my lip.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t work and was just a bunch of expensive goo</li>
            <li> I am going to try it again to see if maybe it was something i did wrong</li>
            <li> Very frustrating.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was disappointed in this product...</li>
            <li> Plus, once the wax gets on your clothes, it&#x27;s impossible to remove.  </li>
            <li> It has destroyed my skin really bad....</li>
            <li> I used this, it wasn&#x27;t as painful as I thought it would be, but it didn&#x27;t remove all the hair.  </li>
            <li> I am soooo sick of tweezing and hate to spend the money when I can do this myself.</li>
            <li> I hate, hate, hate plucking my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this, to the point where I will probably just toss it out.  </li>
            <li> This was a horrible purchase.</li>
            <li> Hated this!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awful.</li>
            <li> I hate that reviews have a minimum number of words for a valid review!</li>
            <li> Terrible buy.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hurt at all. Worked great. You just have to re apply it sometimes</li>
            <li> I thought the concept was really cool- no mess, easy process, etc. But, the stuff itself didn&#x27;t work worth anything. The strips don&#x27;t stick to the wax and therefore I think I got two hairs out of 100. I was really disappointed with this because it would be so much easier than other options, but the other options just work better, hands down.</li>
            <li> After using other wax products at home (i.e. microwave wax, wax strips), I tried this product and am extremely satisfied!  First, it is very easy to use -- simply turn the knob at the bottom and gel comes out the top, smooth the gel onto the area, press on the enclosed cloth strip, and pull off. There is no heating up of product required and the application to the face is very easy.  Second, this really works very well. I was able to remove all but just 1-2 straggling shorter hairs, which came off with tweezers. I think the key is to really press down on the strips hard in the direction of the hair growth, and then to hold the area as taut as possible, and then pull very fast in the opposite direction of hair growth. More effective than the microwave wax or those pre-made strips that you heat up by rubbing in your hands.  I&#x27;m not sure why those with bad reviews had trouble -- it was very easy and effective for me.  Third, you will be able to use this for many applications. It won&#x27;t run out as fast as those pre-made strips and it doesn&#x27;t get all weird and goopy like microwavable wax does after you&#x27;ve used it for a few times. This will store well and last for a long time. The enclosed cloth strips are also reusable-- just rinse them off and let them dry.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work at all for me.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews here at Amazon I though for sure I was going to be completely satisfied with Nad&#x27;s. First time I tried the product I noticed how unwieldy and gloppy it was. I figured that even though it was stored in a warm place the gel still wasn&#x27;t warm enough so I let it sit in very warm water for 15 minutes and then warmed it again in my hands...still most of the hair was left behind.  I gave it a second try thinking maybe I hadn&#x27;t pulled the strips off quickly enough (one good thing I&#x27;ll say about Nad&#x27;s ...it doesn&#x27;t hurt) but it made no difference.  I did find that all the leftover hair was easier to remove when I was forced to follow-up with tweezers. Not a reason to buy it again but an acceptable justification to not throw it in the garbage.  I guess my search for a quality hair remover will continue.</li>
            <li> This was a horrible purchase. Didn&#x27;t work as expected, the gel was not easy to apply once the strips were placed on they didn&#x27;t remove much if any hair at all.</li>
            <li> I might be a rare case of anti-success with waxing kits but this gel did nothing for me, my upper lip hair stood there laughing at the green product which didn&#x27;t remove more than 2 hairs. Not good for me, plus it is messy and comes with a very small amount of product.</li>
            <li> This is the only kit I have tried and am quite pleased with it.  It&#x27;s simple to use; just roll on the gel, place cloth strip and pull!  That&#x27;s it.  The cloth can be washed under warm water and reused!  The gel seems to last a long time, so along with the reusable strips, I&#x27;d say this will last me 6 months plus.  Good product for $10 (I bought mine at Ulta).    Hope this was helpful.</li>
            <li> I just picked this up today at a local store.  Nads products used to only be order by phone or online, so I was excited to see their stuff in-store.  This product is wonderful.  No risk of burning since it doesn&#x27;t get microwaved, and the \\&quot;wand\\&quot; type tool is really great for perfecting an eyebrow arch.  Only drawback is that since it doesn&#x27;t get heated, it is a bit thick and it took a few minutes to get a hang of the texture/application.  But once I was comfortable with it, it was great and I had my eyebrows cleaned up in no time!  Goodbye messy Sally Hansen products!</li>
            <li> I got this on sale at Target. I usually use those pre cut wax strips but couldn&#x27;t find them, so settled for these instead. The pre cut, no heat wax strips for the body by Nad don&#x27;t work at all, so I had little faith in this product. I was disappointed by the tiny amount of wax in the pen and the hard plastic tip. Also, I (first) thought the little cloth strips were a joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the wax and was pretty impressed. The wax goes where you want it to go, it&#x27;s not gooy and all over the place. Because the applicator is so small, it&#x27;s easy to be precise. I&#x27;ve tried doing my eyebrows using a Q tip with a cream and another time with Nair hard wax, and that was super annoying. The applicator and the consistency of the wax are great for eyebrows. Plus the wax isn&#x27;t hot, so there is no discomfort applying it to your eye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put on the strip over the wax (the strip is big enough to cover the entire eyebrow, pressed a few times, and pulled. WOW. Great results. Practice makes perfect. Bear in mind that my Asian eyebrows are super fine and thin. They worked great for me and I am totally sticking with this product. I had to go over the same spot a couple of times but that was ok. This wax does not pull enough to make your eyebrow area red or irritated, and it didn&#x27;t sting at all when I redid spots. I think I&#x27;m going to fiddle with exactly how much wax I should put on a certain spot because I noticed that when I pressed down, the wax would sometimes go outside of its original edges (kind of like when you put a dab of liquid glue on paper and then press down). Also, if you use too much wax, I don&#x27;t think it works as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up using all the strips for doing my eyebrows once so I&#x27;m really glad they&#x27;re washable! They came right off with just a little water. I am very happy. I like the cleaning strips too, they&#x27;re very convenient but not necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside, I really wish they had a refill for the pen.</li>
            <li> Hated this!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!! It comes out hard and is not application friendly!!</li>
            <li> I keep trying different upper lip hair removers with no good results. Very frustrating. I hope to find one that will work. This product pulled off my skin and did not remove the hair. It does not work. Do not use this product.</li>
            <li> I use this for my eyebrows and it does such a great job.  I don&#x27;t even have to go behind it with tweezers.  The nice thing about it is that you don&#x27;t have to wait for it to warm up like wax would.  So if I feel like doing my eyebrows on a whim I can get the job done in just a couple minutes.</li>
            <li> This product is like a pen to be used only on the face. The wax amount can be used for 2 entire face waxing process. It comes with 4 facial wipes , a instruction booklet , 5 - 6 (2 inch) waxing strips and the pen ofcourse. The wax did not get warm enough when I rubbed with my palms/kept it under hot running water. I microwaved it for 10 - 12 secs and it was fine. You twist the pen from below so that the wax comes forward as it would do in a pen. The price $10 is high for the content of wax. But if you are used to waxing at home this is by far the best product to consider.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product from Target, and have had nothing but great experiences using it to wax my eyebrows at home. Honestly, I don&#x27;t even warm the wax before I apply it, which in retrospect would probably make the job even EASIER, but even at that, it is very simple to use, easy to control and works like a charm. I&#x27;m not sure how other reviewers have managed to have the wax stick to their skin but not adhere to the cloth strip--perhaps they didn&#x27;t rub the strip over the wax to get it to stick well enough before trying to pull the strip off? At any rate, it&#x27;s a great product and the best thing about it is that it&#x27;s WATER SOLUBLE! So it is easy peasy to clean up. This will definitely be a regular item I will be ordering from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use on my eyebrows and upper lip.  I&#x27;m sure the wax is fine but the strips just wouldn&#x27;t stick to the wax.  Also, it was incredibly sticky and messy to deal with.  Will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I normally use Nad&#x27;s facial wax strips and love them.  I cut them into little strips and am able to remove nearly ALL  unwanted hairs around my eyebrows instead of tweezers.  I also used them on my upper lip.  Well, for whatever reason I can&#x27;t find them in stores anymore.  I only can find this Facial Wand so decided to try it.  My first attempt resulted in a mess and not one single hair being removed!  The gel soaked through the little strip making my fingers all sticky.  I could put up with sticky fingers if an actual hair was removed.  After the first frustrating attempt, I decided to reread the insert, watch an online video, and try again in a few days.  Same result.  Messy goo and no hairs removed.  Several weeks later, now with extremely long unwanted hairs under my eyebrow I tried again.  This time I lightly warmed the tube, as instructed in the product insert hoping this might help.  No luck!  While it was a little less messy this time around, and I did manage to remove 3 hairs after 2 attempts, I still had to resort to tweezing my eyebrows instead as I have way more than 3 hairs that needed to be removed.  This product sucks.  Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> I tried this on my dad&#x27;s eyebrows when I visited.  I didn&#x27;t warm it up because it was easily oozing out on it&#x27;s own.  I turned until a neat bead of wax came out, applied it to a small area of one eyebrow, pressed down the strip and pulled, as directed.  The wax stuck to the strip, but there were no hairs--all the hairs stayed on my dad&#x27;s brow.  Tried again...same result.  Went online to make sure I did it correctly.  I did.  No luck. May have worked on thinner, finer hair, but didn&#x27;t work for my dad&#x27;s hair.  Oh well, was worth a try, I guess.</li>
            <li> This is liquid gold in a tube as far as I&#x27;m concerned. I was about to drop $20 plus tip to get my brows professionally waxed, but decided to give this a try instead. Well worth it for convenience and money saved! In less than 5 minutes I had perfectly groomed brows again.  I am soooo sick of tweezing and hate to spend the money when I can do this myself. Give it a try, a little goes along way. Move the wand very slowly in the direction of the hair growth, then apply the strip, rub the strip in the direction of the hair growth. Pull skin taut (very important) in direction of growth and pull the strip quickly the opposite way. Voila, beautiful brows! It even got the impossible-to-tweeze-peach-fuzz in between my brows. Will buy this over and over!</li>
            <li> The young lady who used this product, stated that it was a bit difficult to use properly in order to gain the results she was seeking.</li>
            <li> After using Nad&#x27;s Hair Removal Get, Facial Wand I would never consider using any other product!  I&#x27;ve tried the other waxes that you microwave and they would never get the proper consistency and seemed gooey and sticky.  To make matters worse, none of those were water soluble and it was an ordeal to clean up afterwards.  This product is very reasonable since it comes in a complete kit....with waxing strips, alcohol pads and the wand.  Once you finish with the strips, you can wash them and reuse them.  To clean any leftover gel, you just use soap and water!  The gel seems to last a long time as well....a very unique and wonderful product!</li>
            <li> It was pretty much just like putting slightly sticky goo on your face. I followed all of the directions and when I pulled the strip, (which didn&#x27;t actually even stick because the goo is not sticky enough for it to stick to), nothing happened. After trying it several times without ANY results whatsoever, I finally just wiped it off of my face. Needless to say, I was disappointed in this product...</li>
            <li> Save your money! This stuff is awful. I have done waxing at home and this was messy beyond belief and did not work.</li>
            <li> I had bought Sally Hansen wax strips because someone told me that they were good. But they didn&#x27;t work at all, so I have been getting it done at the Salon. But I&#x27;m going to be going on vaction in a couple weeks and I wanted something I could take along with me. I went to Walmart and found they had Nads Facial Wand on the clearance aisle so decided to buy it. Tried it the same night and it worked perfectly!!!! I loved it!!! Didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all!!!</li>
            <li> I usually use the Sally Hanson wax, which is annoying, and I usually end up burning my lip.  Plus, once the wax gets on your clothes, it&#x27;s impossible to remove.  I used this, it wasn&#x27;t as painful as I thought it would be, but it didn&#x27;t remove all the hair.  Even though I had to use tweezers, I was still please because it&#x27;s so easy to wash off.  I think I&#x27;m going to try the paper that comes with the wax and see if that works better than the cloth strips, but it&#x27;s still a good buy and I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This product is great for the at home waxer! It&#x27;s so easy to use! I just roll the wand in my hands then twist the cap and apply! It is so easy to just swipe it on in the exact shape I want my eyebrows! Also, easy cleanup and smells good! I did have to touch up just a little with the tweezers, but, being able to apply it with an easy wand is so great!</li>
            <li> On the whole, I really do like Nads facial wand for hair removal and found it to do everything as is advertised.  The only problem I have experienced is that there are not enough tapes and after they have been washed, they do not seem to work as well.  The tapes work much better before washing.  I would prefer to use a fresh tape each time but then I run out of tapes and still have plenty of gel left in the wand, but no tape!  That is the reason I only gave it 4 stars and not 5.  I wish there were plain tapes for sale at Amazon so I could buy them as refills instead of having to buy a whole new wand each time.  Does anyone know where I could buy such an item?  I am very pleased with the gel in the wand and find it easy to use.</li>
            <li> Removed most of the hairs and isn&#x27;t too painful as long as you hold the skin taut. I love that you can wash and reuse the strips!</li>
            <li> I felt bad about buying the facial wand over the 6oz tub because you get so much more if you spend $10 more on the tub! But from past usage, I knew it gets really messy and I figured if I bought the 6oz tub for my facial hair, I&#x27;d be wasting money because the tub would probably crystallize before I used all of the product. - It&#x27;s worth it! I&#x27;m only using it for my upper lip and the wand really makes application easy and not messy. Also you only need a little bit each time so the .2oz of goop in the wand is plenty. Just becareful when using it the first time. Make sure that you twist it slowly and wait for the goop to ooze out; I twisted the wand until the stuff oozed out, then too much came out.</li>
            <li> This is NOT working what so ever.  My wife and I  have tried it several times and does not work.  It has destroyed my skin really bad....it&#x27;s red, hurts and itchy.</li>
            <li> this is the most clever eyebrow/facial hair removing product ever designed.  i&#x27;ve done the pre-formed strips, tweezing, sally hansen&#x27;s sugar hair removal, etc etc etc and this beats them all by a mile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only thing i can figure with the negative reviews is that maybe they didn&#x27;t press firmly enough or often enough to warm the gel into the strip.  fwiw, there is a video on  youtube and i watched it before even ordering the product.  you clean the area with the wipes provided, dry, twist the bottom of the tube to advance the gel (the tube is clear and the gel is green, so you can see it as it moves to the tip of the wand, so you don&#x27;t over-twist and waste product), apply the gel wherever you want the hair removed, place the strip, rub the strip into the gel firmly three or four times, pull, and voila!  perfectly shaped brows!  the cap seals the gel in the tube perfectly so it doesn&#x27;t dry out.  the engineering in this little applicator is just amazing!</li>
            <li> This product was okay, but not worth ordering again. It only works on fine hair and the applicator tip is too plasticky to aply wax the right way. The wax comes out kind of hard and I can only wax a tiny patch of hair at a time. Definitely would not recommend.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000RFRMAO Nad&#x27;s Natural Hair Removal Gel, Facial Wand, .2-Ounces]]    Product is as good as I remember it was when I first used it a few years ago.  That was a relief.  I&#x27;d ordered some of it earlier this year and what I received had already gotten so hard it was not usable.  Glad I gave it another chance!</li>
            <li> i used the dip-type wand before finding this one, and was relatively pleased with it, until it started getting crystallized due to exposure to air. this new kind seals itself off when you close it so there is no exposure, which also helps keep the stuff sticky. i like the strips better in this one too because they don&#x27;t fray and i can keep using them until the wand runs out. get this one and save yourself a ton of money.</li>
            <li> This product takes off some hair but it&#x27;s mostly ineffective. I imagine it would not work very well for someone with coarser hair. Very sticky and not really user-friendly.</li>
            <li> I have to say, this is the easiest hair removal system I have used, next to tweezers.  No heating, easily removed.  It takes a little practice getting the thickness right, but it&#x27;s worth it.  Plus, it tastes good.  My only complaint is that the second time around it didn&#x27;t grab as much - but tweezing was VERY easy.  PLEASE NOTE: cloth strips are reusable!!!</li>
            <li> I could not work with this product.  I generally read reviews before purchasing a product, but had read so many at once trying to decide on a waxing product, that somehow I messed up on this one.  The gel is so sticky that it is hard to spread on the area with the wand.  I even tried to spread it with my finger, but it just stuck.  Quite a bit of the gel is actually absorbed into the thin strip, and doesn&#x27;t seem to stick to the hair well enough to remove it.  Upon pulling the strip, no hair was removed.  Very disappointed in this, to the point where I will probably just toss it out.  A waste of money.  However, I wanted to add, to be fair, that I tried this on the area below the chin, and not the eyebrow area.   As it is marketed primarily for the eyebrow region, maybe one would have more success there, as it is a smaller area to work with.  If you want this primarily for facial hair, you may be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This does not work as well as I had hoped, the wax is gritty &amp; does not stick to the pads as well as I would like. I am a red head and have blonde eyebrows so it is hard to see if it is really getting all of them.</li>
            <li> after I saw. So many. Good reviews I order this product but. It didn&#x27;t work on me</li>
            <li> Sadly, it didn&#x27;t work for me. Didn&#x27;t pull out a single hair- too bad I really wanted to like this</li>
            <li> Works good. Wax glides on better if you run the tube under hot water for a 1-1 1/2 minutes.</li>
            <li> messy bought it for my daughter it didn&#x27;t work and was just a bunch of expensive goo, i wouldn&#x27;t just not recommend it but i&#x27;d tell anybody not to waste your money!!</li>
            <li> I hate, hate, hate plucking my eyebrows.  When I saw this item in the store, I picked it up just to try it out.  Today, I gave it a shot, and I&#x27;m really glad I did!  The wax picked up all the fine hairs that are hard to get with tweezers. The wax was a little tricky at first, but I got the hang of it, and mistakes were easy to wash off with water.  The strips are washable and reusable, so you won&#x27;t run out.  The process is easy and the results are great!  Give it a try.</li>
            <li> The wax did not stick to the strip, only to my skin and then it just left a residue. Will never buy again.</li>
            <li> This product has gotten mixed reviews but I figured for less than $10 it was a worth a try, and I&#x27;m glad I did! I have pretty fine hair so this product (as with any home wax kit) may not work for you if your hair grows in thicker. I used it on my upper lip and I found it worked quite well. It didn&#x27;t all come out on the first run but after one or two more goes it got pretty much all the hair. I had to pluck a couple but that&#x27;s not any worse than regular waxing. I only did it a little bit on my eyebrow but I don&#x27;t think it works as well for that because it&#x27;s difficult too get super close and accurate, so I&#x27;ve just been tweezing closer to the actual brow and using the gel under the brow and in between. For me it was a great purchase, I will save a lot of money on waxing every month!</li>
            <li> I have been seeing ads for this on tv since i was a teenager, and it only took me over 20 years, but i am so glad i finally tried this product.  After having to clean up a jar of wax that melted in my microwave, i decided there must be an easier way to be hair-free !! Of course i was skeptical, but this small size was the perfect trial size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no heating required. Just holding it in your hand is enough to get it conditioned to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wand was perfect and went exactly where i needed it to go. And if you make a mistake you don&#x27;t need to lose half an eyebrow !! Just wipe it off with a wet paper towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not understand how some people had trouble with it.  Maybe you need to not buy the jar and buy the wand instead so it is less messy for you, especially if you have never used anything like this before.  I have been waxing my own eyebrows myself for many years now, so i have had some practice with the application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were some strays that were left behind that needed tweezing, but that happens even when waxing, so no problem.  And there is no burning/stinging like using wax. Also, your skin does not look raw and swollen like with wax.  It has been 2 weeks now and very little regrowth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product.&lt;br /&gt;Great experience.&lt;br /&gt;Well designed application tool - i.e. the wand.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely buy this again !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - 2/2/13&lt;br /&gt;I had a tiny bit left in the tube and tried to use it a couple months later and it did not work.  Did not even remove one hair!!  So maybe you have to use it all at once.  Not sure if it is the same with larger size/jar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing with Sally Hansen products for years and they are messy and sometimes inconvenient (though the somewhat recent addition of microwavable waxes was a great step forward).  My sister recently told me about this Nad&#x27;s wand, so I bought it to try.    Well!  It eliminates the heating step - you simply run it under warm water, or rub it between your hands, to get the wax flowing, then twist the back of the \\&quot;pen\\&quot; to make wax come out of the tip.  Draw it on where you want the wax to be, put a cloth strip (included) over the wax, and Bob&#x27;s your uncle.  You can even rinse off the cloth strips afterwards and reuse them, if you wish!    Sally Hansen products are in the garbage.  It&#x27;s Nad&#x27;s for me all the time, now.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions, heated the wand, etc.  The wax/gel  was easy to apply but it only grabbed a few hairs and left many behind, leaving me to go back to my old method of tweezing or using the pre-waxed strips.  I have a mix of coarser hairs and fine tiny blond hairs that are impossible to tweeze.  The strips were ineffective on both kinds.  Very Frustrating as it seemed promising how easily the wand applies the gel.  The concept is great; execution horrible.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just not as skilled, but this product didn&#x27;t work for me...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• overall pretty messy with poor results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• the wax is thick and keeps coming out LONG after you need it to stop&lt;br /&gt;• the strips don&#x27;t really stick too well AND were even worse after you cleaned them and tried to reuse&lt;br /&gt;• MOST IMPORTANT...it didn&#x27;t really work</li>
            <li> It does not serve the purpose. Very thick and does not melts in hot water even. Does not remove all the hairs.</li>
            <li> Used other products designed for the removal of hair . this works the better of any I have used and will still use it.</li>
            <li> This is not what it says that it isit looks like is a pencil but it is more like nail polish, and it does not hold the hair does not remove the hair from the eyebrow or any place else this product is nothing what is this it is I didn&#x27;t receive what I order</li>
            <li> This product is superb!  It is quick, easy, and the results are great.  The cold wax glides on easily, and hair is easily removed with the strips.  The whole process could not have been quicker or easier.  I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> good for a home product. Not as great as a salon wax, but hey costs less and you can do it at bedtime so you aren&#x27;t red when you get up the next day.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I have tried waxing and even a sugar based hair removal that was similar to this, but this is the only one that worked.  Very little redness.  Hot wax would usually leave me with red skin burns from removing the skin, but this attached directly to the hair and was easy to clean up!  Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> This is good if you want something quick or when you cant get to the beauty salon to get a waxed. It has worked very well on my eyebrows but no that great on my upper lip. I am going to try it again to see if maybe it was something i did wrong but i will repost with new updates soon. It is nice that you dont have to heat the wax. You click the applicator until enough wax comes out, then you apply to area, out the wax strip on rub across a couple of times and pull.</li>
            <li> By far, my favorite eye-brow product EVER.  It is incredibly easy to apply exactly where you want it.  It comes with plenty of removal cloths and I really like the soothing wipes for after, too.</li>
            <li> I do like the nads facial hair removal stick. However it could come with more strips to use after I washed them after the first use they would not dry and got mold on them. This product does work and does take the hair off.</li>
            <li> Who would I recommend this product to? Hairy people of course! I hate that reviews have a minimum number of words for a valid review!</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s so hard to find!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, Nads is so much easier to use than hot wax because it is water soluble. If it gets somewhere it doesn&#x27;t belong, it comes off easily and you don&#x27;t risk removing hair that you don&#x27;t want to remove. This wand makes it super simple to apply to brows, and the combination of the nads and the included strips lift hair very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one disadvantage to the facial wand is that some of the product is wasted because the click up mechanism can no longer dispense it once it gets down to a certain level. You probably lose one whole brow-waxing use this way. The mechanism could be better, but the product is so good that I&#x27;ll continue to purchase it despite the little bit of waste.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time but does not work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years.  It&#x27;s awesome. Unlike other waxes you can wash away with water, which will save you a lot of pain.</li>
            <li> Difficult to use, and didn&#x27;t get most of the hair on my upper lip. I was left with a patchy &#x27;stache, which is worse than full-grown peach fuzz. Terrible buy.</li>
