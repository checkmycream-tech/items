            <li>I first smelt it a year or so ago when I received this perfume for a gift and when I ran out I just had to get some more and found it on amazon for an amazing price that I couldn&#x27;t pass up!</li>
            <li>The top leaks</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it too.</li>
            <li>I just keep putting  more on</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this.</li>
            <li>If you like Fancy from her line, you will love this one as well.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance but haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores.</li>
            <li>I have receieved many compliments on it.  </li>
            <li>My favorite perfume for my office job and every day use.</li>
            <li>So many of her peers have asked her what makes her smell</li>
            <li>I love the citrusy notes and the musky finish.</li>
            <li>Just bought a 3.4 oz to last her longer - it&#x27;s a great scent and PERFECT for older teens and 20 somethings.</li>
            <li>Smells like a woman&#x27;s kind of fragrance--not too sugary sweet.</li>
            <li>Light and girly, and not at all overwhelming.</li>
            <li>the scent doesn&#x27;t stay the whole day, but I gave it a 5 star review because of how good the scent is.</li>
            <li>I first tried vintage bloom in a mall, and fell in love with it!</li>
            <li>Very light, not to sweet and</li>
            <li>But the smell is too strong for day.</li>
            <li>Its such a fresh and clean perfect for spring!</li>
            <li>The sprayer is a little defective but smells GREAT!!!!!</li>
            <li>It is comforting, like that cashmere cardigan next to the bottle of Joy.</li>
            <li>I would have loved to rate this fragrance higher, but it does not last long at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Very nice, warm scent.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, but does not last, maybe it&#x27;s just me :)</li>
            <li>Love her whole line of colognes.</li>
            <li>Love this so much.  </li>
            <li>Sweet smelling perfume, but for grownups.  </li>
            <li>, I find the scent mellows quite a bit to a soft, warm sweet scent.  </li>
            <li>This scent is new, not like the 30 year old bottle of Joy in your grandmother&#x27;s closet.</li>
            <li>While it smells strong at first, within 10 minutes</li>
            <li>The box it came in is so pretty that I have it on display next to the bottle...a lovely rose pattern.</li>
            <li>Love this fragrance, I&#x27;m a big fan of perfumes, and this one has become one of my top 10.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite.  </li>
            <li>this perfume makes me feel so pretty!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh, and clean and makes her feel so pretty.  </li>
            <li>Smells like fresh flowers.  </li>
            <li>This is a Nice big bottle for the price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to have to buy some kind of oil to make the smell last longer than 5-minutes.</li>
            <li>At first it smells like you just opened a box of lemon Jell-o or a Mountain Dew, but that fades quickly.</li>
            <li>It has an initial strong flower smell but fades very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Soft and not too strong.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a low price a big bottle and smells great.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very classy (not the rich vanilla car freshener).  </li>
            <li>many scents today open like a produce stand and then smell like a bakery (which can be great, but it is pretty common).</li>
            <li>Of course it is very floral and fresh.</li>
            <li>At first I would say this perfume smells like cotton candy.  </li>
            <li>and I finally was able to get it for her.</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t beat the amazon price for the size of this perfume also!</li>
            <li>Its a fresh, light scent that isn&#x27;t offensive to the general population&#x27;s nostrils.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The perfume smell doesn&#x27;t last long but is very nice after it&#x27;s first applied</li>
            <li>It has such a clean, feminine scent!</li>
            <li>I wish it would stay long, if it would than I would be satisfied with the scent.</li>
            <li>I got this perfume because my boss wears it and I loved the smell it seems to be long lasting.</li>
            <li>The smell is sensational &amp; long lasting.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It got to my school fast also.</li>
            <li>I really like the scent</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the soft smell of this, but it doesn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend this perfume at this price point for people on a budget that want to smell clean, fresh, classy and feminine.</li>
            <li>It smells great on my tiny little 17 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>or so it settles into a soft, gentle scent.</li>
            <li>The perfume came in the time expected fully secure.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that the price was so much lower</li>
            <li>I really like the soft smell.</li>
            <li>I purchased this when it was a new fragrance a few years ago and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make me choke on it, but it&#x27;s strong enough that I can still smell it hours later.</li>
            <li>Packaged well, was brand new, and came on time.</li>
            <li>Vintage Bloom stands apart from most modern fragrances because while there are lemon and lime topnotes, they fade on the dry down</li>
            <li>Very feminine and romantic.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by this.</li>
            <li>Smells feminine, soft, floral without smelling like an old woman.</li>
            <li>It is just a little bit sweet after using it 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>this one has a very clean subtle smell to it.  </li>
            <li>Her new stuff is not the same.</li>
            <li>And there are no strong berry notes, which have really been overdone in modern perfumes.</li>
            <li>Im a fanatic of sweet smells, and I bought this one based on reviews</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s my new favorite.  </li>
            <li> this perfume makes me feel so pretty!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fresh, and clean and makes her feel so pretty.  </li>
            <li> Smells like fresh flowers.  </li>
            <li> This is a Nice big bottle for the price.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to have to buy some kind of oil to make the smell last longer than 5-minutes.</li>
            <li> At first it smells like you just opened a box of lemon Jell-o or a Mountain Dew, but that fades quickly.</li>
            <li> It has an initial strong flower smell but fades very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Soft and not too strong.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a low price a big bottle and smells great.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very classy (not the rich vanilla car freshener).  </li>
            <li> many scents today open like a produce stand and then smell like a bakery (which can be great, but it is pretty common).</li>
            <li> Of course it is very floral and fresh.</li>
            <li> At first I would say this perfume smells like cotton candy.  </li>
            <li> and I finally was able to get it for her.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t beat the amazon price for the size of this perfume also!</li>
            <li> Its a fresh, light scent that isn&#x27;t offensive to the general population&#x27;s nostrils.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> The perfume smell doesn&#x27;t last long but is very nice after it&#x27;s first applied</li>
            <li> It has such a clean, feminine scent!</li>
            <li> I wish it would stay long, if it would than I would be satisfied with the scent.</li>
            <li> I got this perfume because my boss wears it and I loved the smell it seems to be long lasting.</li>
            <li> The smell is sensational &amp; long lasting.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It got to my school fast also.</li>
            <li> I really like the scent</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the soft smell of this, but it doesn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend this perfume at this price point for people on a budget that want to smell clean, fresh, classy and feminine.</li>
            <li> It smells great on my tiny little 17 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> or so it settles into a soft, gentle scent.</li>
            <li> The perfume came in the time expected fully secure.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that the price was so much lower</li>
            <li> I really like the soft smell.</li>
            <li> I purchased this when it was a new fragrance a few years ago and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make me choke on it, but it&#x27;s strong enough that I can still smell it hours later.</li>
            <li> Packaged well, was brand new, and came on time.</li>
            <li> Vintage Bloom stands apart from most modern fragrances because while there are lemon and lime topnotes, they fade on the dry down</li>
            <li> Very feminine and romantic.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this.</li>
            <li> Smells feminine, soft, floral without smelling like an old woman.</li>
            <li> It is just a little bit sweet after using it 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> this one has a very clean subtle smell to it.  </li>
            <li> Her new stuff is not the same.</li>
            <li> And there are no strong berry notes, which have really been overdone in modern perfumes.</li>
            <li> Im a fanatic of sweet smells, and I bought this one based on reviews</li>
            <li> Because it is not swimming in vanilla, it does not produce a headache, at least on me.&lt;br /&gt;Vintage here does not mean old, timeworn or dated.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty and delicate scent.</li>
            <li> but the scent does not last long.</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy this as long as I can.</li>
            <li> Definitely notes of the cut green stems in a bouquet, as well as some understated blooms such as peony.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this perfume, I&#x27;m not to crazy about Jessica Simpson&#x27;s other scents....</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly and was exactly as I expected.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very overpowering</li>
            <li> Don know what happened maybe it aged.</li>
            <li> Got this item faster then expected.</li>
            <li> Box was wet.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sad that you can&#x27;t really find it anywhere but Amazon.</li>
            <li> The only thing I can say is that (at least for me)</li>
            <li> The delivery was crazy fast</li>
            <li> But the liquid is yellow not happy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll still use it, but not a huge a fan.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not popular with any of the other girls</li>
            <li> but you&#x27;re not overwhelming people with a heavy scent.  </li>
            <li> I have not heard any negative comments.</li>
            <li> Sprayer was broken.</li>
            <li> Did not like this one unfortunately.</li>
            <li> and I am so disappointed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Best fragrance I have purchased in a while and my husband likes it on me. I would recommend this scent to any woman.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and I  will buy it again. Soft and not too strong. I can still smell it after 8 hours.</li>
            <li> Its very strong but its very sweet its nice for winter</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for a friend that likes the scent. Product arrived on schedule. Works as intended.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite fragrances.  It is floral, but not overpoweringly so.  It also has notes of citrus and apple (which I love.)  While it smells strong at first, within 10 minutes or so it settles into a soft, gentle scent.</li>
            <li> Granddaughter&#x27;s favorite scent!</li>
            <li> Like the perfume but the scent does not last long. I wish it would stay long, if it would than I would be satisfied with the scent.</li>
            <li> Smells like fresh flowers.  I do not like floral scents when choosing perfume, but this is definitely a good one</li>
            <li> I got this perfume because my boss wears it and I loved the smell it seems to be long lasting. Its such a fresh and clean perfect for spring! The delivery was crazy fast I received it two days after ordering it and wasn&#x27;t suppose to receive it for over a week! Very pleased!</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume about 3 years ago in a department store for $70. I couldn&#x27;t find it again, so I turned to Amazon. I found the same size for under $17! It has such a clean, feminine scent! I love it!</li>
            <li> The sprayer is a little defective but smells GREAT!!!!!</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly and was exactly as I expected.  I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Very good for this woman</li>
            <li> I love this perfume it&#x27;s a low price a big bottle and smells great. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Vintage Bloom stands apart from most modern fragrances because while there are lemon and lime topnotes, they fade on the dry down so overall it is not too citrusy or spicy. At first it smells like you just opened a box of lemon Jell-o or a Mountain Dew, but that fades quickly.And there are no strong berry notes, which have really been overdone in modern perfumes. Berry has jumped the shark.&lt;br /&gt;So many scents today open like a produce stand and then smell like a bakery (which can be great, but it is pretty common). Maybe that explains the name \\&quot;vintage.\\&quot; This scent quotes perfumes of earlier times in which florals dominated. So it opens like a produce stand and ends like a florist&#x27;s. Definitely notes of the cut green stems in a bouquet, as well as some understated blooms such as peony. This scent changes as you wear it, revealing peach at times, but not an 80&#x27;s peachiness. Because it is not swimming in vanilla, it does not produce a headache, at least on me.&lt;br /&gt;Vintage here does not mean old, timeworn or dated. Don&#x27;t be put off by the name. This scent is new, not like the 30 year old bottle of Joy in your grandmother&#x27;s closet. It is comforting, like that cashmere cardigan next to the bottle of Joy.</li>
            <li> Wife loves the smell and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it. At any perfume store this goes for about 45-50 dollars. Would recommend</li>
            <li> Did not like this one unfortunately. To me it had a very cheap smell. With all the great reviews I decided to give it a shot. I love the Fancy Love perfume JS makes and I get tons of compliments when I wear that one.</li>
            <li> I got this for Chistmas after smelling it in a magazine. I love it! It lasts all day and I walk around all day and can get sweaty. I get compliments all the time. I&#x27;m so sad that you can&#x27;t really find it anywhere but Amazon. Her new stuff is not the same. I will continue to buy this as long as I can.</li>
            <li> The perfume came in the time expected fully secure. Great perfume for a great price.</li>
            <li> tried it in Dillards, smell lasted forever i absolutely love this scent perfect for dates, and perfect for everyday ! and awesome price, at Dillards and Macys this product is 50-60 dollars.</li>
            <li> Lovely fragrance. Fast shipping. Thanks so much!!</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance, I&#x27;m a big fan of perfumes, and this one has become one of my top 10. MUST BUY.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. It reminds me of spring and summer and would be a perfect one to wear for those seasons. Of course it is very floral and fresh. That is what I love about it and the price is really great too. It got to my school fast also.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume, it smells great and lasts all day.  I&#x27;ve received alot of compliments. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Awesome awesome scent!! Woodsy and fruity this perfume makes me feel so pretty! :) The only thing I can say is that (at least for me) the scent doesn&#x27;t stay the whole day, but I gave it a 5 star review because of how good the scent is. Love it!</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent at a wonderful price!  Great service!</li>
            <li> Love it.  This is a Nice big bottle for the price.  Love her whole line of colognes. Smells really nice.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty and delicate scent. It isn&#x27;t my favorite of Jessica Simpson&#x27;s but I like it a lot. I like every one of her perfumes. This also was a very good price for this size bottle.....pleased with my purchase. The box it came in is so pretty that I have it on display next to the bottle...a lovely rose pattern.</li>
            <li> My favorite now! Love the softness of the scent.</li>
            <li> i loved this cologne and i think you will to,go ahead and get it you will love it,just like i do</li>
            <li> Smelled it at work one day and decided to buy it for my wife. She fell in love with it. Love to smell it on her.</li>
            <li> At first I would say this perfume smells like cotton candy.  I figured it was best for a teenager, however, after wearing it just to try it, I find the scent mellows quite a bit to a soft, warm sweet scent.  It&#x27;s not very overpowering and it&#x27;s very classy (not the rich vanilla car freshener).  A little goes a long way and I found it to have a flowery almost warm sugary smell after a while.  Everyone&#x27;s chemistry is different, but it works well on me.</li>
            <li> I dont know why the perfume arrived as yellow liquid when it should be white. It smells great i think? But the liquid is yellow not happy.  I went to a perfume store and infact the liquid is white. Don know what happened maybe it aged.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, but does not last, maybe it&#x27;s just me :)</li>
            <li> The perfume smell doesn&#x27;t last long but is very nice after it&#x27;s first applied</li>
            <li> I love my perfume! Packaged well, was brand new, and came on time. I was surprised that the price was so much lower then what I could have got at a local store.</li>
            <li> I love jessica Simpsons fragrances. My favorite being FANCY LOVE. For me, Vintage Bloom is just ok. I bought the mini spray to try it out. I&#x27;ll still use it, but not a huge a fan.</li>
            <li> It was a present.  I have not heard any negative comments.</li>
            <li> Every time I wear this perfume I get told how amazing I smell and what am I wearing. This is the best perfume for the price!!!</li>
            <li> Very happy with the perfume! I absolutely love it! Can&#x27;t wait to start wearing it! It will be a perfect Christmas present waiting for me!</li>
            <li> Great scent...for a couple of minutes...</li>
            <li> In love with this perfume! The smell is sensational &amp; long lasting. I get compliments all the time. And the price is totally affordable. Definitely recommend this perfume.</li>
            <li> Watch out. I got an unboxed bottle of parfum. This was NOT mentioned in the item description when I bought it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scent.  I first smelt it a year or so ago when I received this perfume for a gift and when I ran out I just had to get some more and found it on amazon for an amazing price that I couldn&#x27;t pass up!</li>
            <li> Hubby got this for my bday. My mom loved it so I got it for her for mothers day.. PERFECT!</li>
            <li> The top leaks but I love the smell!</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this perfume, I&#x27;m not to crazy about Jessica Simpson&#x27;s other scents.... this one has a very clean subtle smell to it.  You can tell you&#x27;re wearing perfume but you&#x27;re not overwhelming people with a heavy scent.  Perfect for daytime and work!</li>
            <li> I really like the soft smell. I&#x27;ve gotten tons of compliments on it. You&#x27;ll love it too. Jessica has out done herself this time.</li>
            <li> I really like the scent , I only wish that it stayed on longer but will give it four stars anyways! I just keep putting  more on so I can smell it.</li>
            <li> my wife has been wanting this for the last two years and I finally was able to get it for her. She loves it.</li>
            <li> Love this so much.  Gorgeous bottle.  Sweet smelling perfume, but for grownups.  It&#x27;s my new favorite.  I can&#x27;t describe the smell, it just smells amazing.  I&#x27;m in love with this.</li>
            <li> I first tried vintage bloom in a mall, and fell in love with it! You really can&#x27;t beat the amazon price for the size of this perfume also! Smells wonderful, and lasts a while too!</li>
            <li> Very feminine and romantic.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this perfume from Amazon after finding it was more expensive to purchase in a local department store.  The size is great and the price even better.  The perfume smells wonderful and lasts all day.  I would definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Got this item faster then expected. Lasts all day with one application for me. If you like Fancy from her line, you will love this one as well.</li>
            <li> best price I could find and this is a great perfume!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance but haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores.</li>
            <li> It met my expectations</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful scent.  I have receieved many compliments on it.  I was pleasantly surprised by this. Very light, not to sweet and the scent lasts all day.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume for my office job and every day use. Smells feminine, soft, floral without smelling like an old woman. Its a fresh, light scent that isn&#x27;t offensive to the general population&#x27;s nostrils. Would definitely recommend this perfume at this price point for people on a budget that want to smell clean, fresh, classy and feminine.</li>
            <li> I purchased this when it was a new fragrance a few years ago and fell in love with it. I still do! Light and girly, and not at all overwhelming. Doesn&#x27;t make me choke on it, but it&#x27;s strong enough that I can still smell it hours later. Love this scent!!!</li>
            <li> I had purchased this as a gift pack in a store, but wanted to buy just the bottle. This came beautifully wrapped, and it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> i buy this perfume to gift it to my sister she loves it nice perfume i recomend it</li>
            <li> Jessica Simpson&#x27;s Vintage Bloom was requested by my daughter as a Christmas present after she&#x27;d gotten a \\&quot;sample\\&quot; in Seventeen Magazine.  She had been wearing a Juicy perfume - which personally I couldn&#x27;t stand.  So, being the spoiler of the family - I bought her a 1.7 oz just so she could try it.  This perfumes ROCKS!  It smells great on my tiny little 17 year old daughter.  It&#x27;s fresh, and clean and makes her feel so pretty.  She&#x27;s a gorgeous girl and a gorgeous scent that is all her own.  It&#x27;s not popular with any of the other girls she goes to school with - which is PERFECT!  So many of her peers have asked her what makes her smell so good . . . she says it&#x27;s \\&quot;HER scent\\&quot;.  I&#x27;m so glad she liked it (and me too!).  Just bought a 3.4 oz to last her longer - it&#x27;s a great scent and PERFECT for older teens and 20 somethings.</li>
            <li> I would have loved to rate this fragrance higher, but it does not last long at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Very nice, warm scent. Smells like a woman&#x27;s kind of fragrance--not too sugary sweet. I love the citrusy notes and the musky finish. Great size for the price. Nice bottle. It looks nice on my dresser.</li>
            <li> It has an initial strong flower smell but fades very quickly.  I&#x27;m going to have to buy some kind of oil to make the smell last longer than 5-minutes.</li>
            <li> Good price, delivery time and good condition! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Sprayer was broken. Box was wet. Some of the perfume had leaked out.</li>
            <li> Im a fanatic of sweet smells, and I bought this one based on reviews and I am so disappointed.  It is just a little bit sweet after using it 30 minutes. But the smell is too strong for day. Didn&#x27;t like it. I almost got a sore throat using it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the soft smell of this, but it doesn&#x27;t last.  After about 20 minutes, the scent is gone from skin and clothing.  This would definitely be 5 plus stars if only it stayed on....</li>
