            <li>I DO NOT RECOMMEND  COLORING EXT ON YOUR OWN.</li>

            <li>I love</li>
            <li>Overall, excellent product, A+++!</li>
            <li>I love them, I had to dye them cuz I have ombr√© hair</li>
            <li>I am a hair dresser with a part time job where I cannot have any exotic color in my hair.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more :)</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re okay to wear.</li>
            <li>I have styled and colored them many times, washed them, slept in them, etc.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love these extensions especially considering all the wonderful reviews....</li>
            <li>recently purchased clip in extensions from Best Royal Hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised that I saw so many good reviews!  </li>
            <li>my hair extensions are beautiful soft and hold a curl</li>
            <li>They are great other than that they tangle very easy &amp; shead alot &amp; mine looked like dreads after 5 months of having these!</li>
            <li>I do think they should take more accurate pictures.</li>
            <li>I have also died them and they still look good, highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The color holds very well and still has good feel to it when finished.</li>
            <li>Easy to put in and take out.</li>
            <li>i wear them almost everyday and they still look great!</li>
            <li>and I liked the thickness of them but didn&#x27;t like the weft arrangement so much.</li>
            <li>They look great in and it&#x27;s such a fun way to change up your look!</li>
            <li>When the extensions arrived, they were actually DARKER than my own hair!</li>
            <li>Totally worth it!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had them out much yet, but they do feel very secure when clipped in to my hair, and I&#x27;d recommend.  </li>
            <li>you most certainly won&#x27;t need to out in all.  </li>
            <li>AND SHE LOVED THEM ESPECIALLY THE LENGHT</li>
            <li>The color is perfect, it blends in well since my hair has different shades of light blonde.</li>
            <li>Very natural and soft hair, I wore it for my wedding and it looked great.</li>
            <li>It has highlights and lowlights, so it magically matches with many blondes in the same champagne color range.</li>
            <li>I do highlights (light sandy blonde) with some light brown mixed in and this color blends beautifully.</li>
            <li>The hair, in my opinion is the same or better than the hair at Sallys Beauty Supply!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Oh wow do I love these.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re still as good as new :) long, thick and great color .</li>
            <li>but those at least had good quality hair!</li>
            <li>They are very high quality, silky, blend super well with my hair.</li>
            <li>I will certainly buy again from this company!</li>
            <li>Overall, I am pleased and would recommend.</li>
            <li>I am actually amazed that I was able to match the color online.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t match my hair exactly</li>
            <li>These are pretty thick and great quality.</li>
            <li>I just purchased the blonde hair and received the next day loved it</li>
            <li>On the color, it is exactly the way real photos show it.</li>
            <li>Great Quality, I was hoping for a slightly lighter blonde</li>
            <li>really well</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t curl that well and are very stringy.</li>
            <li>I gently style them with my hair and brush them out.  </li>
            <li>Real hair.</li>
            <li>The clips are very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Also the hair was much thinner than what was advertised.</li>
            <li>they blend and look absolutely real</li>
            <li>Styles beautifully, and will last a long time if you care for it properly.  </li>
            <li>: Packaging was fully in tact and on time, if not early.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: The hair is very soft and silky straight!</li>
            <li>My natural hair is a very light brown with lots of blond highlights, so I was worried that the champagne blonde would be too light, but I emailed Tressmatch a few pics of my hair and they made this recommendation for the color.</li>
            <li>Very orange-y and almost brassy in color, compared to most champagne colored extensions I&#x27;ve bought in the past.</li>
            <li>They are super long</li>
            <li>I originally bought this same style in the red color for my BFF to wear at her wedding.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time buying extensions online and will be my last!!</li>
            <li>One note: I would say that the color is nowhere near the color in the pictures (and no, it is not just my monitor).</li>
            <li>The hair was separating from the weft which is not acceptable for clip in extensions, and also the hair was severely frayed near the clips.</li>
            <li>but overall they&#x27;re decent</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s long and this thickness/thinness pretty consistent to the tips, but not stringy like other brands.</li>
            <li>Nice extensions but wrong color.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I was skeptical about buying these because I know Sallys was the only place I trust, but for the price and the length difference I went ahead and got them.</li>
            <li>The color is a cool shade and not a warm tone.</li>
            <li>so much I bought that brown and the black</li>
            <li>I do not flat iron</li>

            <li> I do not flat iron</li>
            <li> These were by far the worst extensions I have experienced next to the extensions with the big clips-</li>
            <li> Can tell these won&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> To me it seems like a light dirty blonde.</li>
            <li> I have been using clip in hair extensions for 10 years now and have never had any issue with any other brand.  </li>
            <li> I also felt that I still needed a second pack as my hair is thick</li>
            <li> but all it needed was a little boxed hair dye</li>
            <li> Complete wrong color of blondes...</li>
            <li> and they came in little over a day!</li>
            <li> All making it hard to sleep at night on</li>
            <li> I have thick hair envy and have paid $1k&#x27;s for weaves and beaded extensions.</li>
            <li> I agree with the reviewer who said it is like a dark dirty blond shade.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re thick, silky and lasted me awhile (even after dyeing them!)</li>
            <li> but I am very hard on my extensions.</li>
            <li> I think they are also very thick.</li>
            <li> : The hair weft is entirely to thin for my type of hair.</li>
            <li> These are extremely thin hair extensions at the root.</li>
            <li> The clips are quite noticeable as you can see them through the extensions because they are thin at the root.</li>
            <li> or they come out embarrassingly at the wrong times.  </li>
            <li> The quality of these shocked me.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> When I recieved the product and removed it from the package, the hair was in horrible condition.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I had to dye my hair to match and toner the extensions because they were yellowish and they have a synthetic smell but overall they&#x27;re decent</li>
            <li> XMAS GIFT AND SHE LOVED THEM ESPECIALLY THE LENGHT</li>
            <li> Complete wrong color of blondes... Very orange-y and almost brassy in color, compared to most champagne colored extensions I&#x27;ve bought in the past. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great extensions, very easy to put in, feel great once in -- I was worried that they would &#x27;pull&#x27; or slide around but they feel very comfortable and secure and blend well with my own hair. One note: I would say that the color is nowhere near the color in the pictures (and no, it is not just my monitor). I agree with the reviewer who said it is like a dark dirty blond shade. My natural hair is a very light brown with lots of blond highlights, so I was worried that the champagne blonde would be too light, but I emailed Tressmatch a few pics of my hair and they made this recommendation for the color. When the extensions arrived, they were actually DARKER than my own hair! So if you are considering ordering, go a shade or two lighter than you think you need. I do think they should take more accurate pictures. Overall, I am pleased and would recommend. They look great in and it&#x27;s such a fun way to change up your look!</li>
            <li> The hair falls out very easily. Even just opening them there was hair shedding all over. Can tell these won&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I just purchased the blonde hair and received the next day loved it so much I bought that brown and the black I love my hair extensions are beautiful soft and hold a curl really well I recommend this product</li>
            <li> I just received my extensions and I truly love them! They are very high quality, silky, blend super well with my hair. The clips seem sturdy and well made. On the color, it is exactly the way real photos show it. I am actually amazed that I was able to match the color online. I do highlights (light sandy blonde) with some light brown mixed in and this color blends beautifully. I think they are also very thick. I didn&#x27;t even use all the pieces and got amazing volume. Overall, excellent product, A+++!</li>

            <li> Nice extensions but wrong color. I ordered the champagne blonde .  My hair is way lighter. To me it seems like a light dirty blonde. The color is a cool shade and not a warm tone.</li>
            <li> i wear them almost everyday and they still look great! I have also died them and they still look good, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Very natural and soft hair, I wore it for my wedding and it looked great.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I was skeptical about buying these because I know Sallys was the only place I trust, but for the price and the length difference I went ahead and got them. Got them in 2 days and they were packaged beautifully. The hair, in my opinion is the same or better than the hair at Sallys Beauty Supply! I hope these last for a while! Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I love them, I had to dye them cuz I have ombr√© hair and they&#x27;re still as good as new :) long, thick and great color .</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! I wear these daily!,</li>
            <li> No one can tell the difference when I&#x27;ve worn these!  I haven&#x27;t had them out much yet, but they do feel very secure when clipped in to my hair, and I&#x27;d recommend.  I was worried a bit to select the right color, but it worked out perfectly!</li>
            <li> They are great other than that they tangle very easy &amp; shead alot &amp; mine looked like dreads after 5 months of having these!</li>
            <li> I am a hair dresser with a part time job where I cannot have any exotic color in my hair. These ext. Allow me to be myself while I&#x27;m not at work. I DO NOT RECOMMEND  COLORING EXT ON YOUR OWN. however you can get them colored by your hairdresser. The color holds very well and still has good feel to it when finished. I love love love mine!! Will be ordering more :)</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re okay to wear. They don&#x27;t curl that well and are very stringy. But the color matched my hair perfectly and it did give me great length that blended well.</li>
            <li> Amazing extension! I dyed and cut them and they still look great. Didn&#x27;t match my hair exactly but all it needed was a little boxed hair dye and I could not be happier!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised that I saw so many good reviews!  These extensions tangled and became matted within a month.  I have been using clip in hair extensions for 10 years now and have never had any issue with any other brand.  The only reason I tried these was because my brand discontinued the color.  This color looks terriblly fake and even after having my stylist trim them, I still couldn&#x27;t get more life out of them.  I do not flat iron and I curl on lowest heat setting with heat protectant.  I tried deep conditioning- everything!  So I would pass- go to Sally Beauty online- get a member card to save money and buy Design Lengths. These were by far the worst extensions I have experienced next to the extensions with the big clips- but those at least had good quality hair!</li>
            <li> I LOVE these! I have thick hair envy and have paid $1k&#x27;s for weaves and beaded extensions. All making it hard to sleep at night on or they come out embarrassingly at the wrong times.  I gently style them with my hair and brush them out.  No one can tell I have them in.  I already have the length, so I don&#x27;t know if you had shorter hair trying to make it look longer how well this would help.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this type of extension! Makes my hair looks so sexy &amp; luscious!! I wear them eberytime I go out!</li>
            <li> Very soft good quality doesn&#x27;t shed hair clips are good and stay in well matched my hair perfectly. Good choice</li>
            <li> Real hair. Great price.. I am VERY happy with mine üòç</li>
            <li> beautiful and such a great color!  I was amazed at how well this matched my hair!  I originally bought this same style in the red color for my BFF to wear at her wedding.  It matched so perfectly and looked so natural and beautiful I HAD to get it for myself in blonde! Styles beautifully, and will last a long time if you care for it properly.  It has highlights and lowlights, so it magically matches with many blondes in the same champagne color range. very pleased!</li>
            <li> Love it! The color is perfect, it blends in well since my hair has different shades of light blonde. I did curl it and it gave my hair lots of volume and length. Easy to put in and take out.</li>
            <li> These are pretty thick and great quality. I&#x27;ve had them about 3 months now and will be replacing them shortly. They would probably last longer but I am very hard on my extensions. I have styled and colored them many times, washed them, slept in them, etc. They&#x27;re beautiful and a great price.</li>
            <li> Great Quality, I was hoping for a slightly lighter blonde but I can just dye it to match. Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love these extensions especially considering all the wonderful reviews.... but I simply couldn&#x27;t allow myself to settle on a product that didn&#x27;t work for me so I returned them....see below for why...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently purchased clip in extensions from Best Royal Hair and I liked the thickness of them but didn&#x27;t like the weft arrangement so much. I also felt that I still needed a second pack as my hair is thick so if the extensions aren&#x27;t they are quite noticeable. I decided to try these extensions to mix in with the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging &amp; Shipping : Packaging was fully in tact and on time, if not early.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: The hair is very soft and silky straight! It&#x27;s long and this thickness/thinness pretty consistent to the tips, but not stringy like other brands. The color also matched perfectly. The clips are very sturdy. Length of weft and amount of clips are perfect...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The hair weft is entirely to thin for my type of hair. I&#x27;m mixed so my hair is on the thicker side towards the ends and a bit finer at the root. These are extremely thin hair extensions at the root. The clips are quite noticeable as you can see them through the extensions because they are thin at the root.</li>
            <li> Beautiful extensions.  Very easy to apply and took color perfectly.  (Stylist colored, not box color.)</li>
            <li> When I recieved the product and removed it from the package, the hair was in horrible condition. The hair was separating from the weft which is not acceptable for clip in extensions, and also the hair was severely frayed near the clips. Also the hair was much thinner than what was advertised. This was my first time buying extensions online and will be my last!!</li>
            <li> Oh wow do I love these. They are super long so I find that if you cut/ style to your hair they blend and look absolutely real&lt;br /&gt;And you most certainly won&#x27;t need to out in all.  Unless you wanna look like Barbie</li>
