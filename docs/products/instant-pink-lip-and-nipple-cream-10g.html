            <li>Supplements my coconut oil and brown sugar scrub which is great for restoring that pink look back to lips.  </li>
            <li>I may update my review after finishing the whole tube but for now all I can say is that this is just a lip gloss that temporarily stains the lips to make them appear pinkish.</li>
            <li>and i am very concerned about the color of my lips.</li>
            <li>Too much sun and cigarettes in my youth has ruined my lips to a permanent chocolate Brown color.</li>

            <li>I wear it when I don&#x27;t feel like wearing lipstick when I want to look natural.</li>
            <li>Not waste your money.</li>
            <li>It just temporarily gives them the natural look.  </li>
            <li>my lips are a pretty British girl pink.</li>

            <li> Although the cream is clear, my lips look pink when I apply it.</li>
            <li> After about a half hour the lips goes back to normal and you have to reapply.</li>
            <li> A natural pink!!</li>
            <li> It makes your lip dark red, not pink.</li>
            <li> but it make my lip look pink not my lip line pink.</li>
            <li> Restores the pink to my lip as described.</li>
            <li> A little on the expensive side, but shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> I have dark lip lines.</li>
            <li> my lips are as black as Whoopi Goldberg&#x27;s lips</li>
            <li> It works a little bit.  </li>
            <li> Luckily my lips aren&#x27;t that dark because I&#x27;d be bitterly disappointed by this product.</li>
            <li> I used it once by placing just a little on my lips and UNBELIEVABLY my lips had turned pink!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it on my nipples for fear of wasting this gel-like gold but my black nipples are the least of my worries.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works forever</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not even black!!</li>
            <li> It sucks</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t see no change at all so waste of 24 dollar for a lipstick that doesn&#x27;t work useless.</li>
            <li> just a clear useless stuff!!!</li>
            <li> Fake product.</li>

            <li> I love how this product makes my lips pink instantly. Not sure if it works forever but hopefully if I continue using this product; my lip will be forever pick. Never used this on my nipples tho.</li>
            <li> I got this for my lips.  It&#x27;s a great temporary lip pinker upper.</li>
            <li> Its nothing! just a clear useless stuff!!!</li>
            <li> Its really cool and comes off as white but when touched it turns a pale pink. It&#x27;s pretty cool if you ask me :D but it does work, my lips have lightened well :)</li>
            <li> Works as described but does not change color permanently. Lips stay pinkish for about 6 hours only.</li>
            <li> Although the cream is clear, my lips look pink when I apply it. It also makes my lips very soft.</li>
            <li> I do not believe that this product will lighten your lips. When applied to the lips it works like a cosmetic lip stain. After about a half hour the lips goes back to normal and you have to reapply. Luckily my lips aren&#x27;t that dark because I&#x27;d be bitterly disappointed by this product. I wear it when I don&#x27;t feel like wearing lipstick when I want to look natural. I may update my review after finishing the whole tube but for now all I can say is that this is just a lip gloss that temporarily stains the lips to make them appear pinkish.</li>
            <li> i am a smoker. and i am very concerned about the color of my lips. i bought this product and it does in fact work...</li>
            <li> It works a little bit.  I have dark lip lines. I started to use it but it make my lip look pink not my lip line pink.</li>
            <li> It was quick delivery.  For the price, too expensive-the product isn&#x27;t that great.  Not waste your money.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t gradually lightens lips.  It just temporarily gives them the natural look.  It sucks</li>
            <li> I am a smoker and over years my lips had turned a dark color more like brown. I am in awe of this product!!! I used it once by placing just a little on my lips and UNBELIEVABLY my lips had turned pink!! A natural pink!! I dont use this product as faithfully as recommended but it definitely works and has me sold!!!!</li>
            <li> Kid you not my lips are as black as Whoopi Goldberg&#x27;s lips and I&#x27;m not even black!! Too much sun and cigarettes in my youth has ruined my lips to a permanent chocolate Brown color. This lil tube of miracle drops into my lap and BAM my lips are a pretty British girl pink. Instantly lightens to a beautiful pink color.  I don&#x27;t know if they make it by the barrel but I&#x27;m searching.  I haven&#x27;t tried it on my nipples for fear of wasting this gel-like gold but my black nipples are the least of my worries.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t done anything to my lips.</li>
            <li> Restores the pink to my lip as described. Supplements my coconut oil and brown sugar scrub which is great for restoring that pink look back to lips.  A little on the expensive side, but shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> I buy this product and I use it a couple day already ,and I Love It....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as it says it is, the owner refused to refund my money and I don&#x27;t see no change at all so waste of 24 dollar for a lipstick that doesn&#x27;t work useless.</li>
            <li> I have pigment lips and I find this helpful also can see the difference,  really like this product.</li>
            <li> It makes your lip dark red, not pink. And I got the product almost expired.</li>
            <li> Fake product. Doesn&#x27;t do what it says.</li>
