            <li>itâ€™s like a strong minty smell</li>
            <li>THAT is a good price (particularly Prime)</li>
            <li>Hands down, the best ever for sore muscles.  </li>
            <li>and I am so glad I found a seller that sells the real stuff!!</li>
            <li>Great stuff I have used White Flower for yeard</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so great for my upper back/neck/shoulder pain.  </li>
            <li>I wear this only at night because of the sent but it has helped me a great deal with my pain.</li>
            <li>Just be cautious, it&#x27;s very powerful scent.</li>
            <li>It instantly gives a strong, but pleasant, menthol style breath of air to your lungs.  </li>
            <li>Love this and good deal but takes way too long to arrive from asia</li>
            <li>The smell is not unpleasant, just strong, and will be shared with everyone around you for about 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li>My original purchase was in Hawaii.</li>
            <li>Pleasant, but no medical  benefit.</li>
            <li>Very light liquid and soaks into the skin fast.</li>
            <li>I also have sinusitis so inhaling the balm from my hands feels good internally too.</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic and fresh.</li>
            <li>the balm or oil helps relieve inflammation in joints also relieves mild pain and skin that is irritated</li>
            <li>First time I tried it I got a huge headache.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very hot.</li>
            <li>and it brings her relief, Iâ€™m not a professional massage therapist, it smell really good</li>
            <li>Hi, great for slight headaches...</li>
            <li>But it wears off, and anyway, if anyone&#x27;s eyebrows go up I just smile.</li>
            <li>but it was definitely worth the wait!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is very good for  pain form arthritis  easy to apply and fast relief , also last a long time after applying to skin</li>
            <li>White Flower offers a pleasant warming, that&#x27;s juuuust right for mild aches.  </li>
            <li>Again, it&#x27;s not too strong - just strong enough to work, without kicking your butt!</li>
            <li>I have tried MANY different products for sore and stiff muscles and this one is by far the best I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad that I can get this White Flower oil even if we have to go to Hong Kong (which we did).  </li>
            <li>This is the first source I found, wanting to get just one bottle to see if it would help with leg and foot cramps.</li>
            <li>So glad to have it back in the house.  </li>
            <li>White flower balm does so much more than you can  imagine.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m liking White Flower even more for sinus relief.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know exactly what it&#x27;s doing if anything</li>
            <li>(I know, why did I let the cat do it in the first place?</li>
            <li>I highly suggest it for those suffering from sinuses as well, the smell definitely useful.</li>
            <li>so I had an excuse to rub it on more areas.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for this magic product for a long time!  </li>
            <li>You might see my review on another source (also positive), but again if you want it fast &amp;#34;go local.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This is very simalar to the one I used to buy in the yellow package just does not seem as strong.</li>
            <li>I would have been just fine with a smaller bottle.  </li>
            <li>It really helps my pain decrease</li>
            <li>Really works for aches and pains of arthritis.</li>
            <li>Really helps with sore muscles.</li>
            <li>--hadn&#x27;t really looked for or purchased it in years.  </li>
            <li>Have used this product for about two years and for me it works very well.  </li>
            <li>However, we found that it really did nothing permanent for our cough or colds.  </li>
            <li>will change review when I get my order not broken ðŸ˜ </li>
            <li>Thank you so much.  </li>
            <li>how much you get</li>
            <li>but I feel like it really works.</li>
            <li>--I had ordered a bottle just to have around and then had the opportunity to use it for that, and it really does work.</li>
            <li>This is wonderful for aches and pains, and also when I have a cold.</li>
            <li>Love this product and it came much sooner than I expected it to.</li>
            <li>I stand sometimes for as much as 8 hours on concrete, walk on gravel, and have a torn meniscus and lisfranc fracture.  </li>
            <li>Live and learn!</li>
            <li>The fluid was originally made only for private use, but family friends and acquaintances tried it out and liked it so much they convinced Mr. Gan to produce it on a commercial basis.</li>
            <li>I love white flower for sore muscles and lower back pain.</li>
            <li>and I actually like even more than White Flower.  </li>
            <li>You get more Wood Lock for the same price as White Flower.</li>
            <li>luckily pain level has been low and not needed to use this yet.</li>
            <li>You, which means white flower oil), named for his favorite flower, the white narcissus.</li>
            <li>I use it mainly on my hands with compression gloves at night and on my knees.</li>
            <li>Following the initial success in Singapore and Penang, Mr. Gan decided to enter into the Hong Kong market in 1951, seeing it as both a potential major market and ideal manufacturing center.</li>
            <li>For speedy delivery, you&#x27;ll want to stick to a source that is highly rated and close.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>One of the stores carried it, and we purchased it based on the high praise of the store clerk.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Other concentrated formulas can be too strong for some aches.  </li>
            <li>It really helps to clear your nose and chest congestion with the vapor.</li>
            <li>White Flower calms the achyness almost right away and the oil scent helps me sleep.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this product a three-star rating due to the fact there are many other products on the market that do just as good, if not better, than elevating pain than this product does.........</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this oil, it works like nothing else I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li>I always have to order a new bottle because someone always ends up with mine.</li>
            <li>BUT it&#x27;s powerful stuff and goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>The White Flower Ol did live up to my friends claims!!</li>
            <li>I think the Wood Lock Oil works a little better (on me) than White Flower.  </li>
            <li>I even use it on my chest to clear up my congestion.  </li>
            <li>It also helps clear our sinuses and helps to relieve congestion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been using it to sniff to clear up my stuffy nose, and it works for that too.</li>
            <li>This white flower is definitely real.  </li>
            <li>so far this is the one she prefers.</li>
            <li>if you rub this into an area that has pain , the next day you will find it really does help lower your pain.</li>
            <li>My 13 year old son is a basketball player and has a lot of growing pains in his knees.  </li>
            <li>White Flower balm works really well.</li>
            <li>The product was developed in 1927 by Gan Geog Eng, a resident of Singapore.</li>
            <li>This has really helped me since my accident with my lower back, shoulders, and elbow.</li>
            <li>/&gt;do not use near in your eyes</li>
            <li>the Chinese have lots of fun things...like different herbs and remedies.</li>
            <li>Cools down the over worked muscles quickly.  </li>
            <li>I am an older lady with deep achy feet and legs in bed at night.  </li>
            <li>I had what looked like a rash but was actually a spot where my older kitty who can&#x27;t retract his claws all the way had been kneading my arm, and I&#x27;ve been using this on it for two days</li>
            <li>but there is another further down the list that is the tiny tiny size for even more money.  </li>
            <li>Since I have used this product in the past and for a long time I had to order more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this stuff for years for strains, joint pains, sprains, and general aches.  </li>
            <li>I had a friend who would pick it up for me at an Asian store near her job.  </li>
            <li>I live in a very rural village in north central washington state, and the nearest place i can even go to find this product is seattle.  </li>
            <li>With a series of marketing campaigns, extensive outdoor advertising, and endorsement by well-known Chinese opera actors, White Flower Oil became a leading product in the Far East.&lt;br</li>
            <li>product absorbs quickly into your skin and you will feel a slight &#x27;icy&#x27; feeling after applied.  </li>
            <li>Careful to keep it away from the eyes or sensitive body parts!</li>
            <li>The 2 products have the same thickness and similar smell - slightly less for Wood Lock - but the real difference is the price.  </li>

            <li> Very useful &amp; effective for a lot of ailments: pains, bites, nausea, motion sickness etc.</li>
            <li> itâ€™s like a strong minty smell</li>
            <li> THAT is a good price (particularly Prime)</li>
            <li> Hands down, the best ever for sore muscles.  </li>
            <li> and I am so glad I found a seller that sells the real stuff!!</li>
            <li> Great stuff I have used White Flower for yeard</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so great for my upper back/neck/shoulder pain.  </li>
            <li> I wear this only at night because of the sent but it has helped me a great deal with my pain.</li>
            <li> Just be cautious, it&#x27;s very powerful scent.</li>
            <li> It instantly gives a strong, but pleasant, menthol style breath of air to your lungs.  </li>
            <li> Love this and good deal but takes way too long to arrive from asia</li>
            <li> The smell is not unpleasant, just strong, and will be shared with everyone around you for about 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> My original purchase was in Hawaii.</li>
            <li> Pleasant, but no medical  benefit.</li>
            <li> Very light liquid and soaks into the skin fast.</li>
            <li> I also have sinusitis so inhaling the balm from my hands feels good internally too.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic and fresh.</li>
            <li> the balm or oil helps relieve inflammation in joints also relieves mild pain and skin that is irritated</li>
            <li> First time I tried it I got a huge headache.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very hot.</li>
            <li> and it brings her relief, Iâ€™m not a professional massage therapist, it smell really good</li>
            <li> Hi, great for slight headaches...</li>
            <li> But it wears off, and anyway, if anyone&#x27;s eyebrows go up I just smile.</li>
            <li> but it was definitely worth the wait!&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is very good for  pain form arthritis  easy to apply and fast relief , also last a long time after applying to skin</li>
            <li> White Flower offers a pleasant warming, that&#x27;s juuuust right for mild aches.  </li>
            <li> Again, it&#x27;s not too strong - just strong enough to work, without kicking your butt!</li>
            <li> I have tried MANY different products for sore and stiff muscles and this one is by far the best I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad that I can get this White Flower oil even if we have to go to Hong Kong (which we did).  </li>
            <li> This is the first source I found, wanting to get just one bottle to see if it would help with leg and foot cramps.</li>
            <li> So glad to have it back in the house.  </li>
            <li> White flower balm does so much more than you can  imagine.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m liking White Flower even more for sinus relief.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know exactly what it&#x27;s doing if anything</li>
            <li> (I know, why did I let the cat do it in the first place?</li>
            <li> I highly suggest it for those suffering from sinuses as well, the smell definitely useful.</li>
            <li> so I had an excuse to rub it on more areas.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this magic product for a long time!  </li>
            <li> You might see my review on another source (also positive), but again if you want it fast &amp;#34;go local.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is very simalar to the one I used to buy in the yellow package just does not seem as strong.</li>
            <li> I would have been just fine with a smaller bottle.  </li>
            <li> It really helps my pain decrease</li>
            <li> Really works for aches and pains of arthritis.</li>
            <li> Really helps with sore muscles.</li>
            <li> --hadn&#x27;t really looked for or purchased it in years.  </li>
            <li> Have used this product for about two years and for me it works very well.  </li>
            <li> However, we found that it really did nothing permanent for our cough or colds.  </li>
            <li> will change review when I get my order not broken ðŸ˜ </li>
            <li> Thank you so much.  </li>
            <li> how much you get</li>
            <li> but I feel like it really works.</li>
            <li> --I had ordered a bottle just to have around and then had the opportunity to use it for that, and it really does work.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful for aches and pains, and also when I have a cold.</li>
            <li> Love this product and it came much sooner than I expected it to.</li>
            <li> I stand sometimes for as much as 8 hours on concrete, walk on gravel, and have a torn meniscus and lisfranc fracture.  </li>
            <li> Live and learn!</li>
            <li> The fluid was originally made only for private use, but family friends and acquaintances tried it out and liked it so much they convinced Mr. Gan to produce it on a commercial basis.</li>
            <li> I love white flower for sore muscles and lower back pain.</li>
            <li> and I actually like even more than White Flower.  </li>
            <li> You get more Wood Lock for the same price as White Flower.</li>
            <li> luckily pain level has been low and not needed to use this yet.</li>
            <li> You, which means white flower oil), named for his favorite flower, the white narcissus.</li>
            <li> I use it mainly on my hands with compression gloves at night and on my knees.</li>
            <li> Following the initial success in Singapore and Penang, Mr. Gan decided to enter into the Hong Kong market in 1951, seeing it as both a potential major market and ideal manufacturing center.</li>
            <li> For speedy delivery, you&#x27;ll want to stick to a source that is highly rated and close.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> One of the stores carried it, and we purchased it based on the high praise of the store clerk.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Other concentrated formulas can be too strong for some aches.  </li>
            <li> It really helps to clear your nose and chest congestion with the vapor.</li>
            <li> White Flower calms the achyness almost right away and the oil scent helps me sleep.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this product a three-star rating due to the fact there are many other products on the market that do just as good, if not better, than elevating pain than this product does.........</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this oil, it works like nothing else I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li> I always have to order a new bottle because someone always ends up with mine.</li>
            <li> BUT it&#x27;s powerful stuff and goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> The White Flower Ol did live up to my friends claims!!</li>
            <li> I think the Wood Lock Oil works a little better (on me) than White Flower.  </li>
            <li> I even use it on my chest to clear up my congestion.  </li>
            <li> It also helps clear our sinuses and helps to relieve congestion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using it to sniff to clear up my stuffy nose, and it works for that too.</li>
            <li> This white flower is definitely real.  </li>
            <li> so far this is the one she prefers.</li>
            <li> if you rub this into an area that has pain , the next day you will find it really does help lower your pain.</li>
            <li> My 13 year old son is a basketball player and has a lot of growing pains in his knees.  </li>
            <li> White Flower balm works really well.</li>
            <li> The product was developed in 1927 by Gan Geog Eng, a resident of Singapore.</li>
            <li> This has really helped me since my accident with my lower back, shoulders, and elbow.</li>
            <li> /&gt;do not use near in your eyes</li>
            <li> the Chinese have lots of fun things...like different herbs and remedies.</li>
            <li> Cools down the over worked muscles quickly.  </li>
            <li> I am an older lady with deep achy feet and legs in bed at night.  </li>
            <li> I had what looked like a rash but was actually a spot where my older kitty who can&#x27;t retract his claws all the way had been kneading my arm, and I&#x27;ve been using this on it for two days</li>
            <li> but there is another further down the list that is the tiny tiny size for even more money.  </li>
            <li> Since I have used this product in the past and for a long time I had to order more.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for years for strains, joint pains, sprains, and general aches.  </li>
            <li> I had a friend who would pick it up for me at an Asian store near her job.  </li>
            <li> I live in a very rural village in north central washington state, and the nearest place i can even go to find this product is seattle.  </li>
            <li> With a series of marketing campaigns, extensive outdoor advertising, and endorsement by well-known Chinese opera actors, White Flower Oil became a leading product in the Far East.&lt;br</li>
            <li> product absorbs quickly into your skin and you will feel a slight &#x27;icy&#x27; feeling after applied.  </li>
            <li> Careful to keep it away from the eyes or sensitive body parts!</li>
            <li> The 2 products have the same thickness and similar smell - slightly less for Wood Lock - but the real difference is the price.  </li>
            <li> clear sinus  dab center of forehead&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Do not rub your eyes and/or another other sensitive parts of your body after getting this product on your hands/fingers.  </li>
            <li> This in the only balm that giver her temporary relief long enough to fall asleep.  </li>
            <li> I was slathering on Icy Hot, which helped, but dried out my skin.  </li>
            <li> product is a blend of several essential oils and active ingredients from plant oils, according to the following formulation:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I recently went to an Asian store where I found the same size bottle for much less.  </li>
            <li> Rub a little on the hands, take a few deep breaths, and my whole respiratory system feels rejuvenated.  </li>
            <li> Turns out a long time ago seeing an acupuncturist, she&#x27;d given me a bottle.</li>
            <li> My wife has extreme lower back pains.</li>
            <li> I dab a little on a tissue and rub behind my neck and back and helps tremendously.</li>
            <li> You can purchase other off-the-self products that contain the same main ingredient this does and the other products will contain at least three times the product this does..........</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the search for alternatives to medication recently and stumbled upon this little life saver.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot like Vicks Vapo Rup, not quite what I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble finding real white flower in the United States.  </li>
            <li> This gets me thru those rough times.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Not as messy as typical Chinese stuff</li>
            <li> I use it in conjunction with other stuff</li>
            <li> I had such a hard time finding a linoment to use for muscle pain and stiffness.</li>
            <li> Healthier than Vicksburg and less painful than Icy Hot.</li>
            <li> My Mom have been using this stuff since I was little.</li>
            <li> Within a few minutes the area feels warmer and muscles loosen up.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Medicated Green Oil for years.  </li>
            <li> A very little bit is all that is needed to rub in the affected area.  </li>
            <li> Also, if I&#x27;m having a rough day or just can&#x27;t get through the day, rubbing it behind my ears refreshes and relaxes me.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the next morning I smell the menthol.  </li>
            <li> You place a small drop at the end of your nostril and inhale.  </li>
            <li> It came broken and package was wet .</li>
            <li> My dad used to get it overseas, and the white flower I&#x27;ve encountered previously has been counterfeit and was a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> No more pills for me!</li>
            <li> The scent is somewhat like bengay but it is soothing and helps to relax tense muscles.</li>
            <li> Leaves no residue or oil behind, just an odor for a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted.</li>
            <li> This is probably too expensive for what it is and</li>
            <li> It is a must have for cold and flu season.</li>
            <li> I have also used it when I have a cold or cough.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s being reviewed badly.</li>
            <li> It was one of those &amp;#34;not so bad at the time&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way stronger than Vicks and not in a painful burning way.</li>
            <li> Rubbed around throat and chest for cold and cough relief!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this product and it came much sooner than I expected it to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot like Vicks Vapo Rup, not quite what I expected.</li>
            <li> great for arthritis and stuffy nose</li>
            <li> Love this and good deal but takes way too long to arrive from asia</li>
            <li> This is liquid gold.It&#x27;s use is multipurpose from analgesic to clearing sinus passages.Healthier than Vicksburg and less painful than Icy Hot.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff! we use it all the time for pain relief.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble finding real white flower in the United States.  My dad used to get it overseas, and the white flower I&#x27;ve encountered previously has been counterfeit and was a disappointment.  This white flower is definitely real.  I love using this for any of my \\&quot;ailments\\&quot;.  It&#x27;s great for headaches and sore muscles but I absolutely love using it when I have a stuffy nose.  A dab or two around the nostrils and my sinuses are cleared up.  Also, if I&#x27;m having a rough day or just can&#x27;t get through the day, rubbing it behind my ears refreshes and relaxes me.  It&#x27;s my go-to medicine for practically anything and I am so glad I found a seller that sells the real stuff!!</li>
            <li> Everything was Perfect</li>
            <li> Not as messy as typical Chinese stuff</li>
            <li> this is the best in transdermal pain relief.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It really helps my pain decrease</li>
            <li> This product is very effective for body aches, it does not take the pain right away I use it to give my mom a back massage and it brings her relief, Iâ€™m not a professional massage therapist, it smell really good itâ€™s like a strong minty smell, she like it a lot, she has osteoarthritis on her back and we have try lots of products so far this is the one she prefers.</li>
            <li> For sore muscles, this stuff is the best. It smells good and absorbs so your skin easily so nothing gets greasy.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic. I get debilitating headaches from tension in my neck and shoulders. This stuff pulls the headache out immediately. No more pills for me!</li>
            <li> Since I have used this product in the past and for a long time I had to order more.  My original purchase was in Hawaii.</li>
            <li> No company takes the time today to even say thank you, but I received a hand written note from the company thanking me and giving me their email address if I had any problem.  I am so glad that I can get this White Flower oil even if we have to go to Hong Kong (which we did).  I can&#x27;t live without this oil, it works like nothing else I&#x27;ve ever tried.  Very nice company I will say.</li>
            <li> This is very simalar to the one I used to buy in the yellow package just does not seem as strong. This will do though, I am happy they are still making this. It is a must have for cold and flu season. It really helps to clear your nose and chest congestion with the vapor. Also great on sore muscles. The scent is rather pleasent.</li>
            <li> thank you for carrying this product.  I live in a very rural village in north central washington state, and the nearest place i can even go to find this product is seattle.  this stuff is great for colds, and achy bones...</li>
            <li> I love white flower for sore muscles and lower back pain. I have also used it when I have a cold or cough. Rubbed around throat and chest for cold and cough relief! I always have to order a new bottle because someone always ends up with mine. I have never had an issue with delivery.</li>
            <li> Hands down, the best ever for sore muscles.  I have tried MANY different products for sore and stiff muscles and this one is by far the best I have tried.  A very little bit is all that is needed to rub in the affected area.  Within a few minutes the area feels warmer and muscles loosen up.  We bring the travel size with us on vacation too.</li>
            <li> Often White Flower hits the mark when I want to work on pain without taking pills.&lt;br /&gt;This product is a winner</li>
            <li> Husband uses it every day</li>
            <li> I have neuropathy and this works great on my feet. Give three to four hours of relief.</li>
            <li> In moving, a bottle of this turned up in one of our boxes. Turns out a long time ago seeing an acupuncturist, she&#x27;d given me a bottle. Remembering this, I went on a hunt. This is the first source I found, wanting to get just one bottle to see if it would help with leg and foot cramps. It does! Plus my husband uses it on his lower back, shoulder, and hands since the work he does is very physically demanding. I selected this distributor and it arrived on time, in perfect condition. For speedy delivery, you&#x27;ll want to stick to a source that is highly rated and close. You might see my review on another source (also positive), but again if you want it fast &amp;#34;go local.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Thank you.  This product is awesome.</li>
            <li> Helps with sinus headaches.</li>
            <li> Really works for aches and pains of arthritis.</li>
            <li> I saw this on the Steve Harvey Show and thought I would give it a try. It helps my joint pain a lot. I haven&#x27;t tried it for headaches as of yet.</li>
            <li> I rub this stuff on my shoulders and back at work. The scent is somewhat like bengay but it is soothing and helps to relax tense muscles.</li>
            <li> I am an older lady with deep achy feet and legs in bed at night.  I was slathering on Icy Hot, which helped, but dried out my skin.  White Flower calms the achyness almost right away and the oil scent helps me sleep.  This is nice stuff.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Incredible stuff for arthritis all the way to a migraine.  BUT WATCH THE SIZE.  The one I clicked on is the .67 oz for just under $11.  THAT is a good price (particularly Prime) but there is another further down the list that is the tiny tiny size for even more money.  Look at the number of ounces/milliliters and use a conversion chart online if you need to.  But the .67 oz size is the &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; bottle (which is still pretty darned small - it fits in the palm of your hand) BUT it&#x27;s powerful stuff and goes a long way.  That tiny sized bottle should be about $2 (which is what I&#x27;ve paid in the past but one of the vendors on here is selling it for the higher price so it&#x27;s being reviewed badly.</li>
            <li> The best liniment you can ever use for tendinitis or regular muscle soreness.</li>
            <li> if you rub this into an area that has pain , the next day you will find it really does help lower your pain.</li>
            <li> I keep several bottles of this on hand.  I even use it on my chest to clear up my congestion.  Give it away to friends and they are amazed at how well it works.</li>
            <li> I love this product and can&#x27;t sleep without it. Great price and arrived sooner than quoted.</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF IS AMAZING I AM SO HAPPY I DISCOVERED IT. IT SMELLS GREAT AND HAD SUPERHUMAN PAIN RELIEVING TENDANDCES</li>
            <li> Had gotten this product before from a friend of my husband.  Couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere local, so I looked it up on the net and found it with you.  So glad to have it back in the house.  Really helps with sore muscles.</li>
            <li> Love this product and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> My 13 year old son is a basketball player and has a lot of growing pains in his knees.  He rubs some of this ointment on and the pain goes away for HOURS!</li>
            <li> This product works well for temporary pain relief.  It&#x27;s a great addition to my a Massage practice.</li>
            <li> We were introduced to White Flower during a trip to the Amana Colonies, of all places.  One of the stores carried it, and we purchased it based on the high praise of the store clerk.  Amazingly, it works!  We&#x27;ve used White Flower to alleviate back pain. It also helps clear our sinuses and helps to relieve congestion. It&#x27;s nice to know there are more and more alternatives before popping a Tylenol or Advil capsule.</li>
            <li> the balm or oil helps relieve inflammation in joints also relieves mild pain and skin that is irritated</li>
            <li> Excellent Product , Great communication and packaging. Would diffently order again. Works great on all aches and pains. Its an amazing product.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product before from the store and needed it again, I bought it from here and as great as always!</li>
            <li> This is very good for  pain form arthritis  easy to apply and fast relief , also last a long time after applying to skin</li>
            <li> I used this growing up...I knew how it would work and bought it because I thought it was a novelty--hadn&#x27;t really looked for or purchased it in years.  But I recently went to an Asian store where I found the same size bottle for much less.  Live and learn!</li>
            <li> Very light liquid and soaks into the skin fast. Leaves no residue or oil behind, just an odor for a while. Very good at pain relief, but has a strong wintergreen smell.  The smell is not unpleasant, just strong, and will be shared with everyone around you for about 20 minutes.  I&#x27;ve used this stuff for years for strains, joint pains, sprains, and general aches.  It works good, but keep it away from your tender parts.  That being said, I recently tried Wood Lock Oil (Wong To Yick), which is very similar and I actually like even more than White Flower.  I think the Wood Lock Oil works a little better (on me) than White Flower.  The 2 products have the same thickness and similar smell - slightly less for Wood Lock - but the real difference is the price.  You get more Wood Lock for the same price as White Flower.</li>
            <li> Love this produce. Rub my aching neck and muscles. Feel refreshed in the morning. Need more.</li>
            <li> luckily pain level has been low and not needed to use this yet.</li>
            <li> This is undoubtedly the best analgesic balm anywhere.  I started using it for a number of things back in 1990 and would not be without it.  It also is great for temporary relief of nasal congestion.  It is very hot.</li>
            <li> White Flower balm works really well. I&#x27;ve been using it for years, for neck, shoulder and wrist pain, tendonitis, a torn ligamentâ€¦ I have also added it to water for steam. The only problem could be the aroma!!  But it wears off, and anyway, if anyone&#x27;s eyebrows go up I just smile.</li>
            <li> Great product for muscle pain associated with Lyme Disease. I use it and I love it! I had such a hard time finding a linoment to use for muscle pain and stiffness. I also use Arnicare and products containing Arnica, but if your looking for a linoment for achy sore muscles- Here it is! ~</li>
            <li> White flower balm does so much more than you can  imagine. White Flower Analgesic Balm is known throughout the world. The product was developed in 1927 by Gan Geog Eng, a resident of Singapore. The fluid was originally made only for private use, but family friends and acquaintances tried it out and liked it so much they convinced Mr. Gan to produce it on a commercial basis. He called it Pak Fah Yeow (also written Bai Hua You, which means white flower oil), named for his favorite flower, the white narcissus. The trademark was registered in 1935. Following the initial success in Singapore and Penang, Mr. Gan decided to enter into the Hong Kong market in 1951, seeing it as both a potential major market and ideal manufacturing center. With a series of marketing campaigns, extensive outdoor advertising, and endorsement by well-known Chinese opera actors, White Flower Oil became a leading product in the Far East.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is a blend of several essential oils and active ingredients from plant oils, according to the following formulation:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wintergreen 40%&lt;br /&gt;Eucalyptus 18%&lt;br /&gt;Peppermint 15%&lt;br /&gt;Menthol 15%&lt;br /&gt;Camphor 6%&lt;br /&gt;Lavender 6%</li>
            <li> I have been using Medicated Green Oil for years.  I decided to try this one for the scent.  Some said it smelled like lavender at the end.  Unfortunately, the next morning I smell the menthol.  It works great on any arthritic, joint pain, or muscle ache.  I have turned many friends onto this product. LOVE IT.  One friend stopped using Meloxicam (oral prescription) because the oil worked so well for her.  I stand sometimes for as much as 8 hours on concrete, walk on gravel, and have a torn meniscus and lisfranc fracture.  This gets me thru those rough times.</li>
            <li> Cools down the over worked muscles quickly.  I keep s bottle in my purse for emergencies.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for about two years and for me it works very well.  I had a friend who would pick it up for me at an Asian store near her job.  Glad that I can get it from you now as she has retired. I use it mainly on my hands with compression gloves at night and on my knees.</li>
            <li> Great stuff I have used White Flower for yeard</li>
            <li> Hey, that&#x27;s nice!  White Flower offers a pleasant warming, that&#x27;s juuuust right for mild aches.  Other concentrated formulas can be too strong for some aches.  However, I&#x27;m liking White Flower even more for sinus relief.  Rub a little on the hands, take a few deep breaths, and my whole respiratory system feels rejuvenated.  Again, it&#x27;s not too strong - just strong enough to work, without kicking your butt!</li>
            <li> I works wonder on sore muscle</li>
            <li> Great like its supposed to be (I&#x27;ve been a user for a while) and good price for the size.</li>
            <li> Very useful &amp; effective for a lot of ailments: pains, bites, nausea, motion sickness etc. My Mom have been using this stuff since I was little. So I recommend this balm. Just be cautious, it&#x27;s very powerful scent.</li>
            <li> Omg  I was told about this from a nurse at my job. Her grandmother is Chinese and loves this stuff. So I brought it off amazon and it works. On my temples headaches, on my tailbone for lower back aches and on my knees ( where the pain is) for knee pain. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product at great price!&lt;br /&gt;The shipping from Hong-Kong took a while but it was definitely worth the wait!&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Attached was a personal hand-written thank you note.</li>
            <li> We used this on recommendation of a friend to relieve our coughing.  You place a small drop at the end of your nostril and inhale.  It instantly gives a strong, but pleasant, menthol style breath of air to your lungs.  However, we found that it really did nothing permanent for our cough or colds.  I would place this in the same catagory as a Vick&#x27;s inhaler, or rubbing Vick&#x27;s Vapo Rub on your nose.  Pleasant, but no medical  benefit.</li>
            <li> I use this every  nite to help me sleep and it works  very good product</li>
            <li> It came broken and package was wet . Dissapointed returned today will change review when I get my order not broken ðŸ˜ </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the search for alternatives to medication recently and stumbled upon this little life saver. I have fibromyalgia,rheumatoid arthritis and had back surgery about 2 years ago. When I first opened it, it smelled wonderful. It&#x27;s very strong but it didn&#x27;t bother me at all. It&#x27;s not for everyone however, especially if you can&#x27;t tolerate peppermint and the menthol smell.  I dab a little on a tissue and rub behind my neck and back and helps tremendously. I also take a whiff of it for my migraines and seems to do the trick. I highly suggest it for those suffering from sinuses as well, the smell definitely useful. All in all its a great alternative  to multiple symptoms that you may have and for me it&#x27;s very effective.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this magic product for a long time!  Finally------ a reliable source.  Thank you so much.  Anita</li>
            <li> Hi, great for slight headaches...refreshing mint to the temples uplifts the spirit. Helps, it seems with headaches. This was shared with me by a Chinese lady...the Chinese have lots of fun things...like different herbs and remedies.</li>
            <li> The White Flower Ol did live up to my friends claims!! I was very pleased how it warmed and then cooled my aching joints! I have recommended it to friends and waiting its arrival!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It works great and smells great!</li>
            <li> I would have been just fine with a smaller bottle.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> great price, seller responded quickly to questions asked!</li>
            <li> This has really helped me since my accident with my lower back, shoulders, and elbow.</li>
            <li> This works good for my joint pain and sore muscles.  Will get it again.</li>
            <li> Great for muscle soreness and aching feet!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted. I don&#x27;t want to pay $11 for it but I will. It&#x27;s so great for my upper back/neck/shoulder pain.  I also have sinusitis so inhaling the balm from my hands feels good internally too. It&#x27;s way stronger than Vicks and not in a painful burning way. It&#x27;s also not oily. Smells fantastic and fresh. I almost wish I had more aches so I had an excuse to rub it on more areas.</li>
            <li> This is probably too expensive for what it is and how much you get but I feel like it really works. Used it 20 years ago as a kid and recently tried it for elbow pain. I use it in conjunction with other stuff so I don&#x27;t know exactly what it&#x27;s doing if anything but I believe in it. The ingredients are proven.</li>
            <li> Exceeds all expectations. My wife has extreme lower back pains. A leftover from back surgery. This in the only balm that giver her temporary relief long enough to fall asleep.  Careful to keep it away from the eyes or sensitive body parts!</li>
            <li> Received very quickly and works great. I had what looked like a rash but was actually a spot where my older kitty who can&#x27;t retract his claws all the way had been kneading my arm, and I&#x27;ve been using this on it for two days and it&#x27;s almost entirely healed. (I know, why did I let the cat do it in the first place? It was one of those &amp;#34;not so bad at the time&amp;#34; things). But it smells great and has so many uses--I had ordered a bottle just to have around and then had the opportunity to use it for that, and it really does work. I&#x27;d been using it to sniff to clear up my stuffy nose, and it works for that too. Awesome stuff, well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful for aches and pains, and also when I have a cold. I use it instead of Vicks at night. The cooling effect on sore muscles is terrific.</li>
            <li> Amazing for sore muscles and stuffed up sinus.</li>
            <li> I wear this only at night because of the sent but it has helped me a great deal with my pain.</li>
            <li> good for head aches  dab on temples&lt;br /&gt;helps clear sinus  dab center of forehead&lt;br /&gt;  rub on palms &amp; inhale deeply&lt;br /&gt;do not use near in your eyes</li>
            <li> The best relief for sinus and chest congestion.</li>
            <li> First time I tried it I got a huge headache.&lt;br /&gt;After I used it my headache gone!&lt;br /&gt;Love this balm!!!</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this oil and helps with my aches and pain in my legs. I only wish it was easier to get the oil out of the jar. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this product a three-star rating due to the fact there are many other products on the market that do just as good, if not better, than elevating pain than this product does.........and at a lower cost.  You can purchase other off-the-self products that contain the same main ingredient this does and the other products will contain at least three times the product this does..........hence the lower cost.&lt;br /&gt;This product absorbs quickly into your skin and you will feel a slight &#x27;icy&#x27; feeling after applied.  Beware!  Do not rub your eyes and/or another other sensitive parts of your body after getting this product on your hands/fingers.  If you do, you will suffer the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the White flower and I&#x27;ve been trying to introduce it to others so that they can get some relief from their pain.</li>
