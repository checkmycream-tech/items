            <li>The whitening is good.  </li>
            <li>and it is actually good for you - unlike chemicals and bleach.  </li>
            <li>I had already tried and loved their tooth whitener.  </li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;ve just begun to use, it gives my mouth a good feeling.</li>

            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made for much more pleasant trips to the dentist for all of us.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the results from Smart Ash.  </li>
            <li>but once you rinse the difference is amazing.</li>
            <li>But amazingly, it does seem to whiten teeth.</li>
            <li>Amazing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already seen amazing results.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>Not only is the product itself great, but the packaging was flawless too.</li>
            <li>They are thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li>The product was shipped promptly with a personalized hand written note thanking me for my purchase, which was a nice touch.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m loving my shinier teeth already.</li>
            <li>Smart Ash is now my favorite!!!  </li>
            <li>love it! :-)  </li>
            <li>Honestly I was not expecting to love this product.  </li>
            <li>The lovely note with the product was a nice touch, and the tiny sampler with the product is great to have your friends try!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, I am a loyal customer!!</li>
            <li>The packaging was great and there was a hand written, personalized note included which was a very pleasant surprise (also included a small sample to pass along to a friend.)</li>
            <li>Thank you, Bedrock &amp; Bloom! :)</li>
            <li>and we all love it.</li>
            <li>Interesting product.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll plan to order more.</li>
            <li>we like the most.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic!</li>
            <li>My teeth have stayed whiter and resisted stains more since I started using this product.</li>
            <li>Interesting product, but</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love that part of it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great if you really don&#x27;t floss your Teeth because</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s refreshing.</li>
            <li>(she&#x27;s 16 :-).</li>
            <li>And yes, like many say, you feel &amp;#34;dentist clean&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>So I took a chance on this and am glad I did.</li>
            <li>Keep a magic eraser-type sponge convenient and use it to wipe the charcoal out of the sink and off the counter as soon as I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel and look better after using this product.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing how my teeth look after more use.  </li>
            <li>Bought this last week, absolutely love it!!!  </li>
            <li>Smart Ash is amazing!</li>
            <li>Excellent cleaning action, quickly reduces stain.  </li>
            <li>My teeth felt very clean, and they looked whiter.</li>
            <li>My daughter asked me the morning after my first use if I had used something to whitened my teeth because they looked so good.  </li>
            <li>(super attractive, right?) and pushing and pulling it through my front teeth.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t sound appealing ...</li>
            <li>Great natural product.</li>
            <li>Many amazon sellers leaves positive reviews  on their own.</li>
            <li>and it cleans up really easily.  </li>
            <li>If they care enough to design creative attractive packaging and hand-write a &amp;</li>
            <li>I have noticed that my mouth feels so much more clean when I use this.</li>
            <li>I have not had time to use this for more than a couple days, but so far it seems to do a good job.</li>
            <li>packaging was really cool, too, and came with tips for use and a cute hand-written note.</li>
            <li>My quest on finding the BEST teeth whitener and desensitizer has FINALLY come to an end now that I have discovered Bedrock and Bloom&#x27;s organic Smart Ash!</li>
            <li>I got my order so fast, and I love the product!  </li>
            <li>I purchased Smart Ash after a recommendation from a friend and I have to say that so far I&#x27;m super impressed!</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was the amazing clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>My first thought after using it was, I love how clean my teeth feel!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic, all around!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also have to mention the fabulous packaging.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never had such great results.</li>
            <li>Enjoy your Charcoal Smile.er as soon as I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember ever being remotely comfortable</li>
            <li>but my teeth feel smooth.</li>
            <li>It takes a while to get used to the texture when brushing, but right away my teeth felt very smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li>After consulting Dr. Google I suspected he had dental fluorosis, I was pretty panicked because his teeth were borderline brown!!</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so clean and so smooth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple and effective!</li>
            <li>First off, the packaging was fantastic!</li>
            <li>and I have always felt significant pain and sensitivity.</li>
            <li>Well, I have just returned from the dentist and for the first time in 45 years, I had no pain, no sensitivity, and I was able to sit in the chair without pain and that means no anxiety.</li>
            <li>What I also love about Smart Ash is that smooth feeling you get from a cleaning at the Dentist.  </li>
            <li>They feel clean.</li>
            <li>Then I spit it out and brush my teeth with water until I&#x27;m spitting out clean water.</li>
            <li>My teeth are so clean and about 2 shades whiter.</li>
            <li>I am OCD about my teeth being clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used chemical based products before, and Smart Ash works better for me, without being damaging.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not talking abnormally bright white teeth.  </li>
            <li>It does not work fast, but I am OK with that.</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t believe the reviews completely upon reading them, but now I can attest to them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My teeth are so smooth and my mouth feels fresh.</li>
            <li>We as a family think the teeth whitening is cool</li>
            <li>But a couple days later she noticed  how good my teeth were looking and started using it too.</li>
            <li>Enjoy your Charcoal Smile.</li>
            <li>In fact, two years ago, I had a full blown panic attack in the chair and my husband had to leave work and come get me.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not slowly grinding my teeth away though, too! : )</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not afraid to smile again!  </li>
            <li>Talk about a really clean, fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>Seriously, I want to rep your product because I am so impressed.</li>
            <li>My husband and I both loved the &#x27;fresh from the dentist&#x27; feeling after using it, without having to actually see him!</li>
            <li>Love this product, and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>First I want to say that this company gave me a free sample and sent a thank-you note for trying their &amp;#34;strange&amp;#34; product.  </li>
            <li>It is not unpleasant in any way.</li>
            <li>This was a good find for me, so long review ahead.</li>
            <li>After just one use, my teeth felt smooth and &amp;#34;dentist clean.&amp;#34; I love the way my entire mouth feels fresh and super clean after each brush.</li>
            <li>hands down BEST natural product I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  </li>
            <li>After trying it the first time I was hooked!</li>
            <li>All in all, exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>It is a natural whitener and great for sensitive teeth and your whole mouth.</li>
            <li>but honestly it&#x27;s the &amp;#34;Fresh back from the Dentist&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Love that it is all natural and organic.  </li>
            <li>it benefits them so much it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>The product was delivered very quickly in a unique box with instructions on how to use Smart Ash.</li>
            <li>I feel much more confident about my smile now, so I&#x27;ll be using Smart Ash as long as I can get my hands on</li>
            <li>Your sink does get black spots, but it cleans up nicely!</li>
            <li>Not only did it significantly whiten my teeth, but my kids also love it and we use it as part of an oral health regimen.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use it in the shower unless you want to clean up the sink constantly.</li>
            <li>I stumbled on this, and due to good reviews decided to purchase.</li>
            <li>You see and feel a difference right away.</li>
            <li>I really like to use this at night before bed and then swish some mouthwash around for a really clean mouth that lasts till I wake up.</li>
            <li>But this whitener works great, can remove stubborn stains as good as any dental hygienist/regular checkup, in my experience; and while you are warned to be careful not to stain your clothes, as clumsy as I am, I haven&#x27;t had a spill yet.</li>
            <li>I ordered some Smart Ash, I wanted a quality natural product and we just love it.</li>
            <li>This ash is indeed SMART and I am a believer !</li>
            <li>As well as the large container that I payed for it also came with a small sample to give to a friend or family member (genuinely great marketing strategy).</li>
            <li>I immediately saw a difference in my whiteness and my teeth felt squeaky clean for much longer than they normally do!</li>
            <li>My concern is that the more mainstream tooth whiteners ultimately damage or weaken tooth enamel, and I care more about that than about having white teeth!</li>
            <li>I have been an avid tea drinker and smoker which has caused staining and yellowing of my teeth.</li>
            <li>but my teeth do become brighter when I use this consistently.</li>
            <li>This is our family&#x27;s second batch and we love it.  </li>
            <li>Our sons think it&#x27;s hilarious and actually demand to use it (&amp;#34;PIRATE TEETH!</li>
            <li>PIRATE TEETH!&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li>(The directions themselves are rather funny - I always like a company with a sense of humor.)</li>
            <li>I totally guess/ pretty sure that these five stars has the problem.</li>
            <li>The product is all natural, cruelty free, and it&#x27;s nutrition for your teeth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different ones and this one works like no others.</li>
            <li>They really are getting whiter!</li>
            <li>My 8 yr old loves it and is now excited to spend time brushing without asking, &amp;#34;are</li>
            <li>I love this strange product:), I will definitely order from this seller again!</li>
            <li>Thanks Smart Ash for meeting and exceeding my expectations!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so regretting it as I can tell now after using my old toothpaste that my mouth doesn&#x27;t feel as clean.</li>
            <li>This product along with my electric toothbrush give me a super clean teeth like I just got back from the dentist.</li>
            <li>I noticed results the FIRST time I used Smart Ash (no joke) as my teeth were whiter and my mouth felt cleaner.</li>
            <li>Tried this product for the first time and it really worked well.</li>
            <li>They come right off when I brush with normal toothpaste</li>
            <li>Without that protection, my teeth became super sensitive and whiteners were no longer an option.</li>
            <li>My teeth are super sensitive.</li>
            <li>I kind of get a kick out of the black stuff in my mouth.</li>
            <li>Smart Ash  cleared up the stains on my teeth in three days,  and my teeth are getting whiter.  </li>
            <li>Where have you been Smart Ash?  </li>
            <li>I also have sensitivity issues and i haven&#x27;t had any problems while using Smart Ash.  </li>
            <li>I started using smart ash four days ago, when a friend gave me some of hers to try.</li>
            <li>Three months ago I started brushing my teeth with Smart Ash.</li>
            <li>also appreciated the hand written note that came with Smart Ash.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few days but my teeth feel great</li>
            <li>but it really works.</li>
            <li>It seem like it haven&#x27;t made much of a difference in whitening my teeth,.</li>
            <li>Even though I just bought it, I&#x27;ve used it about five times now and my teeth are really getting whiter, even in between teeth.  </li>
            <li>and it really does work.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
            <li>I did get too much once</li>
            <li>it is much easier to deal with.</li>
            <li>There really isn&#x27;t a taste</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this stuff will give you the blinding-white smile of a movie star, but my smile definitely looks brighter.</li>
            <li>My teeth are super sensitive, and I have damaged enamel that has left my teeth looking less than great, which is something I&#x27;m very self conscious about.</li>
            <li>I love this feeling of &amp;#34;dentist clean.&amp;#34;  I would not have believed that this black powder could do this if I had not witnessed it first hand.  </li>
            <li>And the thought that I&#x27;m chipping away at my enamel in doing so also bothered me.&lt;br /&gt;SO, not only did this clean my teeth very well, but it also truly did WHITEN them!&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>now my husband and I have clean white teeth!</li>
            <li>Love the healthy alternative, but I need to brush extremely carefully to avoid black marks all over bathroom.</li>
            <li>It is very messing and leave black marks all in the sink and around the counter top.</li>
            <li>After closing it, give the jar a quick wipe and toss the tp in the bowl for the next time I flush.</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that it&#x27;s natural!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan</li>
            <li>I highly recommend you try it for cleaner and whiter teeth.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone looking to whiten and strengthen your teeth.</li>
            <li>Also, my teeth have a really clean feeling all day long.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased it after my 2 year old son began developing this mysterious brown staining on his teeth.</li>
            <li>I just received my first jar of Smart Ash today and immediately tore the box open because I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it!  </li>
            <li>But the directions are clear and I had just used too much.</li>
            <li>Its been a few more days</li>
            <li>You kinda get addicted to how good your teeth feel.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to open and it had a hand written note that gave it a personal touch.</li>
            <li>no big deal cleans right up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Smart Ash for three weeks now, and in addition to leaving my teeth feeling phenomenal, they are at least two shades whiter.</li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive teeth and haven&#x27;t had any sensitivity issues with this product.</li>
            <li>Boy was I pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>It has completely eliminated my teeth sensitivity!  </li>
            <li>could make my teeth white, but I kid you not when I say I noticed a difference after the first use.</li>
            <li>I researched all similar products and Smart ash is a quality product and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge coffee drinker and every time I go to the dentist for a cleaning I&#x27;m advised to cut down on the coffee drinking.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t recommend it enough for that &amp;#34;just left the dentist&amp;#34; clean feeling.</li>
            <li>I have tried several other products and this one is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>My teeth whitened considerably in just the first week and continue to whiten with regular use.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t taste like much and it&#x27;s fun to see your teeth turn black as you brush.</li>
            <li>Smart Ash brought me back to the whitening world!</li>
            <li>Smart Ash has not only made my teeth whiter without any discomfort, but also improved the appearance of my enamel.</li>
            <li>Smart Ash has made sensitivity go away completely, and I have found that I only have to use it about once a week to continue getting that result.  </li>
            <li>And after unsuccessful attempts with whitening strips, I&#x27;m hopeful to see some long-term results as far as the stains on my teeth from years of smoking and coffee drinking.  </li>
            <li>I have had a one sensitive tooth for a while now and this stuff within a matter of days took it completely away.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t have to use sensitive toothpaste anymore.</li>
            <li>I have had my teeth professionally whitened</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also been using it on myself and my 6 year old.</li>
            <li>My teeth didn&#x27;t even feel sensitive at all.</li>
            <li>Finally, and the only upsetting thing, I left yesterday for vacation and forgot to bring my Smart Ash!!  </li>
            <li>I have only used this product once and can already see the difference, will be recommending this highly.</li>
            <li>We only let them use it in the bath, since they&#x27;d make a huge mess otherwise.</li>
            <li>And the only thing I&#x27;m doing differently is brushing with Smart Ash.</li>
            <li>I know packaging doesn&#x27;t really matter in terms of product effectiveness, but I really like it when companies pay attention to those little details.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had sensitive teeth for years, and had to use sensitive toothpaste; but that only lessened the problem...</li>
            <li>Needless to say this product is AMAZING</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not bad at all even though it sure is weird to be brushing with black stuff.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a feeling of cleanliness that I get with Smart Ash that you just can&#x27;t get with other things like it.  </li>
            <li>considering you can barely keep your kids brushing there teeth on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li>It can be a little messy, but it wipes up easily.</li>
            <li>but if I&#x27;m having trouble with the pain from it, I use Smart Ash, the pain is gone within the hour and stays gone.</li>
            <li>I do always get a few flecks stuck at my gum line on certain teeth.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve used plain activated charcoal before, and it&#x27;s incredibly messy (sticks and won&#x27;t come off), however I found this formula easy to rise off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>With a little care this is really helpful for me, having Lymes</li>
            <li>Be careful it is a little messy. :)</li>

            <li> Great Product and outstanding seller!</li>
            <li> The whitening is good.  </li>
            <li> and it is actually good for you - unlike chemicals and bleach.  </li>
            <li> I had already tried and loved their tooth whitener.  </li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve just begun to use, it gives my mouth a good feeling.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m very pleased with the results and will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li> I tried this product because it had so many great reviews.</li>

            <li> Mt teeth look better than ever!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not as adventurous as they thought!  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made for much more pleasant trips to the dentist for all of us.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the results from Smart Ash.  </li>
            <li> but once you rinse the difference is amazing.</li>
            <li> But amazingly, it does seem to whiten teeth.</li>
            <li> Amazing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already seen amazing results.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> Not only is the product itself great, but the packaging was flawless too.</li>
            <li> They are thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li> The product was shipped promptly with a personalized hand written note thanking me for my purchase, which was a nice touch.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m loving my shinier teeth already.</li>
            <li> Smart Ash is now my favorite!!!  </li>
            <li> love it! :-)  </li>
            <li> Honestly I was not expecting to love this product.  </li>
            <li> The lovely note with the product was a nice touch, and the tiny sampler with the product is great to have your friends try!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I am a loyal customer!!</li>
            <li> The packaging was great and there was a hand written, personalized note included which was a very pleasant surprise (also included a small sample to pass along to a friend.)</li>
            <li> Thank you, Bedrock &amp; Bloom! :)</li>
            <li> and we all love it.</li>
            <li> Interesting product.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll plan to order more.</li>
            <li> we like the most.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic!</li>
            <li> My teeth have stayed whiter and resisted stains more since I started using this product.</li>
            <li> Interesting product, but</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love that part of it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s great if you really don&#x27;t floss your Teeth because</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s refreshing.</li>
            <li> (she&#x27;s 16 :-).</li>
            <li> And yes, like many say, you feel &amp;#34;dentist clean&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> So I took a chance on this and am glad I did.</li>
            <li> Keep a magic eraser-type sponge convenient and use it to wipe the charcoal out of the sink and off the counter as soon as I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel and look better after using this product.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing how my teeth look after more use.  </li>
            <li> Bought this last week, absolutely love it!!!  </li>
            <li> Smart Ash is amazing!</li>
            <li> Excellent cleaning action, quickly reduces stain.  </li>
            <li> My teeth felt very clean, and they looked whiter.</li>
            <li> My daughter asked me the morning after my first use if I had used something to whitened my teeth because they looked so good.  </li>
            <li> (super attractive, right?) and pushing and pulling it through my front teeth.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t sound appealing ...</li>
            <li> Great natural product.</li>
            <li> Many amazon sellers leaves positive reviews  on their own.</li>
            <li> and it cleans up really easily.  </li>
            <li> If they care enough to design creative attractive packaging and hand-write a &amp;</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my mouth feels so much more clean when I use this.</li>
            <li> I have not had time to use this for more than a couple days, but so far it seems to do a good job.</li>
            <li> packaging was really cool, too, and came with tips for use and a cute hand-written note.</li>
            <li> My quest on finding the BEST teeth whitener and desensitizer has FINALLY come to an end now that I have discovered Bedrock and Bloom&#x27;s organic Smart Ash!</li>
            <li> I got my order so fast, and I love the product!  </li>
            <li> I purchased Smart Ash after a recommendation from a friend and I have to say that so far I&#x27;m super impressed!</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was the amazing clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> My first thought after using it was, I love how clean my teeth feel!  </li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic, all around!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also have to mention the fabulous packaging.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never had such great results.</li>
            <li> Enjoy your Charcoal Smile.er as soon as I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember ever being remotely comfortable</li>
            <li> but my teeth feel smooth.</li>
            <li> It takes a while to get used to the texture when brushing, but right away my teeth felt very smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li> After consulting Dr. Google I suspected he had dental fluorosis, I was pretty panicked because his teeth were borderline brown!!</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean and so smooth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple and effective!</li>
            <li> First off, the packaging was fantastic!</li>
            <li> and I have always felt significant pain and sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Well, I have just returned from the dentist and for the first time in 45 years, I had no pain, no sensitivity, and I was able to sit in the chair without pain and that means no anxiety.</li>
            <li> What I also love about Smart Ash is that smooth feeling you get from a cleaning at the Dentist.  </li>
            <li> They feel clean.</li>
            <li> Then I spit it out and brush my teeth with water until I&#x27;m spitting out clean water.</li>
            <li> My teeth are so clean and about 2 shades whiter.</li>
            <li> I am OCD about my teeth being clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used chemical based products before, and Smart Ash works better for me, without being damaging.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not talking abnormally bright white teeth.  </li>
            <li> It does not work fast, but I am OK with that.</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t believe the reviews completely upon reading them, but now I can attest to them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teeth are so smooth and my mouth feels fresh.</li>
            <li> We as a family think the teeth whitening is cool</li>
            <li> But a couple days later she noticed  how good my teeth were looking and started using it too.</li>
            <li> Enjoy your Charcoal Smile.</li>
            <li> In fact, two years ago, I had a full blown panic attack in the chair and my husband had to leave work and come get me.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not slowly grinding my teeth away though, too! : )</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not afraid to smile again!  </li>
            <li> Talk about a really clean, fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I want to rep your product because I am so impressed.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both loved the &#x27;fresh from the dentist&#x27; feeling after using it, without having to actually see him!</li>
            <li> Love this product, and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> First I want to say that this company gave me a free sample and sent a thank-you note for trying their &amp;#34;strange&amp;#34; product.  </li>
            <li> It is not unpleasant in any way.</li>
            <li> This was a good find for me, so long review ahead.</li>
            <li> After just one use, my teeth felt smooth and &amp;#34;dentist clean.&amp;#34; I love the way my entire mouth feels fresh and super clean after each brush.</li>
            <li> hands down BEST natural product I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  </li>
            <li> After trying it the first time I was hooked!</li>
            <li> All in all, exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> It is a natural whitener and great for sensitive teeth and your whole mouth.</li>
            <li> but honestly it&#x27;s the &amp;#34;Fresh back from the Dentist&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love that it is all natural and organic.  </li>
            <li> it benefits them so much it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> The product was delivered very quickly in a unique box with instructions on how to use Smart Ash.</li>
            <li> I feel much more confident about my smile now, so I&#x27;ll be using Smart Ash as long as I can get my hands on</li>
            <li> Your sink does get black spots, but it cleans up nicely!</li>
            <li> Not only did it significantly whiten my teeth, but my kids also love it and we use it as part of an oral health regimen.</li>
            <li> Make sure you use it in the shower unless you want to clean up the sink constantly.</li>
            <li> I stumbled on this, and due to good reviews decided to purchase.</li>
            <li> You see and feel a difference right away.</li>
            <li> I really like to use this at night before bed and then swish some mouthwash around for a really clean mouth that lasts till I wake up.</li>
            <li> But this whitener works great, can remove stubborn stains as good as any dental hygienist/regular checkup, in my experience; and while you are warned to be careful not to stain your clothes, as clumsy as I am, I haven&#x27;t had a spill yet.</li>
            <li> I ordered some Smart Ash, I wanted a quality natural product and we just love it.</li>
            <li> This ash is indeed SMART and I am a believer !</li>
            <li> As well as the large container that I payed for it also came with a small sample to give to a friend or family member (genuinely great marketing strategy).</li>
            <li> I immediately saw a difference in my whiteness and my teeth felt squeaky clean for much longer than they normally do!</li>
            <li> My concern is that the more mainstream tooth whiteners ultimately damage or weaken tooth enamel, and I care more about that than about having white teeth!</li>
            <li> I have been an avid tea drinker and smoker which has caused staining and yellowing of my teeth.</li>
            <li> but my teeth do become brighter when I use this consistently.</li>
            <li> This is our family&#x27;s second batch and we love it.  </li>
            <li> Our sons think it&#x27;s hilarious and actually demand to use it (&amp;#34;PIRATE TEETH!</li>
            <li> PIRATE TEETH!&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li> (The directions themselves are rather funny - I always like a company with a sense of humor.)</li>
            <li> I totally guess/ pretty sure that these five stars has the problem.</li>
            <li> The product is all natural, cruelty free, and it&#x27;s nutrition for your teeth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different ones and this one works like no others.</li>
            <li> They really are getting whiter!</li>
            <li> My 8 yr old loves it and is now excited to spend time brushing without asking, &amp;#34;are</li>
            <li> I love this strange product:), I will definitely order from this seller again!</li>
            <li> Thanks Smart Ash for meeting and exceeding my expectations!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so regretting it as I can tell now after using my old toothpaste that my mouth doesn&#x27;t feel as clean.</li>
            <li> This product along with my electric toothbrush give me a super clean teeth like I just got back from the dentist.</li>
            <li> I noticed results the FIRST time I used Smart Ash (no joke) as my teeth were whiter and my mouth felt cleaner.</li>
            <li> Tried this product for the first time and it really worked well.</li>
            <li> They come right off when I brush with normal toothpaste</li>
            <li> Without that protection, my teeth became super sensitive and whiteners were no longer an option.</li>
            <li> My teeth are super sensitive.</li>
            <li> I kind of get a kick out of the black stuff in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Smart Ash  cleared up the stains on my teeth in three days,  and my teeth are getting whiter.  </li>
            <li> Where have you been Smart Ash?  </li>
            <li> I also have sensitivity issues and i haven&#x27;t had any problems while using Smart Ash.  </li>
            <li> I started using smart ash four days ago, when a friend gave me some of hers to try.</li>
            <li> Three months ago I started brushing my teeth with Smart Ash.</li>
            <li> also appreciated the hand written note that came with Smart Ash.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few days but my teeth feel great</li>
            <li> but it really works.</li>
            <li> It seem like it haven&#x27;t made much of a difference in whitening my teeth,.</li>
            <li> Even though I just bought it, I&#x27;ve used it about five times now and my teeth are really getting whiter, even in between teeth.  </li>
            <li> and it really does work.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
            <li> I did get too much once</li>
            <li> it is much easier to deal with.</li>
            <li> There really isn&#x27;t a taste</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this stuff will give you the blinding-white smile of a movie star, but my smile definitely looks brighter.</li>
            <li> My teeth are super sensitive, and I have damaged enamel that has left my teeth looking less than great, which is something I&#x27;m very self conscious about.</li>
            <li> I love this feeling of &amp;#34;dentist clean.&amp;#34;  I would not have believed that this black powder could do this if I had not witnessed it first hand.  </li>
            <li> And the thought that I&#x27;m chipping away at my enamel in doing so also bothered me.&lt;br /&gt;SO, not only did this clean my teeth very well, but it also truly did WHITEN them!&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> now my husband and I have clean white teeth!</li>
            <li> Love the healthy alternative, but I need to brush extremely carefully to avoid black marks all over bathroom.</li>
            <li> It is very messing and leave black marks all in the sink and around the counter top.</li>
            <li> After closing it, give the jar a quick wipe and toss the tp in the bowl for the next time I flush.</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that it&#x27;s natural!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan</li>
            <li> I highly recommend you try it for cleaner and whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone looking to whiten and strengthen your teeth.</li>
            <li> Also, my teeth have a really clean feeling all day long.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased it after my 2 year old son began developing this mysterious brown staining on his teeth.</li>
            <li> I just received my first jar of Smart Ash today and immediately tore the box open because I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it!  </li>
            <li> But the directions are clear and I had just used too much.</li>
            <li> Its been a few more days</li>
            <li> You kinda get addicted to how good your teeth feel.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to open and it had a hand written note that gave it a personal touch.</li>
            <li> no big deal cleans right up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Smart Ash for three weeks now, and in addition to leaving my teeth feeling phenomenal, they are at least two shades whiter.</li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive teeth and haven&#x27;t had any sensitivity issues with this product.</li>
            <li> Boy was I pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> It has completely eliminated my teeth sensitivity!  </li>
            <li> could make my teeth white, but I kid you not when I say I noticed a difference after the first use.</li>
            <li> I researched all similar products and Smart ash is a quality product and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge coffee drinker and every time I go to the dentist for a cleaning I&#x27;m advised to cut down on the coffee drinking.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t recommend it enough for that &amp;#34;just left the dentist&amp;#34; clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I have tried several other products and this one is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> My teeth whitened considerably in just the first week and continue to whiten with regular use.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t taste like much and it&#x27;s fun to see your teeth turn black as you brush.</li>
            <li> Smart Ash brought me back to the whitening world!</li>
            <li> Smart Ash has not only made my teeth whiter without any discomfort, but also improved the appearance of my enamel.</li>
            <li> Smart Ash has made sensitivity go away completely, and I have found that I only have to use it about once a week to continue getting that result.  </li>
            <li> And after unsuccessful attempts with whitening strips, I&#x27;m hopeful to see some long-term results as far as the stains on my teeth from years of smoking and coffee drinking.  </li>
            <li> I have had a one sensitive tooth for a while now and this stuff within a matter of days took it completely away.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t have to use sensitive toothpaste anymore.</li>
            <li> I have had my teeth professionally whitened</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also been using it on myself and my 6 year old.</li>
            <li> My teeth didn&#x27;t even feel sensitive at all.</li>
            <li> Finally, and the only upsetting thing, I left yesterday for vacation and forgot to bring my Smart Ash!!  </li>
            <li> I have only used this product once and can already see the difference, will be recommending this highly.</li>
            <li> We only let them use it in the bath, since they&#x27;d make a huge mess otherwise.</li>
            <li> And the only thing I&#x27;m doing differently is brushing with Smart Ash.</li>
            <li> I know packaging doesn&#x27;t really matter in terms of product effectiveness, but I really like it when companies pay attention to those little details.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had sensitive teeth for years, and had to use sensitive toothpaste; but that only lessened the problem...</li>
            <li> Needless to say this product is AMAZING</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not bad at all even though it sure is weird to be brushing with black stuff.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a feeling of cleanliness that I get with Smart Ash that you just can&#x27;t get with other things like it.  </li>
            <li> considering you can barely keep your kids brushing there teeth on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> It can be a little messy, but it wipes up easily.</li>
            <li> but if I&#x27;m having trouble with the pain from it, I use Smart Ash, the pain is gone within the hour and stays gone.</li>
            <li> I do always get a few flecks stuck at my gum line on certain teeth.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve used plain activated charcoal before, and it&#x27;s incredibly messy (sticks and won&#x27;t come off), however I found this formula easy to rise off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With a little care this is really helpful for me, having Lymes</li>
            <li> Be careful it is a little messy. :)</li>
            <li> The whitening products I have used before made my teeth even more sensitive and were extremely time consuming and expensive.</li>
            <li> If there is any negative, it is that it fills your mouth with black; however, that is easily washed away.  </li>
            <li> I have been using my Smart Ash every day since it arrived this past week.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little messy, but well worth it</li>
            <li> My teeth have gotten both less sensitive and whiter since I started with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Place the jar on a couple squares of toilet paper before opening it.</li>
            <li> I also wanted to do a little whitening, and my teeth are way too sensitive for strips.</li>
            <li> It cleans the mess right up, only takes a few seconds, and no extra waste or cleaning products.</li>
            <li> It cleans the mess right up, only takes a few seconds, and no extra waste or cleaning products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strange, but it works.</li>
            <li> Keep my mouth as closed as possible when brushing.</li>
            <li> It was a long shot</li>
            <li> they can be really difficult to get clean.</li>
            <li> Note that it will make your toothbrush look gross--but that&#x27;s the only down side I can think of.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it once a day for about a month, and my teeth are definitely slightly less yellow</li>
            <li> Brushing with my regular toothpaste also removes all traces of black from my toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> everyday and it totally works.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really not</li>
            <li> I wet my tooth brush and dip it in the powder.</li>
            <li> I thought my wife was crazy when she first bought this, and here I am buying our second jar.</li>
            <li> Because of this, peroxide and other chemical whitening products aren&#x27;t an option for me.</li>
            <li> My last two dentist visits the ladies cleaning my teeth have noted how well I have been taking care of my teeth and there was much less scraping done (less plaque build up &#x3D; less yellowing).</li>
            <li> Who would have thought that by putting this weird black stuff on my toothbrush that my teeth would wind up feeling so much cleaner and whiter!?</li>
            <li> and she was not interested in doing the black teeth thing</li>
            <li> All charchol products with be black when brushing</li>
            <li> I use this in the shower as it is black and if you drip you will stain the bath</li>
            <li> I recommend this to not only friends, but anyone who takes their oral hygiene seriously.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s black ash.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used about a half jar, and my teeth are noticeably whiter.  </li>
            <li> Black powder sticks on my teeth..</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product even though it looks and sounds scary</li>
            <li> Before I started using the product I got some dental work done which cause my teeth to have severe sensitivity to cold and hot liquids.</li>
            <li> mess</li>
            <li> : I wouldn&#x27;t let the mess factor be a deterrent.</li>
            <li> black powder, a bit messy, etc.</li>
            <li> I tried Smart Ash because I was desperate for something - anything - to make my teeth hurt less.</li>
            <li> I have few areas where my teeth overlap a little and</li>
            <li> It is a little messy but</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lately I have been sad about my tea/coffee stains, but cannot withstand the grossness of teeth whiteners, plus they make my teeth severely sensitive for months.</li>
            <li> This product is totally waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;It does not blend with water and stays between gumand teeth.</li>
            <li> Who would have guessed this black as night product would work so well!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe something that turned my teeth black (temporarily!)</li>
            <li> Yes it is messy, but nothing a little tissue wipe can&#x27;t fix!</li>
            <li> A little messy, but the convenient warning in the box was a godsend!</li>
            <li> Once you get past the messy stuff and get your routine</li>
            <li> Furthermore, I have very sensitive teeth to cold food/beverages.</li>
            <li> Both my teens had braces and I am not comfortable using a over the counter tooth whitener that is hard on tooth enamel.  </li>
            <li> And he usually prefers to stick to what he knows, however he&#x27;s been strictly using this since the results are that good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They sent a small sample as well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda crazy to hear my 13 year old asking for it...</li>
            <li> It can be combined with a small dab of toothpaste if that</li>
            <li> do you know why some awful product has so many 5stars??</li>
            <li> It cleans and whitens without harsh abrasives or common chemical additives .  </li>
            <li> I received a small sample, and immediately after I tried it, I gave the sample to my daughter.</li>
            <li> and I do believe I can see a small difference already.</li>
            <li> Persistent, ugly coffee stains were nearly gone after just a few brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve been scolded for brushing my teeth too hard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit hard to get used to as it is not tooth-paste.  </li>
            <li> This may be an odd and weird product</li>
            <li> First off it looks really nasty</li>
            <li> I was using Rx sensitivity toothpaste, and it just seemed to be getting worse.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel weird.</li>
            <li> So, no more lengthy, painful, uncomfortable, and costly teeth whitening escapades (yeah!).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t taste or smell bad.</li>
            <li> The hygienist and the dentist were shocked by the transformation.</li>
            <li> , I have dental tarter bad, and this helps!  </li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Weird but !!!!  </li>
            <li> This is the worst product.  </li>

            <li> Smart Ash brought me back to the whitening world! For years I&#x27;ve been scolded for brushing my teeth too hard. This caused some of the enamel to gradually wear away on my teeth. Without that protection, my teeth became super sensitive and whiteners were no longer an option. This product gets the job done without the discomfort. I don&#x27;t have to worry about overuse and increased sensitivity. I already intend on giving this product as a gift! Not only is the product itself great, but the packaging was flawless too.</li>
            <li> This may be an odd and weird product but it really works. I really like the fact that it&#x27;s natural!</li>
            <li> I just received my first jar of Smart Ash today and immediately tore the box open because I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it!  I heard about it from a friend about a week or so and Googled it, and I was intrigued.  My first thought after using it was, I love how clean my teeth feel!  And after unsuccessful attempts with whitening strips, I&#x27;m hopeful to see some long-term results as far as the stains on my teeth from years of smoking and coffee drinking.  Thank you, Bedrock &amp; Bloom! :)</li>
            <li> Great product! I have been using this product with my girls and we all love it. We have also seen great improvement in our dental health, making our dentist proud.</li>
            <li> Interesting product. I&#x27;ve been using it once a day for about a month, and my teeth are definitely slightly less yellow (I am an inveterate tea-drinker, so the staining was noticeable). It does not work fast, but I am OK with that. My concern is that the more mainstream tooth whiteners ultimately damage or weaken tooth enamel, and I care more about that than about having white teeth! I don&#x27;t think this stuff will give you the blinding-white smile of a movie star, but my smile definitely looks brighter. Doesn&#x27;t taste like much and it&#x27;s fun to see your teeth turn black as you brush. Note that it will make your toothbrush look gross--but that&#x27;s the only down side I can think of.</li>
            <li> What a great thing! Who would have thought that by putting this weird black stuff on my toothbrush that my teeth would wind up feeling so much cleaner and whiter!? Can&#x27;t recommend it enough for that &amp;#34;just left the dentist&amp;#34; clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I saw a show recently with Dr Dubrow and Ru Paul and they were all brushing with the Charchol to whiten teeth  It is a natural whitener and great for sensitive teeth and your whole mouth. I ordered some Smart Ash, I wanted a quality natural product and we just love it. I bought it for myself and my kids and husband use it on a regular basis. You see and feel a difference right away. Both my teens had braces and I am not comfortable using a over the counter tooth whitener that is hard on tooth enamel.  They are thrilled with the results. All charchol products with be black when brushing but once you rinse the difference is amazing. I researched all similar products and Smart ash is a quality product and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I was initially in the hunt for organic toothpaste as I&#x27;m mindful of all the chemicals in toothpaste. I stumbled on this, and due to good reviews decided to purchase. Boy was I pleasantly surprised! I loved the packaging and the handwritten note was also a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;Lately I have been sad about my tea/coffee stains, but cannot withstand the grossness of teeth whiteners, plus they make my teeth severely sensitive for months. And the thought that I&#x27;m chipping away at my enamel in doing so also bothered me.&lt;br /&gt;SO, not only did this clean my teeth very well, but it also truly did WHITEN them!&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;ve used plain activated charcoal before, and it&#x27;s incredibly messy (sticks and won&#x27;t come off), however I found this formula easy to rise off.&lt;br /&gt;Another note: I have had a one sensitive tooth for a while now and this stuff within a matter of days took it completely away. I honestly didn&#x27;t believe the reviews completely upon reading them, but now I can attest to them.&lt;br /&gt;So now my husband and I have clean white teeth! And he usually prefers to stick to what he knows, however he&#x27;s been strictly using this since the results are that good.&lt;br /&gt;I hope they never stop making it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product from a friends recommendation, and I&#x27;m so happy I listened! The product was shipped promptly with a personalized hand written note thanking me for my purchase, which was a nice touch. After trying it the first time I was hooked! I immediately saw a difference in my whiteness and my teeth felt squeaky clean for much longer than they normally do! Before I started using the product I got some dental work done which cause my teeth to have severe sensitivity to cold and hot liquids. After using this product regularly I have noticed the sensitivity dissipating, although it is still there it has definitely lessened. Yes it is messy, but nothing a little tissue wipe can&#x27;t fix! I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to a traditional tooth routine! Keep up the good work!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using since I received it. It seem like it haven&#x27;t made much of a difference in whitening my teeth,. It is very messing and leave black marks all in the sink and around the counter top. I will keep using until it is gone to see if maybe over time it will make a difference in my teeth.</li>
            <li> Having never been a fan of whitening strips, I decided to try this after a friend recommended it.  I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but I&#x27;m very pleased with the results and will continue to use it.  If you&#x27;re considering this product, then go for it. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. We use it (my wife and I) everyday and it totally works. There&#x27;s a feeling of cleanliness that I get with Smart Ash that you just can&#x27;t get with other things like it.  The biggest bonus for me however is how it has helped with a tooth that I chipped a year or so ago. I don&#x27;t know how but if I&#x27;m having trouble with the pain from it, I use Smart Ash, the pain is gone within the hour and stays gone. It&#x27;s awesome and magic.   Try it! You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Who would have guessed this black as night product would work so well! Great Product and outstanding seller!</li>
            <li> My quest on finding the BEST teeth whitener and desensitizer has FINALLY come to an end now that I have discovered Bedrock and Bloom&#x27;s organic Smart Ash! I have been an avid tea drinker and smoker which has caused staining and yellowing of my teeth. Furthermore, I have very sensitive teeth to cold food/beverages. The whitening products I have used before made my teeth even more sensitive and were extremely time consuming and expensive. I noticed results the FIRST time I used Smart Ash (no joke) as my teeth were whiter and my mouth felt cleaner. Since I have started using this product, I constantly have people asking me what I use to make my teeth so white. I use the product every night before bed for 2 minutes and my teeth feel and look great. So, no more lengthy, painful, uncomfortable, and costly teeth whitening escapades (yeah!). The product was delivered very quickly in a unique box with instructions on how to use Smart Ash. Needless to say this product is AMAZING and I am so happy I came across it. It&#x27;s simple and effective! Thanks Smart Ash for meeting and exceeding my expectations!</li>
            <li> I tried this product after hearing great things about it.  It takes a while to get used to the texture when brushing, but right away my teeth felt very smooth and clean.  They started to have a brighter shine.  Don&#x27;t be afraid to give it a try.  I&#x27;ll plan to order more.</li>
            <li> Using this product for 3 weeks twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;I do an others see a big  difference.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic.  It&#x27;s a little messy, but well worth it and it cleans up really easily.  My teeth feel so clean and so smooth.  Even though I just bought it, I&#x27;ve used it about five times now and my teeth are really getting whiter, even in between teeth.  I&#x27;m a huge coffee drinker and every time I go to the dentist for a cleaning I&#x27;m advised to cut down on the coffee drinking.  Can&#x27;t wait until my next appointment.  My hygienist is going to be really impressed.  Love this product!!!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product! After just one use, my teeth felt smooth and &amp;#34;dentist clean.&amp;#34; I love the way my entire mouth feels fresh and super clean after each brush. I&#x27;ve been using Smart Ash for three weeks now, and in addition to leaving my teeth feeling phenomenal, they are at least two shades whiter. My teeth are super sensitive, and I have damaged enamel that has left my teeth looking less than great, which is something I&#x27;m very self conscious about. Because of this, peroxide and other chemical whitening products aren&#x27;t an option for me. Smart Ash has not only made my teeth whiter without any discomfort, but also improved the appearance of my enamel. I feel much more confident about my smile now, so I&#x27;ll be using Smart Ash as long as I can get my hands on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was really cool, too, and came with tips for use and a cute hand-written note. I know packaging doesn&#x27;t really matter in terms of product effectiveness, but I really like it when companies pay attention to those little details. If they care enough to design creative attractive packaging and hand-write a &amp;#34;thank you,&amp;#34; it makes me think they also care about the product I&#x27;m trusting my oral care with.</li>
            <li> Every time I use this I feel like I&#x27;ve just been to the dentist! My teeth are so smooth and my mouth feels fresh. It is a gradual change but my teeth do become brighter when I use this consistently.</li>
            <li> Excellent tooth cleaner.  I am a big fan of iced tea, blueberries and red wine. Smart Ash  cleared up the stains on my teeth in three days,  and my teeth are getting whiter.  I use this in the shower as it is black and if you drip you will stain the bath rug.&lt;br /&gt;I also appreciated the hand written note that came with Smart Ash.  They sent a small sample as well and I&#x27;m taking it with me on vacation.</li>
            <li> I have started using it, and it has a minty taste...it works!!! A little messy, but the convenient warning in the box was a godsend! With a little care this is really helpful for me, having Lymes, I have dental tarter bad, and this helps!  The lovely note with the product was a nice touch, and the tiny sampler with the product is great to have your friends try! All in all, exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Love this!  Getting stains off the cap on my tooth that even the dentist couldn&#x27;t remove with regular cleanings.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because it had so many great reviews. However, I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for 2 weeks and have noticed no whitening of my teeth.</li>
            <li> This is our family&#x27;s second batch and we love it.  We as a family think the teeth whitening is cool but honestly it&#x27;s the &amp;#34;Fresh back from the Dentist&amp;#34; feel of our teeth we like the most.  You kinda get addicted to how good your teeth feel.  It&#x27;s kinda crazy to hear my 13 year old asking for it...considering you can barely keep your kids brushing there teeth on a regular basis.  We will be buying it for years to come!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic! Mt teeth look better than ever!</li>
            <li> You need to try this! Talk about a really clean, fresh feeling. I have used this for only a short period of time and I see the difference. I recommend this to not only friends, but anyone who takes their oral hygiene seriously.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product once and can already see the difference, will be recommending this highly.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel &amp;#34;dentist clean&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s a bit hard to get used to as it is not tooth-paste.  It can be combined with a small dab of toothpaste if that helps.&lt;br /&gt;It is great stuff !!</li>
            <li> Seems to whiten teeth.  It&#x27;s black ash.  But amazingly, it does seem to whiten teeth.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I have few areas where my teeth overlap a little and they can be really difficult to get clean. This product along with my electric toothbrush give me a super clean teeth like I just got back from the dentist. My last two dentist visits the ladies cleaning my teeth have noted how well I have been taking care of my teeth and there was much less scraping done (less plaque build up &#x3D; less yellowing). My teeth have stayed whiter and resisted stains more since I started using this product. I also have very sensitive teeth and haven&#x27;t had any sensitivity issues with this product. It can be a little messy, but it wipes up easily. I really like to use this at night before bed and then swish some mouthwash around for a really clean mouth that lasts till I wake up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a whitener that wouldn&#x27;t cause sensitivity to my teeth and this product is IT!  My teeth whitened considerably in just the first week and continue to whiten with regular use.  What I also love about Smart Ash is that smooth feeling you get from a cleaning at the Dentist.  Where have you been Smart Ash?  I&#x27;m Hooked!</li>
            <li> I thought my wife was crazy when she first bought this, and here I am buying our second jar. It&#x27;s strange, but it works. Our sons think it&#x27;s hilarious and actually demand to use it (&amp;#34;PIRATE TEETH! PIRATE TEETH!&amp;#34;). We only let them use it in the bath, since they&#x27;d make a huge mess otherwise. It&#x27;s made for much more pleasant trips to the dentist for all of us.</li>
            <li> Interesting product, but I like it!  Definitely polishes your teeth!  Give it a try.</li>
            <li> Fantastic, all around!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The first thing I noticed was the amazing clean feeling.  Even though it says it does that, I didn&#x27;t expect that it would actually be so great - and I absolutely love that part of it!&lt;br /&gt;2. The whitening is good.  I don&#x27;t have &amp;#34;Hollywood white&amp;#34; teeth - but I am very happy with the results from Smart Ash.  I&#x27;ve used chemical based products before, and Smart Ash works better for me, without being damaging.&lt;br /&gt;3. It has completely eliminated my teeth sensitivity!  I&#x27;ve had sensitive teeth for years, and had to use sensitive toothpaste; but that only lessened the problem... it did not fix it.  Smart Ash has made sensitivity go away completely, and I have found that I only have to use it about once a week to continue getting that result.  I also don&#x27;t have to use sensitive toothpaste anymore.</li>
            <li> Bought this last week, absolutely love it!!!  No sensitivity at all....literally none.  I&#x27;ve been telling everyone about this product.  Love that it is all natural and organic.  Be careful it is a little messy. :)</li>
            <li> First off it looks really nasty but it doesn&#x27;t taste like anything and it really does work. My teeth look a lot cleaner and it&#x27;s great if you really don&#x27;t floss your Teeth because I  don&#x27;t n after using the product your teeth feel and look a lot cleaner especially in the cracks which is a big help for me because my teeth are stained I highly recommend this product even though it looks and sounds scary it&#x27;s really not I will be buying again and I gave my mom the sample that they sent to me and she also loves it.</li>
            <li> I purchased Smart Ash after a recommendation from a friend and I have to say that so far I&#x27;m super impressed! I am obsessive about having white teeth and already my teeth actually feel cleaner (if that&#x27;s possible) and smoother after using it. It&#x27;s definitely something to get used to but I&#x27;m loving my shinier teeth already.</li>
            <li> I have had my teeth professionally whitened and they looked great though it was a pricey and lengthy process so I was intrigued when I read about this product.  I couldn&#x27;t believe something that turned my teeth black (temporarily!) could make my teeth white, but I kid you not when I say I noticed a difference after the first use. Amazing.  I&#x27;m not afraid to smile again!  I also have to mention the fabulous packaging.  Love this product, and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!! My 8 yr old loves it and is now excited to spend time brushing without asking, &amp;#34;are the minutes up yet?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Smart Ash is amazing!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It is a little messy but no big deal cleans right up. I could tell a difference on day one. I have had 20 years of heavy tea and coffe drinking so my teeth were really stained. I have tried several other products and this one is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> Honestly I was not expecting to love this product.  It didn&#x27;t sound appealing ...black powder, a bit messy, etc. But after using it ONCE I was hooked!!!  It is not unpleasant in any way. It&#x27;s refreshing. Doesn&#x27;t taste or smell bad. Doesn&#x27;t feel weird. You don&#x27;t need to use much. I did get too much once and it felt a bit gritty and took me longer to rinse. But the directions are clear and I had just used too much. My daughter asked me the morning after my first use if I had used something to whitened my teeth because they looked so good.  I showed her how it worked that day and she was not interested in doing the black teeth thing (she&#x27;s 16 :-). But a couple days later she noticed  how good my teeth were looking and started using it too. She just got braces off and I can see a difference- her teeth look polished and naturally white.  I&#x27;m not talking abnormally bright white teeth.  That&#x27;s not what I was looking for. My goal is naturally white teeth with harmless ingredients and overall oral health. Smart Ash is now my favorite!!!  And yes, like many say, you feel &amp;#34;dentist clean&amp;#34; every time. I even wake up with fresher breath and I don&#x27;t have that morning &amp;#34;film&amp;#34;. I also have sensitivity issues and i haven&#x27;t had any problems while using Smart Ash.  Finally, and the only upsetting thing, I left yesterday for vacation and forgot to bring my Smart Ash!!  I&#x27;m so regretting it as I can tell now after using my old toothpaste that my mouth doesn&#x27;t feel as clean. Can&#x27;t wait to get back to using it daily!</li>
            <li> My husband and I both loved the &#x27;fresh from the dentist&#x27; feeling after using it, without having to actually see him! And we can also both see that are teeth are whiter with each use - definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> Amazing! Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I started using smart ash four days ago, when a friend gave me some of hers to try. I&#x27;ve already seen amazing results. My teeth are whiter than they&#x27;ve been in years. Also, my teeth have a really clean feeling all day long. I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of products including whitening strips and I&#x27;ve never had such great results.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! My teeth feel so good, just like after getting them cleaned at the dentist! I have only used it twice, I can&#x27;t wait to see if it whitens my teeth. Your sink does get black spots, but it cleans up nicely! I will definately reorder.</li>
            <li> Excellent cleaning action, quickly reduces stain.  If there is any negative, it is that it fills your mouth with black; however, that is easily washed away.  I&#x27;ve used about a half jar, and my teeth are noticeably whiter.  It does what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> Weird but !!!!  it has made my teeth whiter and my morning mouth and breath seem fresher and cleaner. I now brush my teeth in the laundry tub and only use this product at night because it does turn my thong gray for a bit of time. I am happy with the results and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> The stuff works! Persistent, ugly coffee stains were nearly gone after just a few brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s just hope it&#x27;s not slowly grinding my teeth away though, too! : )</li>
            <li> Great natural product. Great service.</li>
            <li> Once you get past the messy stuff and get your routine it is much easier to deal with. I noticed almost immediately the difference. Dont skip any minutes. 2 is perfect. Your teeth will feel like porclain all day even after eating. I will definately buy this again.</li>
            <li> First off, the packaging was fantastic! It was easy to open and it had a hand written note that gave it a personal touch. As well as the large container that I payed for it also came with a small sample to give to a friend or family member (genuinely great marketing strategy). I have not tried the product yet, but felt compelled to write a review. I will update my review once I&#x27;ve tried it out, up to this point it&#x27;s 5 stars!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. My teeth are whiter. They feel clean.</li>
            <li> This was a good find for me, so long review ahead. My teeth are super sensitive. I was using Rx sensitivity toothpaste, and it just seemed to be getting worse. I tried Smart Ash because I was desperate for something - anything - to make my teeth hurt less. I also wanted to do a little whitening, and my teeth are way too sensitive for strips. So I took a chance on this and am glad I did. My teeth have gotten both less sensitive and whiter since I started with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My procedure: I use this at night. I follow the directions included with the jar. (The directions themselves are rather funny - I always like a company with a sense of humor.) I wet my tooth brush and dip it in the powder. I brush my teeth with the powder for 2 minutes. I then actually leave it in my mouth for several minutes, swishing the charcoal/saliva slurry around my mouth (super attractive, right?) and pushing and pulling it through my front teeth. Then I spit it out and brush my teeth with water until I&#x27;m spitting out clean water. Then I floss to get any remaining charcoal out from between me teeth. I do always get a few flecks stuck at my gum line on certain teeth. They come right off when I brush with normal toothpaste (OTC sensitivity stuff now) in the morning. Brushing with my regular toothpaste also removes all traces of black from my toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mess: I wouldn&#x27;t let the mess factor be a deterrent. I kind of get a kick out of the black stuff in my mouth. It can get everywhere, though, so here&#x27;s what I do to mitigate that. 1. Place the jar on a couple squares of toilet paper before opening it. After closing it, give the jar a quick wipe and toss the tp in the bowl for the next time I flush. 2. Keep my mouth as closed as possible when brushing. 3. Turn my power brush both on and off only when it is in my mouth. 4. Spit close to the drain with the water running. 5. Keep a magic eraser-type sponge convenient and use it to wipe the charcoal out of the sink and off the counter as soon as I&#x27;m done. It cleans the mess right up, only takes a few seconds, and no extra waste or cleaning products. Easy-peasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Et voila. Enjoy your Charcoal Smile.er as soon as I&#x27;m done. It cleans the mess right up, only takes a few seconds, and no extra waste or cleaning products. Easy-peasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Et voila. Enjoy your Charcoal Smile.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed whiter teeth but I think it&#x27;s something that takes time of course so be patient. I use it at night before bed and regular toothpaste in the mornings. Even though I haven&#x27;t noticed whiter teeth I have noticed that my mouth feels so much more clean when I use this. If I don&#x27;t use it for some reason I notice the next morning. It&#x27;s helped a lot with plaque too! Even if it doesn&#x27;t immediately whiten your teeth it benefits them so much it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> This is the worst product.  It doesn&#x27;t Whitten ur teeth at all. Want my money back</li>
            <li> Black powder sticks on my teeth..do you know why some awful product has so many 5stars?? Many amazon sellers leaves positive reviews  on their own. I totally guess/ pretty sure that these five stars has the problem. This product is totally waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;It does not blend with water and stays between gumand teeth.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel and look better after using this product. Went to the dentist and they said my teeth looked great too, would recommend.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. I originally purchased it after my 2 year old son began developing this mysterious brown staining on his teeth. After consulting Dr. Google I suspected he had dental fluorosis, I was pretty panicked because his teeth were borderline brown!! It was a long shot but I tried this on his teeth. After 5 days, I can say his teeth are already 80% better!! I&#x27;ve also been using it on myself and my 6 year old. This stuff is AMAZING!! My teeth are so clean and about 2 shades whiter. I love this stuff, I am a loyal customer!!</li>
            <li> love it! :-)  The product is all natural, cruelty free, and it&#x27;s nutrition for your teeth.  Whitens and cleans and detoxifies and it is actually good for you - unlike chemicals and bleach.  The company if family owned and they truly care about your experience.  So good to know that people and a great company like this exists.</li>
            <li> First I want to say that this company gave me a free sample and sent a thank-you note for trying their &amp;#34;strange&amp;#34; product.  :)  I had already tried and loved their tooth whitener.  I&#x27;m not as adventurous as they thought!  But this whitener works great, can remove stubborn stains as good as any dental hygienist/regular checkup, in my experience; and while you are warned to be careful not to stain your clothes, as clumsy as I am, I haven&#x27;t had a spill yet.</li>
            <li> This product was delivered on time.  I have not had time to use this for more than a couple days, but so far it seems to do a good job.</li>
            <li> I am scared beyond all rational thought processes to go the dentist. I don&#x27;t remember ever being remotely comfortable and I have always felt significant pain and sensitivity. For me to go for a cleaning, I must take a Xanax, and I get both nitrous and topical anesthetic and it is still excruciating. In fact, two years ago, I had a full blown panic attack in the chair and my husband had to leave work and come get me. Three months ago I started brushing my teeth with Smart Ash. Well, I have just returned from the dentist and for the first time in 45 years, I had no pain, no sensitivity, and I was able to sit in the chair without pain and that means no anxiety. I am elated. The hygienist and the dentist were shocked by the transformation. And the only thing I&#x27;m doing differently is brushing with Smart Ash. Seriously, I want to rep your product because I am so impressed. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Love the healthy alternative, but I need to brush extremely carefully to avoid black marks all over bathroom.</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh!  I have been using my Smart Ash every day since it arrived this past week.  The coffee stains on my bottom front teeth have disappeared and all my teeth are whiter. I love this feeling of &amp;#34;dentist clean.&amp;#34;  I would not have believed that this black powder could do this if I had not witnessed it first hand.  This ash is indeed SMART and I am a believer !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week and my teeth are already looking whiter. My teeth didn&#x27;t even feel sensitive at all. Definitely will stock up on this. I&#x27;m amazed.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Not only did it significantly whiten my teeth, but my kids also love it and we use it as part of an oral health regimen. It whitens their teeth, and it also helps scrub away plaque and remineralize. Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase. I am OCD about my teeth being clean. It has not only given me whiter teeth but my teeth feel smooth. Make sure you use it in the shower unless you want to clean up the sink constantly. Was at my dentist office a couple of days ago for a cleaning and the dental hygienist complimented my oral hygiene and stated she couldn&#x27;t find anything. Best purchase I ever made for my teeth.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff!! Although I&#x27;ve just begun to use, it gives my mouth a good feeling. I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan</li>
            <li> This tooth maintenance powder works great for me.  It cleans and whitens without harsh abrasives or common chemical additives .  It leaves my mouth with a &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; taste.  Brushing requires a bit of getting used to, but I have now mastered getting the powder to stay where I want it and go where I want it  after  finishing my brushing and rinsing.  I will keep buying.</li>
            <li> Best product like it on the market...I&#x27;ve tried many different ones and this one works like no others. I highly recommend you try it for cleaner and whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hands down BEST natural product I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  Feels great, no nasty taste like many whiteners!</li>
            <li> I got my order so fast, and I love the product!  I received a small sample, and immediately after I tried it, I gave the sample to my daughter. My teeth felt very clean, and they looked whiter. Nice packaging, all around great experience with Bedrock &amp; Bloom! I love this strange product:), I will definitely order from this seller again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few days but my teeth feel great and I do believe I can see a small difference already. There really isn&#x27;t a taste so it&#x27;s not bad at all even though it sure is weird to be brushing with black stuff. The packaging was great and there was a hand written, personalized note included which was a very pleasant surprise (also included a small sample to pass along to a friend.) I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing how my teeth look after more use.  UPDATE- Its been a few more days and now I definitely see a difference in my teeth. They really are getting whiter!</li>
            <li> Tried this product for the first time and it really worked well. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to whiten and strengthen your teeth.</li>
