            <li> Arrived perfect and in timely manner! Will order again!</li>
            <li> Amazing ! I have have tried her others and they are all good as well! I get compliments all the time!</li>
            <li> My brother actually bought this for himself, but I&#x27;m reviewing it because I just love the smell so much.  We couldn&#x27;t find this particular scent in local stores, so Amazon to the rescue!  My brother has been home visiting at my mother&#x27;s house, where my son stays during the work day hours and when I would come pick him up, he always smelled so fresh.  It turns out my brother was giving him a quick spritz in the morning.  I love the freshness of this scent, it lasts all day and it isn&#x27;t over powering.  I wouldn&#x27;t notice it until I would hug my son in the evening.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome  perfume</li>
            <li> Very light perfume and smell doesn&#x27;t stick at all. I liked Pure Blanc so much but not satisfied with this one. Don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Overall.... This cologne is unbeatable for the price and smell!!! The smell is extremely fresh and is a clean smell that lasts the whole day!</li>
            <li> This product came on time and smells like the real deal could not be happier i always thought buying off amazon would not be a good idea but this one is perfect</li>
            <li> Great product and the same item that a department store wanted $50 for</li>
            <li> Bought Pure Blanc because I smelled it on a friend and I&#x27;ve never looked back since! Pure Blue is just as awesome as Blanc and I get compliments on it all the time. The price is the best on Amazon and delivery was fast like always.</li>
            <li> Very good quality for the price you pay. Well worth every penny that you invest. And the smell is unique.</li>
            <li> it smell very nice, I brought it for my grandsons and nephew. The price was also very low. will buy again.</li>
            <li> It is appropriate for men due to it&#x27;s attractive smell which stays in your clothes all day long. It&#x27;s also cheap !</li>
            <li> Smells nice for a cheapy. Me like it .</li>
            <li> It works for me and my taste.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Doesn&#x27;t upset my allergies.</li>
            <li> I really like the fresh smell. The leaky sprayer and loose packaging makes me wonder if it&#x27;s a knockoff. It also seems to wear off after a few hours. I still use it but the problems mentioned above and oddly low price makes me question its authenticity.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really  gud I been using it 4 a wile  now</li>
