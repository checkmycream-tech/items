    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Thank you Exederm for a great product!</li>
            <li>Mustella seemed to be working the best, but then eventually irritated his eczema.</li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t made to be the perfect intensive hydrating formula.</li>
            <li>Go to their websites and determine what best fits your baby&#x27;s needs (or yours).</li>
            <li>Great products !!!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
            <li>There are no perfumes added which is great for my son who also has asthma.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s great, but this product wasn&#x27;t made to be the #1 moisturizer</li>
            <li>A great product at a great price as well!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had great service getting my questions answered from their service dept, actually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And so did his mother, our son, one of our grandsons and a great grandson.  </li>
            <li>This product is surprisingly amazing!  </li>
            <li>We still think it&#x27;s the best ever and are so pleased to see the product has expanded to include use for children.  </li>
            <li>reviewers and people will say this product doesn&#x27;t moisturize, it doesn&#x27;t feel good</li>
            <li>Maybe good for soom people but</li>
            <li>and we think you&#x27;ll be very pleased.</li>
            <li>Love it, purchased it twice!</li>
            <li>I love how creamy and nice this product goes on my skin!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>amazing how it has helped control the flair-ups that I was having every 8 or so days.  </li>
            <li>AMAZING....</li>
            <li>to read what they are all about and then make your own judgmental decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used three products from this line, and this moisture cream can very easily be used on its own.  </li>
            <li>It is very nicely absorbed into the skin and has done a great job in helping my skin heal.  </li>
            <li>However, for this product I will make an exception since I am overwhelmingly satisfied with the outcome and company.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really love it, its helped us a lot.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many many creams and lotions for eczema</li>
            <li>like the lotion better than the cream.</li>
            <li>My husband suffered from eczema for many years.  </li>
            <li>it smelled like motor oil and was very greasy and irritated my skin even more!!</li>
            <li>The consistency is thinner than I would have liked, but I thought it seemed worth a try after all I read about it.</li>
            <li>this product I also was able to find it locally which is great .</li>
            <li>At first I thought I liked this product.</li>
            <li>After investing all my free time into finding the cause I was eventually came across Exederm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted to try a SLS (sodium laurel sulfate) free product and</li>
            <li>Very nice, fast absorbing.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li>This particular moisturizer I use on the effective area after I shower.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been struggling for four months now and finally found a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not the miracle cream I was searching for, but definitely not a bad product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cream every night before bedtime and it has helped tremendously.  </li>
            <li>I generally don&#x27;t take the time to write a review for any products, even products that I genuinely love.</li>
            <li>I then researched the National Eczema Associations website and began to find better products which were Aveno extensive care, Cetaphyl, and Mustella.  </li>
            <li>literally could see an immediate difference within the first two days.</li>
            <li>Exederm uses higher standards to formulate this cream, which seems to make it geared for people with eczema.</li>
            <li>When I first put it on, it stung.</li>
            <li>I have an skin irritation and sensitity that hasn&#x27;t been diagnosed after many visits to 4 different dermatologists.  </li>
            <li>I have several exederm products and love all of them.  </li>
            <li>I suppose this is good for sensitive skin (extreme eczema)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m certain there is a genetic component.  </li>
            <li>this cream didn&#x27;t really work for me</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Might be OK for adults, but definitely not babies with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>We first assumed it was an obvious food allergy that was causing his skin to break out, but after several stressful-waited formula trials; we were able to find a miracle in a can, Neocate, this hypo-allergenic milk that worked.</li>
            <li>His skin was so much better that he began using the other products in the line, the shampoo, conditioner and body wash.  </li>
            <li>I like the fact that this is a very basic cream without all of the chemicals most larger companies add to their creams.  </li>
            <li>and it is creamy and fast absorbing and makes my skin feel soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone, even if you don&#x27;t have eczema you can</li>
            <li>Do your own research, simply look at the ingredients and you&#x27;ll see what all these other products contain.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and this product does not irritate and really does moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and although the ingredients are the same and just different amounts of certain ingredients to alter the texture of the product, but overall the lotion is a better option for me.  </li>
            <li>My only wish is that Exederm would make available a larger tub cream for purchase.  </li>
            <li>This product is a life saver to me, I have very very sensitive skin and get an intolerant reaction to almost all the moisturizers</li>
            <li>the consistency is not very thick</li>
            <li>occasionally the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hadn&#x27;t ever been able to find a product that gives me as little reaction as this one does.  </li>
            <li>This product has worked great for me, and I have crazy sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING under the sun to help clear it up.</li>
            <li>If her skin is clear, and she doesn&#x27;t come in contact with any irritants, this product would help maintain the &amp;#34;clearness&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite surprised to read about this product burning someone&#x27;s skin.  </li>
            <li>I have accidentally swiped my eyes twice with my hand when the cream was on it (also have sensitive eyes)</li>
            <li>It has made the peeling completely stop in just 4-5 days.  </li>
            <li>I have had eczema on my hands - off and on - for 70 years and have tried everything including all of the so-called sensitive skin products in the drug stores and Walmart and Target.  </li>
            <li>it has helped my face and skin finally feel and look normal again!  </li>
            <li>this worked great, so it must have been the SLS in the other creams that was irritating her skin.</li>
            <li>This product was made specifically and only to cater to those who suffer from Eczema, allergies,  dermatitis, sensitive skin, or those who simply don&#x27;t want to apply a whole pile of C*ap on their skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We have literally tried nearly everything on the market and most creams and ointments are difficult for my sons to tolerate as they either cause pain or are very greasy.  </li>
            <li>My constant rash has calmed down since using it daily, and when I don&#x27;t use it my skin I can easily tell.</li>
            <li>it to moisturize your skin without worry of a bad reaction from the chemicals in most products available today.</li>
            <li>And keep in mind the products that have the baby label are the exact same as the regular ones--the label is for marketing purposes---baby product shoppers won&#x27;t trust a regular product and adults often won&#x27;t shop in the baby section for products that could possibly work for them.  </li>
            <li>Every kind of lotion for sensitive skin only made it worse!  </li>
            <li>Neocate is literally one of the most broken down baby formulas you can buy and not to mention very pricey.</li>
            <li>I will admit there was a slight burning sensation the first several days of using this lotion, but that has gone away too.  </li>
            <li>I researched potential creams for my two sons who have suffered from severe to profound eczema for the last seven years.  </li>
            <li>Its rich texture goes a long way in small amounts, and it isn&#x27;t greasy or sticky at all.  </li>

            <li> Its rich texture goes a long way in small amounts, and it isn&#x27;t greasy or sticky at all.  </li>
            <li> The oils are great for my acne breakouts though--my skin is difficult to say the least (extremely oily, acne prone and now eczema).  </li>
            <li> me start off by saying my son is currently five months old and for the past three months he&#x27;s had severe eczema.</li>
            <li> It took several tries to work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use to watch long term results.</li>
            <li> We moved to the beach and the added moisture in the air helped him, so we decided to venture back to other products.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it to anyone who has has dealt with extremely dry and cracked skin.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, it is moisturizing without being too greasy or wet.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that truly works is a prescription steroid cream which can&#x27;t be used everyday.</li>
            <li> my lifelong eczema problem.</li>
            <li> Within a week of using this I am completely healed and no more skin problems!  </li>
            <li> Until I broke down and purchased this, I was using a blend of essential oils and a thick moisturizer with essential oils in it--they helped some, but didn&#x27;t make it stop.  </li>
            <li> A little dab seems to go a long way.</li>
            <li> I read the ingredients and saw that it contained Almond oil along with some other oils in there that can irritate eczema.</li>
            <li> I believe it was brought on by an extremely stressful life event, as I&#x27;ve never had this problem before, and I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Anything else I tried previous (eucerin, aquaphor) was only making the eczema worse.   </li>
            <li> The National Eczema Association had this cream on their website as one of the few creams they endorse.  </li>
            <li> I have been using exederm for a few months now on my daughter with moderate/severe eczema.  </li>
            <li> It definitely didn&#x27;t make things worse.</li>
            <li> Try it, give it a few days</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s NOT super thick and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes along way so even though it a small jar</li>
            <li> Her eczema is far worse than before, sadly.</li>
            <li> Not suitable for face and not as hypoallergenic as they state.</li>
            <li> I have been battling eczema on my face and neck for at least the past 6 months.  </li>
            <li> His skin stopped inflating and slowly began to get lighter and lighter.</li>
            <li> At this point I had enough and immediately began to research eczema like a mad man.</li>
            <li> , it goes on weird, it has a weird consistency, and all of the above.</li>
            <li> Not a good idea...</li>
            <li> He was miserable and constantly itching and crying.</li>
            <li> All these products contained some sort of oil, fragrance, or chemical that was harmful to my poor son&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> That was approximately six years ago.  </li>
            <li> and she has broken out in hives.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been disappointed by Johnson&#x27;s, Aveno, Aquaphor, and every other company out there.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The dreadful and much hated eczema randomly began to populate the back of his thighs, both arms, cheeks, and the back of his ears.</li>

            <li> this cream didn&#x27;t really work for me the consistency is not very thick and I have a severe case of eczema it may work for someone who does not have a severe case of it</li>
            <li> I researched potential creams for my two sons who have suffered from severe to profound eczema for the last seven years.  The National Eczema Association had this cream on their website as one of the few creams they endorse.  It was rated as a five star cream.  Given that I decided to give the cream a try.  We have literally tried nearly everything on the market and most creams and ointments are difficult for my sons to tolerate as they either cause pain or are very greasy.  This is the one cream that does not cause further irritation to their already open and irritated skin.  Additionally, it is moisturizing without being too greasy or wet.  I like the fact that this is a very basic cream without all of the chemicals most larger companies add to their creams.  There are no perfumes added which is great for my son who also has asthma.  My only wish is that Exederm would make available a larger tub cream for purchase.  Thank you Exederm for a great product!</li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t take the time to write a review for any products, even products that I genuinely love. However, for this product I will make an exception since I am overwhelmingly satisfied with the outcome and company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me start off by saying my son is currently five months old and for the past three months he&#x27;s had severe eczema. We first assumed it was an obvious food allergy that was causing his skin to break out, but after several stressful-waited formula trials; we were able to find a miracle in a can, Neocate, this hypo-allergenic milk that worked. Neocate is literally one of the most broken down baby formulas you can buy and not to mention very pricey. So you could imagine my stress once my son&#x27;s eczema began to resurface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dreadful and much hated eczema randomly began to populate the back of his thighs, both arms, cheeks, and the back of his ears. He was miserable and constantly itching and crying. At this point I had enough and immediately began to research eczema like a mad man. After investing all my free time into finding the cause I was eventually came across Exederm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;ve tried every moisturizer, cream, oil, soap, shampoo, intensive moisturizer, and even ointment&#x27;s just to be upset over and over again. I&#x27;ve been disappointed by Johnson&#x27;s, Aveno, Aquaphor, and every other company out there. All these products contained some sort of oil, fragrance, or chemical that was harmful to my poor son&#x27;s skin. I then researched the National Eczema Associations website and began to find better products which were Aveno extensive care, Cetaphyl, and Mustella.  They all contained some sort of potentially harmful ingredient or irritant. Mustella seemed to be working the best, but then eventually irritated his eczema. I read the ingredients and saw that it contained Almond oil along with some other oils in there that can irritate eczema. I immediately stopped using Mustella (Which scored a 5/5 on the NEA website) and decidedto try the last product from the national Eczema association to score a 5/5, Exederm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I literally could see an immediate difference within the first two days. His skin stopped inflating and slowly began to get lighter and lighter. I&#x27;ve been applying the cream, using the soap, and using the bath oil. Within two weeks his eczema was almost non-existent. I&#x27;ve been struggling for four months now and finally found a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers and people will say this product doesn&#x27;t moisturize, it doesn&#x27;t feel good, it goes on weird, it has a weird consistency, and all of the above. That&#x27;s great, but this product wasn&#x27;t made to be the #1 moisturizer and it wasn&#x27;t made to be the perfect intensive hydrating formula. This product was made specifically and only to cater to those who suffer from Eczema, allergies,  dermatitis, sensitive skin, or those who simply don&#x27;t want to apply a whole pile of C*ap on their skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I can&#x27;t speak for everyone, but I can say for us this company has been a miracle. Do your own research, simply look at the ingredients and you&#x27;ll see what all these other products contain. Go to their websites and determine what best fits your baby&#x27;s needs (or yours). Visit, Exederm. com or the National Eczema Association to read what they are all about and then make your own judgmental decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have read this and you are a parent going through the same heart ache that I endured; TRY THIS PRODUCT OUT NOW! I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using exederm for a few months now on my daughter with moderate/severe eczema.  Anything else I tried previous (eucerin, aquaphor) was only making the eczema worse.   I wanted to try a SLS (sodium laurel sulfate) free product and this worked great, so it must have been the SLS in the other creams that was irritating her skin. Its also not greasy and unscented.  I really love it, its helped us a lot.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son, but he felt a burning sensation when applied.  Needless to say,  we stopped using the product.</li>
            <li> This product wasn&#x27;t ultra hypollergenic for my baby. Everywhere I applied the cream her skin turned red. Not suitable for face and not as hypoallergenic as they state. Might be OK for adults, but definitely not babies with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Love it. After once use you can tell the difference! Really deep moisturising!  I use it at night. Love it, purchased it twice!</li>
            <li> I have used three products from this line, and this moisture cream can very easily be used on its own.  Its rich texture goes a long way in small amounts, and it isn&#x27;t greasy or sticky at all.  It is very nicely absorbed into the skin and has done a great job in helping my skin heal.  Exederm uses higher standards to formulate this cream, which seems to make it geared for people with eczema.</li>
            <li> I love how creamy and nice this product goes on my skin! I have extremely sensitive skin and this product does not irritate and really does moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use it!  A great product at a great price as well!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!!</li>
            <li> This is the only cream after trying everything under the sun that would give me relief from a severe case of dermatis I had on my hands and feet. It actually moisturized .kept me sane while outside running errands and I didn&#x27;t have to wear cotton gloves while out luv this product I also was able to find it locally which is great . A small amount goes along way so even though it a small jar it should last quite a bit .</li>
            <li> *WARNING*  this product burned both my son and I.    When I tried to contact their customer service at their location in Basking Ridge, NJ (973) 615-1739 no one answered after repeated calls after 9:30 on a Tuesday morning and no one returned my calls.      I&#x27;ve used many many creams and lotions for eczema and I have NEVER had any sort of reaction like this.  There must be something wrong here.  It literally is still burning after I washed myself and my son off.    WORST EXPERIENCE EVER</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite surprised to read about this product burning someone&#x27;s skin.  This product has worked great for me, and I have crazy sensitive skin.  I have accidentally swiped my eyes twice with my hand when the cream was on it (also have sensitive eyes) and I didn&#x27;t have burning in my eye whatsoever.  I was shocked about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the lotion better than the cream. and although the ingredients are the same and just different amounts of certain ingredients to alter the texture of the product, but overall the lotion is a better option for me.  And keep in mind the products that have the baby label are the exact same as the regular ones--the label is for marketing purposes---baby product shoppers won&#x27;t trust a regular product and adults often won&#x27;t shop in the baby section for products that could possibly work for them.  I had great service getting my questions answered from their service dept, actually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the lotion and wash, and occasionally the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hadn&#x27;t ever been able to find a product that gives me as little reaction as this one does.  I love this!</li>
            <li> Was not impressed with this product at all! it smelled like motor oil and was very greasy and irritated my skin even more!! Maybe good for soom people but not me I will not purchase it ever again!!Thanks j Elliott</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a moisture cream....amazing how it has helped control the flair-ups that I was having every 8 or so days.  AMAZING....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had eczema since birth and I had a troublesome spot in the middle of my palm that would not go away even with the use of topical steroid creams.  I&#x27;ve been using this cream every night before bedtime and it has helped tremendously.  I recommend it to anyone who has has dealt with extremely dry and cracked skin.  No burning sensation whatsoever!</li>
            <li> I have been battling eczema on my face and neck for at least the past 6 months.  I believe it was brought on by an extremely stressful life event, as I&#x27;ve never had this problem before, and I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s.  It&#x27;s been truly a battle and so embarrassing.  My face would itch and peel off weekly.  Until I broke down and purchased this, I was using a blend of essential oils and a thick moisturizer with essential oils in it--they helped some, but didn&#x27;t make it stop.  The oils are great for my acne breakouts though--my skin is difficult to say the least (extremely oily, acne prone and now eczema).  I refused to use prescription steroids on my face!  This product is surprisingly amazing!  I put this on my face every morning and night, after cleansing, toning and using my coconut oil and essential oils blend.  It has made the peeling completely stop in just 4-5 days.  I will admit there was a slight burning sensation the first several days of using this lotion, but that has gone away too.  I think it was just because my skin was inflamed.  It has taken away the scaly feeling on my neck too (from dryness and flare-ups).  I cannot go without this now...it has helped my face and skin finally feel and look normal again!  Highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> I have had eczema on my hands - off and on - for 70 years and have tried everything including all of the so-called sensitive skin products in the drug stores and Walmart and Target.  Nothing worked until I found the exederm products earlier this year.  I use the Intensive Moisture Cream on my face and my hands and it is creamy and fast absorbing and makes my skin feel soft and moisturized.  I also use the Exederm shampoo and conditioner and the itching on my scalp has stopped.  Great products !!!</li>
            <li> My daughter has suffered from eczema from day one. I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING under the sun to help clear it up. The only thing that truly works is a prescription steroid cream which can&#x27;t be used everyday. This product was recommended to me by a relative. It didn&#x27;t cause my daughter to break out like a lot of products. It definitely didn&#x27;t make things worse. However, it didn&#x27;t get RID of her eczema flare up- which is what I was hoping it would do. If her skin is clear, and she doesn&#x27;t come in contact with any irritants, this product would help maintain the &amp;#34;clearness&amp;#34;. Not the miracle cream I was searching for, but definitely not a bad product.</li>
            <li> This product is a life saver to me, I have very very sensitive skin and get an intolerant reaction to almost all the moisturizers&lt;br /&gt;available in the drug store marketplace. I can put the Exederm on with total impunity, it moistures my skin and helps me live&lt;br /&gt;with my lifelong eczema problem. I would highly recommend this product to anyone, even if you don&#x27;t have eczema you can&lt;br /&gt;us it to moisturize your skin without worry of a bad reaction from the chemicals in most products available today.</li>
            <li> I suppose this is good for sensitive skin (extreme eczema) but it&#x27;s NOT super thick and moisturizing. DISAPPOINTED</li>
            <li> When I first put it on, it stung. It took several tries to work.</li>
            <li> My husband suffered from eczema for many years.  And so did his mother, our son, one of our grandsons and a great grandson.  I&#x27;m certain there is a genetic component.  We had been to our PCP and dermatologist several times.  Living in the MidWest winters was so uncomfortable for my husband.  He found exederm in an online search and we tried it.  That was approximately six years ago.  His skin was so much better that he began using the other products in the line, the shampoo, conditioner and body wash.  We moved to the beach and the added moisture in the air helped him, so we decided to venture back to other products.  Not a good idea... symptoms returned.  Back to exederm, with no additives and symptoms resolved.  I recommended the product to callers when offering tele-health nursing.  We gave jars of the cream to friends or acquaintances with similar symptoms.  We shared the product with our family.  We are back in the MidWest now and continue to use the product.  We still think it&#x27;s the best ever and are so pleased to see the product has expanded to include use for children.  Try it, give it a few days and we think you&#x27;ll be very pleased.</li>
            <li> Very nice, fast absorbing. It seems to leave a shield over my skin and does not cause itching. A little dab seems to go a long way. I&#x27;ll continue to use to watch long term results. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> At first I thought I liked this product. The consistency is thinner than I would have liked, but I thought it seemed worth a try after all I read about it. Well, I have used it on my daughter for a week and she has broken out in hives. Her eczema is far worse than before, sadly. Back to the drawing board!</li>
            <li> I have an skin irritation and sensitity that hasn&#x27;t been diagnosed after many visits to 4 different dermatologists.  I&#x27;ve found products that help it through trial and error, and this line of products by exederm has been such a god-send.  I have several exederm products and love all of them.  This particular moisturizer I use on the effective area after I shower.  It sinks in well, leaving my skin both soft and non-irritated.  My constant rash has calmed down since using it daily, and when I don&#x27;t use it my skin I can easily tell.</li>
            <li> Have had problems with arms getting itchy and bleeding for years!  Every kind of lotion for sensitive skin only made it worse!  Within a week of using this I am completely healed and no more skin problems!  LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
