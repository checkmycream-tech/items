            <li>This is the best silver-enhancing product for gray hair that I&#x27;ve ever seen or used.  </li>
            <li>excellent for beautiful silver hair</li>
            <li>A good buy.</li>
            <li>Pantene Pro-V Silver Expressions Conditioner is every bit as good.  </li>
            <li>Good for belt gray hair.</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>Hair feels nice.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair with nice sheen and some body</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly along with the matching shampoo (separately), I have used it once and had great results.  </li>
            <li>With Pantene Pro-V, I&#x27;ve come to really enjoying being 50-60% gray - now silver..</li>
            <li>I have white gray hair and this keeps my hair beautiful</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s purple which does a great job turning my grey hair silver!</li>
            <li>This is a light bodied conditioner that does not weigh your hair down but is smooths and shines your gray hair very nicely.</li>
            <li>Make sure to get the  Pro-V; it works so much better than the regular Pantene Silver Expressions Conditioner.  </li>
            <li>This too is okay and have used it for years, I have white hair and am glad they came out with a conditioner.</li>
            <li>My dull grays have become such a beautiful bright silver that I&#x27;m complimented on all the time.  </li>
            <li>Hair has a much softer texture now.</li>
            <li>I have gray hair, and this conditioner perked up the color and made my hair  very manageable.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>and I feel it keeps my hair very manageable.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!  </li>
            <li>Glad there is such a product for my very WHITE hair!</li>
            <li>the normal time between hair washing has given me the maximum benefit.  </li>
            <li>This is a great, well-priced silver enhancer (especially compared to the competition); if you use it every other day and have short to medium length hair, I believe that it can last six to ten weeks.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not necessary to use it daily to get its full benefit - using it every other day -</li>
            <li>A little more expensive, but well worth it.  </li>

            <li> totally need this product</li>
            <li> Have ordered it before. It gives grey hair a little shine. I would encourage anyone with grey silvery hair to purchase this conditioner.</li>
            <li> excellent for beautiful silver hair</li>

            <li> Took away the &amp;#34;dingy&amp;#34; yellow in my hair color</li>
            <li> This is the best silver-enhancing product for gray hair that I&#x27;ve ever seen or used.  Before this, I used a much more expensive product (approximately $30 with tax)  and Pantene Pro-V Silver Expressions Conditioner is every bit as good.  I had heard about this  (the Pantene Pro-V  Silver Expressions Conditioner and had looked for it in every retail establishment that carried hair products within 20 miles of my home - NOBODY sells it.  The only place I could find it was through Amazon, where it is stocked regularly.  Make sure to get the  Pro-V; it works so much better than the regular Pantene Silver Expressions Conditioner.  A little more expensive, but well worth it.  The name  Pantene Pro-V . . . Daily Color-Enhancing Conditioner is misleading.  It&#x27;s not necessary to use it daily to get its full benefit - using it every other day - the normal time between hair washing has given me the maximum benefit.  This is a great, well-priced silver enhancer (especially compared to the competition); if you use it every other day and have short to medium length hair, I believe that it can last six to ten weeks.  My dull grays have become such a beautiful bright silver that I&#x27;m complimented on all the time.  With Pantene Pro-V, I&#x27;ve come to really enjoying being 50-60% gray - now silver..</li>
            <li> This too is okay and have used it for years, I have white hair and am glad they came out with a conditioner.</li>
            <li> Who thought that there would be a silver conditioner for silver hair!</li>
            <li> I love this! It&#x27;s purple which does a great job turning my grey hair silver! It looks striking now, instead of boring!</li>
            <li> This product works! I have white gray hair and this keeps my hair beautiful no yellowing and I feel it keeps my hair very manageable. Highly recommend!  I receive compliments all the time on my hair!</li>
            <li> like this product. Leaves my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> Good for belt gray hair.</li>
