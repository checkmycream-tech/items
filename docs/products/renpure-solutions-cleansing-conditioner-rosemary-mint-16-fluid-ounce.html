            <li>I&#x27;m SO happy I tried this bc</li>
            <li>It smells great.</li>

            <li>These products are great.</li>

            <li>and it is a great value.</li>
            <li>It smells great and leaves my hair in great shape.</li>

            <li>Great stuff, save a ton of money compared to the brand name you see on infomercials.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as great as WEN</li>
            <li>great substitute for the wen products.</li>
            <li>This makes my hair so happy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great price</li>
            <li>She tried the Lavender cleansing conditioner after her attempt with the mint one IS happy with that one.</li>
            <li>Great</li>
            <li>of the products that I&#x27;d been using and had been happy with worked anymore.</li>
            <li>Happily, I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Did nothing for my hair and didn&#x27;t smell great either.</li>
            <li>But yeah, I&#x27;m definitely happy with this stuff, and will buy again.</li>
            <li>She thinks this shampoo is just great.</li>
            <li>My hair felt great, but a lot of it fell out.</li>
            <li>Not that I am complaining, I was happy to get rid of it.</li>
            <li>Not that I am complaining, I was happy to get rid of it.</li>
            <li>Win win.</li>
            <li>and it looks great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d choose the RenPure over Wen based on how great my hair looks AND the added bonus is</li>
            <li>Great product, I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>But renpure is great</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>so great.</li>
            <li>This product may be great for some hair types, but for me it was not.  </li>
            <li>I, also at times, use their Argon Luxurious Shampoo and Conditioner and equally love them!!</li>
            <li>You will ABSOLUTELY LOVE this product!!</li>
            <li>Amazing product!</li>
            <li>They both smell nice, however!)</li>
            <li>This shampoo is the best solution that we have been able to find for her.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I switched to this product along with Nexus Pro Mend, Split End Binding!!! :)</li>
            <li>Use at your own risk!</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant.</li>
            <li>My curls for perfectly clump together, and easy to detangle.</li>
            <li>This really is an amazing product, and I&#x27;ve had great results with it.  </li>
            <li>I read it isn&#x27;t so great for some people, but it works great for me :)</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a good quality (but affordable) cleansing conditioner, skip this brand and check out L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s EverCreme and EverCurl cleansing conditioners.</li>
            <li>This works surprisingly well.</li>
            <li>Good luck</li>
            <li>my hair felt like it needed a good cleansing.</li>
            <li>And they were really good for drug store/department store products.</li>
            <li>it was supposedly &amp;#34;on sale&amp;#34; so this is definitely a good price.</li>
            <li>good price and I like the way my hair feels</li>
            <li>This cleansing conditioner is every bit as good as Wen for a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Good value for price.</li>
            <li>Not as good as Wen but close</li>
            <li>I have tried Wen with good results but the cost is prohibitive.</li>
            <li>A good thing that I noticed is that it doesnt seem to leave residue like Wen does.  </li>
            <li>They have a great smell and a nice consistency.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful lightly minty scent with hints of rosemary.</li>
            <li>get yourself a good boar bristle brush and use this stuff.</li>
            <li>I really loved it but can no longer justify the cost.</li>
            <li>It smells good and has good ingredients</li>
            <li>I have absolutely loved the Avalon Organics lemon conditioner and will continue buying it and telling people about it instead.</li>
            <li>I figured hey, its a good deal</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not every product is good for every person.</li>
            <li>I have used \\&quot;Hair One\\&quot; from Sally&#x27;s,with satisfactory results,and I have also tried \\&quot;Salon Grafix\\&quot; cleansing conditioner,and had good results from that one,also.</li>
            <li>I think if you&#x27;ve wanted to give one of these products a try for a while but had sticker shock, this is a good one to try.  </li>
            <li>Works good on colored, hair too.</li>
            <li>but the mint is good too.</li>
            <li>It helps to use a fair amount of water to work it through.</li>
            <li>but im going to assume there will not be good results because of the weight the product adds to the hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s just my hair type, because there are plenty of good reviews.</li>
            <li>A good alternative to Wen.</li>
            <li>On the plus side, it does smell good and it did perserve my color.  </li>
            <li>This is just as good to me.</li>
            <li>The price is more than fair and you can control cost while RENPURE takes care of your hair!</li>
            <li>Some shampoos couldn&#x27;t even get it all out and thoroughly clean my hair but this wonderful conditioner does.</li>
            <li>But after I realized it still cleans my hair perfectly and keeps it feeling smooth and amazing, i loved it all over.</li>
            <li>It rinses clean, smells great, and the ingredient list is great.</li>
            <li>Love the feeling of shampooing with it; even if it doesn&#x27;t make foam the texture is great in the hair and you can feel it washing even without the foam.</li>
            <li>Does a great job, but I like the Loreal non sulfate better.  </li>
            <li>With this, I&#x27;m able to skip a day and my hair looks great.</li>
            <li>This product works great, even better than Wen did for my hair.  </li>
            <li>It smells amazing, and my curls are gorgeous and hydrated after use.</li>
            <li>I love this cleansing conditioner it works great for my hair</li>
            <li>After using it, I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>It smells great when I&#x27;m washing my hair and doesn&#x27;t leave an overwhelming scent when it&#x27;s washed out.</li>
            <li>good, kind of an herbal minty</li>
            <li>Superior products at a reasonable price, what could be better!!!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love the scent of this!</li>
            <li>Also...rinse, rinse, rinse and then rinse some more!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Love Renpure!</li>
            <li>and now I&#x27;m in love with it!</li>
            <li>but it also cleanses my hair without using any chemicals, my hair feels so much better now!</li>
            <li>I love the smell!</li>
            <li>and I love that as well!</li>
            <li>I was looking for a more affordable alternative option to WEN and this is it for me!</li>
            <li>the smell is pretty great, too!</li>
            <li>It had a really wonderful scent and works exactly as indicated on the hair.  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I tried Renpure!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I first pumped the product, the smell was absolutely wonderful.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Renpure works better!</li>
            <li>I am 100% satisfied!</li>
            <li>Have already ordered more and cancelled our Wen shipments!</li>
            <li>anyway, I love the product!  </li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>It smelled great, my hair was easy to comb through afterwards , it all washed out.....</li>
            <li>I can honestly say I love using this!</li>
            <li>It really is amazing.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and my scalp tingles when I scrub with it.</li>
            <li>This is amazing.</li>
            <li>my hair feels amazing.</li>
            <li>The pomegranate smells amazing too.  </li>
            <li>The scent is so amazing.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s important to me that my shampoo leaves my hair looking great without lots of styling products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it twice now and my hair looks amazing.</li>
            <li>At this point apply conditioner (I use Renpure Amazing Miracle and they pair well together).</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>It feels amazing on the head and continues that way for awhile after.  </li>
            <li>Amazing how nice you hair can be after you commit to not shapooing anymore.</li>
            <li>Really nice, esp.</li>
            <li>They both smell nice, however!)Pantene</li>
            <li>The fragrance was just as nice as the WEN.</li>
            <li>1/3 price of Wen and effective.</li>
            <li>was a combination I used when I was making my own cc.</li>
            <li>as well!aking my own cc.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own</li>
            <li>This is a really nice cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li>It has a really nice fragrance to it.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and minty but I need a heavier consistancy for my hiar.  </li>
            <li>Liked the Wen</li>
            <li>This works great, left my hair looking beautiful!  </li>
            <li>I liked the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t get a comb through it without some kind of leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>But the best thing is that I noticed I wasn&#x27;t losing as much hair in the shower.</li>
            <li>Okay, not as good as Wen.</li>
            <li>I bought it rather hesitantly after using Wen and loving it.  </li>
            <li>The shine is nice, but I feel like I need to go rewash my hair.</li>
            <li>A Littler Nice</li>
            <li>The smell is nice, and it gave my scalp a nice tingle too.  </li>
            <li>Thank you Renpure for creating such an awesome product at a great price.</li>
            <li>and I both have our own bottles</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and I like how this product gives a cooling tingle on my scalp.</li>
            <li>I also noticed the ingredients list has words I can pronounce, which is kind of nice.  </li>
            <li>here is my honest to god</li>
            <li>Honestly, try it for yourself</li>
            <li>Has a really nice smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it is especially worth it to me for the color preservation.</li>
            <li>my hair needs it&#x27;s own oils to fluorish.</li>
            <li>but it is effective.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the holy grail, but it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found so far for the price since my beloved Trader Joe&#x27;s Nourish conditioner had &#x27;</li>
            <li>It did nothing for me, it does smell nice</li>
            <li>I will say that it had a nice cool tingly feeling after a couple of minutes and the smell was great.</li>
            <li>My hair feels great, not greasy or dry; its perfect.</li>
            <li>, they have a product with which I am very pleased, and I&#x27;m also pleased with the money I will be saving.</li>
            <li>However, as a mild styler and leave in, this stuff works great.</li>
            <li>I was actually super happy when I got to the end of the bottle.</li>
            <li>This stuff works perfect and doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d try this WEN-like product since it was so much more affordable than WEN, and I discovered that it works even better!  </li>
            <li>, my Pixie cut is even more FABULOUS for me!!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be glad you did! :))</li>
            <li>It cleans and conditions better than Wen, and of course does a better job than RenPure!  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant to try this, as I&#x27;d seen a lot of cleansing conditioners that just weren&#x27;t effective or had too many fragrances, chemicals, etc.</li>
            <li>In a nice unbreakable bottle with convenient pump :-)</li>
            <li>The pomegranate one gave my hair more of the silky feel, which I liked more.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So thrilled this is one of the scents because it&#x27;s literally my favorite.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using it, my hair is soft and has a beautiful shine!  </li>
            <li>Natural and smells great!</li>
            <li>The best no-suds shampoo I have tried, this shampoo cleans without completely stripping.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance wasn&#x27;t as minty/herbal as I would have liked, but that&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>I have hip-length hair that is very fine</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine</li>
            <li>My hair really looked good, and was manageable, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, with continued use, I just kept losing hair!</li>
            <li>I first reviewed the Renpure Sweet Pomegranate Cleansing Conditioner, I was very happy with it, and gave it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Seems to work pretty great too.</li>
            <li>Great price and works wonders on my fine but full hair.</li>
            <li>My hair was very light</li>
            <li>This is a great alternative to Wen if you have pretty healthy hair.</li>
            <li>When it comes out of the bottle the mint is very potent, but as you work it into your hair the rosemary starts to shine through for a most pleasant combination, particularly if one uses a bit of it as a leave-in.</li>
            <li>and it doesnt feel as good whilst in the shower, but the result is nothing less than exquisite.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, but leaves my hair super greasy!</li>
            <li>Huge fan!</li>
            <li>A huge difference!</li>
            <li>and I find I like this better.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>I gave it one star for many reasons.  </li>
            <li>so you end up wasting a  lot more product.  </li>
            <li>dont care what anyone says I love this stuff</li>
            <li>It smells about a million times better than this Renpure stuff anyway.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Point is, as an obsessive hair washer, I absolutely love this stuff</li>
            <li>I love shampooing my hair with this.</li>
            <li>I tried it anyway and found what many have said, it is runny and does not lather like shampoo.</li>
            <li>If they could come out with a truly color safe formula that uses oils like jojoba oil, I&#x27;d be lining up to buy it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You do need to be sure you rinse your hair thoroughly before, spend 1-2 minutes massaging it into your scalp</li>
            <li>I love the Rosemary Mint shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love the idea of a conditioning cleanser.</li>
            <li>I put most of it onto my scalp</li>
            <li>My hair is softer and in better condition than ever before.  </li>
            <li>Smells amazing and feels fantastic.</li>
            <li>It kinda feels like I&#x27;m washing with smooth, silky, and watery conditioner, which feels nice but doesn&#x27;t make me think of &amp;#34;good&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>This stuff seems okay to me.</li>
            <li>i haven&#x27;t gotten to the point where i can go more than one day without washing though,</li>
            <li>This saves me a bit of time in the morning (which I appreciate) and smells absolutely lovely.  </li>
            <li>I love this co wash works</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>love the smell.</li>
            <li>I love that it suggests to use this as a leave in conditioner too.</li>
            <li>I tried Wen for awhile, and although it had more chemicals than I would have liked, I did enjoy it.</li>
            <li>but because of an increasingly hectic schedule I kept running out before I had time to make more.</li>
            <li>and I love that</li>
            <li>Love this product for my curly hair.</li>
            <li>I love the rosemary mint smell and tingle.....</li>
            <li>Plus the ingredients are safer then most hair products.</li>
            <li>Many people spend more on a cup of coffee than what this costs.  </li>
            <li>It adds a lot of shine and makes my hair look and feel healthy.</li>
            <li>They are not a &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; so they don&#x27;t have suds, but that is what makes them so much better for your hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is silkier, healthier, and more manageable since using these products.</li>
            <li>And we all use these products and love them.</li>
            <li>and it being on sale at Walgreens on payday) for me to buy more.</li>
            <li>I have damaged hair, so I need to stick to the more moisturizing Wen Fig.</li>
            <li>I am giving my bottle to my fiance, he will love it.</li>
            <li>Now I put the product on my ends, let it sit, then rinse the top with 2 pumps diluted in about 1/4 cup of water.  </li>
            <li>smells in my hair, but this has more like floral scent to it).  </li>
            <li>Its not horrible but does not help at all with my hair.</li>
            <li>but I guess I will stick with wen untils something better comes along.</li>
            <li>Ren is better than any foaming shampoo.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I agree with all of those who love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>When I went to the store in search of a conditioner I was pleased to see these on the shelf.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>My hair was finally soft, smooth and shiny again and the best part about it</li>
            <li>Smells mostly like mint, and it doesn&#x27;t linger on you once your hair dries.</li>
            <li>Certainly love the price better than Wen.  </li>
            <li>Also, Renpure has a longer list of ingredients mostly oils from plants like coco nut, sea weed, etc</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve given bottles to all my girlfriends (and yes, they love it too).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seriously so glad I picked up a bottle of this Target.</li>
            <li>After two uses of this, I can already tell I love it.</li>
            <li>much more affordable.</li>
            <li>It was more that squeaky feeling like when you are shampooing.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s not tested on animals.</li>
            <li>But as my hair got used to it it got softer and started behaving a lot better.</li>
            <li>so I kept using more and more.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and i have to say i like this better</li>
            <li>It does take some getting used to (it doesn&#x27;t lather), but I love it.</li>
            <li>and I love the results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I never had tried wen but after using renpure I might try wen to see if its better.</li>
            <li>I have tried many brands of cleansing conditioner because I did not want to fork out the $$$ for Wen - it is quite pricy.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to buy more any time soon.)</li>
            <li>She had a problem with oiliness, I will have to tell her about people saying to use more if oiliness happens, which we didn&#x27;t know about.</li>
            <li>I do keep it away from the water so that water doesn&#x27;t get into the bottle from the top.</li>
            <li>It feels amazing, isn&#x27;t sticky and looks smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>I suspect it will work better on my husband&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>I love love love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love the tingle i get when i usr</li>
            <li>I love this and will purchase again.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I think it works even better than Wen.</li>
            <li>Plus, I am in love with the smell.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love my curls, so I avoid sulfates, sulfides and &#x27;cones like the plague.  </li>
            <li>&#x3D;)  </li>
            <li>like it did for me &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>My hair looks and feels lovely using this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve wanted to try one of these types of systems for a while, but most of the natural/organic/sulfate-free stuff gave me severe sticker shock</li>
            <li>I saw this at Target and decided to give it a try, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Like I said, though, I love it, so</li>
            <li>has really given me confidence again great looking hair</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s more of the consistency of a conditioner.</li>
            <li>being said, there are some tricks to getting the most out of this stuff.</li>
            <li>like I tend to get, put some more on the ends.</li>
            <li>And this bottle lasted me about 2 months washing twice a week, so if you&#x27;re a daily hair washer, maybe this isn&#x27;t the best thing out there for you.</li>
            <li>so you may need to use more.</li>
            <li>My hair is softer, more manageable and in much better condition then when I used Wen.</li>
            <li>I love this cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s why THIS one (Renpure mint) is my favorite</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>This works OK, but is not as luxe as Wen</li>
            <li>and I had to use more.</li>
            <li>I do not have to add more.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Months later - This one is the best.  </li>
            <li>This one works the best for my hair, it leaves my hair soft, manageable and it does not strip my hair color like shampoo does (even the sulfate free shampoo does).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the performance, scent, pricing, and form of this hair cleanser are all magnificent assets, with which I wholeheartedly recommend it to everyone who bothers to ask my opinion on such things.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Pomegranate is better</li>
            <li>I have to get us to the fact there is no (damaging) suds when I lather, but the commercials for Wen made be more cognizant if what I should expect.  </li>
            <li>When I saw a twin pack of Ren in BB&amp;B for $13, I figured \\&quot;why not give it a try?\\&quot; I wanted to love it for the price,</li>
            <li>I love mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff works great and is soooooo much cheaper than Wen.</li>
            <li>I use this every time I shower and the more</li>
            <li>the more I love it.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner leaves my hair light, bouncy and healthier than ever before!</li>
            <li>Had to use another conditioner after just to be able to comb and style hair.  </li>
            <li>Okay, check off two requirements.</li>
            <li>Ok so NO</li>
            <li>My favorite cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>Love this cowash.</li>
            <li>They are thicker and work better than RenPure.</li>
            <li>RenPure is MUCH more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to checking out more of the line.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li>Gave Ren to my fiance to have him try it, thinking that with his shorter hair it may work better, and rinse out easier.</li>
            <li>My hair looks healthy.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>In fact, it looks cleaner, and my scalp feels better.</li>
            <li>Tried this and love it.</li>
            <li>You have to make sure you rinse well.</li>
            <li>It smells okay,</li>
            <li>nothing really memorable.</li>
            <li>It smells ok, but not rosemary mint.  </li>
            <li>I hoped Renpure&#x27;s Cleansing Conditioner would be better.</li>
            <li>This one smells wonderful, but it too left my hair in need of a conditioner.</li>
            <li>I hope to see even more improvement in my hair :)</li>
            <li>Now it needs more slip because it&#x27;s so long.)&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>and I absolutely LOVE the way it makes my hair feel</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t want to massage it in the way you would shampoo - something like a wide-toothed comb, or just using your fingers, is a much better option.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with my hair again</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I just ordered on bottle.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>love this stuff.</li>
            <li>but it took much more to coat my hair than I thought.</li>
            <li>OK  for &amp;#34;copy&amp;#34; of the actualy WREN product however I probably won&#x27;t be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Renpure Coconut Crème Cowash through Amazon on a recommendation and found it to be MUCH more drying than any of the Wen cleansing conditioners.  </li>
            <li>The product is okay</li>
            <li>, I hope you love it as much as me!!!!</li>
            <li>Thanks you!!!!</li>
            <li>My hair has lots of body &amp; feels nice and clean.  </li>
            <li>Its also super cheap so thats a plus !!</li>
            <li>I tried this for the first time and I loved it.</li>
            <li>I first used WEN, and really loved it, but at $30-$60 a bottle, I couldn&#x27;t afford to keep using it.  </li>
            <li>so it was getting full force water and still wasn&#x27;t rinsing effectively.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very VERY happy with my purchase and will continue to use this product for a long time!</li>
            <li>But the seller sent quickly and well packaged and does smell nice.  </li>
            <li>I have dry, colored hair, and this product is absolutely wonderful.</li>
            <li>all wonderful in cleaning and helping a dry winter scalp.  </li>
            <li>However this product is a good break when I&#x27;m too busy to make my own products</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know how this stuff could clean hair when it&#x27;s made of oils, but it does!</li>
            <li>I eventually gave in and had to shampoo my hair twice to get it all out and clean!</li>
            <li>My hair feels great &amp; soft &amp; healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I still have shiny, smooth, more manageable hair, but have gotten rid of the greasy bits on day 2.  </li>
            <li>Great and natural product.  </li>
            <li>I love the way this product makes my hair free and look.  </li>
            <li>I suggest giving it (Renpure) a good scrub with your fingertips after leaving it on about five minutes in the shower and really, really rinse it out.  </li>
            <li>I rinsed for a good five minutes, but no matter how much I rinsed</li>
            <li>I loved this so much that I bought some for my daughter.</li>
            <li>As a non-shampoo kind of girl and a mild product junkie, I keep my eyes peeled for sulfate free products that provide ample moisture to my 3c/4a henna&#x27;d curls.</li>
            <li>It does leave my hair nice and soft and the price is so much better!</li>
            <li>I have used the other cleansing conditioner which made me very happy.  </li>
            <li>I noticed my hair was softer,and clean, I love the mint feeling on my scalp, and the smell.</li>
            <li>My hair is easy to comb and has a shine (not oily).</li>
            <li>But once my hair dried, I was really impressed; I like this product more than Wen.</li>
            <li>Love this product, and am so happy that I researched before being suckered into purchasing a similar (but over-priced) product on TV.</li>
            <li>But what I&#x27;ve noticed, is that it is better absorbed by my hair, and can be more evenly distributed.</li>
            <li>It pumps easily and the pump keeps working unlike the Hair One.</li>
            <li>and it tangles easily after using this product</li>
            <li>, I purchased from my local wg drug store for a couple more dollars than Amazon in lavender and the mint and both smell and work great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li>It soft, shiny, and just amazing!</li>
            <li>I have been a fan of Wen products but let&#x27;s be honest, it has really gone up in price!  </li>
            <li>It did get my hair very clean, I&#x27;d say even squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li>The scent is light but really nice and fresh, it goes in easily and washes out clean.</li>
            <li>For reference I have medium/long, fine but dense, color treated hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m middle-aged and have fine hair, and after using Renpure, my hair is silky and shiny.</li>
            <li>I have mid-back length fine hair (but a lot of it)</li>
            <li>love the smell and love the way my hair feels after the first use.  </li>
            <li>I am very impressed with Renpure and for $23 less PER bottle than WEN, it&#x27;s a no-brainer to stick with this brand.</li>
            <li>hair is color-treated, fine, wavy and there are wirey colored gray hair.</li>
            <li>Took a fine tooth comb into the shower and as the directions stated, combed it through my hair from scalp to end.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve fine hair that tends to get greasy looking at the end of the day, but can also get frizzy after styling.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, curly, and has a tendency to frizz.</li>
            <li>works the same as the higher priced version......smells great...and great results!!!!</li>
            <li>It made my fine hair lifeless.</li>
            <li>As always, I had to use a detangler, since shower combing is NOT an option with my fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine curly hair, and a lot of it.</li>
            <li>it was fine with me.  </li>
            <li>It works just fine.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, and a medium amount of it, that tends to the oily side.</li>
            <li>and I am sure this would be a great product for someone with dry and damaged hair, just not for someone like me who&#x27;s ends</li>
            <li>But after blow-drying,  the results were amazing -- looked like I had instantly acquired 1/3 more hair!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell as good or work as well (on my hair) as some more expensive rosemary/mint formulations, but for the price, it is a very good option for fine, maybe a bit oily, hair or for when you want to get rid of product build up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great for shaving too, and leaves skin super soft and minty fresh!</li>
            <li>I use it just like it says on the bottle and the 10-12 pumps is accurate.  </li>
            <li>I bought this from Walgreens because it was on sale and by one get one free for 9.99&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am so happy that I can get the same results as WEN without the price tag.</li>
            <li>I saw this at Target and for $6.99, it was a cheap try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have done the sulfate free for about two years before trying Renpure.  </li>
            <li>My hair had never felt this silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Just one pass with the straightener was enough to get everything looking great.  </li>
            <li>The results have been fabulous.</li>
            <li>and my hair was COMPLETELY free of oil.</li>
            <li>So the history of my hair prior to using this stuff hasn&#x27;t been great.</li>
            <li>hair silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used Wen, but my experience with Renpure has been great, especially when compared to the price of Wen</li>
            <li>(and yes I was using sulfate free/ salt free products before.)</li>
            <li>healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t expect this product to give me such great results.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a cheap alternative to Wen, use Salon Grafix Cleansing Conditioner.</li>
            <li>It was buy one get one free</li>
            <li>She has tried every shampoo available.</li>
            <li>Overall Renpure mint is a great combination for cleansing and nourishing hair.</li>
            <li>or else you defeat the purpose of this cleanser) of sulfate free shampoo to my hair and worked it in as well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been several weeks now, and my hair looks great, feels great--cleaner, fluffier, shinier, and my scalp doesn&#x27;t itch like it does when I use shampoos with a lot of chemicals.</li>
            <li>At present, I am not as happy</li>
            <li>If you look around, there are coupons available as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I bought a bottle and got one free.  </li>
            <li>When I dried my hair it had beautiful volume and luster!  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product after seeing it BOGO free at Walgreens.  </li>
            <li>and I must say RenPure is fabulous.</li>
            <li>Not damaging my hair further with shampoo is also great.</li>
            <li>I use it daily and had great results.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t detangle, it doesn&#x27;t smooth.  </li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t like that this product contains silicone which is just a cheap synthetic ingredient that I have found</li>
            <li>I gave my mom the free bottle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far, so good.</li>
            <li>It looks great and feels soft when freshly washed though.</li>
            <li>Smells good &amp; hair is soft</li>
            <li>My hair turned out soft, plump, and smelling good.</li>
            <li>Now to the good stuff, which is plenty: I&#x27;ve been using this for a month now and have quit using shampoo completely.</li>
            <li>it is better than Wen and so much more reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Because I wanted to like the product and also because I wanted to give it a fair shot, I used it three more times and got the same result each time.  </li>
            <li>Buy this because you are looking for a good natural shampoo.....</li>
            <li>They are still pretty good for what they cost, but Redmond Products NEVER did animal testing and by all reports was impeccable in its sourcing and other business practices.</li>
            <li>I will be aware from now on!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a bit of a product junkie and I very rarely purchase one product twice.</li>
            <li>Fresh, clean, shiny, and more manageable, too.  </li>
            <li>Works great, my hair is left moisturized, clean and shiny.</li>
            <li>As far as preserving my bright red color, this stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>Also as a note, my definition of clean is for my scalp to be free of dirt, not to be stripped of oil.</li>
            <li>I have fine, color-treated hair; and it feels so full of body.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first because I thought since it was so much cheaper that it wouldn&#x27;t be a good shampoo/conditioner (ect.)</li>
            <li>Just like with Wen, you must be sure to rinse very, very thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>I honestly had high hopes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is NOT color safe, so be aware of that.  </li>
            <li>if you have the time to do this it is well worth it!)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li>I was so excited i went home and immediately got in the shower.</li>
            <li>I purchased Ren from Rite Aid while visiting my brother and was excited to find a Wen alternative.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After I first used this product I was in love.  </li>
            <li>Even if you do not like it, the price point makes it worth a try!</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this product when I saw it in walgreens.</li>
            <li>as I originally was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is a bit overwhelming at first, but I don&#x27;t think it lingers that long, and it does a GREAT job.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not like the original cleansing conditioner</li>
            <li>Okay, first of all - I never write reviews.</li>
            <li>I bought this at Walgreens and was excited to try it.  </li>
            <li>My first use I fell in love with the smell.</li>
            <li>I was excited when I saw this at rite aid.</li>
            <li>I was so excited that I ordered another bottle, along with the Pomegranate (will review that formula after I try</li>
            <li>This is not thick and creamy like WEN is, but the smell is nice, and the product seems to clean my hair without stripping it.</li>
            <li>I have fine but thick hair and this has been working awesome.</li>
            <li>can brush right through it, and it is so much lighter with much more volume!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clean the head as well as Wen.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clean as well</li>
            <li>It is also easily available at Riteaid if I need it quickly.</li>
            <li>leaving a manageable clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>My hair never felt clean.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling clean without the yucky poo stuff.  </li>
            <li>No longer using detergents and sulfates on my damaged dry hair sounded great, the price of the product made my stomach hurt.</li>
            <li>My hair would require shampoo more more frequently than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I could not seem to get my hair and scalp to feel clean.  </li>
            <li>Im just not a fan of leaving out shampoo since this is not getting hair clean.</li>
            <li>I added a bit of water to dilute product and additionally clean.</li>
            <li>Prior to this I was using the L&#x27;Oreal Ever Creme Cleansing Conditioner, and liked it for the most part, but it didn&#x27;t moisturize my hair as well as I hoped.</li>
            <li>Remember cowash does not have a lot of lather, but produces a really clean wash anyway.</li>
            <li>It also didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling completely clean.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;d like volume and lift (or clean hair...)</li>
            <li>I researched reviews most of them were positive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving how shiny and soft my hair is!</li>
            <li>My hair is FAR more manageable!</li>
            <li>Using this product my hair is soft for once, and I love it!</li>
            <li>The mint also has a very light tingle to it, that I really like..</li>
            <li>Maybe the reviewers were listening for that \\&quot;squeak\\&quot; that powerful shampoos cause, but to me, that&#x27;s a sure sign you&#x27;ve just damaged your hair pretty significantly.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure this would work, not being a &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; but it did clean very well</li>
            <li>so I was super excited.</li>
            <li>My bright red hair has not faded with this product.</li>
            <li>I expected my hair to look great with all those oils in there.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this over a month now and am back to being pretty happy.  </li>
            <li>Spend more and get the real WEN.</li>
            <li>I would say you need about two palms full of this stuff vs. about a nickle-size of Wen.  </li>
            <li>Sure I had to leave it in for a bit longer and gently scrub away</li>
            <li>Although not as good as WEN but 3rd of the cost.</li>
            <li>so I prefer the sweet pomegranate which doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I have used the mint, sweet pomegranate, and lavender and I</li>
            <li>a whole, I love what it&#x27;s doing to my strands, my hair looks healthier, feels softer and stronger on this product.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this for individuals with oil prone hair.</li>
            <li>I do not have a head full of split ends.  </li>
            <li>I have a  nice natural curl to my hair</li>
            <li>You might love it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>They were a rather nauseatingly sweet smell that I just couldn&#x27;t handle.  </li>
            <li>any buy another bottle because I love this stuff so much</li>
            <li>re rinse in cool water before I get out..</li>
            <li>I bought a bottled of Wen two years ago and loved it, but like others on here, I can&#x27;t justify spending $30 on shampoo on a regular basis (which begs the question:</li>
            <li>I have fairly healthy straight hair, and maybe my hair isn&#x27;t the type this was made for.  </li>
            <li>Free of some allergen ingredients that more famous brands of similar product have.</li>
            <li>But the next Renpure experience was just as good.  </li>
            <li>I bought Wen once &amp; loved every minute of it; however, the cost scared me off, so I went back to the higher-end drug store bransd (John Freida, Organix, etc)</li>
            <li>I know that a lot of people will state that I should rinse out my hair more, but seriously, I really do rinse out well,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with the good ol&#x27; regular shampoo</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions, used about 10 pumps, rubbed it in well from my roots to ends, and left it on for a good 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>scent leaves an unpleasantly sweet trace of itself in your hair.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product.</li>
            <li>I guess it is true</li>
            <li>Rinse very thoroughly while scrubbing scalp some more with fingertips and finger-combing out some of the</li>
            <li>You have to make sure to very thoroughly rinse all of the product out of your hair.</li>
            <li>Not bad for a treat!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>, after the first use of Renpure, it made my hair soft and manageable and I loved it.</li>
            <li>Hands down the absolute best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>This product cleanses well and leaves a beautiful shine, but does not leave a greasy residue or weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It may be great for some - but certainly not for me.</li>
            <li>I combed through and my hair detangled pretty easily.</li>
            <li>Great cleansing conditioner it leaves my hair clean without stripping it and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling weighed down.</li>
            <li>Then, after I did some research, I learned that many regular shampoos and conditioners contain binding agents that prevent detached hair strands from falling out, giving the illusion of more volume.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this cleansing conditioner, and overall my hair is better than it has been, ever.  </li>
            <li>The rosemary mint is decent, although not my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I am so lucky I found this product.  </li>
            <li>For the price, it really is an easy way to clean up any funk in between real shampoos.  </li>
            <li>Lucky are those who like this product and it worked on their hair.  </li>
            <li>I had purchased Wen, but found that to be to expensive, and I wasn&#x27;t that impressed with the fact that Wen automatically sends more product without your authorization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also has more natural and toxic free ingredients than Wen.</li>
            <li>I am super please with this product</li>
            <li>At first Castile soap was great, but after about 6 months I felt like my hair was really dry</li>
            <li>Overall very satisfied with this cleansing conditioner</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic and cleanses very well!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The very first time I used it</li>
            <li>After the very first use I  noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>I tried this for the very first time.</li>
            <li>Bottom line, it&#x27;s good for the price, but I still long for Wen.&lt;br /&gt;USAGE</li>
            <li>method leaves my hair clean, soft, and feeling healthy.</li>
            <li>I made my own cleansing conditioner using all organic oils and essential oils, with a specially chosen &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; conditioner (btw,</li>
            <li>This is easy to use and does not require much.  </li>
            <li>This might be a good replacement for hair gel or hair spray because my hair was exactly the same when I woke up.</li>
            <li>I use a palm-full and I have pretty much a pixie-ish cut with longer bangs and layers on top</li>
            <li>Since using Renpure my hair looks really healthy and is very soft.</li>
            <li>I love that it makes my curly hair feel very soft and it seems to help with frizz too.</li>
            <li>I have fragile, fine hair and have happily used Wen (all of the basic ones, as well as some of the special edition formulas) for over a year.  </li>
            <li>I have not tried other brands of cleansing conditioner, but for me this is amazing!</li>
            <li>I love all Renpure product because of there natural ingredients!</li>
            <li>I was more than pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>Ohhh and keep your eye on it a Target- similar in price most of the time, but I&#x27;ve got it &amp;#34;Buy one get one free&amp;#34; before too!</li>
            <li>I have only used this product 3 times and already love it!</li>
            <li>smell of Renpure is very light and completely natural, and I like that the product doesn&#x27;t contain wheat protein.</li>
            <li>It hangs more smoothly and is generally more manageable and less fly-away.</li>
            <li>My husband will be so happy to get a little shelf space.</li>
            <li>My hair gets very clean and is very soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I have very long fine hair and the product is to runny and not thick like a good cleansing conditioner should be.  </li>
            <li>give it three stars because it really does leave the hair soft and the ends look amazing</li>
            <li>So far Renpure and Matrix Biolage are my top two WEN replacements.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful, but was as thin as milk pouring out of the bottle</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell so far, this product is as good as Wen.  </li>
            <li>I feel it is worth the price I paid for it.</li>
            <li>With Renpure my hair is much more manageable, soft, and shiny.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>There is not $25 worth of difference in my hair to justify paying the cost of Wen.  </li>
            <li>Not even worth the 6 bucks.</li>
            <li>In fact, I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair because it feels so soft and</li>
            <li>Extra curly with a nice volume and shine.  </li>
            <li>For $9.99, maybe it&#x27;s worth the gamble for others, but I will be returning mine.</li>
            <li>It just feels fresh.</li>
            <li>This has made my curls lovely and soft.</li>
            <li>Is it \\&quot;worth it\\&quot;?  </li>
            <li>, of course when I thought I could spend $10.00 instead of about $30 -  that seemed worth</li>
            <li>your worth it</li>
            <li>I apply 3 pumps and massage into the front of my hair, 2-3 more pumps to the crown area, and 2-3 pumps to the underside near the nape of my neck.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way worth the try.  </li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews on beauty products...</li>
            <li>This shampoo is really handy to have around especially</li>
            <li>After trying Hair One, and not really crazy about the smell, I came across Ren at Walgreens.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, I can see why people may have encountered difficulties, especially if they&#x27;re not used to washing with conditioner (co-washing) or if they followed the directions without knowing how to adapt them for their own hair needs.</li>
            <li>It honestly was a waist of ten dollars in my mind.</li>
            <li>I have used Wen and many other fine hair products, and this product exceeds them all!</li>
            <li>This one is a little minty which I like a lot and feels good and clean on the hair.</li>
            <li>I then noticed that one bottle (the one I had been using) said &#x27;color safe formula&#x27; and the other said &#x27;safe for color treated hair.&#x27;  </li>
            <li>Renpure is a bit more work than regular shampoo - but worth it for the volume and shine!</li>
            <li>and I got lucky on my first try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still trying to figure out how many pumps I need (long, wavy, fine, color treated hair)</li>
            <li>I feel like most cleansing conditioners don&#x27;t really clean, I was always left feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>I use oils in my hair, yet this product always leaves me feeling clean and voluminous, yet tangle free and soft.</li>
            <li>I returned the crappy one and purchased the one with the right formula.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m sorry.wen is wen chaz dean got it right no one has come close to recreating  his cream conditioner.so save your money take care of your hair</li>
            <li>I bought this at Target because it had a lot of the right ingredients that I wanted for my hair (coconut oil, tea tree oil, rosemary oil, etc)</li>
            <li>This is thinner, but it left my hair feeling amazing after the first try.  </li>
            <li>i make sure to rinse it out really good, and it has never left my hair crunchy or dry.</li>
            <li>Love, love this stuff, finally my over processed, sun bleached hair looks alive!  </li>
            <li>Your hair feels clean and soft, and smells good long after rinsed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely less frizzy and more manageable and shiny.  :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;It blew dry fairly well, I didn&#x27;t fuss too much, and off I went to an appointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, within 1/2 hour, while I was sitting in the office, my head started to itch.</li>
            <li>I love this product and highly recommend it over the Sweet Pomegranate version (which I don&#x27;t think cleans or moisturizes nearly as well).</li>
            <li>Wen (Not a miracle, but the best by far, but the most expensive.  </li>
            <li>Normally I use a sulfate free shampoo on my scalp and a conditioner on my ends</li>
            <li>I have very fine blonde hair</li>
            <li>flat irons more quickly.</li>
            <li>The same with most other co-washes but this one cleans and is inexpensive, has good ingredients and I have never needed to shampoo my hair to get rid of</li>
            <li>The next best, and until a few days ago, also the cheapest.  </li>
            <li>It is not quite as thick as it could be but it has a nice smell and I love the mint.  </li>
            <li>My hair felt and looked really good the next day; I didn&#x27;t get that slippy feeling you get with regular conditioner, but my hair felt squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li>It looked amazing too; light, fluffy waves and curls without frizz.  </li>
            <li>;) Splash some more water over the top of my head, flip my head upside down, and splash some more over the back of my upside-down head, then turn off the water.&lt;br /&gt;6)</li>
            <li>sure it&#x27;s a great product for someone with medium density, mid length, straight hair with a little dryness.</li>
            <li>My hair is a mess at the end of the day and if Renpure can tackle that, it&#x27;s a really good product.</li>
            <li>We had such high hopes for this, especially considering the fabulous list of nice ingredients!  </li>
            <li>I have fine curly hair, which is easily damaged and becomes dry and brittle.  </li>
            <li>hope this is helpful for anyone like me who needs a very gentle conditioning cleanser like Wen but would like to find a cheaper alternative.</li>
            <li>but my hair doesn&#x27;t seem to like it very much.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many shampoos/conditioners, trying to find one that&#x27;s natural, keeps my hair healthy, and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li>I rinsed it out completely and my hair feels fine out of the shower.</li>
            <li>I made sure to follow instructions to the letter, spent a good 5 minutes trying to rinse my hair, and decided not to blow dry to see if that had contributed to the unsatisfactory results any.</li>
            <li>I felt like a super model and had fun flicking my hair around until I nearly took out an eye!</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, that product is far different from the Coconut Creme cleansing conditioner--my hair felt soft, shiny and clean afterward, and the results were exactly like what I&#x27;d get from any Wen product, for a much lower cost!  </li>
            <li>I think that Ren is better for my hair type than Wen (I have fine, slightly wavy hair).</li>
            <li>but, dries soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This cleans it pretty darn</li>
            <li>(and what isn&#x27;t), this should be the best thing ever, but sadly, I am out 10 bucks for something I won&#x27;t even use with conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff!</li>
            <li>First, I should have bought it at Amazon because it&#x27;s three bucks cheaper.</li>
            <li>Instant love.</li>
            <li>(I comb my hair during this time, in order to make sure everything is properly coated) and then I go on with the rest of my shower before rinsing it out thoroughly at the end.</li>
            <li>I used the Ren conditioning cleanser Rosemary Mint for the first time today.</li>
            <li>The one I purchased for myself I bought in a local store for more money and</li>
            <li>My hair has never been in such healthy shape.</li>
            <li>First, I thought it was postpartum hair loss.</li>
            <li>I washed my hair last night with it, slept on it, woke up looking shiny and healthy, then added the conditioner to my ends</li>
            <li>I love essential oils, and rosemary/mint</li>
            <li>I was washing my hair once every 2 days with a sulfate-free shampoo before I started using Renpure, but now I&#x27;m easily able to wash it only twice a week without it getting oily.</li>
            <li>I just used Renpure cleansing conditioner for the first time yesterday.  </li>
            <li>But even after the first use there was an immediate difference.  </li>
            <li>I am not saying it is &amp;#34;gold&amp;#34; in a bottle, but it is pretty close.  </li>
            <li>I actually used it last night (I use Wen Fig normally) just to be able to give you an honest review.</li>
            <li>This is the first cleansing conditioner I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first I followed the instructions and used the product like a shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Switching to cleansing conditioners has led to the first time in my life</li>
            <li>The reason for 4 stars, I recently bought they pomegranate conditioner and it works better for my hair</li>
            <li>Used this morning first time.</li>
            <li>It was a washing day when I first used this product.</li>
            <li>This is not it&#x27;s first product.</li>
            <li>That is so much conditioner!</li>
            <li>I love the Rosemary Mint smell, and only having to use one product in the shower (instead of shampoo and conditioner).  </li>
            <li>Brings out my waves without them looking like a hot mess.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions exactly</li>
            <li>The first day, I styled my hair with a lot of product &amp; hot tools.</li>
            <li>and I love using only one product instead of shampoo and conditioner and everything else.</li>
            <li>First TiMe</li>
            <li>Thanks Renpure!</li>
            <li>but otherwise I followed directions exactly.  </li>
            <li>and this was my first to try.  </li>
            <li>First let me tell you</li>
            <li>Then, on top of that I have a low thyroid.  </li>
            <li>This product though not organic.. Seemed like a better alternate..  </li>
            <li>The first bottle I had</li>
            <li>First, I wash before I shower and rinse then</li>
            <li>One is better off using inexpensive conditioners such as Suave, VO5 and the rest.</li>
            <li>the first couple times I used it (although it didn&#x27;t look it).</li>
            <li>My hair does not tangle, it feels so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>the first 1-2 times I used this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed with the thickness of others, they are so thick that they more just sit on top of my hair, rather than being absorbed.</li>
            <li>I just received my first order of Renpure today.</li>
            <li>am very discriminatory when it comes to products!  </li>
            <li>pretty</li>
            <li>I read the reviews thinking it would be a healthy alternative to my regular shampoo/conditioner routine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This isn&#x27;t my first cleansing conditioner</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m well aware of how to use it.</li>
            <li>so I started going out of my way to make sure I only applied it to my roots.</li>
            <li>It actually feels better than Wen in some ways.</li>
            <li>It definitely takes some effort to work it into your hair, and then even more effort to rinse it out.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t want to write a negative review without giving the product a fair chance, so after a day of regular shampooing/conditioning (which felt amazing after a day on Ren), I tried Ren again.</li>
            <li>(although I am probably using too much!)</li>
            <li>Anyway, I do that first in the shower, then leave the \\&quot;lather\\&quot; on throughout the rest of my shower while I&#x27;m washing my face, shaving, etc.</li>
            <li>I just tried this for the first time today.</li>
            <li>It totally gets rid of oil and makes hair lighter and more body.</li>
            <li>It might be better for a different type of hair but not mine.</li>
            <li>After a year of using these types of cleaners I can tell you for the first time in my life I can come out of a shower and not have to use products in my harir to control the frizz.</li>
            <li>I work it through in sections, paying really good attention to the crown of my head because thats where I had trouble</li>
            <li>Works just as good as Wen for a lot less money!</li>
            <li>If you have dry or mature hair then maybe this would be a good product for you, but I found it to be both ineffective and a pain to use.</li>
            <li>Wow!!!!</li>
            <li>Having read both the positive and negative reviews, I was prepared for just about anything, so it was a very pleasant surprise to have the product work more or less exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is amazing, but I love anything herbal and minty; if those types of scents aren&#x27;t your thing, maybe try the other scent, because the smell of it definitely stays with your hair for a day or 2.  </li>
            <li>The Renpure smells good but has a more subtle fragrance than Wen Sweet Almond Mint which is the only Wen I have used to date.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product for people in the same situation as I was and looking for something that leaves my hair feeling fresh and healthy.</li>
            <li>They are both pretty good, not expensive, AND I found them both in my very average grocery store!  </li>
            <li>They are both pretty good, not expensive, AND I found them both in my very average grocery store!  </li>
            <li>For me, this is better than Wen, because with most conditioners, higher water content seems to help with my thick hair.</li>
            <li>No product is for everyone, but I honestly feel that most people will benefit from using this product according to the directions, which is to say you should make sure you leave it on for at least 5 minutes and rinse with lukewarm - not hot - water.</li>
            <li>This product is much thinner than Wen and does not leave hair as soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It feels so soft and clean.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and look clean, without drying it out like every shampoo I have ever used and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to occasionally use a gentle clarifying shampoo to deep clean.</li>
            <li>When she washes with it, she follows up with any ol&#x27; leave-in conditioner, and her hair is clean, soft, and comb/brushable.  </li>
            <li>After using Ren alone for a week or so, my scalp didn&#x27;t feel clean, so I&#x27;m using it as a regular conditioner along with a mild shampoo.</li>
            <li>As with the other recommendations,  really make sure that you wash this stuff out THOROUGHLY!  </li>
            <li>The only recommendation I have for anyone who wants to use this product is to make sure to thoroughly rinse your hair out in order to wash away the cleanser, because your hair can look oily at the roots if the cleanser is still on the scalp.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly white girl hair and have been wanting to get wen but can&#x27;t make myself spend that kind of money</li>
            <li>After that first week, my hair was not limp, but full of body and shiny, so give it a chance.</li>
            <li>It has a really nice scent and left my hair soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll likely try some other cleansing conditioners as well, but am pretty happy with this one for now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m American Indian and my hair is not as fine as most white people&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll happily trade a little bit of build-up every few months for softer, more manageable hair.d of build-up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll happily trade a little bit of build-up every few months for softer, more manageable hair.</li>
            <li>After rinsing my hair still retains a positive level of moisture.</li>
            <li>(I like a deeper clean after swimming in the pool) and it does not mess with my hair.</li>
            <li>Ren pure leaves my hair clean, shiny, and soft.</li>
            <li>The bottle says to use 10+ pumps, but I find that I have to use 20 pumps or more because of how long my hair is.</li>
            <li>I know other people have left reviews saying how great this product is,</li>
            <li>My hair is full, soft, manageable and not frizzy.</li>
            <li>I honestly looked like I hadnt washed my hair in WEEKS, so greasy, oily and weighed down</li>
            <li>I was so disappointed that this didn&#x27;t work for me, because it really is a great conditioner and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>I was pleased that my ends didn&#x27;t look so dry and</li>
            <li>I used it as directed (pretty much the same way I always used Wen), and it rinsed out fine.</li>
            <li>If you have really dry hair from coloring or that lovely gray hair that&#x27;s not what it used to be, this is for you.</li>
            <li>I used it exactly as directed and spent 3 minutes under the water to rinse it out since I had heard sometimes these conditioners take awhile to wash out and my hair felt ok, but when I went to blow</li>
            <li>Healthy hair, doesn&#x27;t dry hair out.</li>
            <li>I really bought this by mistake at a local walgreens, I was looking for a decent organic shampoo because my hair seems to fare much better when not using sulfates</li>
            <li>such, my hair doesn&#x27;t get greasy as easily</li>
            <li>First, make sure your hair is soaking wet throughout.</li>
            <li>Renpure isn&#x27;t strong enough as a cleanser by itself and if itwere, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars instead of 4.</li>
            <li>What results I have had with Renpure, and my opinion on the two cleansing conditioners I used of theirs, is based purely on the fact that they made a lot of my hair fall out.</li>
            <li>if you think about it the harsh sudsy surfactants in shampoo strip the hair, this will probably help it grow even better!</li>
            <li>I bought this at harris teeter a few months ago and fell in love with the way it made my hair feel and act!</li>
            <li>I just massage a few pumps more of the product into my scalp, rinse my hair and voila!</li>
            <li>I Really Believe This Actually Damaged My Hair And caused It To Fall Out More Than Normal.</li>
            <li>It is thick, straight and in pretty good condition.</li>
            <li>will most likely use this as a leave in conditioner for the ends only in the future and will go find myself a suitable shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And, it&#x27;s always nice to support a family company vs giant corps who make garbage shampoos that smell over-the-top good. ;^)</li>
            <li>Other than color-treating and light blow-drying (I do not do full blow-outs)</li>
            <li>Turns out, they all have alcohol, a total killer for fine hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is curly and tends to get frizzy easily, my mom&#x27;s hair is very curly, my one sister has wavy hair, and my other sister has super straight hair.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty decent.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, and Renpure gives my hair some texture and body, so much so that I can actually skip a day in between washings.  </li>
            <li>I have fine straight hair and using this product simply does not perform on my hair AT ALL.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap enough that even if you don&#x27;t like it, you&#x27;re not wasting too much money.</li>
            <li>But then it started to be very drying.  </li>
            <li>But the real test is what does my hair look like, and  how does it feel dry.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I have curly/frizzy/dry hair, and this cleansing conditioner did absolutely nothing for me.  </li>
            <li>and I do not need to trim it nearly as much.  </li>
            <li>really don&#x27;t have any complaints.</li>
            <li>than wen..and reasonable price..</li>
            <li>You just have to rinse very well.</li>
            <li>It is okay, not really nourishing to my hair.</li>
            <li>when it dries, it&#x27;s really greasy.</li>
            <li>Very watery.</li>
            <li>I should have stuck with the real cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li>It is so much easier to detangle, and I can go much longer in between &amp;#34;washes&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like it...</li>
            <li>I have use this off &amp; on when I cannot afford Wen and really see no difference at all.  </li>
            <li>it  was better then I expected and I would use it in the furture</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t see any change in my hair at all</li>
            <li>I absolutely would recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Cleans hair very well.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t like this one as much as others.  </li>
            <li>I was using a whole bottle of Wen every 2 weeks, but I&#x27;ve had this product for almost 2 weeks now</li>
            <li>hair gets very tangly after shampooing,  sleeping. .</li>
            <li>I  really didn&#x27;t have to use a lot of product.  </li>
            <li>This product may not be for everyone, but my whole family likes it</li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t really tell you much about it.</li>
            <li>my described usage, wash-day becomes a whole lot simpler.</li>
            <li>By the time I&#x27;m ready for wash, my hair is loaded with this product.</li>
            <li>Clean-er hair ready to be styled all over again.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>So much cheaper than WEN.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t like to do much to my hair, so</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very comparable.</li>
            <li>the Rosemary mint smell really pulled me in</li>
            <li>It has so much shine and bounce-</li>
            <li>I really like this product and have purchased it for my mother to try as well.</li>
            <li>works very well.</li>
            <li>Like it and so much cheaper the Wen</li>
            <li>This is much healthier for your hair than shampoo</li>
            <li>but I have not needed that much at all.</li>
            <li>I wonder if some who described residue were using too much perhaps?&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL ...</li>
            <li>I really like renpure</li>
            <li>Plus the price means that I don&#x27;t have to worry about how much I&#x27;m using</li>
            <li>It is, however, a very passable substitute.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely adore this product.</li>
            <li>, I was about ready to shell out the bucks for Wen, then I saw this at Bed Bath and Beyond.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s too much for me, however.</li>
            <li>I wanted WEN but can&#x27;t bring myself to pay that much, so I found a cheaper knockoff in the drugstore.</li>
            <li>The smell was very minty but not too overpowering.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, but it was not what I expected.  </li>
            <li>when I saw Ren at Walgreens during a BOGO event, I got really excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>haha).</li>
            <li>My hair feels so much thicker and shinier now that I don&#x27;t strip my hair of</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t ready to give up on the product yet, because I could see the benefits to leaving the oils in.  </li>
            <li>My whole family loves this.</li>
            <li>As others have said, you absolutely MUST rinse thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I make a point of scrubbing my scalp really vigorously for 2 minutes, as suggested, (fingertips, no fingernails, of course)</li>
            <li>Rinse VERY well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a one step hair cleaning/conditioning which sounds like it ought to save you time, but you really got rinse this stuff.&lt;br</li>
            <li>very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to use QUITE as much product, either, but I don&#x27;t skimp.</li>
            <li>a regular cheap shampoo that lathers a little.you get what you pay for if you can&#x27;t afford wen and want that wen feeling your are not going to get it from this</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t have any expectations of how it would work, but I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>would absolutely recommend this product to others -</li>
            <li>but I really like the results in my hair.</li>
            <li>REALLY well, and thought I had.</li>
            <li>As such I went cheap on hair care products and washed my hair with body soap.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try Wen but did not want to spend so much on a trial.</li>
            <li>My hair was not greasy and it detangled very well.</li>
            <li>It has the consistency of Elmer&#x27;s Glue and doesn&#x27;t spread very well.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t get creamy nor did it really spread through my hair.</li>
            <li>I got this product from a local store buy one get one free</li>
            <li>it just doesn&#x27;t really work for my hair so much.</li>
            <li>Even with short hair, it was kind of a big expense.</li>
            <li>I have fine, ultra straight hair and my roots tend to get oily, and when that happens the rest of my hair just lies flat.</li>
            <li>This is a nice price for this product, but I was expecting a little more given the other reviews.</li>
            <li>but not least, I noticed that after I blew my hair dry and styled it, my hair felt a lot more substantial.</li>
            <li>i pretty much followed the instructions, although i do have to use more like 16 pumps for my fine thin hair.</li>
            <li>but when I try a new product I always see how it affects my hair alone the first time I use it.</li>
            <li>esp since I live in the hot, humid South.  </li>
            <li>I use more pumps than the instructions call for, massage really well, and then leave it in a clip while I do my other shower stuff.</li>
            <li>I generally have oily hair and thought that this would make my hair super oily.  </li>
            <li>I have straight, long but fine hair and lots of it.</li>
            <li>(most of the other products are thicker).  </li>
            <li>In other words, even though most people lose about 100 strands of hair per day, many of those strands stay on your head attached to other strands of hair if you use volumizing products.</li>
            <li>I have tried other Renpure products before and I LOVE the brand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many sulfate-free shampoos and other products for hair loss.</li>
            <li>I find that I have to use a bit more than the bottle suggests due to the length of my hair</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s mostly because of the foreign concept of a cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li>I seem to use more than with the other product but for the price</li>
            <li>and I cannot use most shampoos without breaking out every other week but</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Wen and used it exclusively for a couple years, but quit due to the cost.</li>
            <li>The thing I love is that I find I can now wash my hair every other day without it getting as greasy.  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft, fluffy (amazing, since i have such fine hair) and smells great!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is now the only product I will use to clean my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is on the fine side, and shoulder length, so I&#x27;ve found that 5-7 pumps is more than enough for each round.</li>
            <li>I have very long fine, wavy hair.</li>
            <li>Smells good, but just not good at all.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Renpure Solutions Cleansing Conditioner at our local Walgreens, and got both the Rosemary Mint, and the Sweet Pomegranate.</li>
            <li>It works much like a normal shampoo--not like a cleansing conditioner.  </li>
            <li>My hair is long and colored slightly, but relatively healthy with a medium to fine wavy texture.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is all natural and kind of puts my hair back to the same unwashed status.  </li>
            <li>It is so concentrated that a very little works to clean and smooth my hair.</li>
            <li>I have fly away dry hair these days and this is the only product that actually put moisture in to the extent that my hair actually lays flat and looks healthy.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, straight and limper than a wet noodle.</li>
            <li>No matter how much product I used and how long I rinsed, I couldn&#x27;t get my hair to feel clean.  </li>
            <li>Shampoo and conditioner in a whole new package.  </li>
            <li>With this my hair seems to be much more moisturized and less frizzy.</li>
            <li>I have tried using more product, less product, letting it sit longer, rinsing longer -</li>
            <li>It worked..you need to use more product ..not less which seems counter productive.  </li>
            <li>I decided that I could do more for less by purshasing organix shampoo.  </li>
            <li>But, I find that the less I do to my hair the better is looking.  </li>
            <li>There is no &amp;#34;one size fits all&amp;#34; with shampoos/cleansers simply because there are so many different hair types-</li>
            <li>It has left my hair so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>, I can truly slather it in and make sure my hair is well saturated (unlike the expensive versions where you&#x27;re more worried about conserving it</li>
            <li>Only caveat I will add is that when my 24 year old daughter tried this rosemary mint cleansing conditioner she didn&#x27;t enjoy it.</li>
            <li>In the shower my hair actually felt more coarse while using this product.</li>
            <li>After trying many different \\&quot;cleansing conditioners\\&quot;, I have finally found one that I will be sticking with!  </li>
            <li>: A lot of the cleansing conditioners are sooo thick, which is nice for moisturizing, but not so much for cleansing...</li>
            <li>Also I use one pump after ive brushed my hair and its the only product I need:)</li>
            <li>Not Wen, but a decent no suds-ing cleanser for your hair.  </li>
            <li>myself, I always do one quick wash (work the conditioner through, then immediately rinse) followed by a second one where I let it sit in my hair for the recommended 3-5 minutes.</li>
            <li>So while expensive, this does seem to be a superior product and worth the high price.</li>
            <li>I normally wash every 2 days but with this I would have to wash daily because the residue left traps more dirt and oils.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this as a beard wash/conditioner.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>My hope was high</li>
            <li>I think I could probably use this in a pinch if I needed to if I used a high quality leave in conditioner</li>
            <li>The only scent experienced while washing is the combination of essential oils in the product, so that the only smells are actual mint and rosemary.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I actually use less of this than the Wen brand and get the same great results.  </li>
            <li>I promptly shelved all of my other product (which the fiance was thrilled to have reclaimed some of the shower space) and will never look back.</li>
            <li>At my age, I can&#x27;t afford to loose hair from excessive tangles, lol.  </li>
            <li>My hair was a little more &amp;#34;unruly&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>and I have to use a little more of it,</li>
            <li>With Renpure, I use the proper amount because it costs 1/3 as much!!</li>
            <li>I think I might try concentrating it more on just the roots and pulling it through the ends with a comb, or hit the ends with a little coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In a matter of four hours, it had gone to \\&quot;okay, a little heavy\\&quot; to \\&quot;ooh, greasy like pomade.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Straight out of the shower, my hair feels super dry and hay-like, not like</li>
            <li>/&gt;Regardless, I was pleasantly surprised that it actually did clean my hair - it didn&#x27;t look like I just went to gym.  </li>
            <li>They either make it very greasy or super dry.</li>
            <li>It really does get your hair nice and clean with minimal effort, but it&#x27;s not particularly &amp;#34;conditioning.&amp;#34; My ends were a hot mess</li>
            <li>Now after a whole month, it&#x27;s like the damage to my hair has been almost completely reversed.</li>
            <li>Afterwards, my hair is very shiny, soft, and not oily at all.</li>
            <li>I tried Wen and it really made my hair soft and gave it body.</li>
            <li>It was very shiny, and ends look better than usual.</li>
            <li>I poured lots of olive oil (and then later, coconut oil) into my hair to bring back some moisture, but honestly, it was like it stripped every last ounce of oil from the hair shaft.  </li>
            <li>Maybe hair gets a bit dryer than without the normal shampoo+conditioner</li>
            <li>Is that normal?</li>
            <li>months in, I notice that I lose about 10-15 strands of hair each time I use Renpure, which still alarms me, but I suppose it&#x27;s normal after all.  </li>
            <li>The consistency is pretty thin compared to wen but the smell is nice and I like the tingly effect it gives my scalp.  </li>
            <li>this is very runny and left my hair feeling funny like it had a residue on it</li>
            <li>After my hair dried it still smelled of lovely mint.</li>
            <li>This is important as I&#x27;m in yoga teacher training and get pretty sweaty everyday.</li>
            <li>I know that probably defeats the purpose of using ren but trust me, I feel like the ingredients are giving my hair nutrients that you don&#x27;t get from a normal shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A Few More TiMes</li>
            <li>I actually,after rinsing the REN out of my hair,had to put my normal conditioner on in order to get a comb through my hair.</li>
            <li>When it dried it looked fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I am a long time Wen user (Fig is my favorite) and started using Ren recently.</li>
            <li>(which I only do on the rare occasion</li>
            <li>it made my hair feel heavy, but after about 3-4 uses my hair began to love it.</li>
            <li>It is by far the most expensive hair care product -  including the most exclusive shampoos and conditioners - that is out there.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not quite the same, but it&#x27;s worth it when I consider the savings.</li>
            <li>I rinsed with warm water, hot water, cold water, cool water; it made no difference.  </li>
            <li>with my short cut that is pretty much 90% of my hair routine.</li>
            <li>The texture of this cleansing conditioner looks like the kind of milk your mom made you drink when you were a kid, all thick and creamy.</li>
            <li>This stuff is magic, a cleansing conditioner with no sulfates, no &amp;#34;clubs&amp;#34; to join, no HUGE price tags.  </li>
            <li>Even though my hair felt dry and not conditioned when I left the shower, it combed out like a dream and after blow drying it was smooth as silk!</li>
            <li>my hair was already clarified with the Castile soap, it would be an easier transition for me than some of the people trying a cleansing conditioner right after using shampoo/products on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>next thing I noticed was that my comb slipped right through my hair.</li>
            <li>does great job on my very thin, oily hair.  </li>
            <li>Right before I&#x27;m done with my shower routine and ready to rinse out my hair, I add a little bit of water again and re-lather, then rinse very, very well.</li>
            <li>and it was to heavy for my fine, straight hair...</li>
            <li>Second hair has been colored several times, it is fine but there is a lot of it,naturally wavy.</li>
            <li>With other shampoos (all sulfate and paraben free), I was still losing clumps of hair.</li>
            <li>With Wen, I was alternating every other wash with a sulfate free shampoo as my hair tended to get oily if I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>It has replaced multiple bottles of hair care items in my shower and my hair hasn&#x27;t looked or felt this nice since I was a little child.</li>
            <li>Although it is a bit like washing your hair with Maalox, you will forget that the minute you see and live with your hair.  </li>
            <li>My advice to new users - READ THE DIRECTIONS.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t live up to advertisements.  </li>
            <li>I turned to a new line of dove shampoo.</li>
            <li>With Renpure, I hardly lost ANY and that was good enough for me to stick with this</li>
            <li>I came across Renpure and it was available at my local Target for only $7!</li>
            <li>I think, if you wanted to go through the trouble, you could make your own personal cleanser/conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I made sure my hair was thoroughly wet and began to work the product through it, following all directions on the bottle to the letter.  </li>
            <li>It blew dry nicely and I dried it without any products so that I could get a real idea of how well it worked.  </li>
            <li>It is soft and manageable as well as shiny and the color is vibrant again.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>I woke up one very early morning to the television still on, and an infomercial for &#x27;Wen&#x27;.</li>
            <li>It is very soft.</li>
            <li>I will profess what touching her dry hair is very nice and soft with this shampoo while with other shampoos it can be stiff and dry.</li>
            <li>From my experience,  the hotter the water, the better (especially if you have thin, fine hair and don&#x27;t want  or need the &amp;#34;conditioning&amp;#34; effect).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it better to just wash my hair with plain old conditioner.</li>
            <li>If you have a family, especially teens with long hair, that could easily add up to $80-$100 a month.</li>
            <li>its fur was so soft!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Within a week of using Renpure, I noticed is that my hair seemed to be falling out more than usual.</li>
            <li>Many people who stop using shampoo experience increased shedding because these 100 strands actually fall out instead of falling out and getting stuck to other</li>
            <li>The first ingredient was the same, purified water.</li>
            <li>First of all, I didn&#x27;t realize that it said on the back that you have to do 10-12 pumps each time you use it.</li>
            <li>I got several compliments on my hair the first time I used this stuff and continue to get them.  </li>
            <li>She has wonderful Asian hair and it is coarse and can be difficult to manage.</li>
            <li>The scent is refreshing, but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Its not drying my hair out, and made its soft and manageable!</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li>I use this exact same routine no matter which cleansing conditioner I use and again</li>
            <li>After a week I swear his hair was so soft and no dandruff at all!  </li>
            <li>Instructions suggest going 6 uses, then using a traditional shampoo for a deeper clean, then back to the product.  </li>
            <li>There is absolutely no lather yet my hair is soft and clean.</li>
            <li>The pomegranate is very close to Sweet Almond mint, just a little difference in fragrance.</li>
            <li>There are less costly products available on Amazon that are a closer match to Wen than this product is.</li>
            <li>It was surprisingly easy to comb through and dried faster than when I use shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine, thin, long hair and most conditioning</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions super carefully this time, thinking it was me making mistakes, but that wasn&#x27;t the case</li>
            <li>I have straight, stringy, tangly hair that normally looks greasy by days&#x27; end, especially in the Florida humidity.</li>
            <li>(My only positive on this product is the scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, the recommended 8-10 pumps of product is barely enough to make it half way through the top layer my hair.</li>
            <li>I find my red dye does not fade as quickly as it does with traditional lathering shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have rather thin and very frizzy hair (but a lot of them) and this conditioner leaves them clean, but a bit stiff - kind of like some of the voluminizing shampoos I used to have.</li>
            <li>Over the years I&#x27;ve tried many conditioners, and every one of them left my fine, limp, volume-challenged hair greasier, limper, and less voluminous.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Conservatively speaking, it will cost an average person $20 a month MINIMUM to clean and condition their hair.</li>
            <li>Perhaps if you have very greasy hair normally, you might want something this drying, to balance it out; for normal to dry hair, I&#x27;d stay away.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps if you have very greasy hair normally, you might want something this drying, to balance it out; for normal to dry hair, I&#x27;d stay away.  </li>
            <li>Mix together in my palms a bit more of the Suave Coconut and some Herbal Essences Set Me Up gel, then work that combo through sopping wet hair, raking out any remaining tangles or loose hairs.&lt;br /&gt;5)</li>
            <li>While the smell of Herbal Essences is amazing, it left my hair a big greasy mess.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t remember the last time my hair stayed clean this long between shampoos.</li>
            <li>It is hard to massage through your hair and you have to use a lot more than the directions call for for cleansing.  </li>
            <li>My hair really didn&#x27;t get soft again until the next shampoo with another</li>
            <li>But many of the reviews were intriguing, the product wasn&#x27;t expensive, so decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li>am African-Amercian  with natural hair, my would be type 3b/c.</li>
            <li>This allows my hair to remain soft</li>
            <li>For anyone that care I have that stubborn white/black mixed hair that was very damaged and curly when I was a kid</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really surprised.  </li>
            <li>&amp; wow.</li>
            <li>IF I run my fingers thru my hair the crispness goes away and my hair feels soft.</li>
            <li>Remember the early days of the Aussie hair products?</li>
            <li>Before Proctor &amp; Gamble bought them, they came from a family company near where I lived.</li>
            <li>; method after my aunt telling me she uses homemade apple cider vinegar and baking soda to wash her hair, it feels so soft like you;d</li>
            <li>I tried to go natural on my hair and not use any heating tools</li>
            <li>After trying wen which is only a conditioner, not a cleanser, i was really looking forward to trying this.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft.</li>
            <li>I  also have a lot of natural wave in my hair that I  never get to see..</li>
            <li>So what I have done is made a spray bottle of water mixed with some of the product to mist in my hair gently after the shower.</li>
            <li>Ren is non foaming and all natural.</li>
            <li>When I saw the natural ingredients and no additives I had to try it.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair shiny, bouncy, and soft.</li>
            <li>It is still soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural also, so you&#x27;re not pouring chemicals into your skin.</li>
            <li>I am thinking it is not so much what you are putting on your hair as it is what you are NOT putting on your hair; such as, sulfates, dyes, parabens, gluten, phthalates, propylene glycol, etc.  </li>
            <li>but as far as I can tell no chemicals.</li>
            <li>It was not in any way silky, moisturizing or soft.</li>
            <li>I also have rosacea and extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This product is definitely far inferior to Wen, per my experience.  </li>
            <li>The tips I can give is to make sure you massage your hair for at least 3 min, then comb the product from root to tip, wait another 2-3 min then rinse</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>My Scalp Sensitive.</li>
            <li>It at least made it look like I had more hair.</li>
            <li>My hair got soft, but stayed curly, and the frizz went away.&lt;br</li>
            <li>,when I put this product on my hair,it did not work anywhere near like</li>
            <li>And just to clarify,yes,my hair was completely detangled before I stepped in the shower,so I know that wasn&#x27;t the problem.</li>
            <li>Does not leave hair soft and does not detangle</li>
            <li>Based on the infomercials I have seen for its competitor, I was expecting (hoping) my hair would be sleek and soft after using this product.  </li>
            <li>I use 5-6 pumps on the front and back of my head  and 5-6 pumps on the sides and really rub it in.  </li>
            <li>I ended up with soft bouncy curls and my color though it does fade..it does not like with shampoo..</li>
            <li>will last a reasonable length of time even at recommended usage levels.  </li>
            <li>I am so surprised that I like this product.  </li>
            <li>The bonus of this product is that your hair stays soft for days after using it.</li>
            <li>Her hair is silky soft and doesn&#x27;t get tangled.</li>
            <li>, Somehow I mistakenly believed this would cleanse my hair and leave it soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft shiny manageable.  </li>
            <li>It left my hair very silky.  </li>
            <li>leaves my hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li>hair shiny, silky, and no where near as knotty.</li>
            <li>I have never dyed it, so it is natural.</li>
            <li>Even if I wasn&#x27;t sensitive to this product I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li>This seems to be helping my hair restore its natural oils.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft and is so manageable to style.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s soft and silky.</li>
            <li>really think they need to go back to the drawing board and keep the idea, but toss this formula.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way below WEN, which I use frequently.  </li>
            <li>, I have natural 4C hair</li>
            <li>My has is soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not anywhere near the quality of Wen.</li>
            <li>but I will not purchase again, as I prefer the Salon Grafix formula of all the products I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>Maybe my skin is just sensitive to it</li>
            <li>I understand that completely.</li>
            <li>My hair is now soft again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An</li>
            <li>I am about to purchase my second bottle, and because of the reasonable cost this will probably be my shampoo for the duration.</li>
            <li>Use as directed and your hair will be soooo soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I stick my head under the shower water for like 1.3 seconds to add a bit of water, and then with my fingertips directly on my scalp I massage vigorously all over my head/hair.</li>
            <li>I feel like all the foaming/massaging really helps in avoiding the greasiness that I think would be likely if you just slapped it on and then rinsed it out.</li>
            <li>if your a frequent shampooer because it&#x27;s not harsh</li>
            <li>, it makes it soft and shiny with no greasiness.</li>
            <li>However, I was pleasantly surprised with the results I achieved.</li>
            <li>I have never found 2-in-1 type shampoos to work for me because they add too much conditioning at my scalp where I don&#x27;t need it, and not enough conditioning at the ends where I do need it.  </li>
            <li>and she has natural hair.</li>
            <li>After letting it sit in my hair for about ten minutes while in the shower I also used just two pumps more on my towel dried hair.</li>
            <li>This was definitely worth the money I spent, and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase this again and recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li>My hair still keeps most of the essential oils in, but it doesn&#x27;t feel so heavy and look so oily.  </li>
            <li>The texture is like thin yogurt or kefir and smell actually really nice</li>
            <li>This shampoo was okay but not amazing.  </li>
            <li>have dry, damaged, relaxed black hair and on top of that, very very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I realized Chaz Dean really found the special formulation and not all companies can do that, not sure why other companies cannot mimic WEN, but, I will rather spend my money on WEN that has been proven right on my hair and skin for 5 years.</li>
            <li>This conditioner has made my hair super soft and shiny all over without feeling weighed down.</li>
            <li>I have hair that sort of varies between wavy and curly depending on the length, time of year, weather, alignment of the stars, and what it feels like doing that day, and it&#x27;s pretty dry to boot.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, my hair never feels flat ever with Renpure, even a few days out from washing it.  </li>
            <li>typically use Wen Sweet Almond Mint.</li>
            <li>while looking for some decent, affordable shampoo and conditioner that didn&#x27;t smell like a chick, I was coming up short.</li>
            <li>First age 45, female, white.</li>
            <li>I give Renpure only 4 stars because it doesnt completely detangle my hair, so I use it as a \\&quot;shampoo\\&quot; and then follow up with my normal conditioner.  </li>
            <li>My hair is straight and thick but the individual strands are fine and soft</li>
            <li>Some have mentioned that this product can put a little weight on your strands and that is true.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not huge on the scent, and my hair seems to take a bit longer to dry, but it leaves my hair surprisingly clean, soft, and very shiny.</li>
            <li>I have never tried Wen, but I don&#x27;t want to at such a high price.  </li>
            <li>However, they were far enough down the list that I decided to give it a try anyway, and it seems to be working out pretty well for my hair without too much buildup.</li>
            <li>(total cost for both is less than the cost of this product) and my hair is light and bouncy and shiny.  </li>
            <li>so my hair can get really dry, but most hair products are too heavy for my hair type...</li>
            <li>My hair dry, and when using the complimentary products, my hair totally sticky.</li>
            <li>With my head still upside-down, scrunch out as much water as I can while disrupting the curl clumps as little as possible, then plop the whole mess of hair into a t-shirt and tie it up before standing up, so that the curls essentially sit on top of my head and set themselves while the t-shirt absorbs the excess water.</li>
            <li>I typically have to wash my hair every day because it starts to look &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; after a day, but the next morning it still looked great and could possibly go two days without washing, but I&#x27;m not sure if I can go a day without washing.  </li>
            <li>I have long hair, curly and treated with keratin and this works with all that very well</li>
            <li>This product is not nearly as thick as the Wen product and I have found does not create the same results.</li>
            <li>This did nothing I could tell, other than weigh down my roots and make them look more oily.</li>
            <li>This has really worked for my fine, thin, medium-length, colored hair.</li>
            <li>This left my fine curls limp.</li>
            <li>Winter has dried my fragile baby fine hair out, so I thought I would try this to repair it.</li>
            <li>The first few times I used it everything was decent, but after a week of use it was unbearable.</li>
            <li>I live in a high desert climate..very very dry.  </li>
            <li>I now use it on my dog because she has sensitive skin and needs as much natural oil retention as possible.</li>
            <li>when using this product you really have to massage your scalp and hair from root to tip really work this stuff in for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>use a few more pumps than suggested, working it into my scalp with a wide comb, and pulling it through with my fingers.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s shown on the bottle is a fairly traditionally pretty blonde with long hair.</li>
            <li>The directions are more like guidelines - the amount they say to use might be far too much for short, thin hair (like mine) or not nearly enough for longer thicker hair.</li>
            <li>I am able to use just 4 pumps and I have thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li>Sure it isn&#x27;t at thick (the actual conditioner)</li>
            <li>If you have very dry hair, or your hair is curly/ethnic/coarse and deep conditioning is what you need, this may be exactly right for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No matter how much or how little of the product you use and by following directions exactly - it always makes your hair look oily</li>
            <li>I have extremely long, thick hair that is very fine.</li>
            <li>Ren Rosemary Mint did a good job at cleaning my scalp, however it left my hair dull, weighed down, and oily looking.  </li>
            <li>You would not believe what a major difference in texture, feels like a baby&#x27;s hair...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad i purchased this before i read the negative reviews!  </li>
            <li>I have natural curly hair and recently learned that most shampoos are not good for curly hair.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t feel as \\&quot;luxurious\\&quot; on my hair as Wen does, and I don&#x27;t feel my hair is as silky after drying, but I&#x27;m pretty pleased with the results (especially the shine).</li>
            <li>It felt really dried out when I used the product on its own, and I could not easily comb through it in the shower like you would with Wen.  </li>
            <li>At the first use I when I dispensed the conditioner it was super thin, not even close to the thickness of Wen.  </li>
            <li>but after only a few uses of this product, my hair is back to being luxurious, soft, and smooth.</li>
            <li>Add a bit of Suave Coconut conditioner and work out the rest of the tangles, then run my head under the water just enough to get it super wet again - not to actually rinse out the conditioner.</li>
            <li>Well worth a little elbow grease on the tub.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen less shedding, less breakage, more thickness, richer color and</li>
            <li>I tried Wen and didn&#x27;t see a dramatic enough difference to spend that kind of money on it.</li>
            <li>Second day hair, which used to be my best day, was now looking a little dirty.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the consistency of Wen - very much &#x27;watered down&#x27; in comparison -</li>
            <li>I spent more time on my hair with one product than I usually do with two.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t want to cut it), and it did not make my hair greasy only soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t want to go back to regular shampoo and conditioner, as I knew the harsh chemicals would wreak havoc on all the work I&#x27;d done to cut them out in the first place.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve barely made a dent.</li>
            <li>For a store-bought cleaning conditioner I was happily surprised by this product, I&#x27;ve been using it for several months now</li>
            <li>I have soft African hair</li>
            <li>My hair is really fine and slightly curly, with the extra wildness that going grey sometimes adds.  </li>
            <li>Used it for a week then went back to my old stuff.</li>
            <li>My shine came back and soft..</li>
            <li>I have mid back, very curly/prone to frizz, color treated hair and have been using cleansing conditioners for several years.</li>
            <li>It is thin, and not terribly conditioning.</li>
            <li>I could probably use this instead of shampoo and conditioner entirely, but I kind of like having an excuse to take my long Saturday showers, plus I usually use styling products on weekends if we&#x27;re going out or something, and I like my routine to feel</li>
            <li>However, it does have a faint minty smell and leaves a slight tingle after washing out, which feels very refreshing (and could be all in my imagination!)</li>
            <li>When I saw 10-12 pumps, I wondered if the price was really justified, but I used I think 10 pumps, maybe 12, and it didn&#x27;t empty half the bottle or anything</li>
            <li>This is the real deal - extremely affordable, makes your hair soft and manageable, and it doesn&#x27;t smell like a Cosmopolitan magazine perfume sample page farted in your hair after you wash with it.</li>
            <li>I was impressed that it actually wasn&#x27;t bad!</li>
            <li>IF you wash your hair everyday (I usually don&#x27;t), it may be fine for you, but too intense for me.</li>
            <li>I have color-treated fine straight hair, a few inches past my shoulders.  </li>
            <li>I started sort-of no-pooing last year, and for the past maybe six months, I&#x27;ve been pretty steadily shampooing once a week, rinsing every day.</li>
            <li>Some people describe it as super thick, leaves hair dry on the ends and really greasy on the scalp.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely liquidy, and it doesn&#x27;t detangle/condition my hair very well.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it every other day for a week and my hair is feeling much healthier.</li>
            <li>First, use waaaay more than the directions say to use, especially if you&#x27;ve got crazy long/thick/curly hair like I do.</li>
            <li>I did not have to use as much either due to</li>
            <li>I give this four stars only because it does leave ur hair smelling good,it works ok for the price,but not good enough, gave it to my 12yr</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d read other reviews that warned to rinse really,</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first, my hair is very long and curly so most hair products simply don&#x27;t work well on my hair.</li>
            <li>Not a single tangle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I went to sleep and woke up with not a single hair out of place.</li>
            <li>Its also lightweight, not greasy, not dry and drys faster as well as</li>
            <li>This product is not as good as either the expensive stuff it tries to imitate nor the inexpensive stuff.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s particularly good for thick hair, but then I don&#x27;t have thick hair, so how would I know?</li>
            <li>I purchased this shampoo at bed bath and beyond because they were out of my usual conditioner (which I love but wasn&#x27;t in the mood to track down that day).</li>
            <li>The first week, my hair was a little frizzy</li>
            <li>First a little background on my hair type.  </li>
            <li>Speaking of smells, I was skeptical at first about the scent for this Ren Pure conditioner - I had previously tried the sweet pomegranate.</li>
            <li>This shampoo cleanses dirt and gently cleans my scalp, so that there&#x27;s always a little bit of natural oil left.  </li>
            <li>The second ingredients differ: the one that made my hair feel really greasy had sorbitol (sugar), and the other had cocamidopopyl (coconut oil).</li>
            <li>but I went through that with WEN the first few weeks.</li>
            <li>it dried frizz-less.. with really pretty waves..</li>
            <li>I purchased this a few weeks ago and I didn&#x27;t read any reviews first.  </li>
            <li>Does Chaz Dean not realize that by lowering the price to a reasonable level he would have a MUCH wider customer base, and therefore make more money?</li>
            <li>My normally frizzy air dried air turned into soft waves!</li>
            <li>Green and crisp.)</li>
            <li>And when you think you&#x27;ve rinsed enough, rinse some more, This system really doesn&#x27;t increase your shower time, because you are cutting down on the whole lather-rinse-repeat scenario.</li>
            <li>really ways it down and</li>
            <li>At first, it left my hair a bit limp, but that was just the first few shampoos.</li>
            <li>Before I begin, I would like to submit a list of factors that I find relevant to a review of a product like this; we have well water (hard water), not fluoridated, chlorinated city water; I have long, wavy to curly hair that is of medium coarseness; I am white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, this cleansing conditioner as well as others make my hair &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; so I have gone back to using the other Renpure shampoo and conditioner products that are really good.</li>
            <li>First use had just over what I consider normal hair loss, which was a lot less than previous shampoo/conditioner</li>
            <li>I let my hair dry naturally.</li>
            <li>and I rinse it really, really well in slightly cooler water than the rest of my shower.  </li>
            <li>On days when I don&#x27;t need as much control, I&#x27;ll use others that have less cones and holding power.</li>
            <li>I did 3 pumps at first and it felt as though I was rubbing shampoo through my hair- very odd.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed after I stepped out of the shower and dried off my hair was that it actually SQUEAKED!</li>
            <li>I have long blonde hair which is thick, but each hair is fine</li>
            <li>My hair is super thick, over-processed and brittle at the ends yet still oily at my scalp.</li>
            <li>The consistency of Renpure is like when you water down the last of WEN that doesn&#x27;t pump out of the bottle, but costs too much to throw away.   </li>
            <li>I live in upstate NY and as everyone knows who lives in cold winter regions, our hair &amp; skin endure serious damage during these long, dry winter months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for making this awesome product!</li>
            <li>My hair tends to naturally be dry and because of my sulfate free regimen, my scalp produces far less sebum than when I used harsh detergents on my hair.</li>
            <li>I found that my hair was very sensitive to other shampoos and conditioners it took me months to find something that did not dry out my hair and even then my hair still was not where I wanted to be.</li>
            <li>and I wash my hair every other day normally.</li>
            <li>I have tried various &amp;#34;cleansing conditioners&amp;#34; over the past few months as I&#x27;m trying to grow my hair out and would like to keep it healthy.</li>
            <li>hair is SO soft, tangles far less.</li>
            <li>&quot; my hair was just literally a glide with no tangles almost the second I applied the product,but with this,no matter how much I used,my hair became one big,tangled mess.</li>
            <li>have fine thin hair, with an oily scalp and drier ends.  </li>
            <li>My hair is thin and fine and must be washed daily because it gets oily.</li>
            <li>I have extremely fine hair, so I was a little worried about a &amp;#34;cleansing conditioner&amp;#34; making it heavy and flat and greasy.</li>
            <li>although they were either really good or really bad, I felt like BC</li>
            <li>So sad--for something that smells so good to behave so badly.</li>

            <li> Win win.</li>
            <li> and it looks great.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d choose the RenPure over Wen based on how great my hair looks AND the added bonus is</li>
            <li> Great product, I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> But renpure is great</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> so great.</li>
            <li> This product may be great for some hair types, but for me it was not.  </li>
            <li> I, also at times, use their Argon Luxurious Shampoo and Conditioner and equally love them!!</li>
            <li> You will ABSOLUTELY LOVE this product!!</li>
            <li> Amazing product!</li>
            <li> They both smell nice, however!)</li>
            <li> This shampoo is the best solution that we have been able to find for her.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I switched to this product along with Nexus Pro Mend, Split End Binding!!! :)</li>
            <li> Use at your own risk!</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant.</li>
            <li> My curls for perfectly clump together, and easy to detangle.</li>
            <li> This really is an amazing product, and I&#x27;ve had great results with it.  </li>
            <li> I read it isn&#x27;t so great for some people, but it works great for me :)</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a good quality (but affordable) cleansing conditioner, skip this brand and check out L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s EverCreme and EverCurl cleansing conditioners.</li>
            <li> This works surprisingly well.</li>
            <li> Good luck</li>
            <li> my hair felt like it needed a good cleansing.</li>
            <li> And they were really good for drug store/department store products.</li>
            <li> it was supposedly &amp;#34;on sale&amp;#34; so this is definitely a good price.</li>
            <li> good price and I like the way my hair feels</li>
            <li> This cleansing conditioner is every bit as good as Wen for a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Good value for price.</li>
            <li> Not as good as Wen but close</li>
            <li> I have tried Wen with good results but the cost is prohibitive.</li>
            <li> A good thing that I noticed is that it doesnt seem to leave residue like Wen does.  </li>
            <li> They have a great smell and a nice consistency.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful lightly minty scent with hints of rosemary.</li>
            <li> get yourself a good boar bristle brush and use this stuff.</li>
            <li> I really loved it but can no longer justify the cost.</li>
            <li> It smells good and has good ingredients</li>
            <li> I have absolutely loved the Avalon Organics lemon conditioner and will continue buying it and telling people about it instead.</li>
            <li> I figured hey, its a good deal</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not every product is good for every person.</li>
            <li> I have used \\&quot;Hair One\\&quot; from Sally&#x27;s,with satisfactory results,and I have also tried \\&quot;Salon Grafix\\&quot; cleansing conditioner,and had good results from that one,also.</li>
            <li> I think if you&#x27;ve wanted to give one of these products a try for a while but had sticker shock, this is a good one to try.  </li>
            <li> Works good on colored, hair too.</li>
            <li> but the mint is good too.</li>
            <li> It helps to use a fair amount of water to work it through.</li>
            <li> but im going to assume there will not be good results because of the weight the product adds to the hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s just my hair type, because there are plenty of good reviews.</li>
            <li> A good alternative to Wen.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, it does smell good and it did perserve my color.  </li>
            <li> This is just as good to me.</li>
            <li> The price is more than fair and you can control cost while RENPURE takes care of your hair!</li>
            <li> Some shampoos couldn&#x27;t even get it all out and thoroughly clean my hair but this wonderful conditioner does.</li>
            <li> But after I realized it still cleans my hair perfectly and keeps it feeling smooth and amazing, i loved it all over.</li>
            <li> It rinses clean, smells great, and the ingredient list is great.</li>
            <li> Love the feeling of shampooing with it; even if it doesn&#x27;t make foam the texture is great in the hair and you can feel it washing even without the foam.</li>
            <li> Does a great job, but I like the Loreal non sulfate better.  </li>
            <li> With this, I&#x27;m able to skip a day and my hair looks great.</li>
            <li> This product works great, even better than Wen did for my hair.  </li>
            <li> It smells amazing, and my curls are gorgeous and hydrated after use.</li>
            <li> I love this cleansing conditioner it works great for my hair</li>
            <li> After using it, I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> It smells great when I&#x27;m washing my hair and doesn&#x27;t leave an overwhelming scent when it&#x27;s washed out.</li>
            <li> good, kind of an herbal minty</li>
            <li> Superior products at a reasonable price, what could be better!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the scent of this!</li>
            <li> Also...rinse, rinse, rinse and then rinse some more!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Love Renpure!</li>
            <li> and now I&#x27;m in love with it!</li>
            <li> but it also cleanses my hair without using any chemicals, my hair feels so much better now!</li>
            <li> I love the smell!</li>
            <li> and I love that as well!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a more affordable alternative option to WEN and this is it for me!</li>
            <li> the smell is pretty great, too!</li>
            <li> It had a really wonderful scent and works exactly as indicated on the hair.  </li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I tried Renpure!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I first pumped the product, the smell was absolutely wonderful.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Renpure works better!</li>
            <li> I am 100% satisfied!</li>
            <li> Have already ordered more and cancelled our Wen shipments!</li>
            <li> anyway, I love the product!  </li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  </li>
            <li> It smelled great, my hair was easy to comb through afterwards , it all washed out.....</li>
            <li> I can honestly say I love using this!</li>
            <li> It really is amazing.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and my scalp tingles when I scrub with it.</li>
            <li> This is amazing.</li>
            <li> my hair feels amazing.</li>
            <li> The pomegranate smells amazing too.  </li>
            <li> The scent is so amazing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s important to me that my shampoo leaves my hair looking great without lots of styling products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice now and my hair looks amazing.</li>
            <li> At this point apply conditioner (I use Renpure Amazing Miracle and they pair well together).</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> It feels amazing on the head and continues that way for awhile after.  </li>
            <li> Amazing how nice you hair can be after you commit to not shapooing anymore.</li>
            <li> Really nice, esp.</li>
            <li> They both smell nice, however!)Pantene</li>
            <li> The fragrance was just as nice as the WEN.</li>
            <li> 1/3 price of Wen and effective.</li>
            <li> was a combination I used when I was making my own cc.</li>
            <li> as well!aking my own cc.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own</li>
            <li> This is a really nice cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li> It has a really nice fragrance to it.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and minty but I need a heavier consistancy for my hiar.  </li>
            <li> Liked the Wen</li>
            <li> This works great, left my hair looking beautiful!  </li>
            <li> I liked the ingredients.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get a comb through it without some kind of leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> But the best thing is that I noticed I wasn&#x27;t losing as much hair in the shower.</li>
            <li> Okay, not as good as Wen.</li>
            <li> I bought it rather hesitantly after using Wen and loving it.  </li>
            <li> The shine is nice, but I feel like I need to go rewash my hair.</li>
            <li> A Littler Nice</li>
            <li> The smell is nice, and it gave my scalp a nice tingle too.  </li>
            <li> Thank you Renpure for creating such an awesome product at a great price.</li>
            <li> and I both have our own bottles</li>
            <li> The smell is nice and I like how this product gives a cooling tingle on my scalp.</li>
            <li> I also noticed the ingredients list has words I can pronounce, which is kind of nice.  </li>
            <li> here is my honest to god</li>
            <li> Honestly, try it for yourself</li>
            <li> Has a really nice smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it is especially worth it to me for the color preservation.</li>
            <li> my hair needs it&#x27;s own oils to fluorish.</li>
            <li> but it is effective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the holy grail, but it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found so far for the price since my beloved Trader Joe&#x27;s Nourish conditioner had &#x27;</li>
            <li> It did nothing for me, it does smell nice</li>
            <li> I will say that it had a nice cool tingly feeling after a couple of minutes and the smell was great.</li>
            <li> My hair feels great, not greasy or dry; its perfect.</li>
            <li> , they have a product with which I am very pleased, and I&#x27;m also pleased with the money I will be saving.</li>
            <li> However, as a mild styler and leave in, this stuff works great.</li>
            <li> I was actually super happy when I got to the end of the bottle.</li>
            <li> This stuff works perfect and doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try this WEN-like product since it was so much more affordable than WEN, and I discovered that it works even better!  </li>
            <li> , my Pixie cut is even more FABULOUS for me!!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be glad you did! :))</li>
            <li> It cleans and conditions better than Wen, and of course does a better job than RenPure!  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try this, as I&#x27;d seen a lot of cleansing conditioners that just weren&#x27;t effective or had too many fragrances, chemicals, etc.</li>
            <li> In a nice unbreakable bottle with convenient pump :-)</li>
            <li> The pomegranate one gave my hair more of the silky feel, which I liked more.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So thrilled this is one of the scents because it&#x27;s literally my favorite.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using it, my hair is soft and has a beautiful shine!  </li>
            <li> Natural and smells great!</li>
            <li> The best no-suds shampoo I have tried, this shampoo cleans without completely stripping.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance wasn&#x27;t as minty/herbal as I would have liked, but that&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> I have hip-length hair that is very fine</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine</li>
            <li> My hair really looked good, and was manageable, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, with continued use, I just kept losing hair!</li>
            <li> I first reviewed the Renpure Sweet Pomegranate Cleansing Conditioner, I was very happy with it, and gave it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Seems to work pretty great too.</li>
            <li> Great price and works wonders on my fine but full hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was very light</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to Wen if you have pretty healthy hair.</li>
            <li> When it comes out of the bottle the mint is very potent, but as you work it into your hair the rosemary starts to shine through for a most pleasant combination, particularly if one uses a bit of it as a leave-in.</li>
            <li> and it doesnt feel as good whilst in the shower, but the result is nothing less than exquisite.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, but leaves my hair super greasy!</li>
            <li> Huge fan!</li>
            <li> A huge difference!</li>
            <li> and I find I like this better.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Love</li>
            <li> I gave it one star for many reasons.  </li>
            <li> so you end up wasting a  lot more product.  </li>
            <li> dont care what anyone says I love this stuff</li>
            <li> It smells about a million times better than this Renpure stuff anyway.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Point is, as an obsessive hair washer, I absolutely love this stuff</li>
            <li> I love shampooing my hair with this.</li>
            <li> I tried it anyway and found what many have said, it is runny and does not lather like shampoo.</li>
            <li> If they could come out with a truly color safe formula that uses oils like jojoba oil, I&#x27;d be lining up to buy it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You do need to be sure you rinse your hair thoroughly before, spend 1-2 minutes massaging it into your scalp</li>
            <li> I love the Rosemary Mint shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of a conditioning cleanser.</li>
            <li> I put most of it onto my scalp</li>
            <li> My hair is softer and in better condition than ever before.  </li>
            <li> Smells amazing and feels fantastic.</li>
            <li> It kinda feels like I&#x27;m washing with smooth, silky, and watery conditioner, which feels nice but doesn&#x27;t make me think of &amp;#34;good&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This stuff seems okay to me.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t gotten to the point where i can go more than one day without washing though,</li>
            <li> This saves me a bit of time in the morning (which I appreciate) and smells absolutely lovely.  </li>
            <li> I love this co wash works</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> love the smell.</li>
            <li> I love that it suggests to use this as a leave in conditioner too.</li>
            <li> I tried Wen for awhile, and although it had more chemicals than I would have liked, I did enjoy it.</li>
            <li> but because of an increasingly hectic schedule I kept running out before I had time to make more.</li>
            <li> and I love that</li>
            <li> Love this product for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> I love the rosemary mint smell and tingle.....</li>
            <li> Plus the ingredients are safer then most hair products.</li>
            <li> Many people spend more on a cup of coffee than what this costs.  </li>
            <li> It adds a lot of shine and makes my hair look and feel healthy.</li>
            <li> They are not a &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; so they don&#x27;t have suds, but that is what makes them so much better for your hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is silkier, healthier, and more manageable since using these products.</li>
            <li> And we all use these products and love them.</li>
            <li> and it being on sale at Walgreens on payday) for me to buy more.</li>
            <li> I have damaged hair, so I need to stick to the more moisturizing Wen Fig.</li>
            <li> I am giving my bottle to my fiance, he will love it.</li>
            <li> Now I put the product on my ends, let it sit, then rinse the top with 2 pumps diluted in about 1/4 cup of water.  </li>
            <li> smells in my hair, but this has more like floral scent to it).  </li>
            <li> Its not horrible but does not help at all with my hair.</li>
            <li> but I guess I will stick with wen untils something better comes along.</li>
            <li> Ren is better than any foaming shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I agree with all of those who love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> When I went to the store in search of a conditioner I was pleased to see these on the shelf.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> My hair was finally soft, smooth and shiny again and the best part about it</li>
            <li> Smells mostly like mint, and it doesn&#x27;t linger on you once your hair dries.</li>
            <li> Certainly love the price better than Wen.  </li>
            <li> Also, Renpure has a longer list of ingredients mostly oils from plants like coco nut, sea weed, etc</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given bottles to all my girlfriends (and yes, they love it too).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously so glad I picked up a bottle of this Target.</li>
            <li> After two uses of this, I can already tell I love it.</li>
            <li> much more affordable.</li>
            <li> It was more that squeaky feeling like when you are shampooing.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> But as my hair got used to it it got softer and started behaving a lot better.</li>
            <li> so I kept using more and more.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and i have to say i like this better</li>
            <li> It does take some getting used to (it doesn&#x27;t lather), but I love it.</li>
            <li> and I love the results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I never had tried wen but after using renpure I might try wen to see if its better.</li>
            <li> I have tried many brands of cleansing conditioner because I did not want to fork out the $$$ for Wen - it is quite pricy.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to buy more any time soon.)</li>
            <li> She had a problem with oiliness, I will have to tell her about people saying to use more if oiliness happens, which we didn&#x27;t know about.</li>
            <li> I do keep it away from the water so that water doesn&#x27;t get into the bottle from the top.</li>
            <li> It feels amazing, isn&#x27;t sticky and looks smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> I suspect it will work better on my husband&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I love love love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love the tingle i get when i usr</li>
            <li> I love this and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I think it works even better than Wen.</li>
            <li> Plus, I am in love with the smell.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my curls, so I avoid sulfates, sulfides and &#x27;cones like the plague.  </li>
            <li> &#x3D;)  </li>
            <li> like it did for me &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> My hair looks and feels lovely using this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve wanted to try one of these types of systems for a while, but most of the natural/organic/sulfate-free stuff gave me severe sticker shock</li>
            <li> I saw this at Target and decided to give it a try, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Like I said, though, I love it, so</li>
            <li> has really given me confidence again great looking hair</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s more of the consistency of a conditioner.</li>
            <li> being said, there are some tricks to getting the most out of this stuff.</li>
            <li> like I tend to get, put some more on the ends.</li>
            <li> And this bottle lasted me about 2 months washing twice a week, so if you&#x27;re a daily hair washer, maybe this isn&#x27;t the best thing out there for you.</li>
            <li> so you may need to use more.</li>
            <li> My hair is softer, more manageable and in much better condition then when I used Wen.</li>
            <li> I love this cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s why THIS one (Renpure mint) is my favorite</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> This works OK, but is not as luxe as Wen</li>
            <li> and I had to use more.</li>
            <li> I do not have to add more.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Months later - This one is the best.  </li>
            <li> This one works the best for my hair, it leaves my hair soft, manageable and it does not strip my hair color like shampoo does (even the sulfate free shampoo does).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, the performance, scent, pricing, and form of this hair cleanser are all magnificent assets, with which I wholeheartedly recommend it to everyone who bothers to ask my opinion on such things.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Pomegranate is better</li>
            <li> I have to get us to the fact there is no (damaging) suds when I lather, but the commercials for Wen made be more cognizant if what I should expect.  </li>
            <li> When I saw a twin pack of Ren in BB&amp;B for $13, I figured \\&quot;why not give it a try?\\&quot; I wanted to love it for the price,</li>
            <li> I love mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff works great and is soooooo much cheaper than Wen.</li>
            <li> I use this every time I shower and the more</li>
            <li> the more I love it.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner leaves my hair light, bouncy and healthier than ever before!</li>
            <li> Had to use another conditioner after just to be able to comb and style hair.  </li>
            <li> Okay, check off two requirements.</li>
            <li> Ok so NO</li>
            <li> My favorite cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> Love this cowash.</li>
            <li> They are thicker and work better than RenPure.</li>
            <li> RenPure is MUCH more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to checking out more of the line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li> Gave Ren to my fiance to have him try it, thinking that with his shorter hair it may work better, and rinse out easier.</li>
            <li> My hair looks healthy.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> In fact, it looks cleaner, and my scalp feels better.</li>
            <li> Tried this and love it.</li>
            <li> You have to make sure you rinse well.</li>
            <li> It smells okay,</li>
            <li> nothing really memorable.</li>
            <li> It smells ok, but not rosemary mint.  </li>
            <li> I hoped Renpure&#x27;s Cleansing Conditioner would be better.</li>
            <li> This one smells wonderful, but it too left my hair in need of a conditioner.</li>
            <li> I hope to see even more improvement in my hair :)</li>
            <li> Now it needs more slip because it&#x27;s so long.)&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> and I absolutely LOVE the way it makes my hair feel</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want to massage it in the way you would shampoo - something like a wide-toothed comb, or just using your fingers, is a much better option.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with my hair again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I just ordered on bottle.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> love this stuff.</li>
            <li> but it took much more to coat my hair than I thought.</li>
            <li> OK  for &amp;#34;copy&amp;#34; of the actualy WREN product however I probably won&#x27;t be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Renpure Coconut Crème Cowash through Amazon on a recommendation and found it to be MUCH more drying than any of the Wen cleansing conditioners.  </li>
            <li> The product is okay</li>
            <li> , I hope you love it as much as me!!!!</li>
            <li> Thanks you!!!!</li>
            <li> My hair has lots of body &amp; feels nice and clean.  </li>
            <li> Its also super cheap so thats a plus !!</li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time and I loved it.</li>
            <li> I first used WEN, and really loved it, but at $30-$60 a bottle, I couldn&#x27;t afford to keep using it.  </li>
            <li> so it was getting full force water and still wasn&#x27;t rinsing effectively.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very VERY happy with my purchase and will continue to use this product for a long time!</li>
            <li> But the seller sent quickly and well packaged and does smell nice.  </li>
            <li> I have dry, colored hair, and this product is absolutely wonderful.</li>
            <li> all wonderful in cleaning and helping a dry winter scalp.  </li>
            <li> However this product is a good break when I&#x27;m too busy to make my own products</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how this stuff could clean hair when it&#x27;s made of oils, but it does!</li>
            <li> I eventually gave in and had to shampoo my hair twice to get it all out and clean!</li>
            <li> My hair feels great &amp; soft &amp; healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still have shiny, smooth, more manageable hair, but have gotten rid of the greasy bits on day 2.  </li>
            <li> Great and natural product.  </li>
            <li> I love the way this product makes my hair free and look.  </li>
            <li> I suggest giving it (Renpure) a good scrub with your fingertips after leaving it on about five minutes in the shower and really, really rinse it out.  </li>
            <li> I rinsed for a good five minutes, but no matter how much I rinsed</li>
            <li> I loved this so much that I bought some for my daughter.</li>
            <li> As a non-shampoo kind of girl and a mild product junkie, I keep my eyes peeled for sulfate free products that provide ample moisture to my 3c/4a henna&#x27;d curls.</li>
            <li> It does leave my hair nice and soft and the price is so much better!</li>
            <li> I have used the other cleansing conditioner which made me very happy.  </li>
            <li> I noticed my hair was softer,and clean, I love the mint feeling on my scalp, and the smell.</li>
            <li> My hair is easy to comb and has a shine (not oily).</li>
            <li> But once my hair dried, I was really impressed; I like this product more than Wen.</li>
            <li> Love this product, and am so happy that I researched before being suckered into purchasing a similar (but over-priced) product on TV.</li>
            <li> But what I&#x27;ve noticed, is that it is better absorbed by my hair, and can be more evenly distributed.</li>
            <li> It pumps easily and the pump keeps working unlike the Hair One.</li>
            <li> and it tangles easily after using this product</li>
            <li> , I purchased from my local wg drug store for a couple more dollars than Amazon in lavender and the mint and both smell and work great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li> It soft, shiny, and just amazing!</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of Wen products but let&#x27;s be honest, it has really gone up in price!  </li>
            <li> It did get my hair very clean, I&#x27;d say even squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li> The scent is light but really nice and fresh, it goes in easily and washes out clean.</li>
            <li> For reference I have medium/long, fine but dense, color treated hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m middle-aged and have fine hair, and after using Renpure, my hair is silky and shiny.</li>
            <li> I have mid-back length fine hair (but a lot of it)</li>
            <li> love the smell and love the way my hair feels after the first use.  </li>
            <li> I am very impressed with Renpure and for $23 less PER bottle than WEN, it&#x27;s a no-brainer to stick with this brand.</li>
            <li> hair is color-treated, fine, wavy and there are wirey colored gray hair.</li>
            <li> Took a fine tooth comb into the shower and as the directions stated, combed it through my hair from scalp to end.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve fine hair that tends to get greasy looking at the end of the day, but can also get frizzy after styling.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, curly, and has a tendency to frizz.</li>
            <li> works the same as the higher priced version......smells great...and great results!!!!</li>
            <li> It made my fine hair lifeless.</li>
            <li> As always, I had to use a detangler, since shower combing is NOT an option with my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine curly hair, and a lot of it.</li>
            <li> it was fine with me.  </li>
            <li> It works just fine.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, and a medium amount of it, that tends to the oily side.</li>
            <li> and I am sure this would be a great product for someone with dry and damaged hair, just not for someone like me who&#x27;s ends</li>
            <li> But after blow-drying,  the results were amazing -- looked like I had instantly acquired 1/3 more hair!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell as good or work as well (on my hair) as some more expensive rosemary/mint formulations, but for the price, it is a very good option for fine, maybe a bit oily, hair or for when you want to get rid of product build up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great for shaving too, and leaves skin super soft and minty fresh!</li>
            <li> I use it just like it says on the bottle and the 10-12 pumps is accurate.  </li>
            <li> I bought this from Walgreens because it was on sale and by one get one free for 9.99&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I can get the same results as WEN without the price tag.</li>
            <li> I saw this at Target and for $6.99, it was a cheap try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have done the sulfate free for about two years before trying Renpure.  </li>
            <li> My hair had never felt this silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Just one pass with the straightener was enough to get everything looking great.  </li>
            <li> The results have been fabulous.</li>
            <li> and my hair was COMPLETELY free of oil.</li>
            <li> So the history of my hair prior to using this stuff hasn&#x27;t been great.</li>
            <li> hair silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used Wen, but my experience with Renpure has been great, especially when compared to the price of Wen</li>
            <li> (and yes I was using sulfate free/ salt free products before.)</li>
            <li> healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t expect this product to give me such great results.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a cheap alternative to Wen, use Salon Grafix Cleansing Conditioner.</li>
            <li> It was buy one get one free</li>
            <li> She has tried every shampoo available.</li>
            <li> Overall Renpure mint is a great combination for cleansing and nourishing hair.</li>
            <li> or else you defeat the purpose of this cleanser) of sulfate free shampoo to my hair and worked it in as well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been several weeks now, and my hair looks great, feels great--cleaner, fluffier, shinier, and my scalp doesn&#x27;t itch like it does when I use shampoos with a lot of chemicals.</li>
            <li> At present, I am not as happy</li>
            <li> If you look around, there are coupons available as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I bought a bottle and got one free.  </li>
            <li> When I dried my hair it had beautiful volume and luster!  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product after seeing it BOGO free at Walgreens.  </li>
            <li> and I must say RenPure is fabulous.</li>
            <li> Not damaging my hair further with shampoo is also great.</li>
            <li> I use it daily and had great results.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t detangle, it doesn&#x27;t smooth.  </li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t like that this product contains silicone which is just a cheap synthetic ingredient that I have found</li>
            <li> I gave my mom the free bottle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far, so good.</li>
            <li> It looks great and feels soft when freshly washed though.</li>
            <li> Smells good &amp; hair is soft</li>
            <li> My hair turned out soft, plump, and smelling good.</li>
            <li> Now to the good stuff, which is plenty: I&#x27;ve been using this for a month now and have quit using shampoo completely.</li>
            <li> it is better than Wen and so much more reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Because I wanted to like the product and also because I wanted to give it a fair shot, I used it three more times and got the same result each time.  </li>
            <li> Buy this because you are looking for a good natural shampoo.....</li>
            <li> They are still pretty good for what they cost, but Redmond Products NEVER did animal testing and by all reports was impeccable in its sourcing and other business practices.</li>
            <li> I will be aware from now on!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit of a product junkie and I very rarely purchase one product twice.</li>
            <li> Fresh, clean, shiny, and more manageable, too.  </li>
            <li> Works great, my hair is left moisturized, clean and shiny.</li>
            <li> As far as preserving my bright red color, this stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> Also as a note, my definition of clean is for my scalp to be free of dirt, not to be stripped of oil.</li>
            <li> I have fine, color-treated hair; and it feels so full of body.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first because I thought since it was so much cheaper that it wouldn&#x27;t be a good shampoo/conditioner (ect.)</li>
            <li> Just like with Wen, you must be sure to rinse very, very thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> I honestly had high hopes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is NOT color safe, so be aware of that.  </li>
            <li> if you have the time to do this it is well worth it!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li> I was so excited i went home and immediately got in the shower.</li>
            <li> I purchased Ren from Rite Aid while visiting my brother and was excited to find a Wen alternative.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After I first used this product I was in love.  </li>
            <li> Even if you do not like it, the price point makes it worth a try!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this product when I saw it in walgreens.</li>
            <li> as I originally was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is a bit overwhelming at first, but I don&#x27;t think it lingers that long, and it does a GREAT job.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not like the original cleansing conditioner</li>
            <li> Okay, first of all - I never write reviews.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Walgreens and was excited to try it.  </li>
            <li> My first use I fell in love with the smell.</li>
            <li> I was excited when I saw this at rite aid.</li>
            <li> I was so excited that I ordered another bottle, along with the Pomegranate (will review that formula after I try</li>
            <li> This is not thick and creamy like WEN is, but the smell is nice, and the product seems to clean my hair without stripping it.</li>
            <li> I have fine but thick hair and this has been working awesome.</li>
            <li> can brush right through it, and it is so much lighter with much more volume!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clean the head as well as Wen.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clean as well</li>
            <li> It is also easily available at Riteaid if I need it quickly.</li>
            <li> leaving a manageable clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> My hair never felt clean.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling clean without the yucky poo stuff.  </li>
            <li> No longer using detergents and sulfates on my damaged dry hair sounded great, the price of the product made my stomach hurt.</li>
            <li> My hair would require shampoo more more frequently than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could not seem to get my hair and scalp to feel clean.  </li>
            <li> Im just not a fan of leaving out shampoo since this is not getting hair clean.</li>
            <li> I added a bit of water to dilute product and additionally clean.</li>
            <li> Prior to this I was using the L&#x27;Oreal Ever Creme Cleansing Conditioner, and liked it for the most part, but it didn&#x27;t moisturize my hair as well as I hoped.</li>
            <li> Remember cowash does not have a lot of lather, but produces a really clean wash anyway.</li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling completely clean.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;d like volume and lift (or clean hair...)</li>
            <li> I researched reviews most of them were positive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving how shiny and soft my hair is!</li>
            <li> My hair is FAR more manageable!</li>
            <li> Using this product my hair is soft for once, and I love it!</li>
            <li> The mint also has a very light tingle to it, that I really like..</li>
            <li> Maybe the reviewers were listening for that \\&quot;squeak\\&quot; that powerful shampoos cause, but to me, that&#x27;s a sure sign you&#x27;ve just damaged your hair pretty significantly.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure this would work, not being a &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; but it did clean very well</li>
            <li> so I was super excited.</li>
            <li> My bright red hair has not faded with this product.</li>
            <li> I expected my hair to look great with all those oils in there.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this over a month now and am back to being pretty happy.  </li>
            <li> Spend more and get the real WEN.</li>
            <li> I would say you need about two palms full of this stuff vs. about a nickle-size of Wen.  </li>
            <li> Sure I had to leave it in for a bit longer and gently scrub away</li>
            <li> Although not as good as WEN but 3rd of the cost.</li>
            <li> so I prefer the sweet pomegranate which doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I have used the mint, sweet pomegranate, and lavender and I</li>
            <li> a whole, I love what it&#x27;s doing to my strands, my hair looks healthier, feels softer and stronger on this product.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this for individuals with oil prone hair.</li>
            <li> I do not have a head full of split ends.  </li>
            <li> I have a  nice natural curl to my hair</li>
            <li> You might love it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> They were a rather nauseatingly sweet smell that I just couldn&#x27;t handle.  </li>
            <li> any buy another bottle because I love this stuff so much</li>
            <li> re rinse in cool water before I get out..</li>
            <li> I bought a bottled of Wen two years ago and loved it, but like others on here, I can&#x27;t justify spending $30 on shampoo on a regular basis (which begs the question:</li>
            <li> I have fairly healthy straight hair, and maybe my hair isn&#x27;t the type this was made for.  </li>
            <li> Free of some allergen ingredients that more famous brands of similar product have.</li>
            <li> But the next Renpure experience was just as good.  </li>
            <li> I bought Wen once &amp; loved every minute of it; however, the cost scared me off, so I went back to the higher-end drug store bransd (John Freida, Organix, etc)</li>
            <li> I know that a lot of people will state that I should rinse out my hair more, but seriously, I really do rinse out well,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with the good ol&#x27; regular shampoo</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions, used about 10 pumps, rubbed it in well from my roots to ends, and left it on for a good 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> scent leaves an unpleasantly sweet trace of itself in your hair.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product.</li>
            <li> I guess it is true</li>
            <li> Rinse very thoroughly while scrubbing scalp some more with fingertips and finger-combing out some of the</li>
            <li> You have to make sure to very thoroughly rinse all of the product out of your hair.</li>
            <li> Not bad for a treat!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> , after the first use of Renpure, it made my hair soft and manageable and I loved it.</li>
            <li> Hands down the absolute best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This product cleanses well and leaves a beautiful shine, but does not leave a greasy residue or weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It may be great for some - but certainly not for me.</li>
            <li> I combed through and my hair detangled pretty easily.</li>
            <li> Great cleansing conditioner it leaves my hair clean without stripping it and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling weighed down.</li>
            <li> Then, after I did some research, I learned that many regular shampoos and conditioners contain binding agents that prevent detached hair strands from falling out, giving the illusion of more volume.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this cleansing conditioner, and overall my hair is better than it has been, ever.  </li>
            <li> The rosemary mint is decent, although not my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I am so lucky I found this product.  </li>
            <li> For the price, it really is an easy way to clean up any funk in between real shampoos.  </li>
            <li> Lucky are those who like this product and it worked on their hair.  </li>
            <li> I had purchased Wen, but found that to be to expensive, and I wasn&#x27;t that impressed with the fact that Wen automatically sends more product without your authorization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also has more natural and toxic free ingredients than Wen.</li>
            <li> I am super please with this product</li>
            <li> At first Castile soap was great, but after about 6 months I felt like my hair was really dry</li>
            <li> Overall very satisfied with this cleansing conditioner</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic and cleanses very well!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The very first time I used it</li>
            <li> After the very first use I  noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> I tried this for the very first time.</li>
            <li> Bottom line, it&#x27;s good for the price, but I still long for Wen.&lt;br /&gt;USAGE</li>
            <li> method leaves my hair clean, soft, and feeling healthy.</li>
            <li> I made my own cleansing conditioner using all organic oils and essential oils, with a specially chosen &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; conditioner (btw,</li>
            <li> This is easy to use and does not require much.  </li>
            <li> This might be a good replacement for hair gel or hair spray because my hair was exactly the same when I woke up.</li>
            <li> I use a palm-full and I have pretty much a pixie-ish cut with longer bangs and layers on top</li>
            <li> Since using Renpure my hair looks really healthy and is very soft.</li>
            <li> I love that it makes my curly hair feel very soft and it seems to help with frizz too.</li>
            <li> I have fragile, fine hair and have happily used Wen (all of the basic ones, as well as some of the special edition formulas) for over a year.  </li>
            <li> I have not tried other brands of cleansing conditioner, but for me this is amazing!</li>
            <li> I love all Renpure product because of there natural ingredients!</li>
            <li> I was more than pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> Ohhh and keep your eye on it a Target- similar in price most of the time, but I&#x27;ve got it &amp;#34;Buy one get one free&amp;#34; before too!</li>
            <li> I have only used this product 3 times and already love it!</li>
            <li> smell of Renpure is very light and completely natural, and I like that the product doesn&#x27;t contain wheat protein.</li>
            <li> It hangs more smoothly and is generally more manageable and less fly-away.</li>
            <li> My husband will be so happy to get a little shelf space.</li>
            <li> My hair gets very clean and is very soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I have very long fine hair and the product is to runny and not thick like a good cleansing conditioner should be.  </li>
            <li> give it three stars because it really does leave the hair soft and the ends look amazing</li>
            <li> So far Renpure and Matrix Biolage are my top two WEN replacements.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful, but was as thin as milk pouring out of the bottle</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell so far, this product is as good as Wen.  </li>
            <li> I feel it is worth the price I paid for it.</li>
            <li> With Renpure my hair is much more manageable, soft, and shiny.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> There is not $25 worth of difference in my hair to justify paying the cost of Wen.  </li>
            <li> Not even worth the 6 bucks.</li>
            <li> In fact, I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair because it feels so soft and</li>
            <li> Extra curly with a nice volume and shine.  </li>
            <li> For $9.99, maybe it&#x27;s worth the gamble for others, but I will be returning mine.</li>
            <li> It just feels fresh.</li>
            <li> This has made my curls lovely and soft.</li>
            <li> Is it \\&quot;worth it\\&quot;?  </li>
            <li> , of course when I thought I could spend $10.00 instead of about $30 -  that seemed worth</li>
            <li> your worth it</li>
            <li> I apply 3 pumps and massage into the front of my hair, 2-3 more pumps to the crown area, and 2-3 pumps to the underside near the nape of my neck.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way worth the try.  </li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews on beauty products...</li>
            <li> This shampoo is really handy to have around especially</li>
            <li> After trying Hair One, and not really crazy about the smell, I came across Ren at Walgreens.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, I can see why people may have encountered difficulties, especially if they&#x27;re not used to washing with conditioner (co-washing) or if they followed the directions without knowing how to adapt them for their own hair needs.</li>
            <li> It honestly was a waist of ten dollars in my mind.</li>
            <li> I have used Wen and many other fine hair products, and this product exceeds them all!</li>
            <li> This one is a little minty which I like a lot and feels good and clean on the hair.</li>
            <li> I then noticed that one bottle (the one I had been using) said &#x27;color safe formula&#x27; and the other said &#x27;safe for color treated hair.&#x27;  </li>
            <li> Renpure is a bit more work than regular shampoo - but worth it for the volume and shine!</li>
            <li> and I got lucky on my first try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still trying to figure out how many pumps I need (long, wavy, fine, color treated hair)</li>
            <li> I feel like most cleansing conditioners don&#x27;t really clean, I was always left feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I use oils in my hair, yet this product always leaves me feeling clean and voluminous, yet tangle free and soft.</li>
            <li> I returned the crappy one and purchased the one with the right formula.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m sorry.wen is wen chaz dean got it right no one has come close to recreating  his cream conditioner.so save your money take care of your hair</li>
            <li> I bought this at Target because it had a lot of the right ingredients that I wanted for my hair (coconut oil, tea tree oil, rosemary oil, etc)</li>
            <li> This is thinner, but it left my hair feeling amazing after the first try.  </li>
            <li> i make sure to rinse it out really good, and it has never left my hair crunchy or dry.</li>
            <li> Love, love this stuff, finally my over processed, sun bleached hair looks alive!  </li>
            <li> Your hair feels clean and soft, and smells good long after rinsed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely less frizzy and more manageable and shiny.  :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It blew dry fairly well, I didn&#x27;t fuss too much, and off I went to an appointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, within 1/2 hour, while I was sitting in the office, my head started to itch.</li>
            <li> I love this product and highly recommend it over the Sweet Pomegranate version (which I don&#x27;t think cleans or moisturizes nearly as well).</li>
            <li> Wen (Not a miracle, but the best by far, but the most expensive.  </li>
            <li> Normally I use a sulfate free shampoo on my scalp and a conditioner on my ends</li>
            <li> I have very fine blonde hair</li>
            <li> flat irons more quickly.</li>
            <li> The same with most other co-washes but this one cleans and is inexpensive, has good ingredients and I have never needed to shampoo my hair to get rid of</li>
            <li> The next best, and until a few days ago, also the cheapest.  </li>
            <li> It is not quite as thick as it could be but it has a nice smell and I love the mint.  </li>
            <li> My hair felt and looked really good the next day; I didn&#x27;t get that slippy feeling you get with regular conditioner, but my hair felt squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li> It looked amazing too; light, fluffy waves and curls without frizz.  </li>
            <li> ;) Splash some more water over the top of my head, flip my head upside down, and splash some more over the back of my upside-down head, then turn off the water.&lt;br /&gt;6)</li>
            <li> sure it&#x27;s a great product for someone with medium density, mid length, straight hair with a little dryness.</li>
            <li> My hair is a mess at the end of the day and if Renpure can tackle that, it&#x27;s a really good product.</li>
            <li> We had such high hopes for this, especially considering the fabulous list of nice ingredients!  </li>
            <li> I have fine curly hair, which is easily damaged and becomes dry and brittle.  </li>
            <li> hope this is helpful for anyone like me who needs a very gentle conditioning cleanser like Wen but would like to find a cheaper alternative.</li>
            <li> but my hair doesn&#x27;t seem to like it very much.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many shampoos/conditioners, trying to find one that&#x27;s natural, keeps my hair healthy, and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li> I rinsed it out completely and my hair feels fine out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I made sure to follow instructions to the letter, spent a good 5 minutes trying to rinse my hair, and decided not to blow dry to see if that had contributed to the unsatisfactory results any.</li>
            <li> I felt like a super model and had fun flicking my hair around until I nearly took out an eye!</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, that product is far different from the Coconut Creme cleansing conditioner--my hair felt soft, shiny and clean afterward, and the results were exactly like what I&#x27;d get from any Wen product, for a much lower cost!  </li>
            <li> I think that Ren is better for my hair type than Wen (I have fine, slightly wavy hair).</li>
            <li> but, dries soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This cleans it pretty darn</li>
            <li> (and what isn&#x27;t), this should be the best thing ever, but sadly, I am out 10 bucks for something I won&#x27;t even use with conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff!</li>
            <li> First, I should have bought it at Amazon because it&#x27;s three bucks cheaper.</li>
            <li> Instant love.</li>
            <li> (I comb my hair during this time, in order to make sure everything is properly coated) and then I go on with the rest of my shower before rinsing it out thoroughly at the end.</li>
            <li> I used the Ren conditioning cleanser Rosemary Mint for the first time today.</li>
            <li> The one I purchased for myself I bought in a local store for more money and</li>
            <li> My hair has never been in such healthy shape.</li>
            <li> First, I thought it was postpartum hair loss.</li>
            <li> I washed my hair last night with it, slept on it, woke up looking shiny and healthy, then added the conditioner to my ends</li>
            <li> I love essential oils, and rosemary/mint</li>
            <li> I was washing my hair once every 2 days with a sulfate-free shampoo before I started using Renpure, but now I&#x27;m easily able to wash it only twice a week without it getting oily.</li>
            <li> I just used Renpure cleansing conditioner for the first time yesterday.  </li>
            <li> But even after the first use there was an immediate difference.  </li>
            <li> I am not saying it is &amp;#34;gold&amp;#34; in a bottle, but it is pretty close.  </li>
            <li> I actually used it last night (I use Wen Fig normally) just to be able to give you an honest review.</li>
            <li> This is the first cleansing conditioner I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first I followed the instructions and used the product like a shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Switching to cleansing conditioners has led to the first time in my life</li>
            <li> The reason for 4 stars, I recently bought they pomegranate conditioner and it works better for my hair</li>
            <li> Used this morning first time.</li>
            <li> It was a washing day when I first used this product.</li>
            <li> This is not it&#x27;s first product.</li>
            <li> That is so much conditioner!</li>
            <li> I love the Rosemary Mint smell, and only having to use one product in the shower (instead of shampoo and conditioner).  </li>
            <li> Brings out my waves without them looking like a hot mess.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions exactly</li>
            <li> The first day, I styled my hair with a lot of product &amp; hot tools.</li>
            <li> and I love using only one product instead of shampoo and conditioner and everything else.</li>
            <li> First TiMe</li>
            <li> Thanks Renpure!</li>
            <li> but otherwise I followed directions exactly.  </li>
            <li> and this was my first to try.  </li>
            <li> First let me tell you</li>
            <li> Then, on top of that I have a low thyroid.  </li>
            <li> This product though not organic.. Seemed like a better alternate..  </li>
            <li> The first bottle I had</li>
            <li> First, I wash before I shower and rinse then</li>
            <li> One is better off using inexpensive conditioners such as Suave, VO5 and the rest.</li>
            <li> the first couple times I used it (although it didn&#x27;t look it).</li>
            <li> My hair does not tangle, it feels so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> the first 1-2 times I used this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed with the thickness of others, they are so thick that they more just sit on top of my hair, rather than being absorbed.</li>
            <li> I just received my first order of Renpure today.</li>
            <li> am very discriminatory when it comes to products!  </li>
            <li> pretty</li>
            <li> I read the reviews thinking it would be a healthy alternative to my regular shampoo/conditioner routine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This isn&#x27;t my first cleansing conditioner</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m well aware of how to use it.</li>
            <li> so I started going out of my way to make sure I only applied it to my roots.</li>
            <li> It actually feels better than Wen in some ways.</li>
            <li> It definitely takes some effort to work it into your hair, and then even more effort to rinse it out.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t want to write a negative review without giving the product a fair chance, so after a day of regular shampooing/conditioning (which felt amazing after a day on Ren), I tried Ren again.</li>
            <li> (although I am probably using too much!)</li>
            <li> Anyway, I do that first in the shower, then leave the \\&quot;lather\\&quot; on throughout the rest of my shower while I&#x27;m washing my face, shaving, etc.</li>
            <li> I just tried this for the first time today.</li>
            <li> It totally gets rid of oil and makes hair lighter and more body.</li>
            <li> It might be better for a different type of hair but not mine.</li>
            <li> After a year of using these types of cleaners I can tell you for the first time in my life I can come out of a shower and not have to use products in my harir to control the frizz.</li>
            <li> I work it through in sections, paying really good attention to the crown of my head because thats where I had trouble</li>
            <li> Works just as good as Wen for a lot less money!</li>
            <li> If you have dry or mature hair then maybe this would be a good product for you, but I found it to be both ineffective and a pain to use.</li>
            <li> Wow!!!!</li>
            <li> Having read both the positive and negative reviews, I was prepared for just about anything, so it was a very pleasant surprise to have the product work more or less exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is amazing, but I love anything herbal and minty; if those types of scents aren&#x27;t your thing, maybe try the other scent, because the smell of it definitely stays with your hair for a day or 2.  </li>
            <li> The Renpure smells good but has a more subtle fragrance than Wen Sweet Almond Mint which is the only Wen I have used to date.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product for people in the same situation as I was and looking for something that leaves my hair feeling fresh and healthy.</li>
            <li> They are both pretty good, not expensive, AND I found them both in my very average grocery store!  </li>
            <li> They are both pretty good, not expensive, AND I found them both in my very average grocery store!  </li>
            <li> For me, this is better than Wen, because with most conditioners, higher water content seems to help with my thick hair.</li>
            <li> No product is for everyone, but I honestly feel that most people will benefit from using this product according to the directions, which is to say you should make sure you leave it on for at least 5 minutes and rinse with lukewarm - not hot - water.</li>
            <li> This product is much thinner than Wen and does not leave hair as soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It feels so soft and clean.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and look clean, without drying it out like every shampoo I have ever used and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to occasionally use a gentle clarifying shampoo to deep clean.</li>
            <li> When she washes with it, she follows up with any ol&#x27; leave-in conditioner, and her hair is clean, soft, and comb/brushable.  </li>
            <li> After using Ren alone for a week or so, my scalp didn&#x27;t feel clean, so I&#x27;m using it as a regular conditioner along with a mild shampoo.</li>
            <li> As with the other recommendations,  really make sure that you wash this stuff out THOROUGHLY!  </li>
            <li> The only recommendation I have for anyone who wants to use this product is to make sure to thoroughly rinse your hair out in order to wash away the cleanser, because your hair can look oily at the roots if the cleanser is still on the scalp.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly white girl hair and have been wanting to get wen but can&#x27;t make myself spend that kind of money</li>
            <li> After that first week, my hair was not limp, but full of body and shiny, so give it a chance.</li>
            <li> It has a really nice scent and left my hair soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll likely try some other cleansing conditioners as well, but am pretty happy with this one for now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m American Indian and my hair is not as fine as most white people&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll happily trade a little bit of build-up every few months for softer, more manageable hair.d of build-up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll happily trade a little bit of build-up every few months for softer, more manageable hair.</li>
            <li> After rinsing my hair still retains a positive level of moisture.</li>
            <li> (I like a deeper clean after swimming in the pool) and it does not mess with my hair.</li>
            <li> Ren pure leaves my hair clean, shiny, and soft.</li>
            <li> The bottle says to use 10+ pumps, but I find that I have to use 20 pumps or more because of how long my hair is.</li>
            <li> I know other people have left reviews saying how great this product is,</li>
            <li> My hair is full, soft, manageable and not frizzy.</li>
            <li> I honestly looked like I hadnt washed my hair in WEEKS, so greasy, oily and weighed down</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed that this didn&#x27;t work for me, because it really is a great conditioner and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I was pleased that my ends didn&#x27;t look so dry and</li>
            <li> I used it as directed (pretty much the same way I always used Wen), and it rinsed out fine.</li>
            <li> If you have really dry hair from coloring or that lovely gray hair that&#x27;s not what it used to be, this is for you.</li>
            <li> I used it exactly as directed and spent 3 minutes under the water to rinse it out since I had heard sometimes these conditioners take awhile to wash out and my hair felt ok, but when I went to blow</li>
            <li> Healthy hair, doesn&#x27;t dry hair out.</li>
            <li> I really bought this by mistake at a local walgreens, I was looking for a decent organic shampoo because my hair seems to fare much better when not using sulfates</li>
            <li> such, my hair doesn&#x27;t get greasy as easily</li>
            <li> First, make sure your hair is soaking wet throughout.</li>
            <li> Renpure isn&#x27;t strong enough as a cleanser by itself and if itwere, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars instead of 4.</li>
            <li> What results I have had with Renpure, and my opinion on the two cleansing conditioners I used of theirs, is based purely on the fact that they made a lot of my hair fall out.</li>
            <li> if you think about it the harsh sudsy surfactants in shampoo strip the hair, this will probably help it grow even better!</li>
            <li> I bought this at harris teeter a few months ago and fell in love with the way it made my hair feel and act!</li>
            <li> I just massage a few pumps more of the product into my scalp, rinse my hair and voila!</li>
            <li> I Really Believe This Actually Damaged My Hair And caused It To Fall Out More Than Normal.</li>
            <li> It is thick, straight and in pretty good condition.</li>
            <li> will most likely use this as a leave in conditioner for the ends only in the future and will go find myself a suitable shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And, it&#x27;s always nice to support a family company vs giant corps who make garbage shampoos that smell over-the-top good. ;^)</li>
            <li> Other than color-treating and light blow-drying (I do not do full blow-outs)</li>
            <li> Turns out, they all have alcohol, a total killer for fine hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is curly and tends to get frizzy easily, my mom&#x27;s hair is very curly, my one sister has wavy hair, and my other sister has super straight hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty decent.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, and Renpure gives my hair some texture and body, so much so that I can actually skip a day in between washings.  </li>
            <li> I have fine straight hair and using this product simply does not perform on my hair AT ALL.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap enough that even if you don&#x27;t like it, you&#x27;re not wasting too much money.</li>
            <li> But then it started to be very drying.  </li>
            <li> But the real test is what does my hair look like, and  how does it feel dry.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I have curly/frizzy/dry hair, and this cleansing conditioner did absolutely nothing for me.  </li>
            <li> and I do not need to trim it nearly as much.  </li>
            <li> really don&#x27;t have any complaints.</li>
            <li> than wen..and reasonable price..</li>
            <li> You just have to rinse very well.</li>
            <li> It is okay, not really nourishing to my hair.</li>
            <li> when it dries, it&#x27;s really greasy.</li>
            <li> Very watery.</li>
            <li> I should have stuck with the real cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li> It is so much easier to detangle, and I can go much longer in between &amp;#34;washes&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like it...</li>
            <li> I have use this off &amp; on when I cannot afford Wen and really see no difference at all.  </li>
            <li> it  was better then I expected and I would use it in the furture</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see any change in my hair at all</li>
            <li> I absolutely would recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Cleans hair very well.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like this one as much as others.  </li>
            <li> I was using a whole bottle of Wen every 2 weeks, but I&#x27;ve had this product for almost 2 weeks now</li>
            <li> hair gets very tangly after shampooing,  sleeping. .</li>
            <li> I  really didn&#x27;t have to use a lot of product.  </li>
            <li> This product may not be for everyone, but my whole family likes it</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t really tell you much about it.</li>
            <li> my described usage, wash-day becomes a whole lot simpler.</li>
            <li> By the time I&#x27;m ready for wash, my hair is loaded with this product.</li>
            <li> Clean-er hair ready to be styled all over again.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than WEN.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t like to do much to my hair, so</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very comparable.</li>
            <li> the Rosemary mint smell really pulled me in</li>
            <li> It has so much shine and bounce-</li>
            <li> I really like this product and have purchased it for my mother to try as well.</li>
            <li> works very well.</li>
            <li> Like it and so much cheaper the Wen</li>
            <li> This is much healthier for your hair than shampoo</li>
            <li> but I have not needed that much at all.</li>
            <li> I wonder if some who described residue were using too much perhaps?&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL ...</li>
            <li> I really like renpure</li>
            <li> Plus the price means that I don&#x27;t have to worry about how much I&#x27;m using</li>
            <li> It is, however, a very passable substitute.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely adore this product.</li>
            <li> , I was about ready to shell out the bucks for Wen, then I saw this at Bed Bath and Beyond.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s too much for me, however.</li>
            <li> I wanted WEN but can&#x27;t bring myself to pay that much, so I found a cheaper knockoff in the drugstore.</li>
            <li> The smell was very minty but not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, but it was not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> when I saw Ren at Walgreens during a BOGO event, I got really excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> haha).</li>
            <li> My hair feels so much thicker and shinier now that I don&#x27;t strip my hair of</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t ready to give up on the product yet, because I could see the benefits to leaving the oils in.  </li>
            <li> My whole family loves this.</li>
            <li> As others have said, you absolutely MUST rinse thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I make a point of scrubbing my scalp really vigorously for 2 minutes, as suggested, (fingertips, no fingernails, of course)</li>
            <li> Rinse VERY well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a one step hair cleaning/conditioning which sounds like it ought to save you time, but you really got rinse this stuff.&lt;br</li>
            <li> very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to use QUITE as much product, either, but I don&#x27;t skimp.</li>
            <li> a regular cheap shampoo that lathers a little.you get what you pay for if you can&#x27;t afford wen and want that wen feeling your are not going to get it from this</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t have any expectations of how it would work, but I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> would absolutely recommend this product to others -</li>
            <li> but I really like the results in my hair.</li>
            <li> REALLY well, and thought I had.</li>
            <li> As such I went cheap on hair care products and washed my hair with body soap.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try Wen but did not want to spend so much on a trial.</li>
            <li> My hair was not greasy and it detangled very well.</li>
            <li> It has the consistency of Elmer&#x27;s Glue and doesn&#x27;t spread very well.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t get creamy nor did it really spread through my hair.</li>
            <li> I got this product from a local store buy one get one free</li>
            <li> it just doesn&#x27;t really work for my hair so much.</li>
            <li> Even with short hair, it was kind of a big expense.</li>
            <li> I have fine, ultra straight hair and my roots tend to get oily, and when that happens the rest of my hair just lies flat.</li>
            <li> This is a nice price for this product, but I was expecting a little more given the other reviews.</li>
            <li> but not least, I noticed that after I blew my hair dry and styled it, my hair felt a lot more substantial.</li>
            <li> i pretty much followed the instructions, although i do have to use more like 16 pumps for my fine thin hair.</li>
            <li> but when I try a new product I always see how it affects my hair alone the first time I use it.</li>
            <li> esp since I live in the hot, humid South.  </li>
            <li> I use more pumps than the instructions call for, massage really well, and then leave it in a clip while I do my other shower stuff.</li>
            <li> I generally have oily hair and thought that this would make my hair super oily.  </li>
            <li> I have straight, long but fine hair and lots of it.</li>
            <li> (most of the other products are thicker).  </li>
            <li> In other words, even though most people lose about 100 strands of hair per day, many of those strands stay on your head attached to other strands of hair if you use volumizing products.</li>
            <li> I have tried other Renpure products before and I LOVE the brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many sulfate-free shampoos and other products for hair loss.</li>
            <li> I find that I have to use a bit more than the bottle suggests due to the length of my hair</li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s mostly because of the foreign concept of a cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li> I seem to use more than with the other product but for the price</li>
            <li> and I cannot use most shampoos without breaking out every other week but</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Wen and used it exclusively for a couple years, but quit due to the cost.</li>
            <li> The thing I love is that I find I can now wash my hair every other day without it getting as greasy.  </li>
            <li> My hair is soft, fluffy (amazing, since i have such fine hair) and smells great!&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is now the only product I will use to clean my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is on the fine side, and shoulder length, so I&#x27;ve found that 5-7 pumps is more than enough for each round.</li>
            <li> I have very long fine, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Smells good, but just not good at all.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Renpure Solutions Cleansing Conditioner at our local Walgreens, and got both the Rosemary Mint, and the Sweet Pomegranate.</li>
            <li> It works much like a normal shampoo--not like a cleansing conditioner.  </li>
            <li> My hair is long and colored slightly, but relatively healthy with a medium to fine wavy texture.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is all natural and kind of puts my hair back to the same unwashed status.  </li>
            <li> It is so concentrated that a very little works to clean and smooth my hair.</li>
            <li> I have fly away dry hair these days and this is the only product that actually put moisture in to the extent that my hair actually lays flat and looks healthy.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, straight and limper than a wet noodle.</li>
            <li> No matter how much product I used and how long I rinsed, I couldn&#x27;t get my hair to feel clean.  </li>
            <li> Shampoo and conditioner in a whole new package.  </li>
            <li> With this my hair seems to be much more moisturized and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have tried using more product, less product, letting it sit longer, rinsing longer -</li>
            <li> It worked..you need to use more product ..not less which seems counter productive.  </li>
            <li> I decided that I could do more for less by purshasing organix shampoo.  </li>
            <li> But, I find that the less I do to my hair the better is looking.  </li>
            <li> There is no &amp;#34;one size fits all&amp;#34; with shampoos/cleansers simply because there are so many different hair types-</li>
            <li> It has left my hair so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> , I can truly slather it in and make sure my hair is well saturated (unlike the expensive versions where you&#x27;re more worried about conserving it</li>
            <li> Only caveat I will add is that when my 24 year old daughter tried this rosemary mint cleansing conditioner she didn&#x27;t enjoy it.</li>
            <li> In the shower my hair actually felt more coarse while using this product.</li>
            <li> After trying many different \\&quot;cleansing conditioners\\&quot;, I have finally found one that I will be sticking with!  </li>
            <li> : A lot of the cleansing conditioners are sooo thick, which is nice for moisturizing, but not so much for cleansing...</li>
            <li> Also I use one pump after ive brushed my hair and its the only product I need:)</li>
            <li> Not Wen, but a decent no suds-ing cleanser for your hair.  </li>
            <li> myself, I always do one quick wash (work the conditioner through, then immediately rinse) followed by a second one where I let it sit in my hair for the recommended 3-5 minutes.</li>
            <li> So while expensive, this does seem to be a superior product and worth the high price.</li>
            <li> I normally wash every 2 days but with this I would have to wash daily because the residue left traps more dirt and oils.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this as a beard wash/conditioner.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My hope was high</li>
            <li> I think I could probably use this in a pinch if I needed to if I used a high quality leave in conditioner</li>
            <li> The only scent experienced while washing is the combination of essential oils in the product, so that the only smells are actual mint and rosemary.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I actually use less of this than the Wen brand and get the same great results.  </li>
            <li> I promptly shelved all of my other product (which the fiance was thrilled to have reclaimed some of the shower space) and will never look back.</li>
            <li> At my age, I can&#x27;t afford to loose hair from excessive tangles, lol.  </li>
            <li> My hair was a little more &amp;#34;unruly&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> and I have to use a little more of it,</li>
            <li> With Renpure, I use the proper amount because it costs 1/3 as much!!</li>
            <li> I think I might try concentrating it more on just the roots and pulling it through the ends with a comb, or hit the ends with a little coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In a matter of four hours, it had gone to \\&quot;okay, a little heavy\\&quot; to \\&quot;ooh, greasy like pomade.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Straight out of the shower, my hair feels super dry and hay-like, not like</li>
            <li> /&gt;Regardless, I was pleasantly surprised that it actually did clean my hair - it didn&#x27;t look like I just went to gym.  </li>
            <li> They either make it very greasy or super dry.</li>
            <li> It really does get your hair nice and clean with minimal effort, but it&#x27;s not particularly &amp;#34;conditioning.&amp;#34; My ends were a hot mess</li>
            <li> Now after a whole month, it&#x27;s like the damage to my hair has been almost completely reversed.</li>
            <li> Afterwards, my hair is very shiny, soft, and not oily at all.</li>
            <li> I tried Wen and it really made my hair soft and gave it body.</li>
            <li> It was very shiny, and ends look better than usual.</li>
            <li> I poured lots of olive oil (and then later, coconut oil) into my hair to bring back some moisture, but honestly, it was like it stripped every last ounce of oil from the hair shaft.  </li>
            <li> Maybe hair gets a bit dryer than without the normal shampoo+conditioner</li>
            <li> Is that normal?</li>
            <li> months in, I notice that I lose about 10-15 strands of hair each time I use Renpure, which still alarms me, but I suppose it&#x27;s normal after all.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is pretty thin compared to wen but the smell is nice and I like the tingly effect it gives my scalp.  </li>
            <li> this is very runny and left my hair feeling funny like it had a residue on it</li>
            <li> After my hair dried it still smelled of lovely mint.</li>
            <li> This is important as I&#x27;m in yoga teacher training and get pretty sweaty everyday.</li>
            <li> I know that probably defeats the purpose of using ren but trust me, I feel like the ingredients are giving my hair nutrients that you don&#x27;t get from a normal shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A Few More TiMes</li>
            <li> I actually,after rinsing the REN out of my hair,had to put my normal conditioner on in order to get a comb through my hair.</li>
            <li> When it dried it looked fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I am a long time Wen user (Fig is my favorite) and started using Ren recently.</li>
            <li> (which I only do on the rare occasion</li>
            <li> it made my hair feel heavy, but after about 3-4 uses my hair began to love it.</li>
            <li> It is by far the most expensive hair care product -  including the most exclusive shampoos and conditioners - that is out there.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite the same, but it&#x27;s worth it when I consider the savings.</li>
            <li> I rinsed with warm water, hot water, cold water, cool water; it made no difference.  </li>
            <li> with my short cut that is pretty much 90% of my hair routine.</li>
            <li> The texture of this cleansing conditioner looks like the kind of milk your mom made you drink when you were a kid, all thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic, a cleansing conditioner with no sulfates, no &amp;#34;clubs&amp;#34; to join, no HUGE price tags.  </li>
            <li> Even though my hair felt dry and not conditioned when I left the shower, it combed out like a dream and after blow drying it was smooth as silk!</li>
            <li> my hair was already clarified with the Castile soap, it would be an easier transition for me than some of the people trying a cleansing conditioner right after using shampoo/products on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> next thing I noticed was that my comb slipped right through my hair.</li>
            <li> does great job on my very thin, oily hair.  </li>
            <li> Right before I&#x27;m done with my shower routine and ready to rinse out my hair, I add a little bit of water again and re-lather, then rinse very, very well.</li>
            <li> and it was to heavy for my fine, straight hair...</li>
            <li> Second hair has been colored several times, it is fine but there is a lot of it,naturally wavy.</li>
            <li> With other shampoos (all sulfate and paraben free), I was still losing clumps of hair.</li>
            <li> With Wen, I was alternating every other wash with a sulfate free shampoo as my hair tended to get oily if I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> It has replaced multiple bottles of hair care items in my shower and my hair hasn&#x27;t looked or felt this nice since I was a little child.</li>
            <li> Although it is a bit like washing your hair with Maalox, you will forget that the minute you see and live with your hair.  </li>
            <li> My advice to new users - READ THE DIRECTIONS.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t live up to advertisements.  </li>
            <li> I turned to a new line of dove shampoo.</li>
            <li> With Renpure, I hardly lost ANY and that was good enough for me to stick with this</li>
            <li> I came across Renpure and it was available at my local Target for only $7!</li>
            <li> I think, if you wanted to go through the trouble, you could make your own personal cleanser/conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I made sure my hair was thoroughly wet and began to work the product through it, following all directions on the bottle to the letter.  </li>
            <li> It blew dry nicely and I dried it without any products so that I could get a real idea of how well it worked.  </li>
            <li> It is soft and manageable as well as shiny and the color is vibrant again.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> I woke up one very early morning to the television still on, and an infomercial for &#x27;Wen&#x27;.</li>
            <li> It is very soft.</li>
            <li> I will profess what touching her dry hair is very nice and soft with this shampoo while with other shampoos it can be stiff and dry.</li>
            <li> From my experience,  the hotter the water, the better (especially if you have thin, fine hair and don&#x27;t want  or need the &amp;#34;conditioning&amp;#34; effect).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it better to just wash my hair with plain old conditioner.</li>
            <li> If you have a family, especially teens with long hair, that could easily add up to $80-$100 a month.</li>
            <li> its fur was so soft!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Within a week of using Renpure, I noticed is that my hair seemed to be falling out more than usual.</li>
            <li> Many people who stop using shampoo experience increased shedding because these 100 strands actually fall out instead of falling out and getting stuck to other</li>
            <li> The first ingredient was the same, purified water.</li>
            <li> First of all, I didn&#x27;t realize that it said on the back that you have to do 10-12 pumps each time you use it.</li>
            <li> I got several compliments on my hair the first time I used this stuff and continue to get them.  </li>
            <li> She has wonderful Asian hair and it is coarse and can be difficult to manage.</li>
            <li> The scent is refreshing, but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Its not drying my hair out, and made its soft and manageable!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li> I use this exact same routine no matter which cleansing conditioner I use and again</li>
            <li> After a week I swear his hair was so soft and no dandruff at all!  </li>
            <li> Instructions suggest going 6 uses, then using a traditional shampoo for a deeper clean, then back to the product.  </li>
            <li> There is absolutely no lather yet my hair is soft and clean.</li>
            <li> The pomegranate is very close to Sweet Almond mint, just a little difference in fragrance.</li>
            <li> There are less costly products available on Amazon that are a closer match to Wen than this product is.</li>
            <li> It was surprisingly easy to comb through and dried faster than when I use shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine, thin, long hair and most conditioning</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions super carefully this time, thinking it was me making mistakes, but that wasn&#x27;t the case</li>
            <li> I have straight, stringy, tangly hair that normally looks greasy by days&#x27; end, especially in the Florida humidity.</li>
            <li> (My only positive on this product is the scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, the recommended 8-10 pumps of product is barely enough to make it half way through the top layer my hair.</li>
            <li> I find my red dye does not fade as quickly as it does with traditional lathering shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have rather thin and very frizzy hair (but a lot of them) and this conditioner leaves them clean, but a bit stiff - kind of like some of the voluminizing shampoos I used to have.</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve tried many conditioners, and every one of them left my fine, limp, volume-challenged hair greasier, limper, and less voluminous.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Conservatively speaking, it will cost an average person $20 a month MINIMUM to clean and condition their hair.</li>
            <li> Perhaps if you have very greasy hair normally, you might want something this drying, to balance it out; for normal to dry hair, I&#x27;d stay away.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps if you have very greasy hair normally, you might want something this drying, to balance it out; for normal to dry hair, I&#x27;d stay away.  </li>
            <li> Mix together in my palms a bit more of the Suave Coconut and some Herbal Essences Set Me Up gel, then work that combo through sopping wet hair, raking out any remaining tangles or loose hairs.&lt;br /&gt;5)</li>
            <li> While the smell of Herbal Essences is amazing, it left my hair a big greasy mess.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember the last time my hair stayed clean this long between shampoos.</li>
            <li> It is hard to massage through your hair and you have to use a lot more than the directions call for for cleansing.  </li>
            <li> My hair really didn&#x27;t get soft again until the next shampoo with another</li>
            <li> But many of the reviews were intriguing, the product wasn&#x27;t expensive, so decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li> am African-Amercian  with natural hair, my would be type 3b/c.</li>
            <li> This allows my hair to remain soft</li>
            <li> For anyone that care I have that stubborn white/black mixed hair that was very damaged and curly when I was a kid</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really surprised.  </li>
            <li> &amp; wow.</li>
            <li> IF I run my fingers thru my hair the crispness goes away and my hair feels soft.</li>
            <li> Remember the early days of the Aussie hair products?</li>
            <li> Before Proctor &amp; Gamble bought them, they came from a family company near where I lived.</li>
            <li> ; method after my aunt telling me she uses homemade apple cider vinegar and baking soda to wash her hair, it feels so soft like you;d</li>
            <li> I tried to go natural on my hair and not use any heating tools</li>
            <li> After trying wen which is only a conditioner, not a cleanser, i was really looking forward to trying this.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft.</li>
            <li> I  also have a lot of natural wave in my hair that I  never get to see..</li>
            <li> So what I have done is made a spray bottle of water mixed with some of the product to mist in my hair gently after the shower.</li>
            <li> Ren is non foaming and all natural.</li>
            <li> When I saw the natural ingredients and no additives I had to try it.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair shiny, bouncy, and soft.</li>
            <li> It is still soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural also, so you&#x27;re not pouring chemicals into your skin.</li>
            <li> I am thinking it is not so much what you are putting on your hair as it is what you are NOT putting on your hair; such as, sulfates, dyes, parabens, gluten, phthalates, propylene glycol, etc.  </li>
            <li> but as far as I can tell no chemicals.</li>
            <li> It was not in any way silky, moisturizing or soft.</li>
            <li> I also have rosacea and extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely far inferior to Wen, per my experience.  </li>
            <li> The tips I can give is to make sure you massage your hair for at least 3 min, then comb the product from root to tip, wait another 2-3 min then rinse</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> My Scalp Sensitive.</li>
            <li> It at least made it look like I had more hair.</li>
            <li> My hair got soft, but stayed curly, and the frizz went away.&lt;br</li>
            <li> ,when I put this product on my hair,it did not work anywhere near like</li>
            <li> And just to clarify,yes,my hair was completely detangled before I stepped in the shower,so I know that wasn&#x27;t the problem.</li>
            <li> Does not leave hair soft and does not detangle</li>
            <li> Based on the infomercials I have seen for its competitor, I was expecting (hoping) my hair would be sleek and soft after using this product.  </li>
            <li> I use 5-6 pumps on the front and back of my head  and 5-6 pumps on the sides and really rub it in.  </li>
            <li> I ended up with soft bouncy curls and my color though it does fade..it does not like with shampoo..</li>
            <li> will last a reasonable length of time even at recommended usage levels.  </li>
            <li> I am so surprised that I like this product.  </li>
            <li> The bonus of this product is that your hair stays soft for days after using it.</li>
            <li> Her hair is silky soft and doesn&#x27;t get tangled.</li>
            <li> , Somehow I mistakenly believed this would cleanse my hair and leave it soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft shiny manageable.  </li>
            <li> It left my hair very silky.  </li>
            <li> leaves my hair soft and shiny</li>
            <li> hair shiny, silky, and no where near as knotty.</li>
            <li> I have never dyed it, so it is natural.</li>
            <li> Even if I wasn&#x27;t sensitive to this product I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This seems to be helping my hair restore its natural oils.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so soft and is so manageable to style.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s soft and silky.</li>
            <li> really think they need to go back to the drawing board and keep the idea, but toss this formula.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way below WEN, which I use frequently.  </li>
            <li> , I have natural 4C hair</li>
            <li> My has is soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not anywhere near the quality of Wen.</li>
            <li> but I will not purchase again, as I prefer the Salon Grafix formula of all the products I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> Maybe my skin is just sensitive to it</li>
            <li> I understand that completely.</li>
            <li> My hair is now soft again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An</li>
            <li> I am about to purchase my second bottle, and because of the reasonable cost this will probably be my shampoo for the duration.</li>
            <li> Use as directed and your hair will be soooo soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I stick my head under the shower water for like 1.3 seconds to add a bit of water, and then with my fingertips directly on my scalp I massage vigorously all over my head/hair.</li>
            <li> I feel like all the foaming/massaging really helps in avoiding the greasiness that I think would be likely if you just slapped it on and then rinsed it out.</li>
            <li> if your a frequent shampooer because it&#x27;s not harsh</li>
            <li> , it makes it soft and shiny with no greasiness.</li>
            <li> However, I was pleasantly surprised with the results I achieved.</li>
            <li> I have never found 2-in-1 type shampoos to work for me because they add too much conditioning at my scalp where I don&#x27;t need it, and not enough conditioning at the ends where I do need it.  </li>
            <li> and she has natural hair.</li>
            <li> After letting it sit in my hair for about ten minutes while in the shower I also used just two pumps more on my towel dried hair.</li>
            <li> This was definitely worth the money I spent, and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase this again and recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> My hair still keeps most of the essential oils in, but it doesn&#x27;t feel so heavy and look so oily.  </li>
            <li> The texture is like thin yogurt or kefir and smell actually really nice</li>
            <li> This shampoo was okay but not amazing.  </li>
            <li> have dry, damaged, relaxed black hair and on top of that, very very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I realized Chaz Dean really found the special formulation and not all companies can do that, not sure why other companies cannot mimic WEN, but, I will rather spend my money on WEN that has been proven right on my hair and skin for 5 years.</li>
            <li> This conditioner has made my hair super soft and shiny all over without feeling weighed down.</li>
            <li> I have hair that sort of varies between wavy and curly depending on the length, time of year, weather, alignment of the stars, and what it feels like doing that day, and it&#x27;s pretty dry to boot.  </li>
            <li> I love this product, my hair never feels flat ever with Renpure, even a few days out from washing it.  </li>
            <li> typically use Wen Sweet Almond Mint.</li>
            <li> while looking for some decent, affordable shampoo and conditioner that didn&#x27;t smell like a chick, I was coming up short.</li>
            <li> First age 45, female, white.</li>
            <li> I give Renpure only 4 stars because it doesnt completely detangle my hair, so I use it as a \\&quot;shampoo\\&quot; and then follow up with my normal conditioner.  </li>
            <li> My hair is straight and thick but the individual strands are fine and soft</li>
            <li> Some have mentioned that this product can put a little weight on your strands and that is true.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not huge on the scent, and my hair seems to take a bit longer to dry, but it leaves my hair surprisingly clean, soft, and very shiny.</li>
            <li> I have never tried Wen, but I don&#x27;t want to at such a high price.  </li>
            <li> However, they were far enough down the list that I decided to give it a try anyway, and it seems to be working out pretty well for my hair without too much buildup.</li>
            <li> (total cost for both is less than the cost of this product) and my hair is light and bouncy and shiny.  </li>
            <li> so my hair can get really dry, but most hair products are too heavy for my hair type...</li>
            <li> My hair dry, and when using the complimentary products, my hair totally sticky.</li>
            <li> With my head still upside-down, scrunch out as much water as I can while disrupting the curl clumps as little as possible, then plop the whole mess of hair into a t-shirt and tie it up before standing up, so that the curls essentially sit on top of my head and set themselves while the t-shirt absorbs the excess water.</li>
            <li> I typically have to wash my hair every day because it starts to look &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; after a day, but the next morning it still looked great and could possibly go two days without washing, but I&#x27;m not sure if I can go a day without washing.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair, curly and treated with keratin and this works with all that very well</li>
            <li> This product is not nearly as thick as the Wen product and I have found does not create the same results.</li>
            <li> This did nothing I could tell, other than weigh down my roots and make them look more oily.</li>
            <li> This has really worked for my fine, thin, medium-length, colored hair.</li>
            <li> This left my fine curls limp.</li>
            <li> Winter has dried my fragile baby fine hair out, so I thought I would try this to repair it.</li>
            <li> The first few times I used it everything was decent, but after a week of use it was unbearable.</li>
            <li> I live in a high desert climate..very very dry.  </li>
            <li> I now use it on my dog because she has sensitive skin and needs as much natural oil retention as possible.</li>
            <li> when using this product you really have to massage your scalp and hair from root to tip really work this stuff in for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> use a few more pumps than suggested, working it into my scalp with a wide comb, and pulling it through with my fingers.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s shown on the bottle is a fairly traditionally pretty blonde with long hair.</li>
            <li> The directions are more like guidelines - the amount they say to use might be far too much for short, thin hair (like mine) or not nearly enough for longer thicker hair.</li>
            <li> I am able to use just 4 pumps and I have thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Sure it isn&#x27;t at thick (the actual conditioner)</li>
            <li> If you have very dry hair, or your hair is curly/ethnic/coarse and deep conditioning is what you need, this may be exactly right for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No matter how much or how little of the product you use and by following directions exactly - it always makes your hair look oily</li>
            <li> I have extremely long, thick hair that is very fine.</li>
            <li> Ren Rosemary Mint did a good job at cleaning my scalp, however it left my hair dull, weighed down, and oily looking.  </li>
            <li> You would not believe what a major difference in texture, feels like a baby&#x27;s hair...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad i purchased this before i read the negative reviews!  </li>
            <li> I have natural curly hair and recently learned that most shampoos are not good for curly hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t feel as \\&quot;luxurious\\&quot; on my hair as Wen does, and I don&#x27;t feel my hair is as silky after drying, but I&#x27;m pretty pleased with the results (especially the shine).</li>
            <li> It felt really dried out when I used the product on its own, and I could not easily comb through it in the shower like you would with Wen.  </li>
            <li> At the first use I when I dispensed the conditioner it was super thin, not even close to the thickness of Wen.  </li>
            <li> but after only a few uses of this product, my hair is back to being luxurious, soft, and smooth.</li>
            <li> Add a bit of Suave Coconut conditioner and work out the rest of the tangles, then run my head under the water just enough to get it super wet again - not to actually rinse out the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Well worth a little elbow grease on the tub.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen less shedding, less breakage, more thickness, richer color and</li>
            <li> I tried Wen and didn&#x27;t see a dramatic enough difference to spend that kind of money on it.</li>
            <li> Second day hair, which used to be my best day, was now looking a little dirty.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the consistency of Wen - very much &#x27;watered down&#x27; in comparison -</li>
            <li> I spent more time on my hair with one product than I usually do with two.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t want to cut it), and it did not make my hair greasy only soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t want to go back to regular shampoo and conditioner, as I knew the harsh chemicals would wreak havoc on all the work I&#x27;d done to cut them out in the first place.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve barely made a dent.</li>
            <li> For a store-bought cleaning conditioner I was happily surprised by this product, I&#x27;ve been using it for several months now</li>
            <li> I have soft African hair</li>
            <li> My hair is really fine and slightly curly, with the extra wildness that going grey sometimes adds.  </li>
            <li> Used it for a week then went back to my old stuff.</li>
            <li> My shine came back and soft..</li>
            <li> I have mid back, very curly/prone to frizz, color treated hair and have been using cleansing conditioners for several years.</li>
            <li> It is thin, and not terribly conditioning.</li>
            <li> I could probably use this instead of shampoo and conditioner entirely, but I kind of like having an excuse to take my long Saturday showers, plus I usually use styling products on weekends if we&#x27;re going out or something, and I like my routine to feel</li>
            <li> However, it does have a faint minty smell and leaves a slight tingle after washing out, which feels very refreshing (and could be all in my imagination!)</li>
            <li> When I saw 10-12 pumps, I wondered if the price was really justified, but I used I think 10 pumps, maybe 12, and it didn&#x27;t empty half the bottle or anything</li>
            <li> This is the real deal - extremely affordable, makes your hair soft and manageable, and it doesn&#x27;t smell like a Cosmopolitan magazine perfume sample page farted in your hair after you wash with it.</li>
            <li> I was impressed that it actually wasn&#x27;t bad!</li>
            <li> IF you wash your hair everyday (I usually don&#x27;t), it may be fine for you, but too intense for me.</li>
            <li> I have color-treated fine straight hair, a few inches past my shoulders.  </li>
            <li> I started sort-of no-pooing last year, and for the past maybe six months, I&#x27;ve been pretty steadily shampooing once a week, rinsing every day.</li>
            <li> Some people describe it as super thick, leaves hair dry on the ends and really greasy on the scalp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely liquidy, and it doesn&#x27;t detangle/condition my hair very well.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it every other day for a week and my hair is feeling much healthier.</li>
            <li> First, use waaaay more than the directions say to use, especially if you&#x27;ve got crazy long/thick/curly hair like I do.</li>
            <li> I did not have to use as much either due to</li>
            <li> I give this four stars only because it does leave ur hair smelling good,it works ok for the price,but not good enough, gave it to my 12yr</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d read other reviews that warned to rinse really,</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, my hair is very long and curly so most hair products simply don&#x27;t work well on my hair.</li>
            <li> Not a single tangle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I went to sleep and woke up with not a single hair out of place.</li>
            <li> Its also lightweight, not greasy, not dry and drys faster as well as</li>
            <li> This product is not as good as either the expensive stuff it tries to imitate nor the inexpensive stuff.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s particularly good for thick hair, but then I don&#x27;t have thick hair, so how would I know?</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo at bed bath and beyond because they were out of my usual conditioner (which I love but wasn&#x27;t in the mood to track down that day).</li>
            <li> The first week, my hair was a little frizzy</li>
            <li> First a little background on my hair type.  </li>
            <li> Speaking of smells, I was skeptical at first about the scent for this Ren Pure conditioner - I had previously tried the sweet pomegranate.</li>
            <li> This shampoo cleanses dirt and gently cleans my scalp, so that there&#x27;s always a little bit of natural oil left.  </li>
            <li> The second ingredients differ: the one that made my hair feel really greasy had sorbitol (sugar), and the other had cocamidopopyl (coconut oil).</li>
            <li> but I went through that with WEN the first few weeks.</li>
            <li> it dried frizz-less.. with really pretty waves..</li>
            <li> I purchased this a few weeks ago and I didn&#x27;t read any reviews first.  </li>
            <li> Does Chaz Dean not realize that by lowering the price to a reasonable level he would have a MUCH wider customer base, and therefore make more money?</li>
            <li> My normally frizzy air dried air turned into soft waves!</li>
            <li> Green and crisp.)</li>
            <li> And when you think you&#x27;ve rinsed enough, rinse some more, This system really doesn&#x27;t increase your shower time, because you are cutting down on the whole lather-rinse-repeat scenario.</li>
            <li> really ways it down and</li>
            <li> At first, it left my hair a bit limp, but that was just the first few shampoos.</li>
            <li> Before I begin, I would like to submit a list of factors that I find relevant to a review of a product like this; we have well water (hard water), not fluoridated, chlorinated city water; I have long, wavy to curly hair that is of medium coarseness; I am white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this cleansing conditioner as well as others make my hair &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; so I have gone back to using the other Renpure shampoo and conditioner products that are really good.</li>
            <li> First use had just over what I consider normal hair loss, which was a lot less than previous shampoo/conditioner</li>
            <li> I let my hair dry naturally.</li>
            <li> and I rinse it really, really well in slightly cooler water than the rest of my shower.  </li>
            <li> On days when I don&#x27;t need as much control, I&#x27;ll use others that have less cones and holding power.</li>
            <li> I did 3 pumps at first and it felt as though I was rubbing shampoo through my hair- very odd.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed after I stepped out of the shower and dried off my hair was that it actually SQUEAKED!</li>
            <li> I have long blonde hair which is thick, but each hair is fine</li>
            <li> My hair is super thick, over-processed and brittle at the ends yet still oily at my scalp.</li>
            <li> The consistency of Renpure is like when you water down the last of WEN that doesn&#x27;t pump out of the bottle, but costs too much to throw away.   </li>
            <li> I live in upstate NY and as everyone knows who lives in cold winter regions, our hair &amp; skin endure serious damage during these long, dry winter months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for making this awesome product!</li>
            <li> My hair tends to naturally be dry and because of my sulfate free regimen, my scalp produces far less sebum than when I used harsh detergents on my hair.</li>
            <li> I found that my hair was very sensitive to other shampoos and conditioners it took me months to find something that did not dry out my hair and even then my hair still was not where I wanted to be.</li>
            <li> and I wash my hair every other day normally.</li>
            <li> I have tried various &amp;#34;cleansing conditioners&amp;#34; over the past few months as I&#x27;m trying to grow my hair out and would like to keep it healthy.</li>
            <li> hair is SO soft, tangles far less.</li>
            <li> &quot; my hair was just literally a glide with no tangles almost the second I applied the product,but with this,no matter how much I used,my hair became one big,tangled mess.</li>
            <li> have fine thin hair, with an oily scalp and drier ends.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thin and fine and must be washed daily because it gets oily.</li>
            <li> I have extremely fine hair, so I was a little worried about a &amp;#34;cleansing conditioner&amp;#34; making it heavy and flat and greasy.</li>
            <li> although they were either really good or really bad, I felt like BC</li>
            <li> So sad--for something that smells so good to behave so badly.</li>
            <li> So sad--for something that smells so good to behave so badly.</li>
            <li> I used the &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; method for a long time, which balanced the PH of my scalp nicely, but unfortunately because my hair is so long (below my hips)</li>
            <li> Because the surfactants (the ingredients that loosen the dirt to clean the hair) used are not the same as the ones used in the other shampoos in market place you won&#x27;t see sudsing as usual, but it is cleansing so</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have split ends, my hair is soft and shiny, it hardly gets frizzy and it lies straight without looking flat</li>
            <li> I find my hair looks relatively fuller -- which means that for special occasions I can style it and wear it down for a few hours before it falls flat.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other, more expensive natural shampoos, and they were nothing like Renpure.  </li>
            <li> I think the concept is WORTH IT, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that exorbitant markups aren&#x27;t in there, and it&#x27;s just too much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> down the backside (slick, sticky back does not equal clean feeling)&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a week and a half I started noticing my hair getting greasier faster than normal.  </li>
            <li> Renpure is somewhat thin in comparison to most other brands of cleansing conditioners..</li>
            <li> All that said my hair had taken a major hit and was literally starting to fall out, not in just small amounts, that is normal for me.</li>
            <li> Over the past year or so, I&#x27;ve been trying to really cut the amount of products I use, especially since I&#x27;ve gone blonde and the bleach does enough of a number on it.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly, very long and rather dry hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin, long and fine.</li>
            <li> , typically I have to wash everyday or my hair looks super greasy.  </li>
            <li> Not sure, but I am certain there is a vast difference between the Renpure Coconut Crème Cowash and the Renpure Solutions Rosemary Mint cleansing conditioner</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not willing to go natural with the unruly curls I used to have.</li>
            <li> Has all natural ingredients and NO SILICONE like other brands.</li>
            <li> My hair is chemically treated, colored and I flat iron it daily.  </li>
            <li> It is also what I look for most in a product since my hair is very thick and prone to defy gravity regardless of what I use to pull it down.</li>
            <li> But unfortunately just did what most shampoos do - dry my hair out by stripping all the oils, which left it feeling brittle like straw.</li>
            <li> Leave it on for a few minutes, but seriously not a lifetime.</li>
            <li> Even when I had very old sticky black motor oil and a pinch of gas in my hair</li>
            <li> This eliminated that problem while leaving my natural feeling, not weight down or gross.</li>
            <li> I sort of like this for the first couple of weeks, made my hair bouncy and shiny even if it was hard to detangle.  </li>
            <li> My hair is dry and damaged from constantly coloring it, but it definitely feels softer when I use the cleanser instead of shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have very oily hair and usually start looking like a greasy mop after 1 day of not washing.</li>
            <li> Long story, short--</li>
            <li> , so we&#x27;ll see how long the bottle lasts, it definitely does the job!</li>
            <li> Also find I am &amp;#34;washing&amp;#34; my hair the same amount as before where with the Wen product I am washing my hair much less which makes up a little for the higher cost.</li>
            <li> It does not weigh my hair down at all, plus the rosemary mint makes my scalp feel alive and tingly.</li>
            <li> I heard about Wen and immediately was interested in the concept but not that particular product because $30 for a month&#x27;s amount of hair cleanser is absurd.</li>
            <li> Your hair WILL feel a little waxy when you&#x27;re rinsing it out, but trust me it dries very soft</li>
            <li> Renpure Cleansing Conditioner does a good job of cleaning my hair, It is much less expensive than Wen!</li>
            <li> have very long hair, so I use about 13-15 pumps total</li>
            <li> It felt dry and coarse.</li>
            <li> If you have really dry damaged hair, leave some in on your ends for extra moisture.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many partially used bottles of EXPENSIVE shampoo and conditioner I have in my bathroom, it&#x27;s embarrassing.</li>
            <li> I use dry shampoo on second day hair, but some times I can even get away without that!</li>
            <li> I dye my hair once a month and my hair was starting to dry out.</li>
            <li> I could never ever just shampoo without using a deep conditioner, so I thought this would make my hair dry</li>
            <li> the next day I used the Renpure again, &amp; let my hair air dry with no product.</li>
            <li> Without that extra bit of leave in conditioner product, the ends of my hair are crispy and crunchy when I air dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> I do still like to follow up with a deep conditioner for dry hair every now and then,</li>
            <li> Soft and Manageable it is, however, I had to resort to spraying my hair with a waterless shampoo to make it appear less stringy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using DevaCare&#x27;s NoPoo for years, but recently my hair had been dry even using that product, so</li>
            <li> Regular shampoos dry out my scalp, sending the oil glands into over-drive.  </li>
            <li> I tried to apply a dry shampoo to mask such buildup, and ended up just having to pull my hair in a ponytail for work.</li>
            <li> Then, my scalp also starting feeling dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> I finally got through my hair and went to dry it.</li>
            <li> weirdly colored semi permanent hair dye lasts easily twice as long as with shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have tried probably 8 different brands from the most expensive down to the ones at Walmart</li>
            <li> Also, the directions say to use a lot of pumps, but I only use half the amount and apply to my scalp only (although occasionally I do all my hair).</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s definitely affordable, and after a months use I still have half the bottle left (as I only use about 8 pumps rather than the suggested 10-12).</li>
            <li> I have no idea how other people are left greasy, since my hair feels cleaner than it ever did using a traditional shampoo and condition.</li>
            <li> All in all, I&#x27;m a cleansing conditioner convert thanks to this stuff (ps - I&#x27;ve never tried Wen or any of the other products like it, so maybe I&#x27;m missing out, but this stuff satisfies my needs for $10 instead of $32</li>
            <li> Also, I bought two different types of this cleansing conditioner, yet when I read the ingredients, it was the same as the other.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any other products at all--dry it, fluff it with my fingers, and when it&#x27;s completely air-dried, I brush it.  </li>
            <li> The next day, the roots were not greasy, but the hair was very dry, as if it had not been conditioned at all.  </li>
            <li> I have learned that when you get this worked into your hair real well add a little water and it actually does lather a little.  </li>
            <li> They still made my hair dry, just not as dry a regular products.  </li>
            <li> Yes, Wen is the gold standard, but not realistic for us (my daughter with long wavy hair also uses these, and goes through a LOT!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was a little thin and 10-12 pumps in a handful was a little hard to spread evenly, so the second time I did 5-6 and 5-6, first on the roots, then the legnths, and it worked out much better.  </li>
            <li> MY Hair Was Flat And Dry,</li>
            <li> When you think about it, it is a rather wasteful product, A. because you have to use so much because it is so hard to work through your hair</li>
            <li> The thing is, once the daily temps got above freezing, my 3-4x/week workouts started getting sweaty, and I noticed that by day 5 or 6 my curls were looking pretty sad no matter how much time I spent with my boar bristle brush, and I was getting a little bit of a funky smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my hair, with the curl, looked like I was walking around with my finger stuck in a light socket.</li>
            <li> but, my hair is really long</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s how my hair stays so long and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I needed to use a lot for my long hair</li>
            <li> I have a beard and long hair.</li>
            <li> I ended up doing 10 pumps and it STILL was not soft at all.</li>
            <li> so I had to use quite a bit for my long hair.  </li>
            <li> Years of coloring and long term medications have done a number on my locks, and no matter what shampoo / conditioner (from store to salon)  </li>
            <li> I used a tiny bit of the product as a styling aid on my wet hair.  </li>
            <li> When my hair dried, the hair itself was soft, but the roots were greasy.  </li>
            <li> I then rinse for a long time under tepid water.  </li>
            <li> Problem for a long time growing my hair longer, this helped a lot</li>
            <li> I do have to be careful with following the directions, and wash it out thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> because it takes so long to work it in and (attempt to) wash it out that your conservative 5 minute shower becomes a 10 minute shower.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair, so blow drying takes about 30-45 minutes, a complete waste.</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t appear oily until later, but the thick sticky feeling is present early - within hours of &amp;#34;cleansing&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I have straight thick long hair</li>
            <li> This product did exactly that same thing, but was actually worse because I could not get it to rinse out.  </li>
            <li> It is much juicier than Wen which pumps out thickly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly not ever going to find its way back into my shower.</li>
            <li> For a better and less expensive alternative to Wen, try Lisa Rachel cleansing conditioner or Hair One.</li>
            <li> : I am mixed, half Asian/half Hispanic, so I have curly Asian hair if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> it was slightly frizzy still, so I used this same stuff here as a leave in conditioner, ran it through my hair with my fingers and massaged it in and that made the final difference.  </li>
            <li> It is not weighed down so the natural slight wave is back, but it is no longer frizzy</li>
            <li> I have dry, fine hair and usually soak my hair in &amp;#34;conditioner&amp;#34; but I&#x27;m never very happy with any single haircare product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps saving $10 a month doesn&#x27;t mean that much for you, but add it up, over a year, and include everyone in your family that uses it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not wild about the scent of this one, but it doesn&#x27;t last too long like other shampoos</li>
            <li> The RenPure product is indeed a bit thinner than Wen as some people have mentioned, but I&#x27;ve found that this only helps it to last longer as a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Also, Ren makes my hair fall out less comparing to Wen (which makes my hair fall out much less than the normal shampoo).</li>
            <li> It left my hair greasy and did not clean it properly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Wen-wannabe&#x27;s that left my hair feeling like straw.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Based on other comments I saw: This can be used as the only means of hair washing like a 2 in 1.</li>
            <li> Going to try the other fragrance next time!</li>
            <li> which is what some of the other cleansing conditioners left me with.</li>
            <li> But, upon purchasing the second bottle I read some of the tips by other users.</li>
            <li> I have wavy to curly hair which is thinning out due to a medical condition so using this cleansing conditioner</li>
            <li> Not everyone can afford Wen and I have tried several other cleaning conditioners.</li>
            <li> Ren left my hair feeling oily and extremely tangled.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, frizzy hair and although my frizz is still there, I have never had soft hair in my entire life.</li>
            <li> And I rinsed for a long time!</li>
            <li> It is the ingredients in the other products that causes the damage, I personally don&#x27;t need to value &amp;#34;the clean&amp;#34; by the suds it makes, I value &amp;#34;the clean&amp;#34; by how my hair feels after I rinse and dry</li>
            <li> If you hate it, it&#x27;s only $7 down the drain, if you like it, $7 for a good size product</li>
            <li> Makes hair shine and minimizes tangles in my very long hair.</li>
            <li> I have very long wavy color treated hair.  </li>
            <li> Very long hair</li>
            <li> My scalp is oily and the ends of my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> It tends to be oily at the scalp and dry at the ends.</li>
            <li> My ends are dry but my scalp is a cesspool of petroleum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Nor did I  blow dry my hair...</li>
            <li> In the winter I like to blow dry my hair and straighten it.  </li>
            <li> I thought my hair would be dry and still oily after usage.</li>
            <li> but it does tend to get frizzy in the summer and dry in the winter.</li>
            <li> my ends were brittle and dry.</li>
            <li> I get highlights often and I have medium length, layered hair that is dry and damaged.  </li>
            <li> That morning I had needed 5 products to end up with frizzy dry hair.</li>
            <li> -dry it</li>
            <li> Cured my dry scalp.</li>
            <li> My scalp tends to be oily, but my curls can sometimes be dry.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it in conjunction with blow drying, since my hour-plus commute to work gives my hair plenty of time to dry without it.  </li>
            <li> Does not seem to dry out my hair at all.  </li>
            <li> are dry and damaged yet the roots and bangs are not.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with the UT dry air and my hair for years after moving from the East Coast.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;roughly towel dry, then wrap to absorb excess moisture, braid, get in bed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rinsed and blotted dry.  </li>
            <li> with wavy curls that feel dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> Because my climate is so dry..</li>
            <li> my hair felt way too dry and tangly afterwards),</li>
            <li> I also had my son switch to this because his hair was wirey, dry  and had lots of dandruff.</li>
            <li> It still was dry and frizzy after this.</li>
            <li> and let it air dry the rest of the way.</li>
            <li> My hair feels dry after using this product.  </li>
            <li> I had tried different cleansing conditioners, but they had left my hair limp and oily.</li>
            <li> Not only this was completely different from WEN after I dried my hair, but this itched my scalp and ears.</li>
            <li> And on the second day after that second wash, my hair was just plain greasy and oily</li>
            <li> With this I feel I need to wash it every single day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is not a bad product, it&#x27;s just wrong for my hair.</li>
            <li> Just a little about me: I have long, naturally curly hair, not super thick, but coarse in texture- especially without proper care.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything to combat my greasy head and dry hair from organic products, super expensive salon brands to apple cider vinegar and nothing worked.</li>
            <li> So my hair had been feeling weighed down &amp; just gross for about a week</li>
            <li> So I was very skeptical about trying this at first, mainly because I had tried Wen before</li>
            <li> (I have hair down to my bra strap; I can&#x27;t afford to regularly use $25 shampoo).  </li>
            <li> With wen my hair seemed to be weighed down and greasy if I used the proper amount.</li>
            <li> This is a little thinner than that other more expensive brand.</li>
            <li> My scalp also did not have that dry look  either!  </li>
            <li> In total volume, it&#x27;s much less than the shampoo and conditioner combined that I was using with organix</li>
            <li> and I usually have to use a lot of conditioner (an entire handful) just to make my hair manageable enough to brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know there are a lot of people who use cleansing conditioner and love it, and this was the first type I tried, but it was a terrible experience.  </li>
            <li> My hair is much less oily with this than with regular shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> If your hair feels dry, use a little of a deep conditioner afterwords.</li>
            <li> My hair is wiry, color-treated and was very dry; when I washed my hair I started seeing hair fall out,</li>
            <li> It might be because I have very dry hair, and it is rebuilding it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> .this is like water and made my hair feel very dry</li>
            <li> have long (mid back ) hair that is very thick  and has a tendency to frizz unless it&#x27;s  blown out in a very specific manner.  </li>
            <li> Only need to use 1-2x per week, as it tends to dry my hair with everyday use.</li>
            <li> It left my hair dry, coarse and dull.  </li>
            <li> Then I get a little bit of water in my hands and spread the cleanser around (this is not supposed to lather, so I just add a little water to get the scalp completely covered with product).</li>
            <li> After both letting it air dry (my preferred practice) and trying to heat-dry/style on separate occasions, my hair not only looked greasy and stringy, but actually seemed worse than if I had used my regular products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The results are the same and for me this is a little easier to work with, plus I am saving money</li>
            <li> A little on the coarse side.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little worried about how my next bottle will perform because of the seeming inconsistency of the product.</li>
            <li> The only thing was it felt a little bit overdried in the ends</li>
            <li> The only criticism I have is that it leaves your hair a little crunchy, but brush or comb it out</li>
            <li> I alternate 2-4 days of Renpure and 1 day of the L&#x27;oreal cleansing conditioner, with sulfate-free shampoo washes every two or three weeks when I start feeling a little buildup.</li>
            <li> breaks me out in little rashy bumps around my hairline, scalp, shoulders, and back (wherever the shampoo touches.)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave any residue, hair is not heavy or dull or greasy or static-y.</li>
            <li> The other is a black &amp; white bottle with pump.  </li>
            <li> The other is a black &amp; white bottle with pump.  </li>
            <li> I took the advice of some of the other people that reviewed this product and used the Wen directions instead of what is on the bottle and my hair is soft, bouncy and isn&#x27;t the least bit dry anymore.</li>
            <li> I put it on wet hair and let it remain while I do other things and shampoo some half hour later.  </li>
            <li> Be very careful with this if you have dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have read many bad reviews of renpure&#x27;s version of wen cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li> This shampoo/cleanser actually works really well for my thin Hair!</li>
            <li> Yes, you can use some as a styling aid later, but if you don&#x27;t completely clear out what you&#x27;ve used for cleaning, you may be leaving dirt and oil behind, which can make your hair feel sticky and gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> My hair still feels like hay when it&#x27;s wet</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s frizzy on the ends and not very manageable.</li>
            <li> With Renpure, I can go 3 days without my hair feeling gross and heavy.</li>
            <li> No moisturizing whatsoever and even after i drowned my hair with moisturizer to make the harshness of this product go away, it was still stripped.  </li>
            <li> I found this stuff at the grocery store for $8, and after I&#x27;d tried my girlfriends&#x27; Wen in my beard a few months prior, I decided to just give this a shot.</li>
            <li> (yes, it is expensive but sooooooooo worth it)</li>
            <li> and it was fluffy... even with using the detangler, my hair suddenly had BODY!</li>
            <li> I noticed absolutely no difference in frizz and smoothness.</li>
            <li> I put it on wet hair</li>
            <li> I ordered a few different brands to find one I like</li>
            <li> I was always curious about trying Wen cleansing conditioner, but the price scared me off.</li>
            <li> Instead, after I rinse (and rinse and rinse and rinse as instructed) I can&#x27;t get my fingers through my wet hair while the water is running through it.  </li>
            <li> this was when I was putting in on my hair wet..</li>
            <li> On the advice of a friend, I picked up a few packets of Hair One for Curly Hair from Sally&#x27;s and will try that, since it is around the same price point.</li>
            <li> I have trouble raising my arms and don&#x27;t like traditional shampoo and conditioner in one bottle, Renpure is nothing like the 2 in 1&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not rocket</li>
            <li> I have used it a few times and have had the same result every time.  </li>
            <li> I carefully followed the instructions and also heeded reviewers&#x27; suggestions, esp.</li>
            <li> with a few pumps of product at a time, working from scalp to ends, and front to back (up to 15 pumps) - 3 minutes&lt;</li>
            <li> thoroughly wet my hair -</li>
            <li> I purchased this in a store, and after trying it several times I felt like I had wasted my money.  </li>
            <li> I have medium-textured, semi-curly hair, partially colored hair</li>
            <li> This product was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> there is nothing remotely rosemary mint about this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> WEN would make my hair flat / heavy&amp; a little dirty feeling after more than 3-4 days of consecutive use;  Renpure does not.  </li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical and worried this would leave my hair either greasy or too dry</li>
            <li> I used this cleansing conditioner as directed, and after about four uses (one week later), my hair became tangly, difficult to comb and when dry (naturally), my hair is flyaway and dry looking.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I use just a touch of shampoo to cleanse my scalp, but certainly not to suds up, and then rinse and use this.</li>
            <li> I used to use Wen and after about four or five months of using it I found my hair was dry and crunchy and the price just was not worth it.</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate with very hard water</li>
            <li> Third I have had serious health problems, including multiple surgeries.</li>
            <li> I have long, blonde, wavy, frizzy, straw-like, dull hair.  </li>
            <li> So, I washed my scalp with normal shampoo to get rid of the oil, then used this hoping it would at least help condition my dried ends.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to this one but the texture is very thin and watery and right away I was worried.</li>
            <li> I have tried dry shampoo but it leaves the texture of my hair a little rough.</li>
            <li> I have a little grey and color treated curly hair.</li>
            <li> So my hair is normally a dry brittle frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything but make my hair a dry, tangled mess.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, dry hair</li>
            <li> and I plan on trying the other ones from this company as well.  </li>
            <li> Massaged into my scalp/hair, left in in for a few minutes, and when I rinsed it out, my hair felt like straw!  </li>
            <li> &amp; I want it in the other scent.</li>
            <li> Is it safe to use daily or should I alternate use with other products in between?&lt;br /&gt;The texture of my hair while applying it in the shower was awful.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try other products of this brand.</li>
            <li> Decent men&#x27;s shampoos and conditioners run 10-30 bucks per bottle, and the cheap junk (Dove Men+care, Suave Professionals) just leaves your hair dry and nasty.</li>
            <li> All other conditioners are so supple that you can just use your fingers.</li>
            <li> I found this one along with the other two scents on bogo at walgreens</li>
            <li> Other than the smell</li>
            <li> and it leaves my hair extremely shiny, but it also leaves it over-conditioned.</li>
            <li> I do use other Renpure products and they are excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is long, tends to be oily on the scalp and dried and frizzy towards the ends.</li>
            <li> Is not comparable to Wen or other cleansing conditioners at all.</li>
            <li> the other brands did-when I used the \\&quot;Hair One\\&quot; and \\&quot;Salon</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve started trying other ones on the market</li>
            <li> And like other reviewers have said, rinse rinse rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> all other shower stuff - ???</li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t include styling products, sprays, cuts, blowouts, coloring, and other treatments and products one still might use.</li>
            <li> for $9.99 you can&#x27;t beat the price considering your other options.  </li>
            <li> unlike other cleansing conditioners in a jar, the pump makes it easier to manage in the shower.</li>
            <li> (that&#x27;s just the nature of blonde hair, each hair has a small diameter).  </li>
            <li> It did dry hair out a little</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair a little dry, but not buad</li>
            <li> I hate using traditional shampoo on my fine, blond, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I have used a few other cleansing conditioners and none of them left my hair extremely heavy and greasy.  </li>
            <li> After using this all I did was blow dry and flat iron with some smoothing cream and my hair was SLICK AS SNOT!</li>
            <li> I do have hair that tends to be a little dry, but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any need for you to suffer and end up with grease-slicked hair with any of these products!</li>
            <li> It didnt dry out my hair at all, or feel stiff, and not too soft and weak.</li>
            <li> But Felt A Little Dry And Slightly Tangled.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t too bad, but is sort mediciney like Ben Gay.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that my hair gets greasy faster with this product than some of the other I have tried.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not going to foam up like a conventional shampoo because A, there&#x27;s no SLS in it and B</li>
            <li> The product was extremely hard to work through my hair, even though I added water just like the directions said, and I only used 8 pumps (the directions say 8-10 pumps).  </li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling sticky; my hair was dull and lifeless.  </li>
            <li> No harm done.thick, that it is really hard to get the last bits out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I would say let the Renpure sit for as long as you can while you shower and don&#x27;t be afraid to really scrub your scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sad because I REALLY wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li> At the time of this writing, I am 62, and still have about 95% of my hair dark brown, which is the color</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> , in case anyone cares (my hair is quite curly and currently about 5&amp;#34; past my shoulders when dry):&lt;br /&gt;1) Cleanse with either the Renpure or the L&#x27;oreal cleansing conditioner, scrubbing scalp well with fingertips; let it sit for a few minutes while I bodywash/shave/whatever else needs</li>
            <li> I currently am wearing my hair in two-strand twists and I apply 4-6 pumps to my thick apl hair at night before bed.</li>
            <li> The roots of my hair hate this product the most.  </li>
            <li> I have thick wavy and coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> Even being careful of that, the cleansers were too harsh for my ends.</li>
            <li> (He has short, thick, curly hair.)</li>
            <li> Wet my hair, few squirts of Renpure in my palm, rub into my hair, finish showering, rinse my hair and viola...</li>
            <li> I typically wash my hair every day to avoid buildup, and was hoping to find a product that would be gentle to my hair as I grew it out (if I could reduce the amount of washes, bonus).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this, I absolutely hated it.</li>
            <li> I add a splash of water and work it down to the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> I have thin-ish hair and it didn&#x27;t way it down.</li>
            <li> , Renpure is a winner hands down.</li>
            <li> broke down &amp; ordered some Wen from an Amazon retailer</li>
            <li> My hair was so weighed down and greasy.  </li>
            <li> How could a &amp;#34;cleansing conditioner&amp;#34; not weigh my hair down?  </li>
            <li> Well, I tried &amp; tried, but I had to break down and use shampoo in conjunction with the product.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, fine hair, so it&#x27;s difficult to retain body.  </li>
            <li> I never shampoo my hair everyday or even every other day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really hesitant to try this again in a different way, it was so bad.</li>
            <li> Renpure costs less than Biolage.</li>
            <li> Definitely less hair loss, and I still wash every two days.</li>
            <li> And I think my hair got slightly lighter in color.</li>
            <li> Now, I buy it here for half the price.  </li>
            <li> After using this for about two weeks, I noticed a softer texture, less hair loss and less breakage.  </li>
            <li> less often.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a less costly substitute for Wen.  </li>
            <li> So I decided to look online for a cheaper price or a comparable product for less.</li>
            <li> (so I can use a bit less) and I don&#x27;t lose a bunch of hair when I wash.</li>
            <li> It left my hair heavy but at least it was not stripping my hair.</li>
            <li> but I have had enough experience with these types of products to say that I have serious doubts it would be satisfactory for anyone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking for a product that will enable me to use LESS product in my hair</li>
            <li> My hair is growing longer, with less breakage.</li>
            <li> After just one use, my hair felt softer, shinier and a lot less frizz.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of sulfate free shampoo and this is by far the worst!</li>
            <li> I have very thick long hair, this product makes it feel dry, it did not soak in...</li>
            <li> BUT I highly recommend this brand if Wen is too expensive.</li>
            <li> I have used Wen for a long time but have a hard time justifing the cost.  </li>
            <li> have lots of long thin dry hair.</li>
            <li> But my hair was SO dried out that it was hard to brush it even wet because it became so tangled even after using a wide tooth comb in the shower while washing.  </li>
            <li> If I used a little less, it took half an hour to brush out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was quite the mess.</li>
            <li> when I wake up on the morning my hair is a frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> I have spent a small fortune on Wen, and honestly,it never worked for me.</li>
            <li> Just like a lot of the negative reviews have pointed out-- if you use this product as directed, it may leave your hair looking heavy, flat, and oily.  </li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, long wavy hair that is color treated and tends to frizz..</li>
            <li> I started using a little less and leaving it on my hair for a shorter amount of time</li>
            <li> I also feel like I&#x27;m saving a little money since I cleanse less and no longer buy shampoo.</li>
            <li> It seemed to actually foam up a little and was not nearly as good as WEN.</li>
            <li> As a result, my hair felt heavy, flat, dull, and just plain not-clean.  </li>
            <li> This product does not clean, does not condition,</li>
            <li> I have to shampoo my hair at least once a day to keep it in check and sometimes have to blast it with a little dry shampoo as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to try Wen, this was a little cheaper.</li>
            <li> The rosemary mint stings my eyes a little</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it a little bit longer</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s a little too crunchy granola for me.</li>
            <li> Also, every once in a while I suggest cleaning your hair will a little bit of baking soda in water or apple cider vinegar in water to get rid of build-up.</li>
            <li> I also shake it a little before use.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to purchase this because some reviews state that it leaves your hair a little oily.</li>
            <li> When I got home I looked at reviews here on amazon and was a little discouraged</li>
            <li> I find the cucumber aloe a little drying, and the lavender too moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I noticed when I combed my hair, it seemed a little</li>
            <li> A little info about my hair</li>
            <li> I just wish it was a little thicker.</li>
            <li> My hair is also a little oily at the scalp and drier at the ends.  </li>
            <li> Not only is it making my hair less manageable and dry looking, but the texture of the conditioner is very thin</li>
            <li> This product is far less expensive than Wen.</li>
            <li> Works well but a little to heavy for my hair</li>
            <li> I tried using a little bit of the product on my towel dried hair &amp;#34;as</li>
            <li> About that--the product is so thick, that it is really hard to get the last bits out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> so I have to wash my hair everyday because my scalp gets very oily and looks dirty.</li>
            <li> Seriously, the product didn&#x27;t coat my hair and when I was done my hair strands just stood up and were really dry.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste money on this product again.  </li>
            <li> Which I never buy because my hair has always needed a heavy duty conditioner to keep the frizz away.</li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> used as directed in the shower, combing through and letting it sit on for a few mins after massaging in.</li>
            <li> and recently my hair has just gotten worse.</li>
            <li> the ends were getting too dried out.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I was shampooing my hair everyday and now do the conditioner every over day (or even sometimes go 3 days).</li>
            <li> so 10-12 pumps means I&#x27;m going to be using 10 times the conditioner and probably run out in a few weeks as opposed to 6-7 months.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money just for the name.</li>
            <li> For people hsving trouble with oilyness, I recommend rinsing well with lukewarm water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything from expensive brands to drugstore cult faves, but nothing has made my hair as soft and manageable as this product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Only To Find My Hair Getting Worse.</li>
            <li> and it has simultaneously dried my hair out and made it greasy.  </li>
            <li> a leave in conditioner&amp;#34; as suggested but that made the ends of my hair sticky and heavy.  </li>
            <li> just a few strands here and there and never saw that before.</li>
            <li> Ended up tossing it after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Unusable product, waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> It moisturizers without feeling heavy.  </li>
            <li> After I blowed dried my hair..</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t feel like the hair was washed at all and dried it out.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not a huge deal.</li>
            <li> It is not as expensive as some of those other brands of cleansing conditioners and it seems to last forever.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, using this product isn&#x27;t as difficult as it seems from other reviews, but it is very specific.</li>
            <li> BTW, my hair is thin, slightly wavy at the ends and tends toward the dry side.</li>
            <li> Imagine the mess of knots on towel dried hair!  </li>
            <li> For me, it was a slimy, oily mess that even my hairdresser commented on when I visited her after using it!</li>
            <li> I have very thick, wavy long blond hair</li>
            <li> L&#x27;oreal Evercreme (which worked well for awhile but then seemed to dull and weigh my hair down),</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, one more bad review for Ren.</li>
            <li> Even with adding a little water, I was using at least 20 pumps per shower.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, a little background: I am caucasian with medium-length, thick, curly hair and lots of it.  </li>
            <li> (very little comes out with each pump).  </li>
            <li> very little.  </li>
            <li> I had very little experience with cleansing conditioners before trying this product</li>
            <li> There was very little hair in the drain after cleansing with this product.</li>
            <li> the slick conditioned feel I was used to.</li>
            <li> (I wash my hair excessively, I know,</li>
            <li> &amp; 10-15 pumps isn&#x27;t that excessive.</li>
            <li> My hair is past my shoulders &amp; I could use 8 pumps.</li>
            <li> Not sure if my hair feels like it&#x27;s supposed to cause it feels crispy as it is just air drying.</li>
            <li> BUt I&#x27;m still not sure if this is how the results are supposed to be.</li>
            <li> so there is a learning curve, but stick with it a few washes and you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money and if you do purchase this product, you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> Initially, I would just rinse my hair, but I found it difficult to detangle my hair after rinsing it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but....</li>
            <li> I dried my hair and it looked and felt as though I hadn&#x27;t washed it weeks!</li>
            <li> I usually use a nickel size amount...</li>
            <li> I have used WEN products in the past and feel that Renpure works just as well if not better.</li>
            <li> I have thick, heavy hair.  </li>
            <li> No more shampoo for me</li>
            <li> Sadly, the local stores stopped carrying it.</li>
            <li> Dead serious--my hair SQUEAKED!</li>
            <li> Even if I were satisfied with Wen, the price is outrageous!</li>
            <li> Well NO MORE hair falling out</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I use a small amount of coconut oil.  </li>
            <li> This one did the job just as well, if not better, for 1/3 the price.  </li>
            <li> and I usually use As I Am cowash.  </li>
            <li> It took me a while to get the hang of it, and about three weeks for my scalp to realize it could stop with the excessive oil production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Was her hair damaged by excessive heat styling?</li>
            <li> I used the product several times thinking I was doing something wrong (even though I had used Wen with no issues.)</li>
            <li> It totes cleans your hair and makes it mad soft.</li>
            <li> The pump was broken which caused the product to leak out all over the bag it shipped in and other items in the box.</li>
            <li> I also like that there are no glutens and other unnecessary chemicals.</li>
            <li> (Both are crap, and the most expensive aside from Wen.  </li>
            <li> (Both are crap, and the most expensive aside from Wen.  </li>
            <li> My hair went from dull, limp, and sometimes stringy to looking like Kate Middleton&#x27;s hair!  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed because I really want to like it.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the bad reviews, I&#x27;m wondering if they have changed the formula (or maybe I have the new and improved formula).</li>
            <li> I only gave it four stars though because it is not a good leave in conditioner; my hair always felt weird after trying to using it as a leave in.  </li>
            <li> Ends were horribly dry while the rest of my hair was greasy and weird feeling.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s bad) &amp; in used to it feeling very soft &amp; flowy.</li>
            <li> Renpure left my hair very heavy and dirty feeling.  </li>
            <li> The cost: About $6.00 for 8 ounces, or $12.00 for 16 oz - at least 1/2 the price of the expensive stuff (actually a little less than 1/2 price).  </li>
            <li> After using it my hair still feels &amp;#34;tangled&amp;#34; and hard to comb out.</li>
            <li> I tried really hard to like this.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very thin, dry, damaged, and colored.</li>
            <li> I am almost surprised that it was just as bad.</li>
            <li> at least: 1 is in a brown bottle, and I think it&#x27;s marketed for &amp;#34;ethnic&amp;#34;</li>

            <li> but I think it is because I&#x27;ve been in negative temperatures for weeks now.</li>
            <li> I protected it from the sun, I only washed it once a week, I washed it in cold water, etc.</li>
            <li> It sucks.  </li>
            <li> at least on my hair.  </li>
            <li> Not the least bit greasy or oily.  </li>
            <li> I recommend Renpure - at least to try and compare.  </li>
            <li> (although I will, at least once a week, to remove build up) and my hair is not greasy.  </li>
            <li> I see a lot of negative reviews of this stuff on here</li>
            <li> Wash days used to be at least a couple hours of conditioning and oiling after shampooing.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> I thought may I wasn&#x27;t rinsing enough, I even tried rinsing with cold water hoping that would help somehow.</li>
            <li> Even at the hottest water temperature I could stand, it took at least twenty minutes to get out of my hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand or agree with any of the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions as written on the bottle except I did my final rinse with cold water.</li>
            <li> I also massaged it into my scalp for at least 5 min.  </li>
            <li> Turns out that it does, which was a big disappointment to me.</li>
            <li> I have thick, hard-to-manage hair.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as thick</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just not as thick as that &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; one out there.</li>
            <li> For reference: I have thick, wavy, color treated, shoulder length</li>
            <li> I immediately felt like my hair and scalp had a thick, greasy coating.</li>
            <li> It is not as thick</li>
            <li> /&gt;My pre-teen daughter has thick, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thick (and I mean THICK)</li>
            <li> So I tweak it up a bit, and after I worked in the conditioner to my hair and scalp, I added a smidge (and I do mean a smidge--</li>
            <li> this price, I wouldn&#x27;t say you shouldn&#x27;t try it, especially as an alternative to (expensive!)</li>
            <li> I had read other reviews that talked about how difficult it was to rinse out</li>
            <li> However, when I got home and used it with my town water, my hair was greasy and felt awful, much like the descriptions in previous reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mean, seriously.</li>
            <li> when i was in the store looking at this, i was very skeptical because it&#x27;s only one product that&#x27;s supposed to act as both shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> The tangly-ness does bug me a bit, but I think I&#x27;ll just try using a very small amount as a leave-in conditioner and see if that helps.</li>
            <li> use to buy wen buy started looking for something less expensive</li>
            <li> I had switched to WEN because my hair was falling out like crazy and always felt so dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying less expensive alternatives to WEN.  </li>
            <li> seriously I look like I have a lion&#x27;s mane if I don&#x27;t straighten it.</li>
            <li> I was a little doubtful about the whole conditioner wash scenario, but was desperate to try something to help my damaged tresses.</li>
            <li> This is NOT nearly as good as Wen Cleansing Conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Not good for me.  </li>
            <li> Not a good product.</li>
            <li> My hair felt a bit heavy when I got out of the shower, but when I ran a brush through my hair it wasn&#x27;t difficult.  </li>
            <li> so I dispensed twice the amount as directed and it at least covered all my hair then but it still was so thin.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say that caught up with me: my hair dried out and my scalp itched all the time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s and have ALWAYS had thin hair.  </li>
            <li> Also, hard to comb out tangles!  </li>
            <li> I was at my wits end, because my hair had started to be unruly, frizzy, and weird, which it never had been in the past....</li>
            <li> My hair was very dull and blah.  </li>
            <li> Not very impressed.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s tough to tell if you got it all</li>
            <li> I immediately noticed that the consistency of the product was very thick, almost paste-like.  </li>
            <li> Oh, my hair is also very thick and long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> your hair feels dirty then use a little shampoo before using ren to get out all the product and dirt.</li>
            <li> I tried WEN and it was just too expensive and hard to get</li>
            <li> But alas, it does not.</li>
            <li> Its a thin liquid &amp; doesn&#x27;t sud</li>
            <li> I was confused because this says &amp;#34;color safe&amp;#34; on the label.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in poor shape.</li>
            <li> If you are look for a dupe of Wen, this is a poor substitute.</li>
            <li> It is NOT a great detangler.</li>
            <li> I was a bit annoyed, since I thought the trend with these products was to have to wash your hair</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product but the performance was awful.</li>
            <li> I was NOT happy.</li>
            <li> Because I keratin my hair and have to wait 3 days, but this was WORSE).  </li>
            <li> But I have NEVER experienced something like this from a cleansing</li>
            <li> I would imagine if you have curly or kinky hair it would be even worse.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thin, wavy and  frizzy despite the fact I use a conditioner with it.</li>
            <li> but the new thicker version is terrible.</li>
            <li> I hate how dry and frizzy it looks.  </li>
            <li> Overall a real disappointment.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a bit confused by reviewers who felt that Ren was difficult to rinse out.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely HATED it, even after trying it for 2 weeks+ and retrying it again recently.</li>
            <li> Massage the crap out of your scalp, and then comb the stuff all the way down to your ends.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but decided, what the heck for 7 bucks</li>
            <li> well i wasn&#x27;t wrong.  </li>
            <li> I was unable to get the pump to work.</li>
            <li> am just not really impressed by the results.</li>
            <li> However, it was insanely expensive</li>
            <li> I tried the product but was not impressed.  </li>
            <li> and it is just way too expensive.</li>
            <li> I use expensive Wen shampoo.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical.</li>
            <li> I was so wrong.</li>
            <li> way too expensive.....</li>
            <li> How could you go wrong with $9?  </li>
            <li> Someone recommended Renpure to me, and I was somewhat skeptical of a &amp;#34;cleansing conditioner.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s watery and it doesn&#x27;t lather, so be prepared for that.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical</li>
            <li> This is the last one I tried, &amp; it was terrible.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe the Renpure was having a weird reaction with my root lifter, hair spray, etc...</li>
            <li> I have a weird fuzzy kink in my hair.</li>
            <li> and I wanted to try one that was not as expensive as Wen.</li>
            <li> I know weird, huh?&lt;br /&gt;None</li>
            <li> WEN is too expensive and it has some preservatives I would rather not use.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I bought this product before I read the reviews.  </li>
            <li> Just the name &amp;#34;cleansing conditioner&amp;#34; made me wary, and all the oils listed as ingredients creeped me out.</li>
            <li> that I blow-dry my hair - a singularly disturbing</li>
            <li> Not allergic itch -  greasy uncomfortable itch.</li>
            <li> However, it is way too expensive.</li>
            <li> Lousy Wen knock off, STICK with Wen or shampoo ONE from Sallys.</li>
            <li> I used it 4 times and ended up with the same awful results each time.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately as soonas I tried using it the excitement was gone.</li>
            <li> experience has led me to wonder if the Coconut Crème product Amazon sells is a fake.</li>
            <li> , it left my hair feeling greasy and nasty to boot - so insult to injury.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like a lot of other people, I used WEN but hated the expensive price.</li>
            <li> He was equally disappointed and said that he really hated the waxy feeling, even when his hair had dried, and that it felt heavy and</li>
            <li> Seriously, the worst.&lt;br /&gt;Too too bad.</li>
            <li> It has a very thin texture and does not lather.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thin, but it does condition your hair.</li>
            <li> It isnt horrible, but im used to stretching out my shampoos 2-3 days, so with this product, it is neccessary every day wash with dry shampoo sometimes.</li>
            <li> My bottle is rather thin, unless ren had a bad batch going around.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other two scents were awful.  </li>
            <li> Typical shampoos, even the salon brands for curly hair, are destructive and terrible for her hair.  </li>
            <li> All i have to say is, my experience, my hair felt so dirty after blow drying it, i had to put it up in a pony tail.</li>
            <li> Is not frizzy or crazy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Whatever had coated my hair seemed to be rapidly causing it to look oily and dirty.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say I stocked up!</li>
            <li> It dries, breaks and tangles like mad.</li>
            <li> It literally mad</li>
            <li> My hair was DIRTY and needed a wash bad, was about 5 days not washing...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even describe how bad it is, but it looks like I wiped a bunch of grease in my hair, and walked out the door.  </li>
            <li> I just know that I had three bad experiences with this product</li>
            <li> isn&#x27;t a bad deal when you consider that it can take the place of 2 products.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used WEN, and even it gets bad reviews from time to time..</li>
            <li> Frankly, at that point, I thought,\\&quot;This isn&#x27;t bad AT ALL.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> Not to bad for $12 bucks I think.  </li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t like something, I give it away, but this was so bad I did not feel I should give it away</li>
            <li> Frustrated, I found my receipt and grabbed both bottles.</li>
            <li> it was just ugly and crazy/ frizzy.</li>
            <li> I was initially disappointed when I tried it out and the consistency was nothing like Wen&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> :((.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> (I hate dealing with subscription services) and my hair felt a bit greasy.  </li>
            <li> Not the end of the world, but it&#x27;s an annoying manufacturing defect.manufacturing defect.</li>
            <li> If the price tag of Wen shocks the crap out of you, then try this.</li>
            <li> I wait till it&#x27;s coated in oil because I really hate washing my hair.</li>
            <li> Skip the oils, leave-in beard conditioners, and frilly crap that people are raving about, I&#x27;ve tried them all, trust me you might as well throw your money in the trash.</li>
            <li> Try this twice or three times before you decide you hate it.</li>
            <li> I kept cutting it because it just was horrible.</li>
            <li> Its not Wen, but for $8 its not so bad!  </li>
            <li> I tried the L&#x27;Oreal version of cleaning conditioner and hated it.</li>
            <li> We both hated it.</li>
            <li> Try it and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This cleansing conditioner is so dope. It totes cleans your hair and makes it mad soft. It totes reminds me of the time I was petting a kitten and its fur was so soft! The texture of this cleansing conditioner looks like the kind of milk your mom made you drink when you were a kid, all thick and creamy. I&#x27;ll totes buy this dope stuff again.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know if I would like this after using the big name brand W*n…This is a little thinner than that other more expensive brand. But I have been using it for a while and I find I like this better. The results are the same and for me this is a little easier to work with, plus I am saving money so I consider it a win wen…LOL.</li>
            <li> I sort of like this for the first couple of weeks, made my hair bouncy and shiny even if it was hard to detangle.  But then it started to be very drying.  I started using a little less and leaving it on my hair for a shorter amount of time but it&#x27;s still looking a bit frayed and frizzy on the ends.  For reference I have medium/long, fine but dense, color treated hair.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the scent of this! I look forward to using it in the mornings. Seems to work pretty great too. Overall very satisfied with this cleansing conditioner and I will be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> Does a great job, comparable to WEn</li>
            <li> This is not thick and creamy like WEN is, but the smell is nice, and the product seems to clean my hair without stripping it. I&#x27;m still trying to figure out how many pumps I need (long, wavy, fine, color treated hair) but I went through that with WEN the first few weeks. The consistency of Renpure is like when you water down the last of WEN that doesn&#x27;t pump out of the bottle, but costs too much to throw away.   I suggest giving it (Renpure) a good scrub with your fingertips after leaving it on about five minutes in the shower and really, really rinse it out.  Any left in makes my hair feel greasy.  I&#x27;ve used other Wen-wannabe&#x27;s that left my hair feeling like straw. Renpure doesn&#x27;t do that to my hair.  So far Renpure and Matrix Biolage are my top two WEN replacements. Renpure costs less than Biolage.</li>
            <li> Renpure Cleansing Conditioner does a good job of cleaning my hair, It is much less expensive than Wen!</li>
            <li> My scalp is oily and the ends of my hair is dry. My hair is fine, straight and limper than a wet noodle. I have to shampoo my hair at least once a day to keep it in check and sometimes have to blast it with a little dry shampoo as well. With the Renpure, my hair is not oily AT ALL. Straight out of the shower, my hair feels super dry and hay-like, not like the slick conditioned feel I was used to. It was surprisingly easy to comb through and dried faster than when I use shampoo/conditioner. The first week, my hair was a little frizzy but it&#x27;s been about a month now and the frizz is gone. The longer I use it, the shinier and silkier my hair seems to become. My hair still feels like hay when it&#x27;s wet but, dries soft and smooth. I do use a lot of product but, my hair is really long and it&#x27;s probably about the same amount of the shampoo + conditioner I was using before. The amount of hair that sheds during the shower is the same as before. I&#x27;ve tried everything to combat my greasy head and dry hair from organic products, super expensive salon brands to apple cider vinegar and nothing worked. I am amazed by how well this product works.</li>
            <li> I bought this from Walgreens because it was on sale and by one get one free for 9.99&lt;br /&gt;I am African-Amercian  with natural hair, my would be type 3b/c. I wash my hair with the product twice. I noticed my hair was softer,and clean, I love the mint feeling on my scalp, and the smell. My curls for perfectly clump together, and easy to detangle. It didnt dry out my hair at all, or feel stiff, and not too soft and weak. I also didn&#x27;t have any buildup considering it&#x27;s consistency of the product. My hair was very light weight.&lt;br /&gt; But the real test is what does my hair look like, and  how does it feel dry.&lt;br /&gt; It was very shiny, and ends look better than usual. I am suffering from split-ends, and color treated hair. I was pleased that my ends didn&#x27;t look so dry and frayed.&lt;br /&gt; I just hope after the bottle is finished I still have the same results.&lt;br /&gt;So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I have curly/frizzy/dry hair, and this cleansing conditioner did absolutely nothing for me.  It&#x27;s extremely liquidy, and it doesn&#x27;t detangle/condition my hair very well.  If you are looking for a good quality (but affordable) cleansing conditioner, skip this brand and check out L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s EverCreme and EverCurl cleansing conditioners.</li>
            <li> My bright red hair has not faded with this product. I do need to leave it in for five minutes and rinse well. As far as preserving my bright red color, this stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> Just like wen this stuff doesn&#x27;t lather or feel as though it&#x27;s cleansing at all. I quit using it on my hair after a week because it felt greasy. I now use it on my dog because she has sensitive skin and needs as much natural oil retention as possible. IT WORKS GREAT ON MY DOG :) It makes her smell good too!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste money on this product again.  Spend more and get the real WEN.</li>
            <li> I literally have tried every co-wash out there.  I tried WEN and it was just too expensive and hard to get (I hate dealing with subscription services) and my hair felt a bit greasy.  The same with most other co-washes but this one cleans and is inexpensive, has good ingredients and I have never needed to shampoo my hair to get rid of that co-wash &amp;#34;I just need to wash my hair&amp;#34; feeling.  I have fine curly hair, which is easily damaged and becomes dry and brittle.  This allows my hair to remain soft and I do not need to trim it nearly as much.  Love it will keep buying it.  The mint is the best, the pomegranate is not so good.</li>
            <li> I bought Renpure Solutions Cleansing Conditioner, hoping to save some money and find a comparable product to Wen.  I used this cleansing conditioner as directed, and after about four uses (one week later), my hair became tangly, difficult to comb and when dry (naturally), my hair is flyaway and dry looking.  I guess you do get what you pay for. This is NOT nearly as good as Wen Cleansing Conditioner.  I gave it one star for many reasons.  Not only is it making my hair less manageable and dry looking, but the texture of the conditioner is very thin so you end up wasting a  lot more product.  Wen, by contrast, is thicker and you only need to use a fraction in order to distribute through your hair.  I would say you need about two palms full of this stuff vs. about a nickle-size of Wen.  I would NOT recommend this product to anyone.  BTW, my hair is thin, slightly wavy at the ends and tends toward the dry side.</li>
            <li> This is a nice price for this product, but I was expecting a little more given the other reviews.</li>
            <li> This works surprisingly well. My hair is over processed with relaxers but I&#x27;m not willing to go natural with the unruly curls I used to have. So my hair is normally a dry brittle frizzy mess. With this my hair seems to be much more moisturized and less frizzy. I never shampoo my hair everyday or even every other day. Only once a week on Saturday. I condition it on Wednesday and Saturday with a deep condition on sunday.&lt;br /&gt;now I have no need to shampoo my hair. This cleans it pretty darn well. I always get build-up of dirt, oil and whatever else I manage to roll into. Some shampoos couldn&#x27;t even get it all out and thoroughly clean my hair but this wonderful conditioner does. Somehow. Even when I had very old sticky black motor oil and a pinch of gas in my hair it got every last drop of that oil out like it was nothing. Sure I had to leave it in for a bit longer and gently scrub away but IT GOT THE OIL OUT!!! All of it!&lt;br /&gt;I dont care what anyone says I love this stuff and I plan on trying the other ones from this company as well.  For anyone that care I have that stubborn white/black mixed hair that was very damaged and curly when I was a kid and I still over processes it with relaxers.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic and cleanses very well!  Only need to use 1-2x per week, as it tends to dry my hair with everyday use.</li>
            <li> We had such high hopes for this, especially considering the fabulous list of nice ingredients!  I have used cleansing conditioners for a while, and used several brands, including Wen.  Yes, Wen is the gold standard, but not realistic for us (my daughter with long wavy hair also uses these, and goes through a LOT!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is short, and though dyed, I don&#x27;t use styling products or tools, so it&#x27;s not damaged.  It smells wonderful, but was as thin as milk pouring out of the bottle (most of the other products are thicker).  I used tons just b/c it went everywhere.  Massaged into my scalp/hair, left in in for a few minutes, and when I rinsed it out, my hair felt like straw!  Even dandruff shampoo is not this drying!  I was stunned.  I poured lots of olive oil (and then later, coconut oil) into my hair to bring back some moisture, but honestly, it was like it stripped every last ounce of oil from the hair shaft.  My hair really didn&#x27;t get soft again until the next shampoo with another product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really surprised.  Based on what&#x27;s in it (and what isn&#x27;t), this should be the best thing ever, but sadly, I am out 10 bucks for something I won&#x27;t even use with conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As per our experience, this is my list (in order of best to worst) of the cleansing conditioners:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1  Wen (Not a miracle, but the best by far, but the most expensive.  I will not sign-up through the company&#x27;s website b/c of horror stories of trying to get out of the &amp;#34;program.&amp;#34;  However, q_c often has sales on Wen, and just yesterday I got 5 full-sized bottles (16oz each) of some &amp;#34;seasonal&amp;#34; scents for 17 dolls per bottle.  Not bad for a treat!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2  Herbal Essences Naked Cleansing Cond. (16.9 oz--The next best, and until a few days ago, also the cheapest.  When I bought it a month ago, it was 5 bux and Prime add-on; now I see it&#x27;s like 9 plus 5 for shipping.  Will wait or look elsewhere.  Really nice, esp. for the low low price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3  Pantene (They have 2 at least: 1 is in a brown bottle, and I think it&#x27;s marketed for &amp;#34;ethnic&amp;#34; hair?  The other is a black &amp; white bottle with pump.  They are both pretty good, not expensive, AND I found them both in my very average grocery store!  I&#x27;m using them now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 &amp; 5  Hair One Cleanser &amp; Renpure (Both are crap, and the most expensive aside from Wen.  Perhaps if you have very greasy hair normally, you might want something this drying, to balance it out; for normal to dry hair, I&#x27;d stay away.  They both smell nice, however!)Pantene (They have 2 at least: 1 is in a brown bottle, and I think it&#x27;s marketed for &amp;#34;ethnic&amp;#34; hair?  The other is a black &amp; white bottle with pump.  They are both pretty good, not expensive, AND I found them both in my very average grocery store!  I&#x27;m using them now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 &amp; 5  Hair One Cleanser &amp; Renpure (Both are crap, and the most expensive aside from Wen.  Perhaps if you have very greasy hair normally, you might want something this drying, to balance it out; for normal to dry hair, I&#x27;d stay away.  They both smell nice, however!)</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff! I&#x27;ve been using Wen, and the price finally got to me. I&#x27;m middle-aged and have fine hair, and after using Renpure, my hair is silky and shiny. It has no feeling of a residue of any kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of Renpure is very light and completely natural, and I like that the product doesn&#x27;t contain wheat protein. (Wheat and I don&#x27;t get along.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a bit confused by reviewers who felt that Ren was difficult to rinse out. I used it as directed (pretty much the same way I always used Wen), and it rinsed out fine. Maybe the reviewers were listening for that \\&quot;squeak\\&quot; that powerful shampoos cause, but to me, that&#x27;s a sure sign you&#x27;ve just damaged your hair pretty significantly. The point of these conditioning cleansers is that they DON&#x27;T strip your hair. They do get your head and hair clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t have any complaints. This is a terrific hair product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. After using Ren alone for a week or so, my scalp didn&#x27;t feel clean, so I&#x27;m using it as a regular conditioner along with a mild shampoo. It doesn&#x27;t clean the head as well as Wen.</li>
            <li> I bought this elsewhere, but I wanted to review it. First, I should have bought it at Amazon because it&#x27;s three bucks cheaper. Either way, I am not fond of the product. I expected my hair to look great with all those oils in there. But alas, it does not. It&#x27;s frizzy on the ends and not very manageable. I even put in a tiny bit extra after rinsing as directed as a detangler. My hair feels like I just washed it without conditioning. I think I&#x27;ll stick with my OGX Argan Oil of Morocco separate shampoo and conditioner instead. It smells about a million times better than this Renpure stuff anyway.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a month and it just isn&#x27;t the same as WEN. It doesn&#x27;t clean as well</li>
            <li> lighter than WEN and a LOT cheaper too</li>
            <li> I could never bring myself to order Wen and was on Pinterest looking for an alternative product. I came across Renpure and it was available at my local Target for only $7! I was skeptical but decided, what the heck for 7 bucks I&#x27;ll give it a try. Wow!!!! It really is amazing. I had been using diluted Castile soap as part of my &#x27;low-poo&#x27; lifestyle for about 8 months. At first Castile soap was great, but after about 6 months I felt like my hair was really dry no matter what homemade conditioner concoction I tried with it. I read a ton of reviews of RenPure and although they were either really good or really bad, I felt like BC my hair was already clarified with the Castile soap, it would be an easier transition for me than some of the people trying a cleansing conditioner right after using shampoo/products on a daily basis. I took the advice of some of the other people that reviewed this product and used the Wen directions instead of what is on the bottle and my hair is soft, bouncy and isn&#x27;t the least bit dry anymore. I have mid-back length fine hair (but a lot of it) I would say let the Renpure sit for as long as you can while you shower and don&#x27;t be afraid to really scrub your scalp. (I use a comb while in the shower) Also...rinse, rinse, rinse and then rinse some more! If you leave any of in your hair IT IS going to be greasy!!!! Good luck, I hope you love it as much as me!!!!</li>
            <li> So my hair had been feeling weighed down &amp; just gross for about a week (I wash my hair excessively, I know, it&#x27;s bad) &amp; in used to it feeling very soft &amp; flowy. I&#x27;ve been told about this stuff &amp; didn&#x27;t want to spend $7 on something I didn&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d like but my hair felt like it needed a good cleansing. &amp; wow. Instant love. My hair feels great &amp; soft &amp; healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on other comments I saw: This can be used as the only means of hair washing like a 2 in 1. &amp; 10-15 pumps isn&#x27;t that excessive. My hair is past my shoulders &amp; I could use 8 pumps. Its a thin liquid &amp; doesn&#x27;t sud so it&#x27;s tough to tell if you got it all in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Point is, as an obsessive hair washer, I absolutely love this stuff &amp; I want it in the other scent. Leaves my hair smelling great too &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I love shampooing my hair with this. It feels so soft and clean.</li>
            <li> Great product. Love the feeling of shampooing with it; even if it doesn&#x27;t make foam the texture is great in the hair and you can feel it washing even without the foam. I have medium lenght hair and don&#x27;t feel like I have to use a lot of it. Definitely less hair loss, and I still wash every two days. And I think my hair got slightly lighter in color. Maybe hair gets a bit dryer than without the normal shampoo+conditioner but I think it is because I&#x27;ve been in negative temperatures for weeks now.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, wavy long blond hair and I stumbled on this in Walgreens and bought it thinking it was a conditioner (versus a 2 in 1) Which I never buy because my hair has always needed a heavy duty conditioner to keep the frizz away. I tried it anyway and found what many have said, it is runny and does not lather like shampoo. It smells amazing and my scalp tingles when I scrub with it. Even though my hair felt dry and not conditioned when I left the shower, it combed out like a dream and after blow drying it was smooth as silk! I am hooked.</li>
            <li> This really is an amazing product, and I&#x27;ve had great results with it.  It left my hair much softer and smoother without being too heavy.  However, it contains coconut oil as the second ingredient, which will strip hair color. I recently dyed my hair and wondered why the color not only faded, but was entirely gone within 2 weeks. I was confused because this says &amp;#34;color safe&amp;#34; on the label. It is NOT color safe, so be aware of that.  I did everything you&#x27;re supposed to do with color-treated hair. I protected it from the sun, I only washed it once a week, I washed it in cold water, etc. and it still stripped my color away.  If they could come out with a truly color safe formula that uses oils like jojoba oil, I&#x27;d be lining up to buy it.  I was so disappointed that this didn&#x27;t work for me, because it really is a great conditioner and smells amazing. And it&#x27;s affordable.</li>
            <li> So I was very skeptical about trying this at first, mainly because I had tried Wen before and I absolutely HATED it, even after trying it for 2 weeks+ and retrying it again recently. It just wasn&#x27;t for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, THIS is a miracle worker for my hair! I have very oily hair and usually start looking like a greasy mop after 1 day of not washing. With Renpure, I can go 3 days without my hair feeling gross and heavy. My hair is soft, fluffy (amazing, since i have such fine hair) and smells great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do need to be sure you rinse your hair thoroughly before, spend 1-2 minutes massaging it into your scalp (I comb my hair during this time, in order to make sure everything is properly coated) and then I go on with the rest of my shower before rinsing it out thoroughly at the end. Your hair WILL feel a little waxy when you&#x27;re rinsing it out, but trust me it dries very soft afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very long hair, so I use about 13-15 pumps total but at $6.99 a bottle it&#x27;s not a huge deal. In total volume, it&#x27;s much less than the shampoo and conditioner combined that I was using with organix so I&#x27;m already saving a lot of money here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and try it if you&#x27;re wondering about using cleansing conditioners. It&#x27;s cheap enough that even if you don&#x27;t like it, you&#x27;re not wasting too much money.</li>
            <li> I used the Ren conditioning cleanser Rosemary Mint for the first time today. After letting it sit in my hair for about ten minutes while in the shower I also used just two pumps more on my towel dried hair. Not sure if my hair feels like it&#x27;s supposed to cause it feels crispy as it is just air drying. IF I run my fingers thru my hair the crispness goes away and my hair feels soft. BUt I&#x27;m still not sure if this is how the results are supposed to be. Is it safe to use daily or should I alternate use with other products in between?&lt;br /&gt;The texture of my hair while applying it in the shower was awful. It felt dry and coarse. Is that normal?</li>
            <li> Hands down the absolute best I&#x27;ve ever used. .better than wen..and reasonable price..I&#x27;m hooked. .I also use the coconut leave in..simply incredible</li>
            <li> Awesome cleaning conditioner for the price. It did dry hair out a little so there is a learning curve, but stick with it a few washes and you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Remember the early days of the Aussie hair products? Before Proctor &amp; Gamble bought them, they came from a family company near where I lived. And they were really good for drug store/department store products. They are still pretty good for what they cost, but Redmond Products NEVER did animal testing and by all reports was impeccable in its sourcing and other business practices. The company that makes this conditioner is owned by that same family. This formula contains some ingredients of low concern, per the GoodGuide, that are suspected of causing immunotoxicity or liver toxicity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell as good or work as well (on my hair) as some more expensive rosemary/mint formulations, but for the price, it is a very good option for fine, maybe a bit oily, hair or for when you want to get rid of product build up.</li>
            <li> I love the Rosemary Mint shampoo. Like a lot of other people, I used WEN but hated the expensive price. I love the idea of a conditioning cleanser. I saw the REN at Walgreens and knew I had to try it. My hair is just over shoulder length. It is thick, straight and in pretty good condition. It tends to be oily at the scalp and dry at the ends. The REN worked beautifully for me. The fragrance was just as nice as the WEN. The only difference I could find was that the WEN was thicker. I could see where this would be a big plus for some type of hair. You just have to rinse very well. I am so happy that I can get the same results as WEN without the price tag. I&#x27;m a REN girl!</li>
            <li> The product arrived in poor shape. The pump was broken which caused the product to leak out all over the bag it shipped in and other items in the box. It was quite the mess. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This cleansing conditioner is nothing like Wen.  It is hard to massage through your hair and you have to use a lot more than the directions call for for cleansing.  It left my hair dry, coarse and dull.  Also, hard to comb out tangles!  Am taking this back to the store for a refund.  Don&#x27;t waste your money and if you do purchase this product, you get what you pay for! Terrible product.</li>
            <li> love the smell and love the way my hair feels after the first use.  I purchased this item as a gift.  The one I purchased for myself I bought in a local store for more money and it was supposedly &amp;#34;on sale&amp;#34; so this is definitely a good price.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try this WEN-like product since it was so much more affordable than WEN, and I discovered that it works even better!  WEN would make my hair flat / heavy&amp; a little dirty feeling after more than 3-4 days of consecutive use;  Renpure does not.  My hair has lots of body &amp; feels nice and clean.  I have very thick, fine hair, so it&#x27;s difficult to retain body.  I am very impressed with Renpure and for $23 less PER bottle than WEN, it&#x27;s a no-brainer to stick with this brand. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I have used Wen and many other fine hair products, and this product exceeds them all! My hair has never been in such healthy shape. I have fine, color-treated hair; and it feels so full of body. It does not weigh my hair down at all, plus the rosemary mint makes my scalp feel alive and tingly. I, also at times, use their Argon Luxurious Shampoo and Conditioner and equally love them!! Superior products at a reasonable price, what could be better!!!</li>
            <li> this is a cleansing n conditions product.  .I use to buy wen buy started looking for something less expensive so I tried this. good price and I like the way my hair feels n smells when I use it.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of Wen products but let&#x27;s be honest, it has really gone up in price!  I have been looking for another product that would compare and I found it!  Renpure products are wonderful!  This cleansing conditioner is every bit as good as Wen for a fraction of the price.  Try it and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!  Love Renpure!</li>
            <li> I have thick, hard-to-manage hair. I&#x27;ve always wanted to try Wen, this was a little cheaper. Smells great, didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair. Long story, short-- I&#x27;m not getting this again.</li>
            <li> It is okay, not really nourishing to my hair.</li>
            <li> when i was in the store looking at this, i was very skeptical because it&#x27;s only one product that&#x27;s supposed to act as both shampoo and conditioner.  well i wasn&#x27;t wrong.  It sucks.  at least on my hair.  it makes me hair tangly, it feels like straw after and when it dries, it&#x27;s really greasy. definitely don&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> Good product. Makes hair shine and minimizes tangles in my very long hair. I found that if there is a sticky feel to my hair after use that I did not apply enough. Do not skimp.</li>
            <li> Very watery. Tangles hair. A waste of money. Nothing like Wen. I should have stuck with the real cleansing conditioner. A bargain is only a bargain if it works.</li>
            <li> If you are look for a dupe of Wen, this is a poor substitute. It is thin, and not terribly conditioning. But the seller sent quickly and well packaged and does smell nice.  I use it my bath water, as a skin conditioner.</li>
            <li> I stopped using shampoo about 4 months ago. Initially, I would just rinse my hair, but I found it difficult to detangle my hair after rinsing it. I have hip-length hair that is very fine and I usually have to use a lot of conditioner (an entire handful) just to make my hair manageable enough to brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across Renpure at a local drugstore (where it costs 11 dollars) and tried it out. It has a very thin texture and does not lather. The scent is pleasant. The bottle says to use 10+ pumps, but I find that I have to use 20 pumps or more because of how long my hair is. I put most of it onto my scalp and I massage it in. I add a splash of water and work it down to the ends of my hair. After I&#x27;m done with the rest of my shower, I rinse out the Renpure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a week of using Renpure, I noticed is that my hair seemed to be falling out more than usual. First, I thought it was postpartum hair loss. Then, after I did some research, I learned that many regular shampoos and conditioners contain binding agents that prevent detached hair strands from falling out, giving the illusion of more volume. In other words, even though most people lose about 100 strands of hair per day, many of those strands stay on your head attached to other strands of hair if you use volumizing products. Many people who stop using shampoo experience increased shedding because these 100 strands actually fall out instead of falling out and getting stuck to other strands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several months in, I notice that I lose about 10-15 strands of hair each time I use Renpure, which still alarms me, but I suppose it&#x27;s normal after all.  My hair is softer and in better condition than ever before.  It is so much easier to detangle, and I can go much longer in between &amp;#34;washes&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last note: I have gone through about 8 or 9 bottles of Renpure, and 3 of them have had defective pumps. I was unable to get the pump to work. Not the end of the world, but it&#x27;s an annoying manufacturing defect.manufacturing defect.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and feels fantastic. It kinda feels like I&#x27;m washing with smooth, silky, and watery conditioner, which feels nice but doesn&#x27;t make me think of &amp;#34;good&amp;#34;. But after I realized it still cleans my hair perfectly and keeps it feeling smooth and amazing, i loved it all over. Will never stop buying!</li>
            <li> I really like it... Although not as good as WEN but 3rd of the cost.</li>
            <li> This stuff seems okay to me. i pretty much followed the instructions, although i do have to use more like 16 pumps for my fine thin hair. i make sure to rinse it out really good, and it has never left my hair crunchy or dry. i haven&#x27;t gotten to the point where i can go more than one day without washing though, when I wake up on the morning my hair is a frizzy mess. It looks great and feels soft when freshly washed though. i think i&#x27;m going to have to try a different brand of cleansing conditioner, I like the concept am just not really impressed by the results.</li>
            <li> I have use this off &amp; on when I cannot afford Wen and really see no difference at all.  The rosemary mint stings my eyes a little so I prefer the sweet pomegranate which doesn&#x27;t.  It is also easily available at Riteaid if I need it quickly.</li>
            <li> it  was better then I expected and I would use it in the furture</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and clean.  Good value for price.</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell so far, this product is as good as Wen.  Wen is so pricey!  I actually use less of this than the Wen brand and get the same great results.  I highly recommend this!  Going to try the other fragrance next time!</li>
            <li> Shampoo and conditioner in a whole new package.  This saves me a bit of time in the morning (which I appreciate) and smells absolutely lovely.  You just rub through your hair, let sit while you finish your shower biz, and rinse!  Your hair feels clean and soft, and smells good long after rinsed.</li>
            <li> I love this co wash works great n u can feel the tingling</li>
            <li> Not as good as Wen but close</li>
            <li> I have been using this since I bought it I really don&#x27;t see any change in my hair at all I&#x27;ll give it a little bit longer but I&#x27;m not seeing any anything happening still looks the same from day one.</li>
            <li> I would give it a thousand stars if I could. Have been wanting to switch to the &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; method after my aunt telling me she uses homemade apple cider vinegar and baking soda to wash her hair, it feels so soft like you;d never believe... but, I wanted something with nutrients and oils, I picked this up at target for just over 6 bucks. My hair was DIRTY and needed a wash bad, was about 5 days not washing...sounds gross but it&#x27;s how my hair stays so long and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used as directed in the shower, combing through and letting it sit on for a few mins after massaging in. You would not believe what a major difference in texture, feels like a baby&#x27;s hair... I&#x27;m actually in disbelief...if you think about it the harsh sudsy surfactants in shampoo strip the hair, this will probably help it grow even better! I can;t wait to see after a while of using it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;things to know, it won&#x27;t suds up.. so you will have to get used to that.&lt;br /&gt;It has oils like rosemary and mint which are known to help thinning hair and stimulate scalp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DON&#x27;T THINK i WILL EVER USE REGULAR SHAMPOO AGAIN! Unless I color it to wash the color out !</li>
            <li> Love this product. 1/3 price of Wen and effective.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, dry hair and recently my hair has just gotten worse. I tried to go natural on my hair and not use any heating tools but my hair was just unmanageable so I always wore a bun. I hear about this product on YouTube and I decided to give it a shot and now I&#x27;m in love with it! Not only its moisturizing but it also cleanses my hair without using any chemicals, my hair feels so much better now!</li>
            <li> does great job on my very thin, oily hair.  Makes my hair soft and look clean, without drying it out like every shampoo I have ever used and conditioner makes my hairy so greasy.  This stuff works perfect and doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of non shampoo cleanser. I have tried Wen with good results but the cost is prohibitive. I saw this at Target and for $6.99, it was a cheap try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is color-treated, fine, wavy and there are wirey colored gray hair. My ends are dry but my scalp is a cesspool of petroleum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell. It is minty and herb-y. I use it in the a.m. and it wakes me up. My hair is easy to comb and has a shine (not oily). I like it!</li>
            <li> I cannot wait to use this! What a great deal!</li>
            <li> After trying wen which is only a conditioner, not a cleanser, i was really looking forward to trying this. This made my hair feel like straw and undid all the moisturizing I did for my hair.  No moisturizing whatsoever and even after i drowned my hair with moisturizer to make the harshness of this product go away, it was still stripped.  Be very careful with this if you have dry hair.</li>
            <li> Wow. This is amazing. My hair is super thick, over-processed and brittle at the ends yet still oily at my scalp. This conditioner has made my hair super soft and shiny all over without feeling weighed down. Just what I was looking for. I love that it suggests to use this as a leave in conditioner too. I washed my hair last night with it, slept on it, woke up looking shiny and healthy, then added the conditioner to my ends (they are so damaged but I don&#x27;t want to cut it), and it did not make my hair greasy only soft and shiny. I&#x27;m SO happy I tried this bc I was worried it was another crappy product. I can&#x27;t wait to try other products of this brand.</li>
            <li> I love this product, my hair never feels flat ever with Renpure, even a few days out from washing it.  I absolutely would recommend it.  I use about 10 pumps.  My hair is jaw length.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure this would work, not being a &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; but it did clean very well and I used it after rinsing for conditioner. I can&#x27;t remember the last time my hair stayed clean this long between shampoos. I might use extra to condition next time though. My hair was a little more &amp;#34;unruly&amp;#34;. I love the smell!</li>
            <li> For me, this is better than Wen, because with most conditioners, higher water content seems to help with my thick hair. It&#x27;s also great for shaving too, and leaves skin super soft and minty fresh!</li>
            <li> Cleans hair very well. Leaves hair soft.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like this one as much as others.  Leaves something in the hair - feels a bit too oily.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but....Amazing product! I used the &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; method for a long time, which balanced the PH of my scalp nicely, but unfortunately because my hair is so long (below my hips) the ends were getting too dried out. I really didn&#x27;t want to go back to regular shampoo and conditioner, as I knew the harsh chemicals would wreak havoc on all the work I&#x27;d done to cut them out in the first place. I tried Wen for awhile, and although it had more chemicals than I would have liked, I did enjoy it. However, it was insanely expensive and I couldn&#x27;t afford to keep it up. I made my own cleansing conditioner using all organic oils and essential oils, with a specially chosen &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; conditioner (btw, if you have the time to do this it is well worth it!) but because of an increasingly hectic schedule I kept running out before I had time to make more. Enter RenPure. I was hesitant to try this, as I&#x27;d seen a lot of cleansing conditioners that just weren&#x27;t effective or had too many fragrances, chemicals, etc. The RenPure product is indeed a bit thinner than Wen as some people have mentioned, but I&#x27;ve found that this only helps it to last longer as a little goes a long way. I was using a whole bottle of Wen every 2 weeks, but I&#x27;ve had this product for almost 2 weeks now and I&#x27;ve barely made a dent. Don&#x27;t forget - I have extremely long, thick hair that is very fine. This product cleanses well and leaves a beautiful shine, but does not leave a greasy residue or weigh my hair down. I was at my wits end, because my hair had started to be unruly, frizzy, and weird, which it never had been in the past....but after only a few uses of this product, my hair is back to being luxurious, soft, and smooth. It is not weighed down so the natural slight wave is back, but it is no longer frizzy which is what some of the other cleansing conditioners left me with. The scent is also pleasant! I love essential oils, and rosemary/mint was a combination I used when I was making my own cc. I also have the coconut co-wash and I love that as well!aking my own cc. I also have the coconut co-wash and I love that as well!</li>
            <li> I stopped using Wen because of the price, and hoped this was a dupe. I was initially disappointed when I tried it out and the consistency was nothing like Wen&#x27;s. But once my hair dried, I was really impressed; I like this product more than Wen. I&#x27;m not huge on the scent, and my hair seems to take a bit longer to dry, but it leaves my hair surprisingly clean, soft, and very shiny. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month. I was washing my hair once every 2 days with a sulfate-free shampoo before I started using Renpure, but now I&#x27;m easily able to wash it only twice a week without it getting oily. Huge fan!</li>
            <li> Love this product for my curly hair. I use it almost every day.</li>
            <li> Although it is a bit like washing your hair with Maalox, you will forget that the minute you see and live with your hair.  This stuff is magic, a cleansing conditioner with no sulfates, no &amp;#34;clubs&amp;#34; to join, no HUGE price tags.  I love the rosemary mint smell and tingle.....</li>
            <li> I was looking for a more affordable alternative option to WEN and this is it for me! I tried HAIR-ONE and it was to heavy for my fine, straight hair... This even smells a lot like WEN.  I live in a very dry climate with very hard water so my hair can get really dry, but most hair products are too heavy for my hair type... This isn&#x27;t! It&#x27;s worth a try! Plus the ingredients are safer then most hair products.</li>
            <li> Not even close to WEN... Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Love this scent!!!  I love all Renpure product because of there natural ingredients!</li>
            <li> I just used Renpure cleansing conditioner for the first time yesterday.  Was a bit nervous about it after having used several homeopathic recipes to eliminate shampoo from my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long (mid back ) hair that is very thick  and has a tendency to frizz unless it&#x27;s  blown out in a very specific manner.  I  also have a lot of natural wave in my hair that I  never get to see.. cuz I  have to blow out my hair to get rid of the frizz!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair gets very tangly after shampooing,  sleeping. . Breathing... you get the idea.  But even after the first use there was an immediate difference.  As with the other recommendations,  really make sure that you wash this stuff out THOROUGHLY!  I  really didn&#x27;t have to use a lot of product.  Took a fine tooth comb into the shower and as the directions stated, combed it through my hair from scalp to end.  All told, I  used 4 to 5 pumps.  That also helped with the tangling issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the beauty part:  1  didn&#x27;t spend 10 minutes ripping my hair out of my head!  Nor did I  blow dry my hair... it dried frizz-less.. with really pretty waves.. no stiffness at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost on cue, while working out at the gym, someone who I see regularly commented  on the hair.. possibly a plant by the company;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to use and recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have never tried Wen, but I don&#x27;t want to at such a high price.  I found this at my local Walgreens for almost $12 and decided to try it.  Now, I buy it here for half the price.  My hair is chemically treated, colored and I flat iron it daily.  Talk about damaged hair!  I have done the sulfate free for about two years before trying Renpure.  They still made my hair dry, just not as dry a regular products.  After using this for about two weeks, I noticed a softer texture, less hair loss and less breakage.  Look...I am not saying it is &amp;#34;gold&amp;#34; in a bottle, but it is pretty close.  If you are looking to try it, just do it.  Many people spend more on a cup of coffee than what this costs.  You can&#x27;t beat the price.  By the way....the smell is pretty great, too!</li>
            <li> Works well but a little to heavy for my hair</li>
            <li> I bought this product when I could not justify spending the money on Wen. It smells great. I use 8-10 pumps, mixed with some water and let it sit throughout my hair while I shower. It is NOT a great detangler. So what I have done is made a spray bottle of water mixed with some of the product to mist in my hair gently after the shower. I did notice that my hair started to get greasy after 3-4 days, so now I&#x27;ve incorporated an organic, sulfate-free, lemon verbena shampoo to my routine 2-3 times a week. This has really worked for my fine, thin, medium-length, colored hair.</li>
            <li> Not good for me.  It left my hair greasy and did not clean it properly.  I went back to Wen products.</li>
            <li> Its not Wen, but for $8 its not so bad!  The consistency is pretty thin compared to wen but the smell is nice and I like the tingly effect it gives my scalp.  A good thing that I noticed is that it doesnt seem to leave residue like Wen does.  If you&#x27;re in a pinch and you use conditioning cleansers instead of shampoos, this is a great alternative.</li>
            <li> It had a really wonderful scent and works exactly as indicated on the hair.  I have been using the pricier alternative, but this works as well.  I have long hair, curly and treated with keratin and this works with all that very well leaving a manageable clean feeling.  I will admit, i do add a conditioner after rinsing but it would probably work just as well if i did nt.</li>
            <li> the product does what it says.  It is not quite as thick as it could be but it has a nice smell and I love the mint.  I feel it is worth the price I paid for it.</li>
            <li> Every bit as good as Wen haircare!</li>
            <li> Smells good &amp; hair is soft</li>
            <li> I love this product! I&#x27;ve fine hair that tends to get greasy looking at the end of the day, but can also get frizzy after styling. Renpure not only tamed away the frizzy and flyaways, but also kept my hair from feeling and looking greasy. It adds a lot of shine and makes my hair look and feel healthy. The only recommendation I have for anyone who wants to use this product is to make sure to thoroughly rinse your hair out in order to wash away the cleanser, because your hair can look oily at the roots if the cleanser is still on the scalp.</li>
            <li> These products are great. I have used the mint, sweet pomegranate, and lavender and I am a fan off all 3. They have a great smell and a nice consistency. They are not a &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; so they don&#x27;t have suds, but that is what makes them so much better for your hair. My hair is silkier, healthier, and more manageable since using these products. Also, the directions say to use a lot of pumps, but I only use half the amount and apply to my scalp only (although occasionally I do all my hair). This product may not be for everyone, but my whole family likes it and we all have different hair types. My hair is curly and tends to get frizzy easily, my mom&#x27;s hair is very curly, my one sister has wavy hair, and my other sister has super straight hair. And we all use these products and love them.</li>
            <li> I bought this at harris teeter a few months ago and fell in love with the way it made my hair feel and act! Then it ran out, and being broke it took me until a week ago (and it being on sale at Walgreens on payday) for me to buy more. So I bought two. I was so excited i went home and immediately got in the shower. It felt horrible! Like I had tried to wash my hair with lotion! I dried my hair and it looked and felt as though I hadn&#x27;t washed it weeks! I thought maybe I didn&#x27;t rinse thoroughly so I tried it again the next day. Same thing. Frustrated, I found my receipt and grabbed both bottles. I then noticed that one bottle (the one I had been using) said &#x27;color safe formula&#x27; and the other said &#x27;safe for color treated hair.&#x27;  So I looked at the ingredients. The first ingredient was the same, purified water. The second ingredients differ: the one that made my hair feel really greasy had sorbitol (sugar), and the other had cocamidopopyl (coconut oil). So I tried the one with coconut oil as the second ingredient and bam! my hair feels amazing. I returned the crappy one and purchased the one with the right formula. I will be aware from now on!!</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to Wen if you have pretty healthy hair. I actually used it last night (I use Wen Fig normally) just to be able to give you an honest review. I was impressed that it actually wasn&#x27;t bad! I have damaged hair, so I need to stick to the more moisturizing Wen Fig. If the price tag of Wen shocks the crap out of you, then try this. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. If you have really dry damaged hair, leave some in on your ends for extra moisture. I am giving my bottle to my fiance, he will love it. Hope this helps!&lt;br /&gt;Licensed Beauty Pro</li>
            <li> I purchased Ren from Rite Aid while visiting my brother and was excited to find a Wen alternative.  I used it at my brother&#x27;s who has a spring fed well.  It worked great - just like Wen!  I was impressed!!  However, when I got home and used it with my town water, my hair was greasy and felt awful, much like the descriptions in previous reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My review is mixed.  I will use it when I go visit my brother but not at home unless I get a water softener system.  I hope the makers of Ren can find a solution to the chemical issue with my town water!</li>
            <li> I really loved this stuff! My hair is fine, curly, and has a tendency to frizz. With Renpure my hair is much more manageable, soft, and shiny. It doubles as a leave in conditioner and has a great minty scent. It is not as expensive as some of those other brands of cleansing conditioners and it seems to last forever.</li>
            <li> First a little background on my hair type.  I have long, blonde, wavy, frizzy, straw-like, dull hair.  I don&#x27;t use styling products (hairspray, serum, etc).  In the winter I like to blow dry my hair and straighten it.  It would take 2-3 straightenings after washing and blow drying to fight the frizz and wave.  This is the first cleansing conditioner I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I first used this product I was in love.  My hair had never felt this silky and smooth.  I finally had shiny hair.  Just one pass with the straightener was enough to get everything looking great.  I used this product to wash my hair each time I showered.  After a week and a half I started noticing my hair getting greasier faster than normal.  Second day hair, which used to be my best day, was now looking a little dirty.  I was a bit annoyed, since I thought the trend with these products was to have to wash your hair less often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this over a month now and am back to being pretty happy.  At first I followed the instructions and used the product like a shampoo.  Now I put the product on my ends, let it sit, then rinse the top with 2 pumps diluted in about 1/4 cup of water.  I still have shiny, smooth, more manageable hair, but have gotten rid of the greasy bits on day 2.  I&#x27;ll likely try some other cleansing conditioners as well, but am pretty happy with this one for now.</li>
            <li> My 1st, experience with a \\&quot;No Poo\\&quot; shampoo... My hair turned out soft, plump, and smelling good. In a nice unbreakable bottle with convenient pump :-)</li>
            <li> It was being compared to WEN  Not even close this is very runny and left my hair feeling funny like it had a residue on it</li>
            <li> If you are used to the Wenn product, you will notice a difference.  It isn&#x27;t as thick and I have to use a little more of it, but I still like it and it is a great value. It smells great and leaves my hair in great shape.</li>
            <li> As a non-shampoo kind of girl and a mild product junkie, I keep my eyes peeled for sulfate free products that provide ample moisture to my 3c/4a henna&#x27;d curls. Enter Renpure. As a cleansing conditioner on it&#x27;s own, I can&#x27;t really tell you much about it. However, as a mild styler and leave in, this stuff works great. I currently am wearing my hair in two-strand twists and I apply 4-6 pumps to my thick apl hair at night before bed. Some have mentioned that this product can put a little weight on your strands and that is true. It is also what I look for most in a product since my hair is very thick and prone to defy gravity regardless of what I use to pull it down. The texture of this product works well for my usage as it clumps my curls together, provides moisture, and tames frizz. It also smells great which is another bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my described usage, wash-day becomes a whole lot simpler. By the time I&#x27;m ready for wash, my hair is loaded with this product. I just massage a few pumps more of the product into my scalp, rinse my hair and voila! Clean-er hair ready to be styled all over again. Also as a note, my definition of clean is for my scalp to be free of dirt, not to be stripped of oil. After rinsing my hair still retains a positive level of moisture. I often will add 4 to 6 pumps after wash and seal with castor oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a whole, I love what it&#x27;s doing to my strands, my hair looks healthier, feels softer and stronger on this product.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this for individuals with oil prone hair. My hair tends to naturally be dry and because of my sulfate free regimen, my scalp produces far less sebum than when I used harsh detergents on my hair. I would definitely recommend this as a styler and as a leave in. As a cleansing conditioner, I&#x27;m already wed to my homemade concoction of amla and shikakai powder mixed with cheap-o (V05 Strawberries and Cream moisture-milk) conditioner. Renpure isn&#x27;t strong enough as a cleanser by itself and if itwere, I&#x27;d give it 5 stars instead of 4. However this product is a good break when I&#x27;m too busy to make my own products and I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I recommend it ............ very good product is what I wanted .... thanks</li>
            <li> This is a really nice cleansing conditioner. It has a really nice fragrance to it. It&#x27;s not too strong. It rinses well, it&#x27;s just not as thick as that &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; one out there. It does leave my hair nice and soft and the price is so much better!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this cleansing conditioner, and overall my hair is better than it has been, ever.  Switching to cleansing conditioners has led to the first time in my life I do not have a head full of split ends.  My only complaint is that my hair gets greasy faster with this product than some of the other I have tried.  I also like the simplicity of cleansing over using a shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Does a great job, but I like the Loreal non sulfate better.  I use this one in between and on my dogs too.  Not bad.</li>
            <li> I just recently switch to the no-shampoo method and decided not to go &amp;#34;complete hippie&amp;#34; but try this conditioner instead.  The texture is like thin yogurt or kefir and smell actually really nice (I&#x27;m no a big fan on minty smells in my hair, but this has more like floral scent to it).  The reason for 4 stars, I recently bought they pomegranate conditioner and it works better for my hair type.&lt;br /&gt;I have rather thin and very frizzy hair (but a lot of them) and this conditioner leaves them clean, but a bit stiff - kind of like some of the voluminizing shampoos I used to have. The pomegranate one gave my hair more of the silky feel, which I liked more.&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, I was pleasantly surprised that it actually did clean my hair - it didn&#x27;t look like I just went to gym.  I was shampooing my hair everyday and now do the conditioner every over day (or even sometimes go 3 days). So great product.</li>
            <li> I tried the product but was not impressed.  I have very long fine hair and the product is to runny and not thick like a good cleansing conditioner should be.  Its not horrible but does not help at all with my hair. It smells nice and minty but I need a heavier consistancy for my hiar.  I am currently using Wen and trying to find a cheaper alternative but I guess I will stick with wen untils something better comes along.</li>
            <li> I bought this to compare to Wen. Liked the Wen but I needed to use a lot for my long hair and it is just way too expensive. This is thinner than the Wen product but I believe it works as well. Thinner consistency should make it easier to use all of the product in the bottle. I also like that there are no glutens and other unnecessary chemicals.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I use expensive Wen shampoo. This is a similar product... notice the attempt to mirror the Wen name with Ren. This product is far less expensive than Wen. I use it to mitigate the cost of wen, alternating this every couple of days. Ren is a bit heavier and my hair feels heavier and thicker after using it. Ren is non foaming and all natural. Ren is better than any foaming shampoo. I prefer Wen brand over this Ren brand. BUT I highly recommend this brand if Wen is too expensive.</li>
            <li> This is the best cleansing conditioner I&#x27;ve ever tried! I feel like most cleansing conditioners don&#x27;t really clean, I was always left feeling greasy. Not this one! It&#x27;s perfect! Smells great too. I have very fine blonde hair, typically I have to wash everyday or my hair looks super greasy.  With this, I&#x27;m able to skip a day and my hair looks great. Love it.  The pomegranate smells amazing too.  I use that one on my four years daughters curly blond locks.</li>
            <li> I agree with all of those who love this conditioner. I could not believe it was on the shelf of my local Walgreens. When I saw the natural ingredients and no additives I had to try it. The results have been fabulous. I have fly away dry hair these days and this is the only product that actually put moisture in to the extent that my hair actually lays flat and looks healthy. If you have really dry hair from coloring or that lovely gray hair that&#x27;s not what it used to be, this is for you. What a find. What a price. My store doesn&#x27;t carry their shampoo and I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Used this morning first time.I&#x27;m loving how shiny and soft my hair is! Prior to this I was using various WEN cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;I actually rushed to write this review! Great product! So much cheaper than WEN.</li>
            <li> When I went to the store in search of a conditioner I was pleased to see these on the shelf. I have tried other Renpure products before and I LOVE the brand. I got this not realizing it was anything but a conditioner. When I got home and re-read the bottle I was a bit skeptical. I thought my hair would be dry and still oily after usage. I was so wrong. I have thickish wavy hair and I tend to wash it maybe twice a week. I wait till it&#x27;s coated in oil because I really hate washing my hair. It was a washing day when I first used this product. The scent is so amazing. It&#x27;s a wonderful lightly minty scent with hints of rosemary. So thrilled this is one of the scents because it&#x27;s literally my favorite. Anyways after you rinse it out your hair feels strawlike. I was tempted to put hair oil in but when I try a new product I always see how it affects my hair alone the first time I use it. After my hair dried it still smelled of lovely mint. I had zero frizz and my hair was COMPLETELY free of oil. I was pleasantly surprised. Leaves hair feeling very soft. I highly recommend this product. P.S. This product brand is NOT called Ren. It is not a Wen knockoff. This is not it&#x27;s first product. This is just their take on a cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li> I bought this in hopes of finding a Cleansing Conditioner to use that would be cheaper then Wen. I have a  nice natural curl to my hair but it does tend to get frizzy in the summer and dry in the winter. This product is not nearly as thick as the Wen product and I have found does not create the same results. After using it my hair still feels &amp;#34;tangled&amp;#34; and hard to comb out. Also find I am &amp;#34;washing&amp;#34; my hair the same amount as before where with the Wen product I am washing my hair much less which makes up a little for the higher cost.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a movement afoot to ditch your shampoo and just use cleansing conditioner. I like this idea, especially since I shampoo when I shower and I dislike all those chemicals running over my body! I had tried different cleansing conditioners, but they had left my hair limp and oily. This one is perfect. Sometimes I use just a touch of shampoo to cleanse my scalp, but certainly not to suds up, and then rinse and use this. It is so concentrated that a very little works to clean and smooth my hair. It&#x27;s perfect, my go-to from now on.</li>
            <li> I have medium-thick, wavy, color-treated Caucasian hair. Other than color-treating and light blow-drying (I do not do full blow-outs), I don&#x27;t like to do much to my hair, so it&#x27;s important to me that my shampoo leaves my hair looking great without lots of styling products. I LOVE this product. It leaves my hair shiny, bouncy, and soft. It has also done wonders at clearing up my scalp (I used to suffer from lots of pimples and dandruff on my scalp). No product is for everyone, but I honestly feel that most people will benefit from using this product according to the directions, which is to say you should make sure you leave it on for at least 5 minutes and rinse with lukewarm - not hot - water.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical and worried this would leave my hair either greasy or too dry I couldn&#x27;t comb it out.  This works great, left my hair looking beautiful!  I followed the directions and after towel drying a bit and used one pump as a leave in conditioner and it worked perfect.  Not the least bit greasy or oily.  I typically have to wash my hair every day because it starts to look &amp;#34;dirty&amp;#34; after a day, but the next morning it still looked great and could possibly go two days without washing, but I&#x27;m not sure if I can go a day without washing.  Great stuff, save a ton of money compared to the brand name you see on infomercials.</li>
            <li> I used to buy WEN cleansing conditioner.....way too expensive.....but Renpure is GREAT!!!...works the same as the higher priced version......smells great...and great results!!!!</li>
            <li> I used to use Wen and after about four or five months of using it I found my hair was dry and crunchy and the price just was not worth it. After I stopped using Wen I found that my hair was very sensitive to other shampoos and conditioners it took me months to find something that did not dry out my hair and even then my hair still was not where I wanted to be. I found Renpure at my local Rite Aid for way cheaper than Wen and decided why not give it a try. Best decision I could have made.  My hair was finally soft, smooth and shiny again and the best part about it is that I can go back an forth between this and regular shampoo (I like a deeper clean after swimming in the pool) and it does not mess with my hair. It is still soft and shiny. I&#x27;ll never go back to Wen.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! My hair has not felt this healthy ever!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man. I have a beard and long hair. while looking for some decent, affordable shampoo and conditioner that didn&#x27;t smell like a chick, I was coming up short. Decent men&#x27;s shampoos and conditioners run 10-30 bucks per bottle, and the cheap junk (Dove Men+care, Suave Professionals) just leaves your hair dry and nasty. I found this stuff at the grocery store for $8, and after I&#x27;d tried my girlfriends&#x27; Wen in my beard a few months prior, I decided to just give this a shot. This is the real deal - extremely affordable, makes your hair soft and manageable, and it doesn&#x27;t smell like a Cosmopolitan magazine perfume sample page farted in your hair after you wash with it. Smells mostly like mint, and it doesn&#x27;t linger on you once your hair dries. I&#x27;ve been using it now for about 6 months, and I won&#x27;t use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this as a beard wash/conditioner. Skip the oils, leave-in beard conditioners, and frilly crap that people are raving about, I&#x27;ve tried them all, trust me you might as well throw your money in the trash. It&#x27;s all natural also, so you&#x27;re not pouring chemicals into your skin. get yourself a good boar bristle brush and use this stuff. You&#x27;ll thank me later.</li>
            <li> Renpure has the same feel as Wen.  Have only used it once and could not tell the difference between Wen and Renpure.  I think I am going to like as well as Wen.  Certainly love the price better than Wen.  I am thinking it is not so much what you are putting on your hair as it is what you are NOT putting on your hair; such as, sulfates, dyes, parabens, gluten, phthalates, propylene glycol, etc.  I think, if you wanted to go through the trouble, you could make your own personal cleanser/conditioner.  Note:  The Renpure smells good but has a more subtle fragrance than Wen Sweet Almond Mint which is the only Wen I have used to date.  I recommend Renpure - at least to try and compare.  How could you go wrong with $9?  Also, Renpure has a longer list of ingredients mostly oils from plants like coco nut, sea weed, etc but as far as I can tell no chemicals.</li>
            <li> There is no &amp;#34;one size fits all&amp;#34; with shampoos/cleansers simply because there are so many different hair types- thick/thin, coarse/fine, curly/straight, processed/natural, colored/not. I happened to want to try a no detergent cleanser. I couldn&#x27;t make the leap to no-poo, that&#x27;s a little too crunchy granola for me. I tried the L&#x27;Oreal version of cleaning conditioner and hated it. My hair never felt clean. I was a self professed shampoo junky. I can&#x27;t tell you how many partially used bottles of EXPENSIVE shampoo and conditioner I have in my bathroom, it&#x27;s embarrassing. I stumbled upon this Renpure expecting nothing and I love it. I&#x27;ve been using it exclusively for probably 4 months. I&#x27;ve given bottles to all my girlfriends (and yes, they love it too). I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s particularly good for thick hair, but then I don&#x27;t have thick hair, so how would I know? All I can say is, for the price it&#x27;s worth a try. You might love it as much as I do. I haven&#x27;t purged my bathroom of all my other&lt;br /&gt;bottles, but I&#x27;m getting close. My husband will be so happy to get a little shelf space.</li>
            <li> I bought this as I was starting to cowash regularly. I liked the ingredients. I figured for the price it was worth a try. I bought the leave in conditioner and coconut jelly as well. This left my fine curls limp. My hair dry, and when using the complimentary products, my hair totally sticky. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! The only reason I deducted a star is that there isn&#x27;t actually any mint in this per the ingredients list. Yet, it&#x27;s called Rosemary Mint Cleansing Conditioner??? However, it does have a faint minty smell and leaves a slight tingle after washing out, which feels very refreshing (and could be all in my imagination!) Now to the good stuff, which is plenty: I&#x27;ve been using this for a month now and have quit using shampoo completely. I use dry shampoo on second day hair, but some times I can even get away without that! If co-washing is just a fad, count me in, and if not count me in for life. My hair had been bleached, box dyed, salon high-lighted, box dyed again and so on, so my ends were brittle and dry. I have fine, ultra straight hair and my roots tend to get oily, and when that happens the rest of my hair just lies flat. So the history of my hair prior to using this stuff hasn&#x27;t been great. But after just 2 weeks I could feel a softness to my hair that I haven&#x27;t felt in a couple of years. Now after a whole month, it&#x27;s like the damage to my hair has been almost completely reversed. I don&#x27;t have split ends, my hair is soft and shiny, it hardly gets frizzy and it lies straight without looking flat (I actually look like I have voluminous hair now!) The brassy discoloration of my treated hair looks revitalized, and could almost pass off as highlights. I&#x27;m seriously so glad I picked up a bottle of this Target. And it&#x27;s definitely affordable, and after a months use I still have half the bottle left (as I only use about 8 pumps rather than the suggested 10-12).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using WEN for about 5 months and I&#x27;m almost out. I really loved it but can no longer justify the cost. I decided to try this after reading some of the reviews. My hair is thin, long and fine. I had switched to WEN because my hair was falling out like crazy and always felt so dry. regular shampoo and conditioner made my scalp itch and I needed to find something else. with WEN my hair stopped falling out and my scalp no longer itched.  After two uses of this, I can already tell I love it. It&#x27;s not as great as WEN but it&#x27;s very comparable. It leaves my hair a little dry, but not buad</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, my hair is very long and curly so most hair products simply don&#x27;t work well on my hair. They either make it very greasy or super dry. I saw this while shopping at Target decided to give it a shot. I&#x27;ve tried a cleansing conditioner only once before and it was Herbal Essences. While the smell of Herbal Essences is amazing, it left my hair a big greasy mess. If I used a little less, it took half an hour to brush out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the Rosemary mint smell really pulled me in so I bought the Renpure. I&#x27;ve used it twice now and my hair looks amazing. It has so much shine and bounce- and not a hint of grease. This is important as I&#x27;m in yoga teacher training and get pretty sweaty everyday. My hair is a mess at the end of the day and if Renpure can tackle that, it&#x27;s a really good product. I&#x27;ll be using it exclusively now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad i purchased this before i read the negative reviews!  This product works great, even better than Wen did for my hair.  I get highlights often and I have medium length, layered hair that is dry and damaged.  Since I&#x27;ve been using it, my hair is soft and has a beautiful shine!  I use it just like it says on the bottle and the 10-12 pumps is accurate.  I have yet to have greasy hair.  I really like this product and have purchased it for my mother to try as well.</li>
            <li> works very well. great substitute for the wen products. much more affordable. hair silky and smooth. I have thin-ish hair and it didn&#x27;t way it down. just calmed the frizzes.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo at bed bath and beyond because they were out of my usual conditioner (which I love but wasn&#x27;t in the mood to track down that day). It smells good and has good ingredients so I decided to buy. First of all, I didn&#x27;t realize that it said on the back that you have to do 10-12 pumps each time you use it. Are you kidding me? That is so much conditioner! I usually use a nickel size amount... so 10-12 pumps means I&#x27;m going to be using 10 times the conditioner and probably run out in a few weeks as opposed to 6-7 months. I did 3 pumps at first and it felt as though I was rubbing shampoo through my hair- very odd. It was not in any way silky, moisturizing or soft. It was more that squeaky feeling like when you are shampooing. Then, they advise you to use a comb to detangle. All other conditioners are so supple that you can just use your fingers. I ended up doing 10 pumps and it STILL was not soft at all. I will say that it had a nice cool tingly feeling after a couple of minutes and the smell was great. I really wanted to like this product but the performance was awful. When I got out of the shower, my hair felt like straw and I had to use a brush to get the tangles out. Not a good product. I have absolutely loved the Avalon Organics lemon conditioner and will continue buying it and telling people about it instead.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair so happy. I love that it&#x27;s not tested on animals. It smells amazing, and my curls are gorgeous and hydrated after use. If you&#x27;re on the fence about trying a cleansing conditioner, just try this.</li>
            <li> A must have! It&#x27;s the same as Wen just a different label. Don&#x27;t waste your money just for the name.</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every brand of shampoo at the store. I dye my hair once a month and my hair was starting to dry out. I found this on Amazon and decided to give it a try. This shampoo/cleanser actually works really well for my thin Hair! Since using Renpure my hair looks really healthy and is very soft. My hair isn&#x27;t breaking off like it was and I&#x27;m getting length back. I highly recommend this product. The smell is also really great! Great product for the price!</li>
            <li> Hello! I have used both the rosemary mint and pomogrante cleansing conditioners. THEY ARE AWESOME! I have color treated blonde hair. It has left my hair so smooth and soft. I would totally recommend this product to anyone.  I have used WEN products in the past and feel that Renpure works just as well if not better. And for a product that is $6.99 compared to $30.... I am sold!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly white girl hair and have been wanting to get wen but can&#x27;t make myself spend that kind of money so I got this.  It leaves my hair feeling clean without the yucky poo stuff.  I have learned that when you get this worked into your hair real well add a little water and it actually does lather a little.  I found this one along with the other two scents on bogo at walgreens and I like all three.</li>
            <li> Like it and so much cheaper the Wen</li>
            <li> I purchased this at Walgreens. I have spent a small fortune on Wen, and honestly,it never worked for me. I think the problem was that I was so mindful of the pricetag, that I never used the proper amount of Wen, which is a lot!!! With Renpure, I use the proper amount because it costs 1/3 as much!! For people hsving trouble with oilyness, I recommend rinsing well with lukewarm water.</li>
            <li> I love the Rosemary Mint smell, and only having to use one product in the shower (instead of shampoo and conditioner).  It works well for my hair.</li>
            <li> This cleansing conditioner has revitalized my hair. I&#x27;ve seen less shedding, less breakage, more thickness, richer color and softness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry, damaged, relaxed black hair and on top of that, very very sensitive skin. I was using Renpure Organic&#x27;s shampoo but still struggled with dryness. I heard about Wen and immediately was interested in the concept but not that particular product because $30 for a month&#x27;s amount of hair cleanser is absurd. I love this product and highly recommend it over the Sweet Pomegranate version (which I don&#x27;t think cleans or moisturizes nearly as well). However, this IS NOT SHAMPOO. IT WILL NOT LATHER. IT WILL NOT SUD. It won&#x27;t feel like shampoo. This is much healthier for your hair than shampoo so I&#x27;ve found some tips along the way I think I should share:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rinse and rinse well. This cannot be overstated. This stuff is basically lights oils used to remove the dirt and heavier oils from your hair. I suggest getting in the shower and rinsing your hair thoroughly with just water to get off some surface sweat, dirt and oil. Then rub in about 10 pumps of this stuff (assuming shoulder length hair, increase or decrease if you need). Rub it in so it&#x27;s even throughout your hair. Leave it in and continue your shower, not getting your head under the water so you don&#x27;t wash it out. You should feel the minty tingle. When you&#x27;re done with your body then start to rinse and rub your hair for longer than you think you need to. Keeping rinsing, keep rubbing. At this point apply conditioner (I use Renpure Amazing Miracle and they pair well together). If you rinsed well there shouldn&#x27;t be any residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very first time I used it I was underwhelmed. But as my hair got used to it it got softer and started behaving a lot better. Try this twice or three times before you decide you hate it. Also, every once in a while I suggest cleaning your hair will a little bit of baking soda in water or apple cider vinegar in water to get rid of build-up. I&#x27;ll happily trade a little bit of build-up every few months for softer, more manageable hair.d of build-up. I&#x27;ll happily trade a little bit of build-up every few months for softer, more manageable hair.</li>
            <li> Best hair care product I have ever purchased! Great price and works wonders on my fine but full hair. I would recommend this to anyone! Even if you do not like it, the price point makes it worth a try!</li>
            <li> Save your money. I have thick, heavy hair.  A little on the coarse side. When I wash my hair with regular shampoo before I put any conditioner on it, it feels like straw.  Can&#x27;t get a comb through it without some kind of leave in conditioner. Not so with Wen. This product is nothing like Wen. My hair feels the same when I use this product as when I use regular shampoo. I thought maybe I wasn&#x27;t using enough product so I kept using more and more. I had maybe 20 pumps in my hand and it still didn&#x27;t help. It doesn&#x27;t even feel like conditioner when I put it in  my hair. I would not recommend wasting your money on this product. I would recommend shampoo and conditioner before this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have been a WEN girl almost for 5 years. Prior to WEN, I was always using shampoos imported from Japan or I brought back from Japan whenever I go back to Japan (I m Japanese living in US) since for some reason none of shampoos sold here worked for my hair and I tried a lot.  Then I met WEN, and my search for shampoos was over. I also have rosacea and extremely sensitive skin. (I tried &amp;#34;soap shampoo&amp;#34; and of course that did not work)  recently I decided to try this Ren as a cheaper alternative to my proven WEN.  My hope was high but I was disappointed. Not only this was completely different from WEN after I dried my hair, but this itched my scalp and ears. :((. So, I&#x27;m back to WEN and will stick to it.  I realized Chaz Dean really found the special formulation and not all companies can do that, not sure why other companies cannot mimic WEN, but, I will rather spend my money on WEN that has been proven right on my hair and skin for 5 years.</li>
            <li> I love it. it is better than Wen and so much more reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I tried really hard to like this.  I hate using traditional shampoo on my fine, blond, curly hair.  I know there are a lot of people who use cleansing conditioner and love it, and this was the first type I tried, but it was a terrible experience.  I&#x27;m on day 5 of using this stuff, and my hair is DISGUSTING.  I can&#x27;t even believe I came to work today with my hair looking like this.  I can&#x27;t even describe how bad it is, but it looks like I wiped a bunch of grease in my hair, and walked out the door.  I definitely would NOT recommend this product!</li>
            <li> not what i thought i was purchasing</li>
            <li> Love, love this stuff, finally my over processed, sun bleached hair looks alive!  Thanks you!!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how this stuff could clean hair when it&#x27;s made of oils, but it does! My hair is dry and damaged from constantly coloring it, but it definitely feels softer when I use the cleanser instead of shampoo. Brings out my waves without them looking like a hot mess.&lt;br /&gt;Does take some getting used to since there&#x27;s no lather. I use more pumps than the instructions call for, massage really well, and then leave it in a clip while I do my other shower stuff. The smell is awesome too! Only downside is if I&#x27;m in a hurry, it&#x27;s faster to just use shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many sulfate-free shampoos and other products for hair loss. Someone recommended Renpure to me, and I was somewhat skeptical of a &amp;#34;cleansing conditioner.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s watery and it doesn&#x27;t lather, so be prepared for that. At first, it left my hair a bit limp, but that was just the first few shampoos. After that first week, my hair was not limp, but full of body and shiny, so give it a chance. Not just one shampoo. But the best thing is that I noticed I wasn&#x27;t losing as much hair in the shower. With other shampoos (all sulfate and paraben free), I was still losing clumps of hair. With Renpure, I hardly lost ANY and that was good enough for me to stick with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the instructions say to use 10-12 pumps but I have not needed that much at all. I have shoulder length hair and have only needed to use 4-5 pumps. I wonder if some who described residue were using too much perhaps?&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL ... if you&#x27;re battling hair loss, because of postpartum or because of age and hormonal changes, I would recommend trying out this product. Believe me when I say I&#x27;ve tried them all, and this product has worked best for me.</li>
            <li> It made my fine hair lifeless.</li>
            <li> Great cleansing conditioner it leaves my hair clean without stripping it and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling weighed down. I only gave it four stars though because it is not a good leave in conditioner; my hair always felt weird after trying to using it as a leave in.  I&#x27;ve used wen as well and i have to say i like this better cause wen left my hair feeling greasy and i could feel a lot of buildup in my hair. Its also super cheap so thats a plus !!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many shampoos/conditioners, trying to find one that&#x27;s natural, keeps my hair healthy, and doesn&#x27;t dry it out. I have dry, colored hair, and this product is absolutely wonderful. It does take some getting used to (it doesn&#x27;t lather), but I love it. It rinses clean, smells great, and the ingredient list is great.</li>
            <li> All I can do share my personal experience.  I did NOT like this product one bit.  It was awfully watery so I had to use quite a bit for my long hair.  Also, it seemed to tie my hair up in knots!!(?)  At my age, I can&#x27;t afford to loose hair from excessive tangles, lol.  Maybe I got a bottle that was defective?  I don&#x27;t know.  I just know that I had three bad experiences with this product, I won&#x27;t ever use it again, and I purchased two bottles.  :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a less costly substitute for Wen.  This product is definitely far inferior to Wen, per my experience.  There are less costly products available on Amazon that are a closer match to Wen than this product is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit of a product junkie and I very rarely purchase one product twice. I have dry, fine hair and usually soak my hair in &amp;#34;conditioner&amp;#34; but I&#x27;m never very happy with any single haircare product. I&#x27;ve tried everything from expensive brands to drugstore cult faves, but nothing has made my hair as soft and manageable as this product. I use oils in my hair, yet this product always leaves me feeling clean and voluminous, yet tangle free and soft. I have no idea how this is possible, but I&#x27;m going on a month of no shampoo and I will definitely repurchase. I have no idea how other people are left greasy, since my hair feels cleaner than it ever did using a traditional shampoo and condition. I&#x27;m so glad I tried Renpure!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! $6.99 is a great price! Please make the pomegranate available too!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in the softness and fullness of my hair since I started using Renpure. I&#x27;ve never used Wen, but my experience with Renpure has been great, especially when compared to the price of Wen, Renpure is a winner hands down. I love that it makes my curly hair feel very soft and it seems to help with frizz too. I bought two bottles at my local Walgreen&#x27;s and will definitely be using only this on my hair from now on.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff on the market!!!!! Absolutely love it!!!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo! Thinner than Wen, so we&#x27;ll see how long the bottle lasts, it definitely does the job!</li>
            <li> I have read many bad reviews of renpure&#x27;s version of wen cleansing conditioner. I was skeptical but I bought it at my local pharmacy (buy one get one) I figured hey, its a good deal so let me try it. I watched a video on YouTube from wen on how to use it. I followed the instructions exactly and I love the results. My hair is very thin, dry, damaged, and colored. I could never ever just shampoo without using a deep conditioner, so I thought this would make my hair dry but it did not! My hair feels great, not greasy or dry; its perfect. I have been using it every other day for a week and my hair is feeling much healthier. I will keep using this product in hopes it will help my hair grow faster and stronger. The tips I can give is to make sure you massage your hair for at least 3 min, then comb the product from root to tip, wait another 2-3 min then rinse completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your hair feels dirty then use a little shampoo before using ren to get out all the product and dirt. If your hair feels dry, use a little of a deep conditioner afterwords. I know that probably defeats the purpose of using ren but trust me, I feel like the ingredients are giving my hair nutrients that you don&#x27;t get from a normal shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I have read reviews saying the ren that was thinner worked well but the new thicker version is terrible. My bottle is rather thin, unless ren had a bad batch going around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never had tried wen but after using renpure I might try wen to see if its better. I really like renpure so maybe I will like wen.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me. I have tried many brands of cleansing conditioner because I did not want to fork out the $$$ for Wen - it is quite pricy. This is the last one I tried, &amp; it was terrible. The first day, I styled my hair with a lot of product &amp; hot tools. Throughout the day, my hair got heavier &amp; weirder. I thought maybe the Renpure was having a weird reaction with my root lifter, hair spray, etc...&lt;br /&gt;So the next day I used the Renpure again, &amp; let my hair air dry with no product. It was awful! My hair was lank, greasy &amp; tangly. My coworker said it looked like I had put a lot of gel or mousse in it - when I had used nothing! Ick!!&lt;br /&gt;I broke down &amp; ordered some Wen from an Amazon retailer (yes, it is expensive but sooooooooo worth it) &amp; I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t do it sooner. That stuff is a miracle in a bottle.</li>
            <li> Okay, not as good as Wen.</li>
            <li> Natural and smells great!</li>
            <li> For a store-bought cleaning conditioner I was happily surprised by this product, I&#x27;ve been using it for several months now and I have no complaints. It&#x27;s a great price and I love using only one product instead of shampoo and conditioner and everything else. Plus the price means that I don&#x27;t have to worry about how much I&#x27;m using, I can truly slather it in and make sure my hair is well saturated (unlike the expensive versions where you&#x27;re more worried about conserving it so you don&#x27;t have to buy more any time soon.) The scent is light but really nice and fresh, it goes in easily and washes out clean. You can even use it as a detangler and a leave in conditioner if you wanted.</li>
            <li> Truly amazed with this product! I was a little doubtful about the whole conditioner wash scenario, but was desperate to try something to help my damaged tresses. Years of coloring and long term medications have done a number on my locks, and no matter what shampoo / conditioner (from store to salon)  I was using my hair was just lifeless. I have baby fine, thin, long hair and most conditioning really ways it down and Detangler has been always been a must. After the very first use I  noticed a difference. As always, I had to use a detangler, since shower combing is NOT an option with my fine hair. I let my hair air-dry... and it was fluffy... even with using the detangler, my hair suddenly had BODY! It was insane! I felt like a super model and had fun flicking my hair around until I nearly took out an eye! I promptly shelved all of my other product (which the fiance was thrilled to have reclaimed some of the shower space) and will never look back. My advice to new users - READ THE DIRECTIONS. And when you think you&#x27;ve rinsed enough, rinse some more, This system really doesn&#x27;t increase your shower time, because you are cutting down on the whole lather-rinse-repeat scenario. I&#x27;ve used this for about a week, and have no build-up, but plan to do a clarifying shampoo if it occurs. Love this product, and am so happy that I researched before being suckered into purchasing a similar (but over-priced) product on TV. No more shampoo for me, it&#x27;s all about the co-wash!</li>
            <li> This is not Wen.  It has a different feel and a different smell.  It is, however, a very passable substitute.  I bought it rather hesitantly after using Wen and loving it.  I was pleasantly surprised.  My hair gets very clean and is very soft and manageable.  I can get this at my local Walgreens or Target on sale for around $5, whereas I was paying $30 for a bottle of Wen.  There is not $25 worth of difference in my hair to justify paying the cost of Wen.  With Wen, I was alternating every other wash with a sulfate free shampoo as my hair tended to get oily if I didn&#x27;t.  With Renpure, I have yet to wash with anything else (although I will, at least once a week, to remove build up) and my hair is not greasy.  Just like with Wen, you must be sure to rinse very, very thoroughly.  If you don&#x27;t take the time to rinse well, you will end up with greasy hair.  I knocked off one star for the scent.  The rosemary mint is decent, although not my favorite.  The other two scents were awful.  They were a rather nauseatingly sweet smell that I just couldn&#x27;t handle.  Other than the smell, they have a product with which I am very pleased, and I&#x27;m also pleased with the money I will be saving.</li>
            <li> Absolutely adore this product. It has replaced multiple bottles of hair care items in my shower and my hair hasn&#x27;t looked or felt this nice since I was a little child.</li>
            <li> I know this will say not a verified purchaser but I am a user of this product and have to say I am seriously impressed! First age 45, female, white. Second hair has been colored several times, it is fine but there is a lot of it,naturally wavy. Third I have had serious health problems, including multiple surgeries. All that said my hair had taken a major hit and was literally starting to fall out, not in just small amounts, that is normal for me. I am talking several handfuls per shower daily! Not something I was going to sit still for, I was about ready to shell out the bucks for Wen, then I saw this at Bed Bath and Beyond. First use had just over what I consider normal hair loss, which was a lot less than previous shampoo/conditioner (and yes I was using sulfate free/ salt free products before.) By the third use my hair had almost returned to it&#x27;s pre-surgery/health issue condition. I am still using this product after 6 months and recommending it to everyone!! Only caveat I will add is that when my 24 year old daughter tried this rosemary mint cleansing conditioner she didn&#x27;t enjoy it. Her hair is very similar to mine but without the health issues. She had a problem with oiliness, I will have to tell her about people saying to use more if oiliness happens, which we didn&#x27;t know about. She tried the Lavender cleansing conditioner after her attempt with the mint one IS happy with that one. So don&#x27;t give up on the brand because one type doesn&#x27;t work for you. Oh, and as to the ones that said it came out watery. I have never had that issue. I do keep it away from the water so that water doesn&#x27;t get into the bottle from the top. I also shake it a little before use. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of chemical damage to my hair from coloring. I recently decided to do an at home highlighting kit and destroyed my hair. I had to get 5 inches of it cut off and still had rubbery, stringy, sticky hair. I woke up one very early morning to the television still on, and an infomercial for &#x27;Wen&#x27;. No longer using detergents and sulfates on my damaged dry hair sounded great, the price of the product made my stomach hurt. So I decided to look online for a cheaper price or a comparable product for less. I bought this and 2 days later when it arrived at my house I used it immediately. That morning I had needed 5 products to end up with frizzy dry hair. After using this all I did was blow dry and flat iron with some smoothing cream and my hair was SLICK AS SNOT! My hair doesn&#x27;t break off, fall out or snap in the shower. It doesn&#x27;t come out in my brushes and combs anymore. It feels amazing, isn&#x27;t sticky and looks smooth and shiny. Its also lightweight, not greasy, not dry and drys faster as well as flat irons more quickly. My hair is FAR more manageable! I&#x27;m very VERY happy with my purchase and will continue to use this product for a long time!</li>
            <li> This is not a bad product, it&#x27;s just wrong for my hair. I have very fine hair and it leaves my hair extremely shiny, but it also leaves it over-conditioned. The shine is nice, but I feel like I need to go rewash my hair. IF you wash your hair everyday (I usually don&#x27;t), it may be fine for you, but too intense for me. I suspect it will work better on my husband&#x27;s hair. I do use other Renpure products and they are excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not every product is good for every person. If you have very dry hair, or your hair is curly/ethnic/coarse and deep conditioning is what you need, this may be exactly right for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too much for me, however.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of buying this before reading the reviews. I wanted WEN but can&#x27;t bring myself to pay that much, so I found a cheaper knockoff in the drugstore. My hair is long, tends to be oily on the scalp and dried and frizzy towards the ends. This did nothing I could tell, other than weigh down my roots and make them look more oily. So, I washed my scalp with normal shampoo to get rid of the oil, then used this hoping it would at least help condition my dried ends. Nope. I noticed absolutely no difference in frizz and smoothness. In the shower my hair actually felt more coarse while using this product. It didn&#x27;t help detangle, either. The smell isn&#x27;t too bad, but is sort mediciney like Ben Gay. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> No matter how much or how little of the product you use and by following directions exactly - it always makes your hair look oily/dirty. Is not comparable to Wen or other cleansing conditioners at all.</li>
            <li> This stuff is terrible. I used it exactly as directed and spent 3 minutes under the water to rinse it out since I had heard sometimes these conditioners take awhile to wash out and my hair felt ok, but when I went to blow-dry it it looks like a cat licked it. I honestly looked like I hadnt washed my hair in WEEKS, so greasy, oily and weighed down I had to put my hair in a ponytail and put on a hat to go to work. I have long hair, so blow drying takes about 30-45 minutes, a complete waste. I&#x27;m really hesitant to try this again in a different way, it was so bad. Smells good, but just not good at all.</li>
            <li> I bought some of this at a local store because I&#x27;ve been looking for a cleansing conditioner that does not have ingredients tested on animals and that is affordable. I love this stuff! It is thinner than the others I have tried (so I can use a bit less) and I don&#x27;t lose a bunch of hair when I wash. I have fine curly hair, and a lot of it. And the smell is lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for my concerns. After reading some of the bad reviews, I&#x27;m wondering if they have changed the formula (or maybe I have the new and improved formula). Some people describe it as super thick, leaves hair dry on the ends and really greasy on the scalp. I&#x27;m a little worried about how my next bottle will perform because of the seeming inconsistency of the product. I will go ahead any buy another bottle because I love this stuff so much and I will report back...</li>
            <li> I love love love this stuff. I have a weird fuzzy kink in my hair. Since I started using this, my hair has done  a 360. It soft, shiny, and just amazing! I actually pair this up with the morrocan oil. I am so lucky I found this product.  I love the tingle i get when i usr this I can&#x27;t wait to try the pomegranate one next</li>
            <li> Item arrived with pump up and contents exploded into plastic bag.  Have to pay money to return and not allowed to contact seller.</li>
            <li> I Bought This From A Store. First TiMe My Hair Looked A Littler Nice But Felt A Little Dry And Slightly Tangled. IAlso HaD A Lot Of hair Fall Out. Tried It A Few More TiMes Only To Find My Hair Getting Worse. MY Hair Was Flat And Dry, My Scalp Sensitive. I Really Believe This Actually Damaged My Hair And caused It To Fall Out More Than Normal. I Bought The Rosemary And The Pomegranate. They smell Great But I Will Never Use It</li>
            <li> I recently found out about cleansing conditioner and I wanted to try one that was not as expensive as Wen. I recently put purple streaks in my hair and wanted to find an alternative to shampoo that was causing a lot of color to come out with every wash. I was a little hesitant to purchase this because some reviews state that it leaves your hair a little oily. My hair is very fine so I have to wash my hair everyday because my scalp gets very oily and looks dirty. I have tried dry shampoo but it leaves the texture of my hair a little rough. I tried this for the first time and I loved it. It did not lather well but that was no big deal. The smell was very minty but not too overpowering. I put it on wet hair (about 6 pumps for medium length hair), combed, and then let it sit while in the shower for about 4 minutes. Afterwards, my hair is very shiny, soft, and not oily at all. I love this and will purchase again. I ordered a few different brands to find one I like and I got lucky on my first try. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> After trying many different \\&quot;cleansing conditioners\\&quot;, I have finally found one that I will be sticking with!  I first used WEN, and really loved it, but at $30-$60 a bottle, I couldn&#x27;t afford to keep using it.  I give Renpure only 4 stars because it doesnt completely detangle my hair, so I use it as a \\&quot;shampoo\\&quot; and then follow up with my normal conditioner.  My hair is fine, and Renpure gives my hair some texture and body, so much so that I can actually skip a day in between washings.  Thanks Renpure!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. It is a shampoo, conditioner, and leave in conditioner all in one. When I hit menopause my hair got curly. I know weird, huh?&lt;br /&gt;None of the products that I&#x27;d been using and had been happy with worked anymore. Not that I minded the curly hair. It at least made it look like I had more hair. Unfortunately my hair, with the curl, looked like I was walking around with my finger stuck in a light socket. I found a book called Curly Girl The Handbook and in there it lists what ingredients to look for in a shampoo as well as what ingredients not to have in a shampoo. That led me to Renpure Solutions Cleansing Conditioner. My hair got soft, but stayed curly, and the frizz went away.&lt;br /&gt;  It is also sulfate, paraben, dye, gluten phthalate, and propylene glycol free.&lt;br /&gt;  Sadly, the local stores stopped carrying it. Happily, I found it on Amazon. Needless to say I stocked up!</li>
            <li> Garbage. Hair is greasy as hell and knotted up. Not even worth the 6 bucks.</li>
            <li> I was always curious about trying Wen cleansing conditioner, but the price scared me off. So when I saw this at Walgreens, I decided to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used about 8 pumps for my hair (my hair&#x27;s fairly short) and followed the directions. The first thing I noticed after I stepped out of the shower and dried off my hair was that it actually SQUEAKED! Dead serious--my hair SQUEAKED! I didn&#x27;t expect my hair to do that--especially after using a product that didn&#x27;t suds up like I&#x27;m used to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next thing I noticed was that my comb slipped right through my hair. Not a single tangle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last but not least, I noticed that after I blew my hair dry and styled it, my hair felt a lot more substantial. It felt thicker, it felt softer, and it felt healthier. In fact, I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair because it feels so soft and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t expect this product to give me such great results. And it&#x27;s a drugstore knockoff! This was definitely worth the money I spent, and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase this again and recommend it to my friends. I was more than pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> Having used WEN in the past,but not liking the price,I have been trying the cheaper alternatives. I have used \\&quot;Hair One\\&quot; from Sally&#x27;s,with satisfactory results,and I have also tried \\&quot;Salon Grafix\\&quot; cleansing conditioner,and had good results from that one,also.Well,I was shopping at Walgreen&#x27;s one day,and saw the Ren cleansing conditioner,and decided to try it out....big mistake-for some reason,when I put this product on my hair,it did not work anywhere near like the other brands did-when I used the \\&quot;Hair One\\&quot; and \\&quot;Salon Grafix\\&quot; my hair was just literally a glide with no tangles almost the second I applied the product,but with this,no matter how much I used,my hair became one big,tangled mess.I actually,after rinsing the REN out of my hair,had to put my normal conditioner on in order to get a comb through my hair.And just to clarify,yes,my hair was completely detangled before I stepped in the shower,so I know that wasn&#x27;t the problem. I know other people have left reviews saying how great this product is,so obviously it works for some,just letting you know how it worked on me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a few weeks ago and I didn&#x27;t read any reviews first.  I have very long wavy color treated hair.  I find that I have to use a bit more than the bottle suggests due to the length of my hair but otherwise I followed directions exactly.  The smell is nice, and it gave my scalp a nice tingle too.  My hair felt a bit heavy when I got out of the shower, but when I ran a brush through my hair it wasn&#x27;t difficult.  I used a tiny bit of the product as a styling aid on my wet hair.  When it dried it looked fantastic!  Extra curly with a nice volume and shine.  I got several compliments on my hair the first time I used this stuff and continue to get them.  I would definitely use this product again.</li>
            <li> I tried this, thinking it would be like wen (havent tried that either). All i have to say is, my experience, my hair felt so dirty after blow drying it, i had to put it up in a pony tail. now, i only use it at night when i have to shower twice in one day, to use up the product to avoid drying out my hair.</li>
            <li> Like the product, needs to be thicker</li>
            <li> Did nothing for my hair and didn&#x27;t smell great either. It left a residue on my hair.</li>
            <li> Works great!!! Cured my dry scalp.</li>
            <li> Does not leave hair soft and does not detangle</li>
            <li> Best stuff my hair has even seen and you can&#x27;t beat the price! My curls are back and my frizz is gone!</li>
            <li> My color treated hair is 10 years younger.</li>
            <li> For reference: I have thick, wavy, color treated, shoulder length hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for 2 weeks and it has simultaneously dried my hair out and made it greasy.  Based on the infomercials I have seen for its competitor, I was expecting (hoping) my hair would be sleek and soft after using this product.  Instead, after I rinse (and rinse and rinse and rinse as instructed) I can&#x27;t get my fingers through my wet hair while the water is running through it.  When I do get my fingers through, wads of hair are wrapped around them.  Imagine the mess of knots on towel dried hair!  I tried using a little bit of the product on my towel dried hair &amp;#34;as a leave in conditioner&amp;#34; as suggested but that made the ends of my hair sticky and heavy.  Without that extra bit of leave in conditioner product, the ends of my hair are crispy and crunchy when I air dry my hair.  The roots of my hair hate this product the most.  By mid-day, the hair closest to my scalp is sticking to my head. My hair doesn&#x27;t appear oily until later, but the thick sticky feeling is present early - within hours of &amp;#34;cleansing&amp;#34;.  I have tried using more product, less product, letting it sit longer, rinsing longer - and I get the same results.  Instructions suggest going 6 uses, then using a traditional shampoo for a deeper clean, then back to the product.  My hair would require shampoo more more frequently than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may be great for some - but certainly not for me.</li>
            <li> Would have given 5 stars, but pump was dysfunctional.</li>
            <li> I went to Walgreens looking a different cleansing conditioner and they were out, so I decided to try this. Big mistake. This stuff is terrible. It didn&#x27;t do anything but make my hair a dry, tangled mess. I literally had to get back in the shower and re-shampoo and condition with a heaping handful of conditioner. If you&#x27;re looking for a cheap alternative to Wen, use Salon Grafix Cleansing Conditioner. It&#x27;s like $7 and works wonders.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I think it works even better than Wen. I tried Wen and didn&#x27;t see a dramatic enough difference to spend that kind of money on it. Even if I were satisfied with Wen, the price is outrageous! This is a cheaper alternative and it works wonderfully! It gives my hair extra shine and bounce. Plus, I am in love with the smell. I would never shell out the money for Wen now that I found this.</li>
            <li> I tried this cleansing conditioner in place of using Wen.  Wen is the only thing that keeps my hair from feeling like straw or having tons of build up from regular shampoos.  The cost is killer though!  So I&#x27;ve started trying other ones on the market and this was my first to try.  At the first use I when I dispensed the conditioner it was super thin, not even close to the thickness of Wen.  When I applied it it didn&#x27;t even come close to coating my hair so I dispensed twice the amount as directed and it at least covered all my hair then but it still was so thin.  It did get my hair very clean, I&#x27;d say even squeaky clean.  But my hair was SO dried out that it was hard to brush it even wet because it became so tangled even after using a wide tooth comb in the shower while washing.  I think I could probably use this in a pinch if I needed to if I used a high quality leave in conditioner afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m still on the hunt for something comparable to Wen.</li>
            <li> Great and natural product.  It does not have phosphates or parabens.  I will order again.  Thank you Renpure for creating such an awesome product at a great price.</li>
            <li> First let me tell you I have a little grey and color treated curly hair. Then, on top of that I have a low thyroid.  The combination made my hair break and brittle. I kept cutting it because it just was horrible. I prefer my hair longer..So, I needed some help. WEN is too expensive and it has some preservatives I would rather not use. This product though not organic.. Seemed like a better alternate..  The first bottle I had I just went with it. It left my hair heavy but at least it was not stripping my hair. But, upon purchasing the second bottle I read some of the tips by other users. It worked..you need to use more product ..not less which seems counter productive.  I use 5-6 pumps on the front and back of my head  and 5-6 pumps on the sides and really rub it in.  Then, rinse throughly. I rinse twice.. First, I wash before I shower and rinse then re rinse in cool water before I get out.. I let my hair dry naturally. I ended up with soft bouncy curls and my color though it does fade..it does not like with shampoo..It lasts a lot longer..It definately has help me a lot...with my color and texture..</li>
            <li> This shampoo was okay but not amazing.  I decided that I could do more for less by purshasing organix shampoo.  Everyones hair is different, so I would classify my hair as 4b african american hair, my daughter 3c, 4a hair and our hair was softer with the organix shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Valen Ford</li>
            <li> Ren Rosemary Mint did a good job at cleaning my scalp, however it left my hair dull, weighed down, and oily looking.  Overall a real disappointment.</li>
            <li> I have been a WEN user for the last 3 years...I accidentally came across Renpure&#x27;s version.  I have very thick long hair, this product makes it feel dry, it did not soak in...this was when I was putting in on my hair wet..I love the smell, but it was not what I expected.  Not even close to WEN products.</li>
            <li> I was born during JFK&#x27;s administration and I have probably discarded 2 hair care products in my entire life. This is the third. I have thick wavy and coarse hair.  This product does not clean, does not condition, just awful. It left my hair coated and waxy. One is better off using inexpensive conditioners such as Suave, VO5 and the rest. This product is not as good as either the expensive stuff it tries to imitate nor the inexpensive stuff. Unfortunately, one more bad review for Ren.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sad because I REALLY wanted to like this product. However, if I could give it zero stars, I would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, a little background: I am caucasian with medium-length, thick, curly hair and lots of it.  My scalp tends to be oily, but my curls can sometimes be dry.  I absolutely love my curls, so I avoid sulfates, sulfides and &#x27;cones like the plague.  I bought a bottled of Wen two years ago and loved it, but like others on here, I can&#x27;t justify spending $30 on shampoo on a regular basis (which begs the question: Does Chaz Dean not realize that by lowering the price to a reasonable level he would have a MUCH wider customer base, and therefore make more money? Wen is more expensive than even the salon products in my area.) I have been looking for a Wen alternative, so when I saw Ren at Walgreens during a BOGO event, I got really excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first pumped the product, the smell was absolutely wonderful.  However, the smell didn&#x27;t last and was gone by the time I left the shower.  I immediately noticed that the consistency of the product was very thick, almost paste-like.  I made sure my hair was thoroughly wet and began to work the product through it, following all directions on the bottle to the letter.  The product was extremely hard to work through my hair, even though I added water just like the directions said, and I only used 8 pumps (the directions say 8-10 pumps).  I immediately felt like my hair and scalp had a thick, greasy coating. I rinsed for a good five minutes, but no matter how much I rinsed I could not seem to get my hair and scalp to feel clean.  When my hair dried, the hair itself was soft, but the roots were greasy.  The next day, the roots were not greasy, but the hair was very dry, as if it had not been conditioned at all.  Because I wanted to like the product and also because I wanted to give it a fair shot, I used it three more times and got the same result each time.  I will be returning the unused bottle to the store.On the advice of a friend, I picked up a few packets of Hair One for Curly Hair from Sally&#x27;s and will try that, since it is around the same price point.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this product when I saw it in walgreens. It was buy one get one free so my mother and I both have our own bottles &#x3D;)  When I got home I looked at reviews here on amazon and was a little discouraged I thought oh great!!!! I tried it anyways and I am very happy with the results it cut out 90% of my frizz and I am 100% frizz ball.  The smell is nice and I like how this product gives a cooling tingle on my scalp. when using this product you really have to massage your scalp and hair from root to tip really work this stuff in for a few minutes.  Give it a try it might work for you like it did for me &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I was a Wen user, would still be if it was affordable and not on a delivery schedule. Then I found Renpure with Rosemary Mint and I don&#x27;t miss Wen any longer! I have trouble raising my arms and don&#x27;t like traditional shampoo and conditioner in one bottle, Renpure is nothing like the 2 in 1&#x27;s. My hair looks and feels lovely using this product. Thank you for delivering ahead of schedule also!</li>
            <li> I have hair that sort of varies between wavy and curly depending on the length, time of year, weather, alignment of the stars, and what it feels like doing that day, and it&#x27;s pretty dry to boot.  Over the past year or so, I&#x27;ve been trying to really cut the amount of products I use, especially since I&#x27;ve gone blonde and the bleach does enough of a number on it.  I started sort-of no-pooing last year, and for the past maybe six months, I&#x27;ve been pretty steadily shampooing once a week, rinsing every day. The thing is, once the daily temps got above freezing, my 3-4x/week workouts started getting sweaty, and I noticed that by day 5 or 6 my curls were looking pretty sad no matter how much time I spent with my boar bristle brush, and I was getting a little bit of a funky smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve wanted to try one of these types of systems for a while, but most of the natural/organic/sulfate-free stuff gave me severe sticker shock (I have hair down to my bra strap; I can&#x27;t afford to regularly use $25 shampoo).  I saw this at Target and decided to give it a try, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  For the price, it really is an easy way to clean up any funk in between real shampoos.  When I saw 10-12 pumps, I wondered if the price was really justified, but I used I think 10 pumps, maybe 12, and it didn&#x27;t empty half the bottle or anything (very little comes out with each pump).  I feel like a bottle will last a reasonable length of time even at recommended usage levels.  It was a little thin and 10-12 pumps in a handful was a little hard to spread evenly, so the second time I did 5-6 and 5-6, first on the roots, then the legnths, and it worked out much better.  And like other reviewers have said, rinse rinse rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is amazing, but I love anything herbal and minty; if those types of scents aren&#x27;t your thing, maybe try the other scent, because the smell of it definitely stays with your hair for a day or 2.  Like I said, though, I love it, so it was fine with me.  My hair felt and looked really good the next day; I didn&#x27;t get that slippy feeling you get with regular conditioner, but my hair felt squeaky clean.  It looked amazing too; light, fluffy waves and curls without frizz.  The only thing was it felt a little bit overdried in the ends the first couple times I used it (although it didn&#x27;t look it). I think I might try concentrating it more on just the roots and pulling it through the ends with a comb, or hit the ends with a little coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks now, not after every workout, but one time in the middle of the week between my Saturday or Sunday shampoos, and I definitely like it. I also noticed the ingredients list has words I can pronounce, which is kind of nice.  I haven&#x27;t tried it in conjunction with blow drying, since my hour-plus commute to work gives my hair plenty of time to dry without it.  I think if you&#x27;ve wanted to give one of these products a try for a while but had sticker shock, this is a good one to try.  If you hate it, it&#x27;s only $7 down the drain, if you like it, $7 for a good size product isn&#x27;t a bad deal when you consider that it can take the place of 2 products.  I could probably use this instead of shampoo and conditioner entirely, but I kind of like having an excuse to take my long Saturday showers, plus I usually use styling products on weekends if we&#x27;re going out or something, and I like my routine to feel like I get the product off my hair.  But yeah, I&#x27;m definitely happy with this stuff, and will buy again.</li>
            <li> I am so surprised that I like this product.  A friend recommended it and I decided to give it a shot.  I generally have oily hair and thought that this would make my hair super oily.  It did just the opposite.  My hair is much less oily with this than with regular shampoo and conditioner.  Does not seem to dry out my hair at all.  I would definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> Healthy hair, doesn&#x27;t dry hair out.</li>
            <li> I love this cleansing conditioner it works great for my hair I have wavy to curly hair which is thinning out due to a medical condition so using this cleansing conditioner has really given me confidence again great looking hair I will be buying this from now on</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I bought this product before I read the reviews.  When it ended up looking like I put Wesson Oil in my hair after using it, I then read the reviews.  Lucky are those who like this product and it worked on their hair.  For me, it was a slimy, oily mess that even my hairdresser commented on when I visited her after using it! And yes, I used it according to directions, and rinsed it thoroughly.  I have fairly healthy straight hair, and maybe my hair isn&#x27;t the type this was made for.  For $9.99, maybe it&#x27;s worth the gamble for others, but I will be returning mine.</li>
            <li> I have been using this a week and I like it! I have extremely fine hair, so I was a little worried about a &amp;#34;cleansing conditioner&amp;#34; making it heavy and flat and greasy. My hair does not tangle, it feels so soft and smooth. Winter has dried my fragile baby fine hair out, so I thought I would try this to repair it. I am in the process of growing out a pixie. I read it isn&#x27;t so great for some people, but it works great for me :)</li>
            <li> I see a lot of negative reviews of this stuff on here and I think it&#x27;s mostly because of the foreign concept of a cleansing conditioner. It&#x27;s not going to foam up like a conventional shampoo because A, there&#x27;s no SLS in it and B, it&#x27;s more of the consistency of a conditioner. So just pretend like you&#x27;re just going to use conditioner on your hair and you&#x27;ll be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, there are some tricks to getting the most out of this stuff. First, use waaaay more than the directions say to use, especially if you&#x27;ve got crazy long/thick/curly hair like I do. I work it through in sections, paying really good attention to the crown of my head because thats where I had trouble the first 1-2 times I used this. Massage the crap out of your scalp, and then comb the stuff all the way down to your ends. If you&#x27;ve got fuzzy ends like I tend to get, put some more on the ends. Leave it on for a few minutes, but seriously not a lifetime. Then rinse! It&#x27;s really not rocket science.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not wild about the scent of this one, but it doesn&#x27;t last too long like other shampoos so I didn&#x27;t remove any stars for that. I&#x27;ll just try a different scent next time. All in all, I&#x27;m a cleansing conditioner convert thanks to this stuff (ps - I&#x27;ve never tried Wen or any of the other products like it, so maybe I&#x27;m missing out, but this stuff satisfies my needs for $10 instead of $32 haha). Oh! And this bottle lasted me about 2 months washing twice a week, so if you&#x27;re a daily hair washer, maybe this isn&#x27;t the best thing out there for you.</li>
            <li> This has a different consistency than Wen but seems to work well. It is not as thick so you may need to use more.</li>
            <li> This is excellent cleansing conditioner. I had purchased Wen, but found that to be to expensive, and I wasn&#x27;t that impressed with the fact that Wen automatically sends more product without your authorization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Renpure works better! My hair is softer, more manageable and in much better condition then when I used Wen. I like the fact that this product is lighter weight and it literally melts into your hair. The directions suggest using between 10-12 pumps. I am able to use just 4 pumps and I have thick, coarse hair. The bonus of this product is that your hair stays soft for days after using it.</li>
            <li> My wife swears by this shampoo. She has wonderful Asian hair and it is coarse and can be difficult to manage. She has tried every shampoo available. She thinks this shampoo is just great. Her hair is silky soft and doesn&#x27;t get tangled. I will profess what touching her dry hair is very nice and soft with this shampoo while with other shampoos it can be stiff and dry. So while expensive, this does seem to be a superior product and worth the high price.</li>
            <li> I love this cleansing conditioner. Just a little about me: I have long, naturally curly hair, not super thick, but coarse in texture- especially without proper care. I have used several cleansing conditioners (Pantene, Herbal Essences, Salon Grafix, L&#x27;Oreal, and probably others). Here&#x27;s why THIS one (Renpure mint) is my favorite: A lot of the cleansing conditioners are sooo thick, which is nice for moisturizing, but not so much for cleansing... I&#x27;ve noticed with the thickness of others, they are so thick that they more just sit on top of my hair, rather than being absorbed. Renpure is somewhat thin in comparison to most other brands of cleansing conditioners.. But what I&#x27;ve noticed, is that it is better absorbed by my hair, and can be more evenly distributed. The mint also has a very light tingle to it, that I really like.. It just feels fresh. I do still like to follow up with a deep conditioner for dry hair every now and then, but it&#x27;s definitely not needed every time. Overall Renpure mint is a great combination for cleansing and nourishing hair. Ohhh and keep your eye on it a Target- similar in price most of the time, but I&#x27;ve got it &amp;#34;Buy one get one free&amp;#34; before too!</li>
            <li> I just received my first order of Renpure today. After using it, I am very pleased. There is absolutely no lather yet my hair is soft and clean. I will be ordering again. This is now the only product I will use to clean my hair. I am 100% satisfied!</li>
            <li> I am a long time Wen user (Fig is my favorite) and started using Ren recently. I think that Ren is better for my hair type than Wen (I have fine, slightly wavy hair). Also, Ren makes my hair fall out less comparing to Wen (which makes my hair fall out much less than the normal shampoo).</li>
            <li> I have straight thick long hair and I&#x27;m telling you this product brought life back to it.  My hair feels so much thicker and shinier now that I don&#x27;t strip my hair of it&#x27;s essential oils.  Just like a lot of the negative reviews have pointed out-- if you use this product as directed, it may leave your hair looking heavy, flat, and oily.  It did this with me as well-- but I wasn&#x27;t ready to give up on the product yet, because I could see the benefits to leaving the oils in.  So I tweak it up a bit, and after I worked in the conditioner to my hair and scalp, I added a smidge (and I do mean a smidge-- or else you defeat the purpose of this cleanser) of sulfate free shampoo to my hair and worked it in as well.  Now, I know this is kinda cheating, but on me it actually worked.  My hair still keeps most of the essential oils in, but it doesn&#x27;t feel so heavy and look so oily.  It&#x27;s perfect!  I love the way this product makes my hair free and look.  It&#x27;s definitely less frizzy and more manageable and shiny.  :)</li>
            <li> My whole family loves this. The scent is refreshing, but not overwhelming. Works good on colored, hair too. Free of some allergen ingredients that more famous brands of similar product have.</li>
            <li> You will ABSOLUTELY LOVE this product!! My hair is wiry, color-treated and was very dry; when I washed my hair I started seeing hair fall out, just a few strands here and there and never saw that before. Well NO MORE hair falling out and my hair feels WONDERFUL, my Pixie cut is even more FABULOUS for me!! Because the surfactants (the ingredients that loosen the dirt to clean the hair) used are not the same as the ones used in the other shampoos in market place you won&#x27;t see sudsing as usual, but it is cleansing so don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s not working, it is! It is the ingredients in the other products that causes the damage, I personally don&#x27;t need to value &amp;#34;the clean&amp;#34; by the suds it makes, I value &amp;#34;the clean&amp;#34; by how my hair feels after I rinse and dry and this product has surpassed my expectations for I am very discriminatory when it comes to products!  Comparing WEN vs REN, choose REN! :) The price is more than fair and you can control cost while RENPURE takes care of your hair! You&#x27;ll be glad you did! :))</li>
            <li> I was looking for a lower cost replacement for Wen.  This works OK, but is not as luxe as Wen and I had to use more.</li>
            <li> I really bought this by mistake at a local walgreens, I was looking for a decent organic shampoo because my hair seems to fare much better when not using sulfates, Somehow I mistakenly believed this would cleanse my hair and leave it soft and manageable. Soft and Manageable it is, however, I had to resort to spraying my hair with a waterless shampoo to make it appear less stringy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will most likely use this as a leave in conditioner for the ends only in the future and will go find myself a suitable shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it three stars because it really does leave the hair soft and the ends look amazing and I am sure this would be a great product for someone with dry and damaged hair, just not for someone like me who&#x27;s ends are dry and damaged yet the roots and bangs are not.</li>
            <li> This product did not work on my hair.  I have used a few other cleansing conditioners and none of them left my hair extremely heavy and greasy.  My hair has never reacted to any product this way.  I have used it a few times and have had the same result every time.  My hair was so weighed down and greasy.  It looked like I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair in a week.  Pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t live up to advertisements.  Left my hair feeling sticky; my hair was dull and lifeless.  Would never buy product again and would never recommend it.  Also, I bought two different types of this cleansing conditioner, yet when I read the ingredients, it was the same as the other.  It was just with a different label.</li>
            <li> Just the name &amp;#34;cleansing conditioner&amp;#34; made me wary, and all the oils listed as ingredients creeped me out. Over the years I&#x27;ve tried many conditioners, and every one of them left my fine, limp, volume-challenged hair greasier, limper, and less voluminous. How could a &amp;#34;cleansing conditioner&amp;#34; not weigh my hair down?  But many of the reviews were intriguing, the product wasn&#x27;t expensive, so decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;  I carefully followed the instructions and also heeded reviewers&#x27; suggestions, esp. with regard to thorough rinsing.  And I used the hottest water I could tolerate.  At the end, my hair didn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;squeaky clean,&amp;#34; so I was prepared to hop back into the shower for a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; shampoo.  But after blow-drying,  the results were amazing -- looked like I had instantly acquired 1/3 more hair!  Fresh, clean, shiny, and more manageable, too.  I almost couldn&#x27;t believe it -- thought it might be a fluke.  But the next Renpure experience was just as good.  Ended up ordering several bottles as gifts for friends.&lt;br /&gt;  As others have said, you absolutely MUST rinse thoroughly.  From my experience,  the hotter the water, the better (especially if you have thin, fine hair and don&#x27;t want  or need the &amp;#34;conditioning&amp;#34; effect).  Renpure is a bit more work than regular shampoo - but worth it for the volume and shine!</li>
            <li> Works just as good as Wen for a lot less money! Have already ordered more and cancelled our Wen shipments!</li>
            <li> this just does not do anything for my hair. I could just use regular conditioner instead. Im just not a fan of leaving out shampoo since this is not getting hair clean.</li>
            <li> I have not tried other brands of cleansing conditioner, but for me this is amazing! I have natural curly hair and recently learned that most shampoos are not good for curly hair. I am also trying to eliminate sulfates and parabins from all my products. I can honestly say I love using this! I don&#x27;t think I will ever go back to &#x27;regular&#x27; shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is SO soft, tangles far less. Is not frizzy or crazy. I have struggled with the UT dry air and my hair for years after moving from the East Coast.  I almost never wore it curly b/c it was just ugly and crazy/ frizzy. This has made my curls lovely and soft. A huge difference!</li>
            <li> I have used the other cleansing conditioner which made me very happy.  This product is cheaper and excellent.  My hair is so soft shiny manageable.  This is easy to use and does not require much.  I put it on wet hair and let it remain while I do other things and shampoo some half hour later.  I do not have to add more.  I then rinse for a long time under tepid water.  There is no tangling.  I have soft African hair and I use a small amount of coconut oil.  very little.  I will never shampoo again.  use warm or cold water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying less expensive alternatives to WEN.  This one did the job just as well, if not better, for 1/3 the price.  It left my hair very silky.  It is much juicier than Wen which pumps out thickly.  This is thinner, but it left my hair feeling amazing after the first try.  I did not have to use as much either due to it&#x27;s thinner texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Months later - This one is the best.  It pumps easily and the pump keeps working unlike the Hair One.</li>
            <li> Not everyone can afford Wen and I have tried several other cleaning conditioners. This one works the best for my hair, it leaves my hair soft, manageable and it does not strip my hair color like shampoo does (even the sulfate free shampoo does).</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  My hair is really fine and slightly curly, with the extra wildness that going grey sometimes adds.  I have been using DevaCare&#x27;s NoPoo for years, but recently my hair had been dry even using that product, so I thought I&#x27;d try this.  I make a point of scrubbing my scalp really vigorously for 2 minutes, as suggested, (fingertips, no fingernails, of course) and I rinse it really, really well in slightly cooler water than the rest of my shower.  I don&#x27;t use any other products at all--dry it, fluff it with my fingers, and when it&#x27;s completely air-dried, I brush it.  It&#x27;s been several weeks now, and my hair looks great, feels great--cleaner, fluffier, shinier, and my scalp doesn&#x27;t itch like it does when I use shampoos with a lot of chemicals. I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
            <li> leaves my hair soft and shiny I have hair to my butt and it is curly. I am always struggling with dryness and this product is AMAZING!!!! I do prefer the coconut fragrance but the mint is good too. Also I use one pump after ive brushed my hair and its the only product I need:)</li>
            <li> Before I begin, I would like to submit a list of factors that I find relevant to a review of a product like this; we have well water (hard water), not fluoridated, chlorinated city water; I have long, wavy to curly hair that is of medium coarseness; I am white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, using this product isn&#x27;t as difficult as it seems from other reviews, but it is very specific. My method is as follows:&lt;br /&gt;wet hair thoroughly - 2 minutes&lt;br /&gt;start with a few pumps of product at a time, working from scalp to ends, and front to back (up to 15 pumps) - 3 minutes&lt;br /&gt;scrub scalp with fingertips / nails as if I were a mother treating a lice infestation patient  - up to 5 minutes&lt;br /&gt;do all other shower stuff - ???&lt;br /&gt;rinse well, shaking and scrubbing as needed - 2 minutes&lt;br /&gt;soap down the backside (slick, sticky back does not equal clean feeling)&lt;br /&gt;roughly towel dry, then wrap to absorb excess moisture, braid, get in bed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This method leaves my hair clean, soft, and feeling healthy. I am a fan of the No-Poo system in its various forms, but this works well, without stripping my hair. Also, my husband doesn&#x27;t complain about my hair reeking of vinegar! Speaking of smells, I was skeptical at first about the scent for this Ren Pure conditioner - I had previously tried the sweet pomegranate. When it comes out of the bottle the mint is very potent, but as you work it into your hair the rosemary starts to shine through for a most pleasant combination, particularly if one uses a bit of it as a leave-in. (which I only do on the rare occasion that I blow-dry my hair - a singularly disturbing experience)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the performance, scent, pricing, and form of this hair cleanser are all magnificent assets, with which I wholeheartedly recommend it to everyone who bothers to ask my opinion on such things.</li>
            <li> I give this four stars only because it does leave ur hair smelling good,it works ok for the price,but not good enough, gave it to my 12yr she likes it ,it&#x27;s well priced and I would buy it again for my kid,just not for me</li>
            <li> Very disappointing. I have naturally curly, very long and rather dry hair. I bought this stuff it in hopes that it would work similarly to Wen care products. But unfortunately just did what most shampoos do - dry my hair out by stripping all the oils, which left it feeling brittle like straw.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have very long fine, wavy hair. It dries, breaks and tangles like mad. I quit sulfates and started using conditioning cleansers. WEN, Salon Grafix and L&#x27;oreal all make one. I tried them all, and had such issues with drying and tangling. Turns out, they all have alcohol, a total killer for fine hair. This has none!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First use it made my hair feel heavy, but after about 3-4 uses my hair began to love it. It helps to use a fair amount of water to work it through. Massage it in, let It soak while you shower. Rinse VERY well. It&#x27;s a one step hair cleaning/conditioning which sounds like it ought to save you time, but you really got rinse this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;My hair shiny, silky, and no where near as knotty. It&#x27;s nice to occasionally use a gentle clarifying shampoo to deep clean. I recommend this.</li>
            <li> The best no-suds shampoo I have tried, this shampoo cleans without completely stripping.  If I want oil-free hair, I would have to wash it daily with this shampoo, but for a different reason than traditional shampoos.  Regular shampoos dry out my scalp, sending the oil glands into over-drive.  This shampoo cleanses dirt and gently cleans my scalp, so that there&#x27;s always a little bit of natural oil left.  I have tried other, more expensive natural shampoos, and they were nothing like Renpure.  The only scent experienced while washing is the combination of essential oils in the product, so that the only smells are actual mint and rosemary.  With this shampoo, after it dries, my hair looks like the picture on the back of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;My pre-teen daughter has thick, curly hair.  Typical shampoos, even the salon brands for curly hair, are destructive and terrible for her hair.  She has tried a variety of African-American hair care products for cleansing and conditioning.  This shampoo is the best solution that we have been able to find for her.  When she washes with it, she follows up with any ol&#x27; leave-in conditioner, and her hair is clean, soft, and comb/brushable.  Wash days used to be at least a couple hours of conditioning and oiling after shampooing.&lt;br /&gt;You do have to use a lot compared to traditional shampoos (follow directions on bottle), so the overall cost ends up somewhere in between the cheapest drugstore brand and the mid-priced salon brand.  If I had shorter than elbow-length hair, the cost would be a lot closer to cheapest drugstore cost.</li>
            <li> Pomegranate is better</li>
            <li> My hair felt great, but a lot of it fell out. I was NOT happy. I purchased the Renpure Solutions Cleansing Conditioner at our local Walgreens, and got both the Rosemary Mint, and the Sweet Pomegranate. The first few times I used them, I noticed that I lost quite a few of my long hairs, but did not think much about it. My hair really looked good, and was manageable, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, with continued use, I just kept losing hair! I did not like that, at all. At the time of this writing, I am 62, and still have about 95% of my hair dark brown, which is the color I with which I was born. I have never dyed it, so it is natural. I prefer to have it on my head, not in the sink when I am finished washing my hair, even if I am not using shampoo, but only a cleansing conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first reviewed the Renpure Sweet Pomegranate Cleansing Conditioner, I was very happy with it, and gave it 5 stars. Later, I went back and edited my review, as I found that it made me lose a LOT of hair.  So did the Rosemary Mint version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Renpure changes their formula, to eliminate whatever it is that makes my hair depart for the drain, I will try it again. At present, I am not as happy as I originally was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I have never used WEN, as that is not what I consider \\&quot;affordable\\&quot; for my hair. What results I have had with Renpure, and my opinion on the two cleansing conditioners I used of theirs, is based purely on the fact that they made a lot of my hair fall out. That should not be the result of cleansing and conditioning one&#x27;s hair!</li>
            <li> Used it for a week then went back to my old stuff. This made my hair feel lank and lacking body, looks oily.</li>
            <li> It seemed to actually foam up a little and was not nearly as good as WEN. It irritated my scalp and the back of my neck. I may have been allergic to this product. Even if I wasn&#x27;t sensitive to this product I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> This seems to be helping my hair restore its natural oils. Its not drying my hair out, and made its soft and manageable! I&#x27;m so happy I switched to this product along with Nexus Pro Mend, Split End Binding!!! :)</li>
            <li> I have to get us to the fact there is no (damaging) suds when I lather, but the commercials for Wen made be more cognizant if what I should expect.  anyway, I love the product!  My normally frizzy air dried air turned into soft waves! love it!</li>
            <li> I bought Wen once &amp; loved every minute of it; however, the cost scared me off, so I went back to the higher-end drug store bransd (John Freida, Organix, etc) When I saw a twin pack of Ren in BB&amp;B for $13, I figured \\&quot;why not give it a try?\\&quot; I wanted to love it for the price, the fact that it is made in the USA, and that it seems to be a family company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here is my honest to god opinion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its pretty terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have lots of long thin dry hair. I use abt 20 pumps of the Rosemary Mint in my hair. Massage it for 3 minutes, comb it out with a shower comb, cover with a plastic cap, go about my shower business (abt 5 minutes) and rise out my hair fully then in sections while combing it out for what feels like an eternity (but it probably about 5 minutes) The cream does nothing for in shower detangling. Even with its thickness, there just seems yo be no glycerin in the formula. It does smell heavenly. I love mint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are &#x27;2nd or 3rd day&#x27; hair immediately after blow drying. It isnt horrible, but im used to stretching out my shampoos 2-3 days, so with this product, it is neccessary every day wash with dry shampoo sometimes. On the plus side, my hair feels quite thicker. I havent attempted any heat appliances (curling iron) but im going to assume there will not be good results because of the weight the product adds to the hair. I know that a lot of people will state that I should rinse out my hair more, but seriously, I really do rinse out well, it is just the product sticks to my hair. It might be because I have very dry hair, and it is rebuilding it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not be getting it again, but I will finish out the two bottles. If the results get better/worse, I will update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 01/29/2013: Well, I tried &amp; tried, but I had to break down and use shampoo in conjunction with the product. It is definitely not for me. I was actually super happy when I got to the end of the bottle. About that--the product is so thick, that it is really hard to get the last bits out of the bottle. Not that I am complaining, I was happy to get rid of it. So sad--for something that smells so good to behave so badly. *Sigh* oh well. No harm done.thick, that it is really hard to get the last bits out of the bottle. Not that I am complaining, I was happy to get rid of it. So sad--for something that smells so good to behave so badly. *Sigh* oh well. No harm done.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great and is soooooo much cheaper than Wen. It also has more natural and toxic free ingredients than Wen. Win win.</li>
            <li> Awesome price and product...I use this every time I shower and the more I use it the more I love it.  My hair feels so soft and is so manageable to style.  I will be buying this item over and over!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying all the cleansing conditioners. This one is very good. I went to sleep and woke up with not a single hair out of place. The only criticism I have is that it leaves your hair a little crunchy, but brush or comb it out and it&#x27;s soft and silky. This might be a good replacement for hair gel or hair spray because my hair was exactly the same when I woke up. My hair tends to frizz out and I use products to control it and keep from getting pyramid head. This eliminated that problem while leaving my natural feeling, not weight down or gross. Also, not crunchy because the crunch can be shook out very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I will probably use it in between Hair One and maybe Wen Styling Creme. On days when I don&#x27;t need as much control, I&#x27;ll use others that have less cones and holding power. On days where I need to have flawless hair, I will use renpure rosemary mint.</li>
            <li> Compared to Wen this product needs extra conditioner...too drying</li>
            <li> This was not the same product I bought at the store. The bottle was the same, but the product inside the bottle had a different consistency and texture. It was like milky water, and did not work the same when applied to my hair.</li>
            <li> After being a wen user for years I was looking for a cheaper alternative that still made my hair luxurious. This product delivered an effect that I just loved! Sure it isn&#x27;t at thick (the actual conditioner) and it doesnt feel as good whilst in the shower, but the result is nothing less than exquisite. With wen my hair seemed to be weighed down and greasy if I used the proper amount. This conditioner leaves my hair light, bouncy and healthier than ever before! I would highly recommend this product for people in the same situation as I was and looking for something that leaves my hair feeling fresh and healthy.</li>
            <li> Watery.  Could not get comb through hair afterwards.  Had to use another conditioner after just to be able to comb and style hair.  Will not buy again or recommend.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews, but I still decided to try this product. I&#x27;ve used WEN, and even it gets bad reviews from time to time.. maybe it doesn&#x27;t suit everyone&#x27;s hair. I like to keep an open mind and try things for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically use Wen Sweet Almond Mint. I find the cucumber aloe a little drying, and the lavender too moisturizing. The pomegranate is very close to Sweet Almond mint, just a little difference in fragrance. I haven&#x27;t tried the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps I should just say \\&quot;this didn&#x27;t work for me\\&quot; but I have had enough experience with these types of products to say that I have serious doubts it would be satisfactory for anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like WEN, but I am not a \\&quot;Wen Girl\\&quot; because there is NO WAY I am going to regularly pay that amount for a product. It is by far the most expensive hair care product -  including the most exclusive shampoos and conditioners - that is out there.  Is it \\&quot;worth it\\&quot;?  I think the concept is WORTH IT, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that exorbitant markups aren&#x27;t in there, and it&#x27;s just too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conservatively speaking, it will cost an average person $20 a month MINIMUM to clean and condition their hair. That doesn&#x27;t include styling products, sprays, cuts, blowouts, coloring, and other treatments and products one still might use. If you have a family, especially teens with long hair, that could easily add up to $80-$100 a month. Think of THOSE numbers....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, of course when I thought I could spend $10.00 instead of about $30 -  that seemed worth the try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this is a family owned company that seems to care, and I wanted to give them my business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really think they need to go back to the drawing board and keep the idea, but toss this formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Rosemary Mint product, as I like a minty, herb fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thoroughly wet my hair - I know the routine - and massaged a generous amount in to my hair and scalp. Frankly, at that point, I thought,\\&quot;This isn&#x27;t bad AT ALL.\\&quot;  The fragrance wasn&#x27;t as minty/herbal as I would have liked, but that&#x27;s okay.  I combed through and my hair detangled pretty easily. Okay, check off two requirements. I added a bit of water to dilute product and additionally clean. I left on about three minutes. I never add additional product after cleansing, as it tends to attract dirt and oil. In this case, I did not use any additional styling products so I could properly evaluate the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rinsed and blotted dry.  I noticed when I combed my hair, it seemed a little heavy.&lt;br /&gt;It blew dry fairly well, I didn&#x27;t fuss too much, and off I went to an appointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, within 1/2 hour, while I was sitting in the office, my head started to itch. Not allergic itch -  greasy uncomfortable itch. I looked in a mirror and was horrified to see my hair starting to separate,  like it would if I hadn&#x27;t washed it for three or four days. (Why do I know this? Because I keratin my hair and have to wait 3 days, but this was WORSE).  It was as if pomade was in my hair, and it kept on getting greasier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever had coated my hair seemed to be rapidly causing it to look oily and dirty.  I thought I could wait until the next day, but couldn&#x27;t WAIT to get home to re-wash my hair. In a matter of four hours, it had gone to \\&quot;okay, a little heavy\\&quot; to \\&quot;ooh, greasy like pomade.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine thin hair, with an oily scalp and drier ends.  But I have NEVER experienced something like this from a cleansing product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, what&#x27;s a cheapskate like me to do? Well, I have discovered L&#x27;Oreal cleansing conditioner. The fragrance is a bit overwhelming at first, but I don&#x27;t think it lingers that long, and it does a GREAT job. It cleans and conditions better than Wen, and of course does a better job than RenPure!  The cost: About $6.00 for 8 ounces, or $12.00 for 16 oz - at least 1/2 the price of the expensive stuff (actually a little less than 1/2 price).  I don&#x27;t need to use QUITE as much product, either, but I don&#x27;t skimp. That is a BIG mistake when using something like this. If you look around, there are coupons available as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps saving $10 a month doesn&#x27;t mean that much for you, but add it up, over a year, and include everyone in your family that uses it.  Suddenly, that can be a lot of extra money, to the tune of hundreds of dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, using this product will not save you money, because you will still have to buy something to clean/cleanse/condition your hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend this product based on my experience.  Seriously, the worst.&lt;br /&gt;Too too bad.</li>
            <li> I saw this at Rite Aid; a BOGO deal so I bought a bottle and got one free.  I&#x27;ve always wanted to try WEN but could not pay the price for it.  I have noting to compare REN to; but it worked great for me!  After I bought this I came home and read the reviews online and was worried.  I was fully prepared to wash my hair again with regular shampoo if this didn&#x27;t work.  I was pleasantly surprised!  It smelled great, my hair was easy to comb through afterwards , it all washed out.....When I dried my hair it had beautiful volume and luster!  My hair went from dull, limp, and sometimes stringy to looking like Kate Middleton&#x27;s hair!  My husband came home yesterday and immediately said, \\&quot;What did you do to your hair? It looks great!\\&quot;  This is my 2nd day using REN and I&#x27;m happy with it!</li>
            <li> Ok so NO it&#x27;s not like the original cleansing conditioner we all know well WEN. The formula looks like modge podge &amp; I was almost hesitant to use it, BUT It works just fine. I seem to use more than with the other product but for the price it&#x27;s pretty decent. I would buy again,</li>
            <li> Not very impressed.  It&#x27;s way below WEN, which I use frequently.  Not to bad for $12 bucks I think.  I will not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews thinking it would be a healthy alternative to my regular shampoo/conditioner routine. It left my hair so oily and stuck to my head. The first few times I used it everything was decent, but after a week of use it was unbearable. I thought may I wasn&#x27;t rinsing enough, I even tried rinsing with cold water hoping that would help somehow. I eventually gave in and had to shampoo my hair twice to get it all out and clean!</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! I have seborrheic dermatitis and I cannot use most shampoos without breaking out every other week but with Renpure I have not had a break out in over a month!</li>
            <li> Okay, first of all - I never write reviews. The fact I&#x27;m writing one about this product is something..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t my first cleansing conditioner so I&#x27;m well aware of how to use it. Prior to this I was using the L&#x27;Oreal Ever Creme Cleansing Conditioner, and liked it for the most part, but it didn&#x27;t moisturize my hair as well as I hoped. I&#x27;m looking for a product that will enable me to use LESS product in my hair overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, after the first use of Renpure, it made my hair soft and manageable and I loved it. I honestly had high hopes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was after the second use that my hair felt different, heavier even. And on the second day after that second wash, my hair was just plain greasy and oily looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About me: I am mixed, half Asian/half Hispanic, so I have curly Asian hair if that makes sense. Think of Hispanic waves-curls on an Asian girl, that&#x27;s my hair (not kinky or unmanageable). Oh, my hair is also very thick and long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As such, my hair doesn&#x27;t get greasy as easily and I wash my hair every other day normally. With this I feel I need to wash it every single day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the third time I was fed up. I followed the instructions super carefully this time, thinking it was me making mistakes, but that wasn&#x27;t the case it&#x27;s the product. I rinsed it out completely and my hair feels fine out of the shower. It&#x27;s after I style it that it&#x27;s just so oily and heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s just my hair type, because there are plenty of good reviews. Honestly, try it for yourself it&#x27;s only $10. But I know that I will NOT continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> every cream shampoo seems to compare to wen you need to stop.this shampoo is nothing like wen,it has a shampoo feel when you apply it my hair was all over the place even after using a hair oil to stop the static,i could not get the brush through it when using it it felt like a regular cheap shampoo that lathers a little.you get what you pay for if you can&#x27;t afford wen and want that wen feeling your are not going to get it from this i&#x27;m sorry.wen is wen chaz dean got it right no one has come close to recreating  his cream conditioner.so save your money take care of your hair your worth it</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after seeing it BOGO free at Walgreens.  I really didn&#x27;t have any expectations of how it would work, but I decided to give it a try.  A little info about my hair, I have natural 4C hair and I usually use As I Am cowash.  When I used Renpure on my hair there was no penetration of product into my hair.  Seriously, the product didn&#x27;t coat my hair and when I was done my hair strands just stood up and were really dry.  I was disappointed because I really want to like it.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo/conditioner I have ever used.  My has is soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this product at all. I bought it to compare to Chaz Dean Wen Cleansing Conditioner. It&#x27;s not anywhere near the quality of Wen. I&#x27;ll continue to pay up to 10 times the amount for Wen products.</li>
            <li> My favorite cleansing conditioner. Has all natural ingredients and NO SILICONE like other brands. (Dimethicone, Dimethiconal, etc)</li>
            <li> I have tried various &amp;#34;cleansing conditioners&amp;#34; over the past few months as I&#x27;m trying to grow my hair out and would like to keep it healthy. I&#x27;ve tried L&#x27;Oreal EverCreme, Salon Grafix Citrus Creme, and now Renpure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros:&lt;br /&gt;Smells good, kind of an herbal minty scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleanses well. I apply 3 pumps and massage into the front of my hair, 2-3 more pumps to the crown area, and 2-3 pumps to the underside near the nape of my neck. Then I get a little bit of water in my hands and spread the cleanser around (this is not supposed to lather, so I just add a little water to get the scalp completely covered with product). Then, I leave on for five minutes or so and rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not strip out my hair dye. I find my red dye does not fade as quickly as it does with traditional lathering shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The con:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a conditioner by any means. My hair is straight and thick but the individual strands are fine and soft (I am white). I have to follow up this cleanser with a separate conditioner because my hair does not have that silky glide that conditioners leave. I would imagine if you have curly or kinky hair it would be even worse.  So, I follow up with a traditional conditioner and comb through with a wide-tooth comb to detangle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works okay. I will finish out my bottle but I will not purchase again, as I prefer the Salon Grafix formula of all the products I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> I like the mint smell and feel bit it dries out the hair and fades the color. Don&#x27;t use on your colored hair.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this at all. This cleanser made my scalp and any urrounding skin itch. Maybe my skin is just sensitive to it but I would not purchase this again. I&#x27;ll stick with the good ol&#x27; regular shampoo</li>
            <li> The product does not work like Wen, the line it is attempting to imitate.  I purchased this in a store, and after trying it several times I felt like I had wasted my money.  It works much like a normal shampoo--not like a cleansing conditioner.  It requires following with a separate conditioner.  My hair is long and colored slightly, but relatively healthy with a medium to fine wavy texture.  It felt really dried out when I used the product on its own, and I could not easily comb through it in the shower like you would with Wen.  Buy this because you are looking for a good natural shampoo.....not because you are looking for a cheaper alternative to Wen cleansing conditioners.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I had very little experience with cleansing conditioners before trying this product but I couldn&#x27;t be happier. It took a couple of cleansing for my hair and scalp to adjust but I have been shampoo-free for about six months now and don&#x27;t see myself going back.  I have medium-textured, semi-curly hair, partially colored hair and it looks great.  Curls are smoother and I no longer need to wash my hair every day. I also feel like I&#x27;m saving a little money since I cleanse less and no longer buy shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love this cowash. Has a really nice smell. Remember cowash does not have a lot of lather, but produces a really clean wash anyway.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and fine and must be washed daily because it gets oily. I tried Wen and it really made my hair soft and gave it body. However, it is way too expensive. This product is much thinner than Wen and does not leave hair as soft and smooth. It also didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling completely clean.  For a better and less expensive alternative to Wen, try Lisa Rachel cleansing conditioner or Hair One. They are thicker and work better than RenPure.</li>
            <li> Works great, my hair is left moisturized, clean and shiny. Doesn&#x27;t leave any residue, hair is not heavy or dull or greasy or static-y. Although, FYI, I also use Garnier&#x27;s leave-in cream conditioner after using this product. Seems to help protect hair from daily hairdryer use also.</li>
            <li> Lousy Wen knock off, STICK with Wen or shampoo ONE from Sallys. This product was a total waste of money. Ended up tossing it after a few uses. Unusable product, waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Wen &amp; now RenPure and I must say RenPure is fabulous. I&#x27;d choose the RenPure over Wen based on how great my hair looks AND the added bonus is RenPure is MUCH more affordable!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would absolutely recommend this product to others - I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Target because it had a lot of the right ingredients that I wanted for my hair (coconut oil, tea tree oil, rosemary oil, etc) all wonderful in cleaning and helping a dry winter scalp.  I was not even considering Wen when I picked it up.  It feels amazing on the head and continues that way for awhile after.  I followed the instructions, used about 10 pumps, rubbed it in well from my roots to ends, and left it on for a good 5 minutes.  It blew dry nicely and I dried it without any products so that I could get a real idea of how well it worked.  I have straight, long but fine hair and lots of it. And I get it highlighted from time to time. I live in upstate NY and as everyone knows who lives in cold winter regions, our hair &amp; skin endure serious damage during these long, dry winter months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for making this awesome product! I&#x27;m looking forward to checking out more of the line. And, it&#x27;s always nice to support a family company vs giant corps who make garbage shampoos that smell over-the-top good. ;^)</li>
            <li> I tried this when my store stopped carrying my sulfate-free shampoo. I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My method:&lt;br /&gt;I use a few more pumps than suggested, working it into my scalp with a wide comb, and pulling it through with my fingers. I let it sit while I attend to the rest of myself, and rinse 3-5 minutes later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pro:&lt;br /&gt;My weirdly colored semi permanent hair dye lasts easily twice as long as with shampoo. My hair is growing longer, with less breakage. It is very soft. It appears thicker.  I mean, seriously. My hair looks so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The con:&lt;br /&gt;More drain clogging than with shampoo. This leaves oily traces of itself in the tub and you must be up on the housekeeping. The&lt;br /&gt;pomegranate scent leaves an unpleasantly sweet trace of itself in your hair. The rosemary does not. It took me a while to get the hang of it, and about three weeks for my scalp to realize it could stop with the excessive oil production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is especially worth it to me for the color preservation. Not damaging my hair further with shampoo is also great. Well worth a little elbow grease on the tub.</li>
            <li> A good alternative to Wen. I use it daily and had great results. It&#x27;s not quite the same, but it&#x27;s worth it when I consider the savings.</li>
            <li> It really does get your hair nice and clean with minimal effort, but it&#x27;s not particularly &amp;#34;conditioning.&amp;#34; My ends were a hot mess so I started going out of my way to make sure I only applied it to my roots. Even being careful of that, the cleansers were too harsh for my ends. I&#x27;ll definitely finish the bottle, armed with leave-in conditioner, but probably not buy this again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the consistency of Wen - very much &#x27;watered down&#x27; in comparison - but I really like the results in my hair. It actually feels better than Wen in some ways.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product. I have fine hair, and a medium amount of it, that tends to the oily side. I typically wash my hair every day to avoid buildup, and was hoping to find a product that would be gentle to my hair as I grew it out (if I could reduce the amount of washes, bonus).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this, I absolutely hated it. It definitely takes some effort to work it into your hair, and then even more effort to rinse it out. I spent more time on my hair with one product than I usually do with two. I&#x27;d read other reviews that warned to rinse really, REALLY well, and thought I had. It still felt waxy when I got out of the shower, and after blow drying my hair was a ball of grease. My hair was dirtier than before I washed it. I tried to apply a dry shampoo to mask such buildup, and ended up just having to pull my hair in a ponytail for work. So disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want to write a negative review without giving the product a fair chance, so after a day of regular shampooing/conditioning (which felt amazing after a day on Ren), I tried Ren again. I made sure to follow instructions to the letter, spent a good 5 minutes trying to rinse my hair, and decided not to blow dry to see if that had contributed to the unsatisfactory results any. I am almost surprised that it was just as bad. Gave Ren to my fiance to have him try it, thinking that with his shorter hair it may work better, and rinse out easier. (He has short, thick, curly hair.) He was equally disappointed and said that he really hated the waxy feeling, even when his hair had dried, and that it felt heavy and dirty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this price, I wouldn&#x27;t say you shouldn&#x27;t try it, especially as an alternative to (expensive!) Wen. Just know that if you have hair types similar to ours, it may not work for you. If you&#x27;d like volume and lift (or clean hair...) you may want to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> After hearing this product hyped both on Facebook and internet ads, I set about finding this \\&quot;holy grail\\&quot; of hair-care. I have thick (and I mean THICK) semi-wavy, wholly unruly, chin length hair. I was told this would be perfect for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah. Right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the recommended 8-10 pumps of product is barely enough to make it half way through the top layer my hair. Even with adding a little water, I was using at least 20 pumps per shower. Secondly, the rinse-out takes forever. Even at the hottest water temperature I could stand, it took at least twenty minutes to get out of my hair. (My only positive on this product is the scent. I think it smells heavenly. Green and crisp.) After both letting it air dry (my preferred practice) and trying to heat-dry/style on separate occasions, my hair not only looked greasy and stringy, but actually seemed worse than if I had used my regular products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a learning curve with every product. I understand that completely. The packaging is misleading with its usage recommendations, and the before/after pictures give no indication as to the model&#x27;s actual hair type. What&#x27;s shown on the bottle is a fairly traditionally pretty blonde with long hair. In regards to the properties of the effects of the product, all that is even brought up is her hair is \\&quot;damaged\\&quot; before using it. Simply saying hair is \\&quot;damaged\\&quot; is like saying you see a car. That&#x27;s great--if you don&#x27;t need to know specifics. Was she compulsively coloring her hair? Was her hair damaged by excessive heat styling? Did she tease it? Did she gnaw on her hair? (Sounds gross, but yes, people actually do this.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a great product for someone with medium density, mid length, straight hair with a little dryness. It&#x27;s certainly not ever going to find its way back into my shower.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Walgreens and was excited to try it.  I have used Wen for a long time but have a hard time justifing the cost.  I have long, thick, wavy hair.  Renpure left my hair very heavy and dirty feeling.  I used the product several times thinking I was doing something wrong (even though I had used Wen with no issues.) No matter how much product I used and how long I rinsed, I couldn&#x27;t get my hair to feel clean.  I rinsed with warm water, hot water, cold water, cool water; it made no difference.  My hair was very dull and blah.  No shine at all and waxy feeling.  On the plus side, it does smell good and it did perserve my color.  I guess it is true, you get what you pay for.  I&#x27;ll be going back to Wen!</li>
            <li> Ren pure leaves my hair clean, shiny, and soft. It moisturizers without feeling heavy.  My hair looks healthy.  I don&#x27;t understand or agree with any of the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> I love it I will only use this shampoo from now on! Very long hair and it tangles easily after using this product can brush right through it, and it is so much lighter with much more volume!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at my local Walgreens.  I have been reading all the hype on cleansing conditioners.. So, I had to to try it.&lt;br /&gt;I will say that I am very impressed with this product.  I followed the directions as written on the bottle except I did my final rinse with cold water. I also massaged it into my scalp for at least 5 min.  I have brunette hair, medium to coarse..with wavy curls that feel dry and frizzy. I live in a high desert climate..very very dry.  After just one use, my hair felt softer, shinier and a lot less frizz.  My scalp also did not have that dry look  either!  After I blowed dried my hair..it was slightly frizzy still, so I used this same stuff here as a leave in conditioner, ran it through my hair with my fingers and massaged it in and that made the final difference.  My hair is full, soft, manageable and not frizzy. Gosh..for $9.99 you can&#x27;t beat the price considering your other options.  It&#x27;s way worth the try.  Heck, the lady at Walgreens says I can return within 30 days if it doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I no longer wash my hair every day. I now only wash my hair anywhere from 3-7 days..depending on it&#x27;s mood.  But, I find that the less I do to my hair the better is looking.  When I do wash it ..I hate how dry and frizzy it looks.  That&#x27;s why I am trying this stuff. This stuff is all natural and kind of puts my hair back to the same unwashed status.  Because my climate is so dry..my hair needs it&#x27;s own oils to fluorish.</li>
            <li> My hair is not treated in any way and is cut extremely short. As such I went cheap on hair care products and washed my hair with body soap. Needless to say that caught up with me: my hair dried out and my scalp itched all the time. I had used Renpure for only about a week and noticed my scalp was no longer itching. My hair is now soft again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An added bonus is the pump...unlike other cleansing conditioners in a jar, the pump makes it easier to manage in the shower. Wet my hair, few squirts of Renpure in my palm, rub into my hair, finish showering, rinse my hair and viola...with my short cut that is pretty much 90% of my hair routine. I am about to purchase my second bottle, and because of the reasonable cost this will probably be my shampoo for the duration.</li>
            <li> Use as directed and your hair will be soooo soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> PRODUCT REVIEW: I absolutely love Wen and used it exclusively for a couple years, but quit due to the cost. Even with short hair, it was kind of a big expense. Plus shipping costs. Ew. So, I&#x27;ve been searching ever since for a substitute. I tried Hair One (did not like - my hair felt way too dry and tangly afterwards), L&#x27;oreal Evercreme (which worked well for awhile but then seemed to dull and weigh my hair down), and then I heard about Ren so I had to try that, too. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t feel as \\&quot;luxurious\\&quot; on my hair as Wen does, and I don&#x27;t feel my hair is as silky after drying, but I&#x27;m pretty pleased with the results (especially the shine). The tangly-ness does bug me a bit, but I think I&#x27;ll just try using a very small amount as a leave-in conditioner and see if that helps. Bottom line, it&#x27;s good for the price, but I still long for Wen.&lt;br /&gt;USAGE TIPS: I also wanted to add my tips for cleansing with these cleansing conditioners, since a lot of people complain of oily or greasy hair afterwards. I do have hair that tends to be a little dry, but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any need for you to suffer and end up with grease-slicked hair with any of these products! :) So, here&#x27;s what I do, and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with greasiness. I hope it helps! First, make sure your hair is soaking wet throughout. Also, you have to use a LOT of product. I use a palm-full and I have pretty much a pixie-ish cut with longer bangs and layers on top (although I am probably using too much!). Anyway, I rub the product together in my hands for a second and then rub/distribute it all throughout my hair. I stick my head under the shower water for like 1.3 seconds to add a bit of water, and then with my fingertips directly on my scalp I massage vigorously all over my head/hair. It does actually sort of lather when I do this, like sort of a foamy lather. Anyway, I do that first in the shower, then leave the \\&quot;lather\\&quot; on throughout the rest of my shower while I&#x27;m washing my face, shaving, etc.Right before I&#x27;m done with my shower routine and ready to rinse out my hair, I add a little bit of water again and re-lather, then rinse very, very well. I feel like all the foaming/massaging really helps in avoiding the greasiness that I think would be likely if you just slapped it on and then rinsed it out. I use this exact same routine no matter which cleansing conditioner I use and again, I&#x27;ve never had any greasy issues. Anyway, I hope that helps anyone who&#x27;s having probs!</li>
            <li> will never again try another thing if it&#x27;s not wen .this is like water and made my hair feel very dry</li>
            <li> I just tried this for the first time today. I have straight, stringy, tangly hair that normally looks greasy by days&#x27; end, especially in the Florida humidity. Recently, I noticed that my hair was breaking and that a lot of it was shedding during the shampooing/conditioning process. We are talking a LOT. Then, my scalp also starting feeling dry and itchy. My mom gave me a bottle of this cleansing conditioner. I thought it would just make my hair oily and drab-- NOT SO!! In fact, it looks cleaner, and my scalp feels better. There was very little hair in the drain after cleansing with this product. I will update the review after I&#x27;ve used it for several weeks.</li>
            <li> Great product, I&#x27;ve had. Problem for a long time growing my hair longer, this helped a lot</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews on beauty products... but I was so displeased with this product I felt I had to. Like the majority of the reviews I&#x27;ve also been searching for a substitute for WEN based on the price. Ren left my hair feeling oily and extremely tangled. I tried it for one week and had to return it.</li>
            <li> Worst hair product I&#x27;ve ever used! Smells nice, but leaves my hair super greasy! I used it 4 times and ended up with the same awful results each time. I&#x27;m a \\&quot;product junkie\\&quot; and I have never thrown a product away before. If I don&#x27;t like something, I give it away, but this was so bad I did not feel I should give it away - it had to be thrown away. I&#x27;ve used a lot of sulfate free shampoo and this is by far the worst! I&#x27;ll shampoo my hair with suave rosemary mint conditioner over this any day!</li>
            <li> I have fine but thick hair and this has been working awesome. I haven&#x27;t tried wen but I have tried the herbal essence cleansing waxy conditioner #dont recommend that brand. But renpure is great, I purchased from my local wg drug store for a couple more dollars than Amazon in lavender and the mint and both smell and work great. It totally gets rid of oil and makes hair lighter and more body. Will definitely continue using renpure. I also had my son switch to this because his hair was wirey, dry  and had lots of dandruff. After a week I swear his hair was so soft and no dandruff at all!  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I like ve this product. I wanted to try Wen but did not want to spend so much on a trial. Tried this and love it. You have to make sure you rinse well. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is really handy to have around especially if your a frequent shampooer because it&#x27;s not harsh but it is effective. It smells okay,nothing really memorable.</li>
            <li> there is nothing remotely rosemary mint about this conditioner.  It smells ok, but not rosemary mint.  It&#x27;s very thin, but it does condition your hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin, wavy and  frizzy despite the fact I use a conditioner with it. I have used WEN and it did nothing for my hair. Had to follow it up with a conditioner because I could not get a comb through it. It still was dry and frizzy after this. I hoped Renpure&#x27;s Cleansing Conditioner would be better. This one smells wonderful, but it too left my hair in need of a conditioner. Couldn&#x27;t get a comb through the ends. Felt parched after drying. I don&#x27;t think any brand of these cleansing conditioners work well. Back to my Organix shampoo and conditioner. It still saves and moisturizes my hair the best.</li>
            <li> I have color-treated fine straight hair, a few inches past my shoulders.  I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s and have ALWAYS had thin hair.  For years I have worn it short because of the thinness and oiliness -- I washed my hair every day esp since I live in the hot, humid South.  I saw Renpure at Walgreens 2-for-1 and decided to try it.  I have never used Wen because of the price tag so I can&#x27;t compare effectiveness, but I will continue with Renpure.  I do have to be careful with following the directions, and wash it out thoroughly.  It adds time to my shower routine.  Also, every week or so I need to use a cleansing shampoo before using the Renpure to prevent any build-up.  I have only tried the Rosemary Mint (on my 2nd bottle).  I find my hair looks relatively fuller -- which means that for special occasions I can style it and wear it down for a few hours before it falls flat.  The thing I love is that I find I can now wash my hair every other day without it getting as greasy.  It hangs more smoothly and is generally more manageable and less fly-away.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product 3 times and already love it! My first use I fell in love with the smell. I come out of the shower with my hair smelling like mint and it&#x27;s great. I have long, thick, frizzy hair and although my frizz is still there, I have never had soft hair in my entire life. Using this product my hair is soft for once, and I love it! I hope to see even more improvement in my hair :)</li>
            <li> I use the Curly Girl sulfate/silicone-free hair care method, and I bought this because based on the ingredients list posted on Amazon, it wasn&#x27;t supposed to contain silicones. Turns out that it does, which was a big disappointment to me. However, they were far enough down the list that I decided to give it a try anyway, and it seems to be working out pretty well for my hair without too much buildup. I alternate 2-4 days of Renpure and 1 day of the L&#x27;oreal cleansing conditioner, with sulfate-free shampoo washes every two or three weeks when I start feeling a little buildup. It&#x27;s not the holy grail, but it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found so far for the price since my beloved Trader Joe&#x27;s Nourish conditioner had &#x27;cones added to it and stopped working for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My routine, in case anyone cares (my hair is quite curly and currently about 5&amp;#34; past my shoulders when dry):&lt;br /&gt;1) Cleanse with either the Renpure or the L&#x27;oreal cleansing conditioner, scrubbing scalp well with fingertips; let it sit for a few minutes while I bodywash/shave/whatever else needs doing.&lt;br /&gt;2) Rinse very thoroughly while scrubbing scalp some more with fingertips and finger-combing out some of the tangles.&lt;br /&gt;3) Add a bit of Suave Coconut conditioner and work out the rest of the tangles, then run my head under the water just enough to get it super wet again - not to actually rinse out the conditioner. (When my hair was shorter I skipped this step; step 4 was enough to detangle. Now it needs more slip because it&#x27;s so long.)&lt;br /&gt;4) Mix together in my palms a bit more of the Suave Coconut and some Herbal Essences Set Me Up gel, then work that combo through sopping wet hair, raking out any remaining tangles or loose hairs.&lt;br /&gt;5) (&amp;#34;Baptismal rinse&amp;#34;) Splash some more water over the top of my head, flip my head upside down, and splash some more over the back of my upside-down head, then turn off the water.&lt;br /&gt;6) With my head still upside-down, scrunch out as much water as I can while disrupting the curl clumps as little as possible, then plop the whole mess of hair into a t-shirt and tie it up before standing up, so that the curls essentially sit on top of my head and set themselves while the t-shirt absorbs the excess water. I leave the t-shirt on my head while I get dressed, or if I&#x27;m showering at night I&#x27;ll just sleep with it on. When I take it off I just shake out my still-wet-but-not-dripping-anymore hair and let it air dry the rest of the way.</li>
            <li> I loved this so much that I bought some for my daughter. It smells great when I&#x27;m washing my hair and doesn&#x27;t leave an overwhelming scent when it&#x27;s washed out. My hair feels healthier and my hair color lasts longer. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> ordered as a gift for my mom per her request she loves this product</li>
            <li> I tried this for the very first time. It has a really nice scent and left my hair soft. I just wish it was a little thicker.</li>
            <li> After trying Hair One, and not really crazy about the smell, I came across Ren at Walgreens. I decided to give it a try and I absolutely LOVE the way it makes my hair feel, it makes it soft and shiny with no greasiness. I have no plans to ever &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; my hair again, with shampoo and conditioner. I am totally sold on this product.</li>
            <li> Not Wen, but a decent no suds-ing cleanser for your hair.  You will NEED conditioner after this products.  While it cleans, it also can be drying.</li>
            <li> I refuse to pay Chaz Dean another $40 bucks. This is just as good to me.</li>
            <li> I discovered this product while doing a search for Wen. I was hesitant at first because I thought since it was so much cheaper that it wouldn&#x27;t be a good shampoo/conditioner (ect.) However, I was pleasantly surprised with the results I achieved. My hair was not greasy and it detangled very well. I have thick, long wavy hair that is color treated and tends to frizz.. seriously I look like I have a lion&#x27;s mane if I don&#x27;t straighten it. After one use.. the frizz is gone! It is soft and manageable as well as shiny and the color is vibrant again. I am super please with this product and I don&#x27;t even think I&#x27;ll try Wen.</li>
            <li> Having read both the positive and negative reviews, I was prepared for just about anything, so it was a very pleasant surprise to have the product work more or less exactly as advertised. For me, the only downside is the scent - the mint is lovely, but the addition of the rosemary makes it smell faintly medicinal to me. It isn&#x27;t terrible, just not quite what I&#x27;d hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I can see why people may have encountered difficulties, especially if they&#x27;re not used to washing with conditioner (co-washing) or if they followed the directions without knowing how to adapt them for their own hair needs. The directions are more like guidelines - the amount they say to use might be far too much for short, thin hair (like mine) or not nearly enough for longer thicker hair. Basically, you want your hair to feel like the product has worked its way through all of your hair. You don&#x27;t want to massage it in the way you would shampoo - something like a wide-toothed comb, or just using your fingers, is a much better option. You have to make sure to very thoroughly rinse all of the product out of your hair. Yes, you can use some as a styling aid later, but if you don&#x27;t completely clear out what you&#x27;ve used for cleaning, you may be leaving dirt and oil behind, which can make your hair feel sticky and gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For myself, I always do one quick wash (work the conditioner through, then immediately rinse) followed by a second one where I let it sit in my hair for the recommended 3-5 minutes. My hair is on the fine side, and shoulder length, so I&#x27;ve found that 5-7 pumps is more than enough for each round.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I needed something different.  I researched reviews most of them were positive. So I decided to bite the bullet and try it. The excitement was very very short lived. I followed the directions. Omg! My hair was awful. It felted like straw but with an oily appearance.  It literally mad me feel I&#x27;ll. I didn&#x27;t feel like myself. So I went out and looked for some hope. I turned to a new line of dove shampoo. This was with macadamin oil.. I tried it..so great. My shine came back and soft..I&#x27;m in love with my hair again</li>
            <li> I have used Wen as well as the coconut cowash by I Am Me.  Renpure is the worst.  I have fine straight hair and using this product simply does not perform on my hair AT ALL.  It doesn&#x27;t detangle, it doesn&#x27;t smooth.  It has the consistency of Elmer&#x27;s Glue and doesn&#x27;t spread very well.  The one thing I did like is the scent.  I won&#x27;t be ordering this again.  My hair feels dry after using this product.  It doesn&#x27;t condition at all.  I&#x27;m glad I just ordered on bottle.  I will be going back to I Am Me coconut cowash.</li>
            <li> I like using cleansing conditioners and only shampoo my hair once a week now. This one is a little minty which I like a lot and feels good and clean on the hair. I will order again once I&#x27;m done with this one.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This product may be great for some hair types, but for me it was not.  I have long blonde hair which is thick, but each hair is fine (that&#x27;s just the nature of blonde hair, each hair has a small diameter).  My hair is also a little oily at the scalp and drier at the ends.  I have never found 2-in-1 type shampoos to work for me because they add too much conditioning at my scalp where I don&#x27;t need it, and not enough conditioning at the ends where I do need it.  This product did exactly that same thing, but was actually worse because I could not get it to rinse out.  As a result, my hair felt heavy, flat, dull, and just plain not-clean.  I had read other reviews that talked about how difficult it was to rinse out so I went to extra effort to rinse, but it still wouldn&#x27;t come out.  I can&#x27;t even imagine the disaster this would be if a person had low water pressure...I was rinsing under the faucet in my tub so it was getting full force water and still wasn&#x27;t rinsing effectively.  Normally I use a sulfate free shampoo on my scalp and a conditioner on my ends (total cost for both is less than the cost of this product) and my hair is light and bouncy and shiny.  I normally wash every 2 days but with this I would have to wash daily because the residue left traps more dirt and oils.  When you think about it, it is a rather wasteful product, A. because you have to use so much because it is so hard to work through your hair (recommended amount on the bottle is 10-12 pumps!) and B. because it takes so long to work it in and (attempt to) wash it out that your conservative 5 minute shower becomes a 10 minute shower.  I also don&#x27;t like that this product contains silicone which is just a cheap synthetic ingredient that I have found breaks me out in little rashy bumps around my hairline, scalp, shoulders, and back (wherever the shampoo touches.) If you have dry or mature hair then maybe this would be a good product for you, but I found it to be both ineffective and a pain to use.</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed with this. I have mid back, very curly/prone to frizz, color treated hair and have been using cleansing conditioners for several years. I have tried probably 8 different brands from the most expensive down to the ones at Walmart I was looking forward to this one but the texture is very thin and watery and right away I was worried. It did nothing for me, it does smell nice but I actually had to use another brand I had after I washed this 1 out. It might be better for a different type of hair but not mine.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this cleansing conditioner as well as others make my hair &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; so I have gone back to using the other Renpure shampoo and conditioner products that are really good.</li>
            <li> love this stuff. its like Wen but affordable. After a year of using these types of cleaners I can tell you for the first time in my life I can come out of a shower and not have to use products in my harir to control the frizz. Natually curly color treated hair. Amazing how nice you hair can be after you commit to not shapooing anymore.</li>
            <li> I was excited when I saw this at rite aid. Unfortunately as soonas I tried using it the excitement was gone. I know it douen&#x27;ts suds up so I wasn&#x27;t expecting or waiting for that but it took much more to coat my hair than I thought. It didn&#x27;t get creamy nor did it really spread through my hair. My ends felt like straw!I could not use my pick to comb through it.It wasn&#x27;t happening at all. Rinsed it all out gently towel dried it and it took 15 mins to comb through it! It felt goupy too! And I rinsed for a long time! I finally got through my hair and went to dry it. Still couldn&#x27;t comb through it and the drier it got the weirder it got. Ends were horribly dry while the rest of my hair was greasy and weird feeling. It honestly was a waist of ten dollars in my mind. I obviously will never buy it again.</li>
            <li> OK  for &amp;#34;copy&amp;#34; of the actualy WREN product however I probably won&#x27;t be purchasing it again. Item was for my personal daily use and one bottle is sufficient.</li>
            <li> I have fragile, fine hair and have happily used Wen (all of the basic ones, as well as some of the special edition formulas) for over a year.  I ordered the Renpure Coconut Crème Cowash through Amazon on a recommendation and found it to be MUCH more drying than any of the Wen cleansing conditioners.  My hair felt like straw after using it, although the addition of a moisturizing styling product saved the day.  I have decided to use this as a body wash instead, as it works well for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I received the Renpure Solutions Rosemary Mint cleansing conditioner as a gift and used it last night.  Surprisingly, that product is far different from the Coconut Creme cleansing conditioner--my hair felt soft, shiny and clean afterward, and the results were exactly like what I&#x27;d get from any Wen product, for a much lower cost!  I was so excited that I ordered another bottle, along with the Pomegranate (will review that formula after I try it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This experience has led me to wonder if the Coconut Crème product Amazon sells is a fake. I have noticed that the Rosemary Mint and Coconut Creme labels are slightly different and that the Coconut Crème product is made by &amp;#34;Renpure,&amp;#34; whereas the Rosemary Mint product label says &amp;#34;Renpure Solutions&amp;#34;.  Just a thought.  I&#x27;ve known Amazon to sell knock-offs before (Timex 1440 watches, specifically). So maybe that&#x27;s the problem here. Not sure, but I am certain there is a vast difference between the Renpure Coconut Crème Cowash and the Renpure Solutions Rosemary Mint cleansing conditioner formulas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this is helpful for anyone like me who needs a very gentle conditioning cleanser like Wen but would like to find a cheaper alternative.</li>
            <li> I got this product from a local store buy one get one free so I was super excited. I gave my mom the free bottle. We both tried it I have chemically treated hair and she has natural hair. We both hated it. It didn&#x27;t feel like the hair was washed at all and dried it out. I went back to hair one with olive oil its the best!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this on a whim, since it was BOGO at Walgreens. What a mistake! I only used it once, but that was enough to inflict massive damage on my hair. I lost oodles of hair when I lathered up with this, and I promptly took it back for a refund. Not only that, it left my hair feeling greasy and nasty to boot - so insult to injury.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give this a zero stars if I could. Use at your own risk!</li>
            <li> The product is okay it just doesn&#x27;t really work for my hair so much. I&#x27;ve found it better to just wash my hair with plain old conditioner. I like that there are no sulfates in this product but my hair doesn&#x27;t seem to like it very much. It just made it frizzy. Again though it could just be my hair type. I&#x27;m American Indian and my hair is not as fine as most white people&#x27;s.</li>
