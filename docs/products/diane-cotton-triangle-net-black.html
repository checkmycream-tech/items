            <li>it was exactly what i was looking for.. good quality, love it..</li>

            <li>Good size for large rollers and durable.</li>

            <li>It is durable and easy to care for.</li>
            <li>I use the very large magnetic rollers and this net fits perfect over the rollers.</li>
            <li>The mesh is too fine for use with any type of roller that has protrusions.</li>
            <li>but it works just fine.</li>
            <li>This is a great oversized hair net if you are using jumbo rollers.</li>
            <li>It securely holds my hair rollers in place.</li>
            <li>this no hair net it might work for fishing lol</li>
            <li>also great for deep conditioning under the pidds dryer.  </li>
            <li>Just the thing I needed to keep my &amp;#34;coif&amp;#34; secure while I nap.  </li>
            <li>It was big, made out of good material and it fit over my rollers.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to find something that will hold large hair rollers in place while I waited for my hair to dry/</li>
            <li>Good old-fashioned cotton nets, simple and useful.&lt;br /&gt;They are also sturdy - my cat got a hold of one of them</li>
            <li>and she really wasn&#x27;t able to do much damage, try as she might :).&lt;br</li>
            <li>covers all your head full of rollers.</li>
            <li>A great addition  for any wet set!</li>
            <li>; He actually thought it looked cute, and to be honest, it does make more sense as a headband than a hair net.</li>
            <li>these are hard to find, bought several for my Mom, great price, good quality</li>
            <li>Nice big size too.</li>
            <li>This is the kind of net I had been looking for.  </li>
            <li>Was just right for Halloween costume.</li>
            <li>Very large  </li>
            <li>It was Okay, Seems sturdy, but that sucker is huge!!</li>
            <li>great hairnet for over rollers, plenty big enough, made of quality mesh</li>
            <li>my mom&#x27;s been searching for this net and I am so glad I was able to find it for her.&lt;br /&gt;the photo shows it to be made in USA, but the actual product received notes it is made in China.  </li>
            <li>It was recommended as something that helped to keep large hair rollers in place when using the dryer.  </li>
            <li>Did to know it was so large.  </li>
            <li>I use it around my rollers, and even at that it was large</li>
            <li>This net works just fine except that it is tricky to put on over the Velcro rollers I use to set my hair.</li>
            <li>It fits fine around even my bouffant sized curlers (the big rollers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted a superfine nylon net - NOT cotton or triangular.</li>
            <li>Large enough to cover a full head of rollers and then some.</li>
            <li>It works fine for rollers AS LONG AS you are not using self-holding rollers.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think to get anything to wrap around my head until I first put the curlers in and then had to hunt for old scarves.</li>
            <li>Thank you for quick shipping and the quality of this hair net.</li>
            <li>I smooth my wet hair around my head after washing.</li>
            <li>Stayed on all night, kept all of my curling rods on and in place, large enough that I had more than enough left to tie up to keep it in place.</li>
            <li>Would have liked it just a little smaller  </li>
            <li>Back in the olden days when I was in high school I used to set my hair in rollers pretty often.  </li>
            <li>and my husband thought I got a new &amp;#34;headband thing.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Recently, I was dissatisfied with hot rollers and decided to dig up my old velcro-type hair curlers.  </li>
            <li>This is a large triangle-shaped hair net.  </li>
            <li>The picture of the packaging clearly states &amp;#34;MADE IN USA&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Just like the old fashioned hairnets found in old beauty parlors.</li>
            <li>the big size for this net is really useful.</li>
            <li>This is large enough to hold her rollers, comfy enough, and all cotton.  </li>
            <li>Large enough for larger rollers.</li>
            <li>Then I secure it with this hair net and either dry it under a bonnet dryer or let my hair air dry.</li>
            <li>At first I doubted if it would hold up, but after 6 months of using it almost every other day, it has held up.</li>
            <li>Reminds me of my Grandmother who was a hair dresser and used this type of hairnet back in the old days, thank you!</li>
            <li>I fully expected it to get large holes in it</li>
            <li>I looked everywhere for this old fashioned, open weave, triangular hair net.  </li>
            <li>Hair net is too large and is not very useable in a commercial kitchen setting.</li>
            <li>I also hate tight things over my ears, so this type of hairnet is perfect for my needs.</li>

            <li> I also hate tight things over my ears, so this type of hairnet is perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li> This can be as large or as small as you need it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this can be a hair net, it is so thick and large</li>
            <li> I jus found it really large and hard to tie.</li>
            <li> Of course I am careful when I take it off as to not catch the hair net on hair clips.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also started using this net when I do a &amp;#34;wrap&amp;#34; on my wet hair.</li>
            <li> Normal hairnets are too small for me and their rubber band too tight.</li>
            <li> It was a little larger than I expected</li>
            <li> Heavy enough not to tangle up.</li>
            <li> Heavy enough to put some pressure on the curlers when you tie it, to hold I all together.</li>
            <li> In my case, I have thick naturally curly hair that I don&#x27;t want messed up when I sleep.</li>
            <li> I have a long thick hair and when I do it with rollers nothing can cover it but this net.</li>
            <li> To keep the rollers secured to my head while I went about my business or, usually, sleeping, I would use a triangle hair net.  </li>
            <li> They were to be used around food but the black stuff falling off of them makes that unwise.</li>
            <li> I hand washed them in a fragrant Method laundry product and little black pieces were all over - perhaps from trimming?</li>
            <li> It helps to stretch out my shoulder-length tightly curly type 4 hair while still leaving it with a some waves.</li>
            <li> I have a hood dryer that sucks the air up into the hood and needed something to tie my braids down while drying.</li>
            <li> so, since they weren&#x27;t worth sending back, I opened the packages and they smelled terrible.</li>
            <li> Not sexy, however, so keep that in mind . . .</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want anything thin because I use it to keep my rollers in place when I set my hair and go to bed.</li>
            <li> but as per description, yes it matches the poor description</li>
            <li> Alas, I searched everywhere to no avail.  </li>
            <li> A disappointing item -</li>
            <li> Very disappointed when they arrived and the packaging said &amp;#34;Made in CHINA.&amp;#34;  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is a great oversized hair net if you are using jumbo rollers.</li>
            <li> I have a hood dryer that sucks the air up into the hood and needed something to tie my braids down while drying. I have to tie this in several places but it does the job.</li>
            <li> My mom has been searching at all the stores for one of these.  Everything in retail is nylon and they do melt when she uses her hairdryer on it.  This is large enough to hold her rollers, comfy enough, and all cotton.  Its a winner</li>
            <li> This  hair net is the perfect fit!! I use the very large magnetic rollers and this net fits perfect over the rollers.</li>
            <li> I looked everywhere for this old fashioned, open weave, triangular hair net.  It securely holds my hair rollers in place.</li>
            <li> I found this net while shopping for a bonnet hair dryer.  It was recommended as something that helped to keep large hair rollers in place when using the dryer.  It does the trick and I love it!!</li>
            <li> great hairnet for over rollers, plenty big enough, made of quality mesh</li>
            <li> this no hair net it might work for fishing lol</li>
            <li> Good size for large rollers and durable.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for these in drugstores all over! Good old-fashioned cotton nets, simple and useful.&lt;br /&gt;They are also sturdy - my cat got a hold of one of them and she really wasn&#x27;t able to do much damage, try as she might :).&lt;br /&gt;Good deal!</li>
            <li> I wore this to cook dinner and my husband thought I got a new &amp;#34;headband thing.&amp;#34; He actually thought it looked cute, and to be honest, it does make more sense as a headband than a hair net. Ah well...maybe for someone else it would work better. I jus found it really large and hard to tie.</li>
            <li> This is just what I was hoping it would be. Heavy enough not to tangle up. Heavy enough to put some pressure on the curlers when you tie it, to hold I all together. Nice big size too. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> my mom&#x27;s been searching for this net and I am so glad I was able to find it for her.&lt;br /&gt;the photo shows it to be made in USA, but the actual product received notes it is made in China.  Still it seems to be well constructed.</li>
            <li> It was Okay, Seems sturdy, but that sucker is huge!! Not for kitchen use, its a bit more on the fashion side id say</li>
            <li> Great product. Stayed on all night, kept all of my curling rods on and in place, large enough that I had more than enough left to tie up to keep it in place. Love it!</li>
            <li> these are hard to find, bought several for my Mom, great price, good quality</li>
            <li> I bought this when I switched to plastic &amp;#34;magnetic&amp;#34; rollers - a must have hair net. At first I doubted if it would hold up, but after 6 months of using it almost every other day, it has held up. I fully expected it to get large holes in it ----that did NOT happen. Of course I am careful when I take it off as to not catch the hair net on hair clips. Large enough for larger rollers. Holds in the rollers - does what it was made for.</li>
            <li> perfect size. covers all your head full of rollers. also great for deep conditioning under the pidds dryer.  great n happy</li>
            <li> Did to know it was so large.  I wanted to wear it to be, but it is for woman.</li>
            <li> Perfect for Keeping your hair and roller in place.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to find something that will hold large hair rollers in place while I waited for my hair to dry/</li>
            <li> this net is not what I ordered unless I made a mistake.  I wanted a superfine nylon net - NOT cotton or triangular.</li>
            <li> This net works just fine except that it is tricky to put on over the Velcro rollers I use to set my hair.</li>
            <li> This is the kind of net I had been looking for.  I didn&#x27;t want anything thin because I use it to keep my rollers in place when I set my hair and go to bed.</li>
            <li> I bought this to hold rollers in place and sometimes to keep hair in place before I go out. It works fine for rollers AS LONG AS you are not using self-holding rollers. The mesh is too fine for use with any type of roller that has protrusions.</li>
            <li> Works just like it used to when I used these in highschool to hold my magnetic rollers in place overnight.</li>
            <li> Just the thing I needed to keep my &amp;#34;coif&amp;#34; secure while I nap.  Can&#x27;t find stuff like this in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> Was just right for Halloween costume.</li>
            <li> It was a little larger than I expected but it works just fine.</li>
            <li> it was not the product I thought it was, a photo of the product unpacked and extended would avoid the confusion ...but as per description, yes it matches the poor description</li>
            <li> Back in the olden days when I was in high school I used to set my hair in rollers pretty often.  To keep the rollers secured to my head while I went about my business or, usually, sleeping, I would use a triangle hair net.  These hairnets were sold every where.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the advent of heated rollers that&#x27;s what I would use through the years to curl my hair.  Recently, I was dissatisfied with hot rollers and decided to dig up my old velcro-type hair curlers.  Result?  I loved how my hair turned out.  Downside?  The rollers kept loosening and I had to keep adjusting them.  Solution?  A triangle hairnet.  Alas, I searched everywhere to no avail.  Good ol&#x27; Amazon came through for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just like 1970.  The hairnet works great.  If you want to make the switch from damaging hot rollers to good old-fashioned hair curlers, you need this hairnet.</li>
            <li> As a cosmetologist, I find the Cotton Triangle Net, best for wrapping hair when sleeping and then covering with a scarf or bonnet.  It keeps the hair in place and allows air to circulate.  I like the product.  It is durable and easy to care for.</li>
            <li> This was a real-old fashioned triangular hairnet. It is used to wrap hair that is somehow bulky, such as hair in rollers. In my case, I have thick naturally curly hair that I don&#x27;t want messed up when I sleep. Normal hairnets are too small for me and their rubber band too tight. I also hate tight things over my ears, so this type of hairnet is perfect for my needs. Not sexy, however, so keep that in mind . . .</li>
            <li> Hair net is too large and is not very useable in a commercial kitchen setting. The material is quite durable however , and perhaps can be used by those with LOTS of hair to cover but not recommended for industrial kitchen use.</li>
            <li> It was big, made out of good material and it fit over my rollers. I would recommend this to buy.</li>
            <li> This can be as large or as small as you need it.  It held my hair in perfect shape when showering.</li>
            <li> My husband told me recently he likes my hair curly, so off I went to buy curlers. I didn&#x27;t think to get anything to wrap around my head until I first put the curlers in and then had to hunt for old scarves. They worked but when I saw this on Amazon I placed my order. It works much better than a scarf! Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Thank you for quick shipping and the quality of this hair net. Reminds me of my Grandmother who was a hair dresser and used this type of hairnet back in the old days, thank you!</li>
            <li> Would have liked it just a little smaller  Very large  I use it around my rollers, and even at that it was large</li>
            <li> Good size and material</li>
            <li> it was exactly what i was looking for.. good quality, love it..</li>
            <li> The picture of the packaging clearly states &amp;#34;MADE IN USA&amp;#34; so I made my order based on that alone.  Very disappointed when they arrived and the packaging said &amp;#34;Made in CHINA.&amp;#34;  We needed to use them ASAP so, since they weren&#x27;t worth sending back, I opened the packages and they smelled terrible. I hand washed them in a fragrant Method laundry product and little black pieces were all over - perhaps from trimming? A disappointing item - I should have guessed at the price they were imported but that&#x27;s NOT what the picture says. They were to be used around food but the black stuff falling off of them makes that unwise.</li>
            <li> awesome hair net u just tie it like a bandana</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this can be a hair net, it is so thick and large, it&#x27;s almost a shawl.</li>
            <li> Great for letting my curlers breath but still holding nice and secure. Convenient to have around for sure. A great addition  for any wet set!</li>
            <li> the big size for this net is really useful. I have a long thick hair and when I do it with rollers nothing can cover it but this net. I ordered another one just in case.</li>
            <li> Large enough to cover a full head of rollers and then some. it worked well for me with magnetic rollers.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this net in stores for almost a year.  It was something that was always carried to now not.  If is perfect for the Times I do use rollers.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t what we thought it was, could not use it.</li>
            <li> This is a large triangle-shaped hair net.  It fits fine around even my bouffant sized curlers (the big rollers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also started using this net when I do a &amp;#34;wrap&amp;#34; on my wet hair. I smooth my wet hair around my head after washing. Then I secure it with this hair net and either dry it under a bonnet dryer or let my hair air dry. It helps to stretch out my shoulder-length tightly curly type 4 hair while still leaving it with a some waves.</li>
            <li> Just like the old fashioned hairnets found in old beauty parlors.</li>
            <li> this was a great product and kept all my rollers in my hair and in place.  I love that it is a huge size so it fits any size of rollers in your hair.  this is a must buy and a great product to have handy when you need to hold your rollers in place.</li>
