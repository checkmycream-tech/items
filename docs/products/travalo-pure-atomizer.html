            <li>This is so handy.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to refill.</li>
            <li>It is easy to fill and it&#x27;s a lieghtweight!</li>
            <li>I am able to carry my favorite fragrances with me.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Does not leak and able to carry 3 in my purse.</li>
            <li>This one has been great so far and no leaks.</li>
            <li>Easy to fill and no leaks.</li>
            <li>Sprayed perfume easily.</li>
            <li>just the right amount, safely contained &amp; you don&#x27;t have to worry about a suitcase full of perfume saturated clothes!</li>
            <li>It is easily filled from the perfume bottle itself.</li>
            <li>Small and perfect for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li>I love not having to carry the whole bottle when I take a trip.</li>
            <li>but they can be refilled in seconds and the bottle itself is super lightweight.</li>
            <li>So useful but the perfume evaporates quickly.</li>
            <li>Thanks Travalo!!</li>
            <li>Great little product.</li>
            <li>It would be much better to fill with a little funnel and then recap with the spray top.</li>
            <li>I loved this little thing when I first got it.</li>
            <li>I love to carry a fragrance with me for travel, but the large bottles, even a 3 oz,  are just too big.</li>
            <li>Hence the rather handy refillable &#x60;perfume spray&#x27; that is in handy size for either a clutch purse or similar bag, or as one reviewer has said when travelling overseas - really useful to have, as it is small enough to be allowed to be carried with you.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these...(my boyfriend even has one for his cologne, even though he would never admit it;)</li>
            <li>Just throw it in your purse or bag and you are always ready.</li>
            <li>Can really put any liquid in it.</li>
            <li>It was really nifty, sturdy, and convenient.</li>
            <li>With the perfume bottle I have, it is very tricky to get it in this vial.</li>
            <li>No more hunting for deals on the travel size of my favorite perfume!</li>
            <li>The only issue is that it cannot be easily rinsed out, so you would need to keep using the same scent, otherwise you would mix the smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, however this is perfect to sick in my purse, makeup bag, etc.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s lieghter than glas and nearly unbreakable</li>
            <li>My hope is that it holds up as it has so far.</li>
            <li>Nice but so expensive</li>
            <li>I ordered the black one for my husband to keep one at the office and one in his travel bag and the pretty silver, gold and red ones for all my girlfriends!  </li>
            <li>This is a small plastic bottle that holds a very large amount of perfume.</li>

            <li> The vial does not open, but relies on lining up the spray tube with the spray tube on your perfume bottle. Unfortunately, this is not an airtight seal. As a result, you will get a lot of stray perfume on your hands and very little in the travel container! It would be much better to fill with a little funnel and then recap with the spray top.</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife as a gift. She loves it. Easy to fill and no leaks.</li>
            <li> Gave this item to Mrs C so she could save some space in the handbag. This is a small plastic bottle that holds a very large amount of perfume. It is easily filled from the perfume bottle itself. The only issue is that it cannot be easily rinsed out, so you would need to keep using the same scent, otherwise you would mix the smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It appears to be well made and works like it should. Small and perfect for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time when traveling. Works great, no leaks and what a great gift for some of your girlfriends that travel as well. You don&#x27;t have to worry about airport security because the size is perfect.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I&#x27;d like to take some perfume with me when I go out.  When I got the product, I found that you need to use it with a perfume that sprays instead of a cologne.  But it is the size that I&#x27;d like, so I&#x27;ll just give it to my sister as a birthday present.</li>
            <li> I thought it might possibly spill out or be hard to use but they can be refilled in seconds and the bottle itself is super lightweight.</li>
            <li> I travel alot so this is great. Just throw it in your purse or bag and you are always ready. Can really put any liquid in it.</li>
            <li> Love the variety of colors!</li>
            <li> So useful but the perfume evaporates quickly. I only add a little at a time.</li>
            <li> These are the best things ever! I used to lug around my big bottle in my purse everywhere...ugh...now I have several of these for all my body sprays &amp; perfumes! And they&#x27;re perfect for vacations...just the right amount, safely contained &amp; you don&#x27;t have to worry about a suitcase full of perfume saturated clothes! I highly recommend these...(my boyfriend even has one for his cologne, even though he would never admit it;)</li>
            <li> This product works as promised.  I am able to carry my favorite fragrances with me.  It is very easy to refill.</li>
            <li> Great product but the perfume does evaporate. I would recommend not filling them up.....fill maybe 1/4 at a time, as you need it. Oterwise, great product, functional and works well.</li>
            <li> I loved this little thing when I first got it. It was really nifty, sturdy, and convenient. However, not even a month into using it, it broke. Every time I press down on the trigger, it leaks terribly. Also, it&#x27;s almost impossible to get the cap off because the two components of the cap have separated. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I was flying to Europe. It is easy to fill and it&#x27;s a lieghtweight! I love it! And it&#x27;s lieghter than glas and nearly unbreakable</li>
            <li> This is so handy. I always hated trying to carry my perfume because the bottle was heavy and I use small handbags. The Travalo is perfect size and works great.</li>
            <li> I love it. Does not leak and able to carry 3 in my purse.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best inventions ever!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical. Always hate traveling with perfume in my luggage due to leakage. Friend told me about this little gadget. Bought two. Flew two times already and am super impressed. Followed simple directions. Took spray cap off my  big bottle of perfume. Pumped into this little gadget and packed it away. No leakage upon arrival. Sprayed perfume easily. Packed away in toiletry bag. No leakage! Will be giving this as gifts to my traveling friends!!! My hope is that it holds up as it has so far.</li>
            <li> With the perfume bottle I have, it is very tricky to get it in this vial. Plus a lot of it is getting wasted. I would not buy or recommend this as this vial may not fit all types of perfume bottles.</li>
            <li> This atomizer worked great, not leaks or problems, magically easy to fill.  I used it for a three week trip, and my fragrance ran out after 10 days. I guess I thought it would be a bit larger than it was, however this is perfect to sick in my purse, makeup bag, etc.</li>
            <li> To get best value for money my partner and always get the largest sized fragrance bottles that we like, however, this then leaves us with a problem - portability! Hence the rather handy refillable &#x60;perfume spray&#x27; that is in handy size for either a clutch purse or similar bag, or as one reviewer has said when travelling overseas - really useful to have, as it is small enough to be allowed to be carried with you. Great little product.</li>
            <li> I love to carry a fragrance with me for travel, but the large bottles, even a 3 oz,  are just too big. I used this on a trip from FL to CO, in my liquids bag. I did put in  a small plastic bag within (just in case), but no leakage that I noticed. Great idea, easy to use!</li>
            <li> I ordered a cheaper dispenser and got what I paid for - it leaked. This one has been great so far and no leaks. It survived the long airplane flight from the US to Asia in my baggage without a drop leaking!</li>
            <li> Nice but so expensive</li>
            <li> Where has this been all my life!! No more hunting for deals on the travel size of my favorite perfume! I can now just refill this compact sprayer over and over again!  I ordered the black one for my husband to keep one at the office and one in his travel bag and the pretty silver, gold and red ones for all my girlfriends!  Great idea!  Thanks Travalo!!</li>
            <li> It works great. I love not having to carry the whole bottle when I take a trip. It is also perfect to keep in my desk at work.</li>
