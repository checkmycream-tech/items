    <ol>
            <li>The best that I have found on the market!</li>
            <li>Excellent product!</li>
            <li>One of the best on the market.</li>
            <li>Tom&#x27;s toothpaste is awesome and delicious, but I have nothing good to say about this Tom&#x27;s floss, so I&#x27;ll keep this brief:&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t break and does a great job otherwise.  </li>
            <li>This works and tastes great.</li>
            <li>I think the floss is great and would be a perfect choice for most people.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for those with wider contacts.</li>
            <li>This is a good quality floss that doesn&#x27;t snap easily.  </li>
            <li>Have used Tom&#x27;s floss for many years and glad I can get it at a good price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>My favorite floss.  </li>
            <li>so I was delighted to find it available on Amazon through Vitacost, a vitamin supplier I had not been aware of.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a perfect choice for most people but those with tight spacing should give it try with the knowledge that it might not work for you.</li>
            <li>This is a good floss , it doesn&#x27;t shred or fall apart like other flosses and it has a nice spearmint scent, I gave this 2 stars because it doesn&#x27;t work for me  </li>
            <li>The spearmint is very pure and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>Item was readily available and received quickly.</li>
            <li>This leaves you minty-fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>It did leave me with fresh breath.</li>
            <li>This floss is unique because it has a \\&quot;tooth\\&quot; to the flat floss, which creates more friction against the tooth surfaces.</li>
            <li>This excellent flat floss seemed to have been dropped by other sources (health food stores; drugstore.com)</li>
            <li>Used this floss for years and really like it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit thick as my teeth are close together, quality is good though.</li>
            <li>It is so much better at removing food from between teeth than any other floss.  </li>
            <li>It looks more coarse than standard floss.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be able to go back to regular floss after using this.</li>
            <li>could have spent half as much and gotten 30 times more yardage from this&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li>-Pounds 900 Yds (Clear)]]...</li>
            <li>I have always used Glade floss in the past but after the company was sold to P&amp;G it seemed as though the formula changed because it now breaks easily.  </li>
            <li>So many brands are so thin they don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>No artificial flavoring or harsh chemical ingredients.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> and I do have some trouble using it and it tends to shred a little in tight spaces</li>

            <li> It was&#x27;t too bad-leaving just a small amount of wax residue.</li>

            <li> Not happy customer.</li>

            <li> Tom&#x27;s toothpaste is awesome and delicious, but I have nothing good to say about this Tom&#x27;s floss, so I&#x27;ll keep this brief:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s way OVERPRICED.&lt;br /&gt;It SHREDS like Yngwie Malmsteen.&lt;br /&gt;I could have spent half as much and gotten 30 times more yardage from this&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000T7WAN4 South Bend Mono 6 -Pounds 900 Yds (Clear)]]...and it&#x27;s just as \\&quot;anti-plaque\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every floss on the market. This floss is unique because it has a \\&quot;tooth\\&quot; to the flat floss, which creates more friction against the tooth surfaces. It is hard to find in stores, however. I would resort to almost anything to get it because I can&#x27;t go back to regular floss.</li>
            <li> The best that I have found on the market!</li>
            <li> This excellent flat floss seemed to have been dropped by other sources (health food stores; drugstore.com) so I was delighted to find it available on Amazon through Vitacost, a vitamin supplier I had not been aware of.  Item was readily available and received quickly.</li>
            <li> What a delight to find a tape floss.  It is so much better at removing food from between teeth than any other floss.  This is a good quality floss that doesn&#x27;t snap easily.  Excellent product!</li>
            <li> I have always used Glade floss in the past but after the company was sold to P&amp;G it seemed as though the formula changed because it now breaks easily.  In my search for another floss I have read other reviews about Tom&#x27;s floss and the only negative comments I found had to do with the floss being \\&quot;thick\\&quot; and difficult to use for people whose teeth are close together with little space between the teeth.  I have that problem but thought I&#x27;d try the floss because it is sold in our local health food store.  I think the floss is great and would be a perfect choice for most people.  It is quite \\&quot;thick\\&quot; though and I do have some trouble using it and it tends to shred a little in tight spaces but it doesn&#x27;t break and does a great job otherwise.  It&#x27;s a perfect choice for most people but those with tight spacing should give it try with the knowledge that it might not work for you.</li>

            <li> One of the best on the market. Don&#x27;t need to use a lot. Does not slip through your fingers or hurt your fingers like the find stuff</li>
            <li> It looks more coarse than standard floss.  Slightly thicker also.  The spearmint is very pure and refreshing.  No artificial flavoring or harsh chemical ingredients.  I won&#x27;t be able to go back to regular floss after using this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like waxed floss but I thought I would try it in a pinch. It was&#x27;t too bad-leaving just a small amount of wax residue. It did leave me with fresh breath. Much much better than Glide waxed tape which is awful and rips your gums.</li>
            <li> My favorite floss.  I&#x27;m a dental hygienist and I&#x27;ve tried about every floss out there.  It&#x27;s good for those with wider contacts.</li>
            <li> Used this floss for years and really like it.</li>
