            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to cause or trigger breakouts for me, which is always a good thing.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>but this stuff really is good.</li>
            <li>just cpncentrates on what is good.</li>
            <li>This is a good product for moisturizing.</li>
            <li>feels good.  </li>
            <li>This is a good night moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I like this moisturizer and gave it four stars because of its good ingredients and quality, but don&#x27;t try to wear it during the day if you have oily skin.</li>
            <li>but if you use Cerave cleanser (oily skin) then this works out good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really fair</li>
            <li>This is good for my skin.</li>
            <li>I used it all over my face/neck/under eyes w/ good results.</li>
            <li>Otherwise a good moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t look or feel greasy.</li>
            <li>I want to like this because it&#x27;s inexpensive and seems to have some good ingredients.</li>
            <li>May be good for hands and neck.</li>
            <li>This product contains the ingredients that are supposed to be good for my skin to moisturize and reduce aging: ceramides, niacinamide, and hyaluronic acid.  </li>
            <li>The pump rotates to a locked position, also good for travel.</li>
            <li>All CeraVe&#x27;s product are good, I find.</li>
            <li>Feels really good.</li>
            <li>I looked them up, and they&#x27;re known to be good for the skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good lotion that moisturizes without causing any breakouts.</li>
            <li>To me, this lotion works just as good as the neutrogena one.</li>
            <li>It did not absorb into the skin ....to be fair</li>
            <li>This one is soothing, not too greasy, and has good ingredients for your skin.</li>
            <li>As soon as I put this on, I loved it.</li>
            <li>It also FEELS good going on.  </li>
            <li>bought this product based on the price and good reviews.  </li>
            <li>*** makes my skin feel good.</li>
            <li>Not as good as introduced.  </li>
            <li>but this feels so good after my shave, I always remember...</li>
            <li>This keeps my skin so nice and happy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li>and I truly loved it.  </li>
            <li>Good product, like how it feels, not greasy or oily, but moist well.</li>
            <li>I use this day and night because I didn&#x27;t want the sunscreen in it, but this product is really good</li>
            <li>I have used are good and inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t worn makeup in a while and my boyfriend told me I look good waking up in the morning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it now for quite sometime, just to give it a fair chance, but it&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
            <li>dermatologist said this is a good product as well and recommended that I keep using it along with what she has prescribed.</li>
            <li>First things - the price difference makes me really happy, and the difference in my skin is wonderful!</li>
            <li>this was packaged great and this is a wonderful product, first time i used it.</li>
            <li>But, I was impressed with the way the product absorbed into the skin and the residual moisturization.  </li>
            <li>That’s great because their formulas contain outstanding blends of emollients and skin-identical ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have tried a number of evening moisturizers and am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I have since re-ordered the product since I am very pleased with the results I have had using it.</li>
            <li>Great products are not always about price, but a couple of my favorite moisturizers were high-priced</li>
            <li>I had read about this cream yahoo and am very satisfied with it.&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li>but if you stick with it you&#x27;ll be very pleased.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s great from some people, but for me, Cerave was better suited for my skin.</li>
            <li>Works great, glad to see it in a 3 pack.</li>
            <li>Great for even acne-prone or problem skin, as it is very light yet effective.</li>
            <li>Love it...!</li>
            <li>I first learned about CeraVe from my excellent dermatologist.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I really love this moisturizer!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>I love that this doesn&#x27;t have sunscreen added to it!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve almost finished my first bottle of this Cerave pm lotion, and it&#x27;s wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this face cream!</li>
            <li>Love !</li>
            <li>My face has never looked better!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>Love this lotion!</li>
            <li>I love them both!</li>
            <li>I bought this product hoping to fix this problem, and I love it!</li>
            <li>Also, I love the pump!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did!  </li>
            <li>I love Cerave!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>This moisturizer isn&#x27;t scented, it doesn&#x27;t contain a skin irritants, and it certainly lives up to CeraVe&#x27;s excellent reputation.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s an AMAZING moisturizer and helps with lines/wrinkles and also helps mask the ones that I can&#x27;t get rid of..</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s an amazing product.  </li>
            <li>I started using CeraVe after seeing amazing results on my son&#x27;s excema.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing though.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer is light, yet does a great job of moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing product, but I am concerned about the parabens.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and is a great under my foundation</li>
            <li>This lotion is amazing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for months now, its truely amazing.</li>
            <li>Its translucent, a bit watery but kind of gel-like.</li>
            <li>My skin does not react kindly to the change in weather.</li>
            <li>was on two rounds of Accutane so moisturizers are kind of an obsession of mine.</li>
            <li>I tried it under my makeup once because I liked how my skin felt in the morning after a night of wear</li>
            <li>This is the best, gentle moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Nice packaging and is unscented ,  which I like .</li>
            <li>and I was delighted that this product didnt give me even a hint of that gunky feeling that most skin products leave behind.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So gentle, and it&#x27;s packed with excellent ingredients like hyaluronic acid, ceramides and niacinamide.  </li>
            <li>But if you are looking for something unscented, lightweight and without sunscreen, this is nice.</li>
            <li>I liked the reviews, liked the price.</li>
            <li>I had used the CeraVe body lotion and liked it.  </li>
            <li>The lotion is a nice texture and non greasy which is also nice for using as a AM lotion.</li>
            <li>Fragrance-free makes it nice.</li>
            <li>better than day for sure, but still not that great</li>
            <li>I value that kind of testimony.</li>
            <li>Some dermatologists are impressed how much info I know about creams and lotions for oily and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>nice product for evening seems to work well and not have a chemical smell.</li>
            <li>This item was received in perfect condition and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>This was also recommended to me from my dermatologist and its really nice.</li>
            <li>Nice weight lotion for you face.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s affordable, feels nice on my skin, and does not cause breakouts.</li>
            <li>If you have normal skin, I think it may be perfect.</li>
            <li>Very light yet effective.</li>
            <li>May try the day time kind with sunscreen built in - but like the way my skin looks so much - why ruin a good thing!</li>
            <li>Also, the lotion is not very thick and oily, but does its job PERFECTLY.</li>
            <li>It packs a good punch, though, for something so light in texture.  </li>
            <li>and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Excellent product if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This is the best so far I had.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always struggled with my sensitive skin and this product is perfect!</li>
            <li>So far this is the best product for my face eczema.</li>
            <li>perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>By far the best moisturizer I have ever used in my life.</li>
            <li>CeraVe makes a line of products that are excellent for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Perfect for sensitive or irritated skin.</li>
            <li>The great thing is that it absorbs right into the skin, is not greasy and doesn&#x27;t flake off when applying foundation.  </li>
            <li>Having skin issues, Ive tried many products and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Who knew you can get a great product without spending much!</li>
            <li>Not bad but not that good either.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light gel-like cream.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very light.  </li>
            <li>I even use a very light layer under my makeup.</li>
            <li>Very light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light</li>
            <li>got cerave AM &amp; PM because they have very high concentrations of niacinamide and ceramides, which are great for your skin.</li>

            <li>Ok-- I need a richer cream -this one more like lotion.</li>
            <li>Love the way my face feels.</li>
            <li>and I love this</li>

            <li>Always love this lotion.</li>
            <li>This has been the best beauty find of the year for me - I only wish I&#x27;d discovered it sooner.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>totally in love with it...</li>
            <li>I Love</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>My skin is a lot more supple and the color is brighter.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li>, it sits on top of my skin and doesn&#x27;t absorb as well.</li>
            <li>What I like best is that using the PM Lotion, along with CeraVe facial cleanser, seems to have all but cleared up my acne.</li>
            <li>Love this-</li>
            <li>I use the pm only, and in the am also and it is perfect!!</li>
            <li>After I used this product for a week, she remarked how smooth my face looks!</li>
            <li>I love this face lotion.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is just okay.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>many chemicals and parabens in this product.  </li>
            <li>I like this, but don&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this moisturizing lotion.</li>
            <li>The lotion itself is light feeling, kind of a cream/gel hybrid thing.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I use the AM and Pm moisturizing lotions and love them both.</li>
            <li>I love Cerve.</li>
            <li>use CeraVe&#x27;s PM formula during day and at night, because I the &amp;#34;daytime&amp;#34; formula includes sun-tan lotion, which I tend not to need most of the time.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Within 4 days, my husband and I could not believe how much better my skin looked.</li>
            <li>so I bought this thinking it would be ok</li>
            <li>I started using this moisturizer in combination with Rohto Hadalabo Gokujyn Hyaluronic Acid Lotion about a week ago and my skin have never felt smoother or better.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I use that more sparingly and give myself a break by using this in between.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I like the cost too :)</li>
            <li>I use it for my day time lotion, mostly after taking a shower or washing my face.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>I use this product day and night, I&#x27;m so pleased with it.</li>
            <li>and I love that there is no scent.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s why I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Why spend more on all the pricy night creams.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion and use it AM and PM.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love it &amp; use the day moisturizer to</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>It was recommended to me by dermatologist, and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>Love the way it moisturizes my face without making it feel too greasy.</li>
            <li>my face looks fantastic!</li>
            <li>then I guess I&#x27;m ok with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure this might be a lovely product for many,</li>
            <li>and it is much better</li>
            <li>Great product for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>but how many hours will it take to fully absorb into the skin?</li>
            <li>I am thinking maybe its better for someone with drier skin then mine....</li>
            <li>however, none have been more efficacious than cerave.  </li>
            <li>This was recommended by my derm and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully it keeps working :)</li>
            <li>Of course, I was looking to add more to my \\&quot;collection.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s definitely not the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this lotion.</li>
            <li>Ive tried many many moisturizers, and had to eliminate ones with spf</li>
            <li>I love the fact this lotion hydrate my combo type of skin, it&#x27;s moisture,</li>
            <li>Overall, excellent</li>
            <li>love my CeraVe</li>
            <li>that doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts. :-)</li>
            <li>I find my face feels and looks better in the morning.</li>
            <li>I love CeraVe PM b/c</li>
            <li>It works for me better than OTC lotions.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this item.</li>
            <li>I thought it was on sale at duane reade but ended up being more than I thought.</li>
            <li>Also noticed a healthy &amp;#34;glow.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>I can see from the reviews that this is magic for some and for a handful, no idea why, it does encourage pimples etc.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this because everyone loves it</li>
            <li>I have combination skin (but mostly oily)</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been problematic for most of my life.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really, really pleased with it.</li>
            <li>and I have been really pleased with the outcome.  </li>
            <li>If everyone knew what I know about this product now, they&#x27;d never spend $20, $50, $100 or more for a face cream.</li>
            <li>It seems to work better for me on my hands.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I also like the pump style dispenser because it is more sanitary and helps preserve the beneficial additives in the lotion.</li>
            <li>It is okay for me.</li>
            <li>This lotion is simply the best you can buy for its price point.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more like a gel serum than a lotion.</li>
            <li>And I do notice my skin looking better without makeup as well.</li>
            <li>I have had eczema since childhood, and covering up in the wintertime means more skin problems.  </li>
            <li>They ought to be charging more for this cream.  </li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer alottttt alottt.  </li>
            <li>I love this -- the way it feels, the way it does not have scent, the way it goes on and covers.  </li>
            <li>With that said, I really do love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed my skin feels and looks better...</li>
            <li>I use it in the day as well, but since I&#x27;m more on the oily side I can get a bit shiny.  </li>
            <li>It feels slightly better than not putting it on, but it lasts about 3 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it will work better for her.</li>
            <li>This product (CeraVe is supposed to be good, right?)</li>
            <li>/&gt;I have learned that some readily available products in the US are very good substitutes with a decent price point.  </li>
            <li>Very rich and nourishing to the skin.</li>
            <li>This comes highly recommended with a very satisfied CeraVe user!</li>
            <li>This lotion is derma. tested and created to replenish your skins need for hydration (particularly in aging skin),  I am really happy with the results and will buy this product again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my mid-thirties and have noticed that my wrinkles aren&#x27;t progressing nearly as quickly as they were before I started using this product, so I&#x27;m beyond pleased!  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the smell, but that dissipates quick and does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The Cerave line has all the wonderful ingredients as the popular Olay Regenerist products at half the price.  </li>
            <li>It has a light, non-greasy texture, absorbs quickly, but still provides good hydration.</li>
            <li>of the first products I found I loved</li>
            <li>Its very light, which is okay, but on some creams after you apply it your skin feels smooth not the case with this.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, fragrance and irritant free, and it contains a host of really beneficial ingredients for a great price.</li>
            <li>I love the pump, too, which makes it easy to dispense.&lt;br /&gt;NOTE</li>
            <li>Nice feeling, absorbs quickly, but after 4 continous weeks of use</li>
            <li>Quick shipping, nice product.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because it was awarded the best night cream for dry skin 2012 by</li>
            <li>The CeraVe lotion seems to be great for sensitive, combination skin types!</li>
            <li>This is a very smooth, light lotion, almost like a serum, that moisturizes fantastically.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, never had any issues with CeraVe Products, goes on evenly and absorbs quickly!  </li>
            <li>Great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Nothing exciting, it just does what you would expect it to do which is pretty great in my book.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no noticeable smell, which is great for people who are sensitive to scents.</li>
            <li>Ladies love the smooth skin, these are the 2000&#x27;s</li>
            <li>CeraVe PM feels great on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>its an ok product line if you want something cheap in the house to have for guests or want to take this traveling</li>
            <li>Great natural product with an affordable price.</li>
            <li>I used to use Aveda&#x27;s All Sensitive line which was great, but they discontinued it two years ago.</li>
            <li>CeraVe is a great line for people with sensitive skin or eczema, and this product is no exception.  </li>
            <li>My skin&#x27;s been looking brighter and reflecting light better, and not because it&#x27;s oily.</li>
            <li>I really like CeraVe&#x27;s moisturizing lotion (for body), and I&#x27;d heard good things about this face lotion.  </li>
            <li>It really moisture your face and is non-comedonic what is good for my acne prone skin, but it still leave my skin feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>While she was checking the incision area, I asked her if the products were really that good.  </li>
            <li>A very inexpensive moisturizer that gives me good result.</li>
            <li>A good ceramide lotion that is reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended by my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>A nice light-weight moisturizer, I use this in the AM right before my sunblock, and in the pm with a drop or two of argan oil.  </li>
            <li>Docked one star because I&#x27;m pretty sure this won&#x27;t be hydrating enough for NY winters, but this formula is perfect for the humid summers.</li>
            <li>By the way, Cerave makes loads of other products that are excellent as well.  </li>
            <li>Some of the other moisturizers I have use make my face look shinny and glossy and that&#x27;s not the best look at 1am.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to the CeraVe line after hearing many people rave about it and so far, I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
            <li>It goes on and in easily.  </li>
            <li>I could easily wear this under my makeup as an AM, but I chose to apply at night because I use an SPF moisturizer in the morning.</li>
            <li>It even makes my flaking peel off easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to store, and you can twist the cap to lock it to prevent leaks when traveling.</li>
            <li>Best to use it directly after getting out of the shower or washing your face when it can really soak in and prevent dryness from occurring.</li>
            <li>Prior to this i was using cetaphil but have switched to cerave products because they have more emollients in them which is ironically great for my acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t perform miracles but it is easy on my pocketbook and on my skin.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to tolerate a strong fragrance on your face.</li>
            <li>Needed a strong PM moisturizer for after Retin-A application and this one seems to be working well.</li>
            <li>I would have to strongly disagree.  </li>
            <li>My fine lines on my forehead have diminished significantly and my face looks and feels more even toned.  </li>
            <li>I love the CeraVe hydrating cleanser, but this product wasn&#x27;t anything special.</li>
            <li>no sticky or oily feels and it&#x27;s just soak into my skin right away, I choose the PM one, because it&#x27;s more hydrate and more versatile for AM and PM usage.</li>
            <li>I use it in combination with the Clean&amp;Clear persa-gel, and the two have managed to clear my skin up quite nicely!</li>
            <li>it is awesome &amp; leaves my super dry skin moist -</li>
            <li>Best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried, hands down.</li>
            <li>should be fine with this.  </li>
            <li>My pores are minimized and three fine wrinkles disappear as the skin pumps.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and the touch is comfortable, help to keep skin moisty</li>
            <li>I think this one would be fine.</li>
            <li>Rather than a greasy feel, it&#x27;s just a light, water-based, fragrance-free lotion that smoothes on easily.  </li>
            <li>It is a fine lotion for the summertime.</li>
            <li>Light moisturizer and works fine for daytime too.  </li>
            <li>I am very suitable for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>very gentle, and effective, suitable for any type of skin, hydrates skin very well</li>
            <li>Simple and cheap, yet great for my skin.</li>
            <li>Does not irritate sensitive skin, and does an amazing job - you won&#x27;t find a better moisturizer than this at any price.</li>
            <li>Just a simple, great moisturizer---no fancy bells or whistles.</li>
            <li>This CeraVe PM lotion is light and non-greasy.  </li>
            <li>this lotion is light.  </li>
            <li>1 1/2 pumps is pleny, sometimes 1 pump, of this light lotion.  </li>
            <li>Again, I think why this applies so lightly is because of that consistency.  </li>
            <li>The PM formula is light weight, and absorbs well into my skin.</li>
            <li>Being acne prone, it is important to use a non-comedogenic lotion.  </li>
            <li>It is as light as air and does the job.  </li>
            <li>but your face is smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li>So smooth, no longer bumpy, and</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s a pump bottle - clean and sanitary, easy to use, and</li>
            <li>So moisturizing but still light.</li>
            <li>This lotion is unscented and light.</li>
            <li>This lotion is fairly light</li>
            <li>But the body creme is fantastic.</li>
            <li>This light lotion seems job done.</li>
            <li>I tried another night product recently and wasn&#x27;t as happy.</li>
            <li>Goes in smooth, not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>Is light even with the SPF.  </li>
            <li>I understand that this is a popular product, and it was very well reviewed on Beautipedia (with praise for the ingredients, esp niacinamide), but it did not work at all for me.</li>
            <li>CeraVe comes in a light cream, containing alcohol derivatives that seemed so diluted it</li>
            <li>Overall another great product by CeraVe</li>
            <li>using it druing the day instead of PM, find it a bit light for me for night time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s surprisingly light and watery, with a gel-like texture.</li>
            <li>Great basic moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Unscented, light, and smoothing.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive, feels light and never greasy.</li>
            <li>Feelings light and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is light weight, which works well with my oily skin.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic night cream.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel smooth after applying.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light.</li>
            <li>My skin feel like baby smooth after a week of using.</li>
            <li>No scent, light on the skin.</li>
            <li>so far so good, but it does have an odor</li>
            <li>After about a week or so - noticed that my skin actually looked &amp;#34;plumper&amp;#34; (which is a good thing at 44 :)..).</li>
            <li>From the 1st time I applied this product I LOVED it -- immediately made &amp; continues to make my face &amp; neck skin feel sooo soft.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this seemed like it would be a good match,</li>
            <li>What I like most about it is that in addition to feeling great, this moisturizer improves skin with long-term use due to its beneficial ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and can break out easily, this is a nice light oil-free lotion that is non-irritating.</li>
            <li>Also LoVe that it doesn&#x27;t cost major $$$ to own it.  </li>
            <li>My skin cleared up pretty good after using gentle skin cleanser +</li>
            <li>It is smooth, luxurious and does not clog pores; it also absorbs quickly and makes skin feel smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>My skin is easily irritated, so much so that I make sure to check that everything is non-comodogenic.</li>
            <li>price of Cearve is great, i think much more less then the quality itself.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>There are nine more words required - that&#x27;s kinda funny.</li>
            <li>No pretty bottle or advertising, just good stuff!</li>
            <li>Looking up the ingredients, I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li>and I  would say my acne has significantly improved.</li>
            <li>If you need something rich and creamy, this is probably not the product for you - it&#x27;s a lotion</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s worth the price, but does NOT compare to Dermalogica&#x27;s product!</li>
            <li>I love the whole line!</li>
            <li>Rich &amp; nourishing yet absorbs well.</li>
            <li>Best facial lotion out there for anyone even if you have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>the fine lines are improving, my skin is evening out, and it feels nice and soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a teriffic body lotion, super hydrating, lightweight and thankfully fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>Great for healing dry skins</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a clean moisture, if that makes sense--</li>
            <li>So I decided to give this moisturizer a try, as I was looking for a good, cheap and basic moisturizer for day and night.  </li>
            <li>my face feels so clean and moisturized.</li>
            <li>consistency of the lotion is light, and my skin quickly absorbs it.</li>
            <li>I put it on before bed on a clean face.  </li>
            <li>Light, non greasy, wonderfully mild.</li>
            <li>A great moisturizer for face, hands, and any dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Your skin feels supple and clean in the morning.</li>
            <li>I combine using this with the CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser to clean my face morning and night</li>
            <li>skin is dry and this product is great for the price.</li>
            <li>This by far is the best facial lotion that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 59 years old, and I appreciate having this at my most favorite night cream.</li>
            <li>Great lotion for dry skin.</li>
            <li>It is light enough to use as a daytime moisturizer, which is surprising since I have oily skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a nice oil free moisturizer, very gentle and really works.</li>
            <li>A great product, which I use day and night on my dry areas!  </li>
            <li>Great for dry skin!  </li>
            <li>When I smile I have tons of fine lines that were not there before.</li>
            <li>It is very comfortable to use, but moisturizing enough, suitable for use in summer</li>
            <li>it is a light moisturizer and does exactly what is promised!</li>
            <li>Read reviews comparing this to Dermalogica&#x27;s Super Rich Repair moisturizer, at a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li>, they have many good ingredients to improve the health of your skin and hardly any irritants (it&#x27;s fragrance free!).</li>
            <li>A really great moisturiser with higher amounts of ceramide that is generally only found in Elizabeth Arden products.  </li>
            <li>This product applies easily and really moisturizes my skin and reduces appearance of fine lines.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of softening up rough patches of skin without provoking an acne flare-up.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized without having any kind of film or gunkiness on it.</li>
            <li>Unforuntately, I have been suckered by products that are supposed to be good, by ordering them-- only to find out when I get the product at home, that they include parabens.  </li>
            <li>Its good not only on your face, but also at your hands and your knees, where there is bump!</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer so much I use it both in the morning and in the evening.  </li>
            <li>Love this product and the whole CeraVe line.</li>
            <li>This one is slightly better than the am lotion, but not by much.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion - it&#x27;s very lightweight but still hydrating.  </li>
            <li>product goes on smoothly and is quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li>The very next morning my face already felt more smooth and healthy.  </li>
            <li>BETTER than lotions costing 2 or 3 or 4 times as much ...</li>
            <li>But here&#x27;s what really made me fall in love..</li>
            <li>really does more than just moisturize your skin.</li>
            <li>Now, I have found that most PM lotions tend to be on the thicker side and get very greasy which tends to clog my pores and break me out all over within a day or two.  </li>
            <li>I like to keep it in a cool place and put it on after a shower.</li>
            <li>keeps skin smooth, hydrated, and fresh.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not creamy like most night lotions are, I much prefer the daytime one.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, is absorbed quickly, and you can reapply as needed.</li>
            <li>I saw the strong rating on this product and decided to give it a try, since it was also pretty inexpensive compare to dept. store brands (e.g., Estee Lauder, Clinique).</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to many products, but this is fine.</li>
            <li>Great price for ingredients that sell for 3x the cost under other high-end names.</li>
            <li>I will not use it because of these ingredients even though it contains other great ingredients.</li>
            <li>It has helped my fine lines so much!  </li>
            <li>I have oily skin, not too oily but this product makes my skin SUPER oily like how it gets when I apply argan oil on my face.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly with no residue on face.</li>
            <li>This helped  tremendously  for that.</li>
            <li>My face doesn&#x27;t feel greasy after I put it on and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I had mild acne growing up.</li>
            <li>My pores are also getting more visible and I break out with most facial products (cystic acne!</li>
            <li>It is different then the pm lotion which is nice and smooth on the face, it has sun screen in it</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly without being sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li>I actually stumbled upon this product after reading an interview of a famous person that said this was one of their favorite products.</li>
            <li>At times I have sensitive skin, depending on what I&#x27;m trying out to battle wrinkles, but have had absolutely NO reaction to this awesome product!!  </li>
            <li>However, it packs a tremendous moisturizing punch.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and sealed package.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly into the skin and it creates a protective barrier on the skin.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t recommend CeraVe Moisturizing Lotion, more highly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a miracle put it on at night wake up with healed skin any kind of dryness or cracked skin due to blemishes hands down the best</li>
            <li>Very nice, very inexpensive moisturizing facial lotion.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle and moisturizing!</li>
            <li>I love putting it on because it reminds me of Clinique&#x27;s Dramatically Different Moisturizing Gel--it is a wonderfully lightweight gel and makes my skin feel refreshed instead of heavy.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much to go a long way, so it lasts for a good while.</li>
            <li>This glides on so easily application is quick and it keeps my face very moisturized</li>
            <li>Over the years, I&#x27;ve found some that I like better than others, but I still feel the need to try out new stuff that I hear about.</li>
            <li>this is my first time trying this product-not sure on how much I like it yet.  </li>
            <li>Admittedly, I have very sensitive skin, but there are many products I can and do use.  </li>
            <li>I check EWG for most of the products I use, this lotion has a danger rating of 3 out of 10 (which is good, very few products have a rating of 0).</li>
            <li>It only took two nights for me to fall in love with it!</li>
            <li>It has a water-y feel and glides on smoothly, my skin absorbs it quickly and it hydrates my skin very well.</li>
            <li>However, unlike Clinique&#x27;s famous DDMG that I used to use back when I had super oily skin, this moisturizer is great for my dry-combination skin and probably suitable for most other skin types except very dry.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, which is nice, but I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>For the awesome price I would certainly recommend that anyone at least gives it a try.</li>
            <li>Never have a reaction, goes on smooth and moisturizes gently.  </li>
            <li>Amazing lotion for my skin that is often red and irritated from lupus!</li>
            <li>Great non oily lotion that does not feel heavy on your face.</li>
            <li>I do alternate with Renova which gives me amazing results</li>
            <li>I am still looking for a product that can calm the redness without compounding it.</li>
            <li>absorb very well, smooth .like</li>
            <li>I use the cetaphil normal to oily wash though, it&#x27;s be pretty good thus far.</li>
            <li>Light and non-greasy yet intensely moisturizing.</li>
            <li>My skin is feeling great and it is not too heavy.</li>
            <li>This is such a nice texture.</li>
            <li>I think I read about this on Reddit, and have been looking for an affordable, but useful face lotion.  </li>
            <li>I also own the version with SPF, and the consistency of that version is different from this one.  </li>
            <li>I will still occasionally use my go to night treatments - Vitamin E and olive oil if my skin really needs a moisture boost, but this is really good.</li>
            <li>Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>My acne has actually cleared up a lot and more importantly my skin tone has evened out from all the scars I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i switched to something more natural.</li>
            <li>After putting this stuff on (after washing with sulfur soap) my face feels much more moist and really soft.</li>
            <li>Works for me my life partner loved it may be ordering more soon would like larger bottle if possible.</li>
            <li>Face feels so soft after rinsing in the morning :)</li>
            <li>For the price, it is certainly worth the try.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Ceramides, Hyaluronic acid, and niacinamide all in one moisturizer is a rare find.</li>
            <li>My favorite night cream so far.</li>
            <li>Its fantastically moisturizing yet light as air, and actually makes your skin better and healthier -so</li>
            <li>I figured it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer, I have sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>Wow I love the texture of this stuff.</li>
            <li>This is the second time I&#x27;m ordering this moisturizer, I also own one of their body lotions.</li>
            <li>my opinion, It&#x27;s well worth the $$.</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s kinda pricey, it&#x27;s so well worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been researching ingredients on skincare and kept reading how niacinamide is great for your skin, especially for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This is a nice basic moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try, it&#x27;s not too expensive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted something that was good for sensitive skin, even though I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for oily skin because I woke up with minimal oil on my face.</li>
            <li>Works great, I&#x27;d suggest taking one a day at first if you have a more sensitive subject</li>
            <li>But if you are OK with a light moisturizer that soaks right into the skin giving just enough moisture and leaves no oily residue feeling, this is for you.</li>
            <li>In my other review of the Cerave Moisturizing Lotion, I mentioned that I also use this facial moisturizer and that I am totally satisfied and happy that I switched over from Aveeno.  </li>
            <li>its a very light formula, it absorbs fast and so far no bad reactions</li>
            <li>Super mild on your skin and very hydrating as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried different products to calm it down (without prescriptions) but hadn&#x27;t found the perfect solution.</li>
            <li>I saw results right away.  </li>
            <li>The right product at the right time.</li>
            <li>but this plumped my skin right up</li>
            <li>It comes in a travel-friendly pump bottle that is just the right size and structure for bringing on an airplane if you need to (you can lock the pump by turning it 90 degrees).</li>
            <li>This is just right for night time cream.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t break my skin out and gives me just the right amount of moisture that I need.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, sort of pearlescent and with the right content of niacinamide (~5%) and lots of ceramides.</li>
            <li>It always makes my face look like the life has been sucked right out.  </li>
            <li>it gives you the right amount of hydration for your face.</li>
            <li>It absorbed quickly and made my face feel soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>While this one doesn&#x27;t pack enough punch to use alone during the dry winter, it is good during the warmer, more humid months.</li>
            <li>I bought the body &amp;#34;Moisturizing Cream&amp;#34; from CeraVe at the exact same time I bought this, and I liked it.</li>
            <li>The skin there is very sensitive and easily irritated.</li>
            <li>Use it after shower and will keep you soft and you will feel clean!</li>
            <li>I past it right by all because it didn&#x27;t have the fancy labels or attractive boxes</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s great for dry skin but oily skin people, steer clear.</li>
            <li>I have skin problems and this works very well in keeping it in check, as I have a tendency to dry out on my cheeks and so far so good!</li>
            <li>This seems to help protect my skin so that I can use makeup without a problem -- although I rarely need it because my skin is so pretty now.</li>
            <li>Has not clogged me yet and have been using this for about 3 weeks :o :)</li>
            <li>The container is small and the head can turn to lock, so it&#x27;s great for travel.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn like other night creams, no scent, feels pretty good.</li>
            <li>It does a nice job, and doesn&#x27;t break out my sensitive skin like many other products have.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I needed in an overnight cream at the right price.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy, and although it has not turned back the hands of time, I am sure it is doing something useful.  </li>
            <li>Neutrogena always makes my face burn and Cetaphil does when it is in this kind of dry state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non-iritating, non-greasy, unscented and effective for moderately dry skin.</li>
            <li>This also effectively takes care of dry skin resulting from swimming in chlorinated water.  </li>
            <li>It brought back moisture to my face instantly and when I woke up this morning, my face looks GREAT..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure with a few more applications they will be non existent.</li>
            <li>If you suffer from super dry skin this is a great facial lotion for any time of day (despite the pm label).</li>
            <li>To be fair, I do have somewhat sensitive facial skin, as this has happened to me before, but NEVER to this degree!</li>
            <li>Well I decided to give it a try and do what in my mind seemed very counterproductive, as I started to use regularly moisturizers and drinking water regularly my skin balanced out beautifully.  </li>
            <li>I think the price is also very reasonable.</li>
            <li>and it is very gentle on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>Unlike some other nighttime moisturizers, it&#x27;s not gloppy or gooey, just lovely and smooth.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like lotions where I have to stick my hand in the big, open jar, so this is also nice in packaging and easy to travel with.  </li>
            <li>I guess a good moisturizer is just a good moisturizer with one not much better than another, other than</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to everyone!!</li>
            <li>;)&lt;br /&gt;My issue?</li>
            <li>Same product, better price.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I could literally feel the moisture being restored on the first application.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty shiny.</li>
            <li>I use this in conjunction with The CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser at nights and I love it.</li>
            <li>Keeps the face smooth and moisturized and clear looking.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion, plan to use it for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li>I have always been hesitant to try this because I already have pretty oily skin</li>
            <li>first tried it out at me dermatologist, when in for acne treatments</li>
            <li>since then this is the ONLY moisturizer I buy, I have tried so many and this is the only that helps me  and does not irritated my skin giving me more breakouts, it says pm</li>
            <li>no complains yet except that this in the only place i can find it at an ok price</li>
            <li>I know the exact amount to put on my face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We will be buying more of it later on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s helped my skin so much!</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin soft, smooth and doesn&#x27;t cause irritation or breakouts.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it consistently for about 3 years.  </li>
            <li>If someone was dealing with extra dryness or eczema on the face this might not be enough but might be the next best thing if you don&#x27;t want something greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>I have been using this facial lotion 2x a day for 5 months and it has become my favorite.</li>
            <li>It is a bit greasy at first but then soaks in.</li>
            <li>I had tried many products, including homemade ones using shea butter and various oils, but nothing works as well as CeraVe.</li>
            <li>Also please be aware that the cleanser you are using can also be stripping your face and not have any thing to do with the product, many gentile cleansers exist if thats your issue such as cetaphil.</li>
            <li>I really like this face lotion!</li>
            <li>At first I thought my sheets needed washing, but after sleuthing it turned out it was the lotion.</li>
            <li>I even prefer it to some higher priced department store brands.</li>
            <li>I wish I would have researched the ingredients first.  </li>
            <li>It makes my face soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I use the AM daily and love this product; therefore, when I found out there is a PM moisturizing, I had to try it.</li>
            <li>This product is the only CeraVe product that I can give even an OK rating to.</li>
            <li>so glad that I finally found out about</li>
            <li>We both love the foaming facial wash (it stays in the bathroom), and now we&#x27;re fighting over this moisturizer!  </li>
            <li>I have used so many different moisturizers and this one is no doubt one anyone should have in their repertoire.</li>
            <li>and my face was still soft and smooth with no greasy feel in my T-Zone area.  </li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t seen too many if any commercial for it.  </li>
            <li>I had the first go-round.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s often out of stock at my local stores, so I&#x27;m glad to get on Amazon.</li>
            <li>ok but moisturizing enough in the winter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty bummed that it didn&#x27;t work out for me.  </li>
            <li>CeraVe is the only face wash/moisturizer that my daughter and I are able to use.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be buying some more after I run out.</li>
            <li>Tried it once more with the same result.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty affordable compared to Olay niacinamide product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Actually, it has improved my skin in general, but I&#x27;m really delighted to have eczema under control.  </li>
            <li>get lotion this brand was highly recommended by my dermatologist!!</li>
            <li>I bought this face lotion after researching so many different products.  </li>
            <li>This one is very light and kind to my delicate skin!</li>
            <li>This facial moisturizer is a very good option for normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li>Exactly what one wants from a moisturizer, right?  </li>
            <li>By the next morning my dry patches on my cheeks were diminished greatly, the redness in my face was almost gone</li>
            <li>Less oily than other moisturizers I&#x27;ve used but probably not the best in that department.</li>
            <li>It seems to be a very nourishing cream and feels light, not heavy.</li>
            <li>If that much change happened in one night, I have no doubt that it can only get better.</li>
            <li>My 16 year old used some and the next day asked for a bottle of her own.</li>
            <li>Really nice, basic nightime lotion that won&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any special disease, just somewhat sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I would even use this lotion as my primary day lotion as well (as long as I could supplement with adequate sun block protection.)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what is this lotion for because I haven&#x27;t seen any positive difference on my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight --- and fragrance free, as with other CeraVe products.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty much gone.</li>
            <li>and this stuff is as good if not better.</li>
            <li>I really like the adjustable top that ensures I only get exactly as much lotion as I need.</li>
            <li>I would say this works just as good as La Mer at a 10th of the cost and no more breakouts.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so natural and light for sensitive skin but yet have powerful nutritions feed my skin.  </li>
            <li>I hoped that this would be a good facial lotion for my sensitive skin, but it really was a complete dud.</li>
            <li>It sinks in SUPER quickly, so you need to rub it in quickly and use about 2-3 pumps for your whole face.</li>
            <li>The product was 100% fresh and new.</li>
            <li>It has been terrific and this comes after I have used some of the higher end skin care lines where moisturizers cost around $70 (on the cheap end).</li>
            <li>Inexpensive and easy to apply, especially when you just want to go to bed!</li>
            <li>I have been using this every night for years, but it&#x27;s not always easy to find at my local Target or CVS.</li>
            <li>product absorbs into the skin quickly leaving soft and smoothe skin with NO oily residue.</li>
            <li>It may not been strong enough for winter time though</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t cause break out for my sensitive skin, which is pretty rare.</li>
            <li>Sometimes my dry skin is very itchy and most moisturizers can sting.  </li>
            <li>After use it more than one month, I think is helping my skin, AM version is too heavy for me, PM cream absorbs quick.</li>
            <li>Its nice bc my face feels hydrated not too tight or oily,</li>
            <li>This is perfect for summer nights, but for people with super dry skin, especially in the winter, I would advise you pair this up with a light skin oil to boost the moisture if this isn&#x27;t heavy enough for you.</li>
            <li>I have never found a good night time moisturizer as I only use olive oil, coconut oil, and/or argan oil on my face to moisturize day and night and since it&#x27;s winter and the air has changed and much cooler, my face changed alot as well, being flakey and dry!</li>
            <li>It helped with the rosacea problem I sometimes experienced and cleared up some patches of dried out/hyperpigmented skin from a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; face wash I used that brutalized my skin a while back.</li>
            <li>This seller has always sent me the real stuff as well.</li>
            <li>For this to be a PM moisturizer, I found it to be much lighter than CeraVe in the tub and one of the lightest PM lotions I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing but for oily skin, it&#x27;s TOO moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have any antioxidants or skin-improving ingredients, but I use it with a serum, so that doesn&#x27;t matter so much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing without clogging pores.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of moisturizing without irritating.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, CeraVe, and</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t irritate my acne-prone skin, and provides much needed moisture without being too heavy/greasy.</li>
            <li>, I recomended this because is really what I was expecting to receive.</li>
            <li>but it really cleans you out and makes you feel lighter</li>
            <li>It is very moist and makes me feel youthful.</li>
            <li>I purchased this after reading all the reviews and was really looking forward to it.  </li>
            <li>it so much</li>
            <li>I use a ton of it because I like how it makes it feel so much.</li>
            <li>I really like Cerave products.  </li>
            <li>Gee, thanks.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a gentle, moisturizer with no sunscreen for nighttime use.  </li>
            <li>However, As much as I do like the feel of it (and the price)</li>
            <li>won&#x27;t make you break out, goes on thin, great for summer.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommended if you have a case of eczema in the winter!</li>
            <li>I have really oily skin in the summer</li>
            <li>It is very hydrating.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>Non-irritating and very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>I use it every two days trying to not give so much oil to my face.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy and absorbs very well.  </li>
            <li>and it was light enough to handle the humidity.</li>
            <li>and I really haven&#x27;t noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper than some of the products out there.</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care how it works at this point.  </li>
            <li>I really like CeraVe, recommended by my doctor.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I use a cerave body lotion that I really like....</li>
            <li>I really like this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to reviewers</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than buying it in the store.</li>
            <li>Gentle on my skin and works well with medication my dermatologist prescribed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lighter weight moisturizer than I&#x27;m used to, but it has been working very well.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>and it really worked wonders for me.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li>It does not require much.  </li>
            <li>I really like the CeraVe products</li>
            <li>It is very non-irritating and not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>It has really improved my skin, may take some time</li>
            <li>I thought it sounded like a sensible product and the cost is reasonable.  </li>
            <li>I use it during the day also and I have really fry skin.</li>
            <li>Really like this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I have very acne-prone skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to not apply niacinamide and vitamin C at the same time though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I really recommend using this product and vitamin C together.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really moisturizing but not oily.  </li>
            <li>However, I do really like to put it on the apples of my cheeks where I have a touch of rosacea.  </li>
            <li>It feels very soothing</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing, keeps skin moisturized all day/night.</li>
            <li>It absorbs super quick and somehow leaves my skin feeling dry within 5 min.</li>
            <li>Used more expensive, but this is just as effective.  </li>
            <li>CeraVe is modestly priced and certainly has all the right ingredients.</li>
            <li>Once I started using it, it was clearly better than my old facial moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I would give good grades if it weren&#x27;t for the slow poison of the parabens that are contained within the product.  </li>
            <li>I learned about it from my dermatologist and was happy to find that it&#x27;s not very expensive at approximately $15/bottle.  </li>
            <li>My skin has acted very calm overall, despite a very stressful month.  </li>
            <li>I mostly get oily skin, mild acne and blackheads in my nose and chin area, especially the parentheses - for lack of a better term - from the corners of my nose, around the corners of my mouth, and down the outside crease of my chin.</li>
            <li>not bad however if you have sensitive skin be careful no breakouts but did burn my skin a bit it is just really strong</li>
            <li>We finally stops that two months ago and his face is been great since using a plain cleanser in the morning and Persagel to spot treat, and then wash with 10% Pan oxyl (also dermatologist recommendation) in the evening followed by this Cerave PM lotion.  </li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive face, and pretty much any moisturizer will make me break out or</li>
            <li>It offers the right amount of moisture to my face without leaving it feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>Most of my dry patches were gone in the morning, some that were a bit more severe were slightly lingering.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a bargain buy, which is why it&#x27;s popular on Reddit&#x27;s SkincareAddiction, rated highly on Beautypedia, and one of the best-sellers of facial moisturizers on Amazon (which is always changing but it was at the time of my purchase)!</li>
            <li>vitamin b3 can cause an allergic reaction in certain people so make sure your not allergic to it.the only thing missing in this lotion is antioxidants which I easily remedy by mixing some acure marula oil in with this</li>
            <li>I never break out from this, as I do with many other products.  </li>
            <li>no irritation like many other lotions.</li>
            <li>I have Rosacea and many of the other lotions irritate it.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation and keeping my skin hydrated better than some other lotions I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many other products and they don&#x27;t seem to have that effect on me.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight and I am left feeling clean.</li>
            <li>I have quite sensitive, reactive skin, and using this consistently has really improved my complexion.</li>
            <li>I normally wear Murad or Darphin moisturizers at night, which are available only at Neimans or Nordstrom, but I use CeraVe during the day.</li>
            <li>Both are great, especially if you already had some skin problems in the past.</li>
            <li>I use Tazorac, a very strong prescription Retin A cream that I sometimes apply a bit too heavily.</li>
            <li>However I did find that it still slightly tingles my sensitive spots, but I&#x27;ve tried every other thing out there, all of which burn and irritate, and this one is the best I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>May not be good for extremely dry skin but normal to dry skin</li>
            <li>Nothing too special, but it will work if you need a basic moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I was at my dermatologist&#x27;s office for a check on a tiny odd mole they&#x27;d removed (good news...</li>
            <li>Strong recommendation here, especially for those with sensitive or problem skin.</li>
            <li>Am I the only one with a drawer or cabinet full of skin care products?  </li>
            <li>Since then I&#x27;ve tried many that are without spf and claim to be for dry sensitive skin, but they all still irritate my sensitive spots and don&#x27;t really moisturize my skin as i feel it becoming dry in one or two hours again, or</li>
            <li>It feels very light and absorbs quickly, which I normally like in a regular facial lotion, but it seems a little too light for a PM lotion.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is hands down my favorite moisturizer</li>
            <li>CeraVe has proven itself to not cause new zits for me, when I&#x27;ve been sure that other face creams ~ though not greasy at all ~ have.</li>
            <li>My makeup goes on more evenly and smoothly where as before it was looking powedery and settling into the fine lines and making the dry patches look worse.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find such a great mixture in the more expensive department store brands!  </li>
            <li>Bought a rotating facial brush and some Aveeno Ultra Calming cleanser and lotion, that I quickly returned after my skin felt like it was on fire after 1 use.  </li>
            <li>I made the switch to this from a heavier night cream I was using after I started breaking out (most likely pregnancy related).  </li>
            <li>The main difference between this and the AM formulation is that the PM does not have sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>I use it before bed, the skin feels smooth and soft  next day I wake up.</li>
            <li>once I realized it was the main culprit making my skin burn while applying moisturizer.</li>
            <li>my main concern is that i have combination skin type which leads me to the breakouts from using inappropriate products.  </li>
            <li>As I get older my skin is changing.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that breaks out from everything...until now!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended for anyone.</li>
            <li>But I highly recommend the PM.</li>
            <li>This stuff has Propylparaben in it which is highly toxic and causes endocrine disruption.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use CeraVe, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin prone to  breakouts from certain products - but this is just soothing.</li>
            <li>, in the store cost a little more</li>
            <li>Very nice product a little bit pricey compare to other drugstore product</li>
            <li>I have used products with hyaluronic acid and even salicylic acid Clean &amp; Clear moisturizer, with no facial irritation, or breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i normally spend high $$ on my creams until i found this</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much of a smell, and it dries completely clear unlike sperm.</li>
            <li>I waited til my first bottle was almost empty before reviewing because so often a first impression of a product doesn&#x27;t stand up to continual use but this product really has.  </li>
            <li>So far this product is working very well.  </li>
            <li>Overall a nice lotion that doesn&#x27;t have much fragrance to it, and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or slimy.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use much at all on it.</li>
            <li>Not only does CeraVe help to calm a flare up - it also prevents them.</li>
            <li>I use this at night, and my  nose is actually normal in the morning.  </li>
            <li>So I gave it a try as it costs 1/10 what my normal creams do.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s with &amp;#34; normal skin&amp;#34; and not a lot  of wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>Its silky, normal consistence, and has no smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a full year since our daughter has had a flare up, and while not that long for me-</li>
            <li>This is definitely a solid product worth trying out.</li>
            <li>I adore the cleanser for normal to oily skin.</li>
            <li>Target also carries this, but it&#x27;s a few dollars more there.</li>
            <li>Alas, I loved the price.</li>
            <li>I live in a very dry climate and it was too light for me.</li>
            <li>decent moisturizer and no reaction from my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and this is a sheer light coverage and sinks right into my skin.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a nice enough night moisturizer, however it creates an odd smell.  </li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t super sensitive, but I&#x27;m just trying to avoid aggravating it as much as possible while I deal with (what is now)</li>
            <li>/&gt;does left and right of the face</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s silky in texture (very similar to a primer), absorbs quickly, is not greasy and really makes my skin soft and smooth, and most importantly, it doesn&#x27;t break me out, which so many other facial moisturizers I&#x27;ve used in the past have done.  </li>
            <li>This fragrance-free moisturizer is highly recommended for sensitive or rosacea-affected skin, hence the high rating.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other facial moisturizers, but CeraVe PM is the very first product I&#x27;ve found that actually keeps my dryness under control.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not able to spend a ton of money like so many gals do these days on beauty creams, but  I found this one really decent &amp; does not break the bank for me.</li>
            <li>I found this to be extremely hydrating and suprisingly extremely light.  </li>
            <li>Cheap compared to other ones out there that contains hyaluronic.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist had recommended it and I cannot live without it :0)</li>
            <li>I live in Vegas</li>
            <li>This is a new product</li>
            <li>I do not like to pay for ingredients that are bad for the body, even though the company finds them cheap and good</li>
            <li>This is one of only a few lotions I can use that both effectively moisturizes and doesn&#x27;t cause me to eventually break out.  </li>
            <li>This must be ordered with a more expensive purchase to ship for free with Prime, but Amazon&#x27;s price is quite a bit cheaper than Walgreens or Walmart.</li>
            <li>an innocent little thing!).  </li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>They make your skin very soft.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive and acne prone skin and</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>For reference, I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This moisturizer has helped clear and balance my skin, used in combination with a time-released benzoyl peroxide [AcneFree qfoam!].</li>
            <li>, I had facial flushing and my face felt hot to touch.</li>
            <li>I do go without make-up and my skin tone feels more even, although I started other skin care products (recommended by Reddit) at the same time.  </li>
            <li>I emailed them a second time basically ranting and raving and they finally got back to me and told me that Cerave is safe to use under the eyes</li>
            <li>It contains ingredients found in many more expensive, department store products such as ceramides, niacinamide and hyaluronic acid.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend this moisturizer to anyone with sensitive and problematic skin!</li>
            <li>So far, I like it!</li>
            <li>I have been using it nightly for a couple of months and see no more difference in my skin than using the Nivea cream that I have used for many years.</li>
            <li>I read about this online; like many of the other reviewers, I&#x27;ve had various skin issues over the years and have become something of a skin care junkie/expert.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin feeling soft and not greasy!</li>
            <li>Okay, I&#x27;m not sure if it was just me</li>
            <li>I usually put this on before bed on top of my retin a</li>
            <li>It is not heavy (even under makeup!)</li>
            <li>I tried a few high quality and high $$ products and finally gave Cerave products a try after reading many recommendations on the web.  </li>
            <li>I am a little concerned about some of the ingredients but as long as it&#x27;s not past hazardous 5</li>
            <li>I have per the years used so many expensive products that its hard to accept something this cheap to be better</li>
            <li>The Dermatologist prescribed me a very strong topical acne cream and gave me a few samples of this product to put on in case my skin started peeling/flaking.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend this lotion to anyone with skin issues, young or old.</li>
            <li>This is half the price for twice the product and works fantastic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&amp;#34;CeraVe’s first official facial moisturizer isn’t too far removed from their well-formulated body moisturizers.</li>
            <li>My husband made the comment recently that my face is so soft and pretty.  </li>
            <li>After reading all the positive reviews I decided to give this product a try for my recent Rocasea flair up.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a heavy moisturizer or even something that is super moisturizing for very thirsty skin, you may not want to get this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s NOT a super heavy moisturizer, it&#x27;s very light, but even though it&#x27;s light, it still makes the skin feel properly moisturized after application.</li>
            <li>I have mild to moderate rosacea with frequent flares of red bumps on my face.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed a clear difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance since I started using the CeraVe PM lotions.</li>
            <li>but I have not so clear skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;First off, my skin is not that sensitive.</li>
            <li>Hasn&#x27;t irritated my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Neither too light nor too heavy for my combination skin.</li>
            <li>I have incredibly sensitive rosacea skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;*4 stars because I could not put the lotion near my lip--due to the smell giving me a head ache.</li>
            <li>So, busy consumer does not suspect.  </li>
            <li>I use it day and night and near my eyes.  </li>
            <li>It lives up to its claims, and leaves my face soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li>After applying, my face feels velvety soft, and when I wake up in the morning, my face is still moisturized.</li>
            <li>I went to a dermatologist to examine pimples on this 78 year old face, after treatment the doctor suggested I use Cerave AM and PM and the cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I have insanely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This is not heavy at all and absorbs completely.</li>
            <li>Also I am sensitive to how a lotion makes my skin feel, and this lotion allows my skin to feel like it can breathe....</li>
            <li>yr old son uses it as well as my husband</li>
            <li>it was for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Maybe my skin is too sensitive.</li>
            <li>I have fairly sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It turns out, many common face lotions aren&#x27;t, go figure.</li>
            <li>My face always feel so soft and in the summer my face is protected by the sun.</li>
            <li>(they&#x27;re near the end of the ingredients list), but there is NO valid, scientific evidence that these compounds are harmful (research it yourself if you don&#x27;t believe me).  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and use the CeraVe moisturizer everywhere except on my face</li>
            <li>price is reasonable ($14 at Target), and the packaging is simple.</li>
            <li>I use CeraVe because it&#x27;s the only thing that really works to soothe the redness from my rosacea.  </li>
            <li>It is considered a non comedogenic and gentle to use on skin for a daily basis.</li>
            <li>I was using neutrogena sensitive skin oil-free moisturizer to help with any dryness before I applied any makeup on face.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I do have combination skin and it  is also sensitive...</li>
            <li>It soaks in and makes your skin feel naturally hydrated.</li>
            <li>I am 56 years old, but have had a problem with zits continuing all the way through my life so far...  </li>
            <li>While it hasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;cured&amp;#34; the SD, combined with gentle cleansing and keeping my paws off, my chin is vastly improved.</li>
            <li>A couple of years ago, I started seeing a dermatologist for still having acne at 35yrs old.  </li>
            <li>My 12 year old daughter is also fighting some early acne and learning how to care for her skin.  </li>
            <li>Nearly every day, she stashes this moisturizer in her room</li>
            <li>With all the thugs I do to exfoliate and renew I&#x27;m 32 years old and this is my go to for a night of guaranteed moisture.</li>
            <li>It does not make my face feel sticky or heavy, and creates a smooth surface for makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product dramatically irritated my skin (inflamed, sensitive to touch, etc.)</li>
            <li>my adult acne.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and is glowing.</li>
            <li>Early 20s sensitive acne-prone</li>
            <li>It leaves my face soft &amp; supple without over drying or breaking out.</li>
            <li>No redness, itching, no trouble at all.</li>
            <li>I am 56 years old.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs almost completely and doesn&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a lotion that wouldn&#x27;t aggravate my sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I cannot attest to the anti aging clams of this product as I am quite young, but I do like it quite a lot.</li>
            <li>Not greasy but leaves skin well moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>I feel like all the PM creams are a bajillion dollars and promise to wake up looking 15 years old again.</li>
            <li>This is really good lotion, I&#x27;ve always been used expensive stuff for my face but to my surprise</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more lightweight (but still very moisturizing), it absorbs well, never feels greasy, and I have never experienced any sort of a burning sensation with it.</li>
            <li>Many popular moisturizers have strong scents which I find unpleasant and irritating.</li>
            <li>Cerave proves that great products doesn&#x27;t necessarily need fancy packaging or other expensive whatnot.</li>
            <li>It is light and silky and makes the skin on your face very soft, and it lasts even though just a small amount is needed.</li>
            <li>It is a gel cream formula, that sinks right into the skin.  </li>
            <li>This one just sinks right into your skin and stays there.  </li>
            <li>But I have pretty dry skin</li>
            <li>i can put this light lotion all over my face, neck, and under eyes along w/ my other nightly prescribed acne facial regiment, it does not leave my face greasy.</li>
            <li>The product is light, with a very faint but pleasant smell and it blends into my skin unlike any other moisturizer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through several bottles of this and highly recommend it for those of you with sensitive skin or who use a retinoid product.</li>
            <li>After an extensive research I found that this product it&#x27;s simple enough, meaning free of harsh chemicals, and does the job just right in moisturizing my skin overnight.</li>
            <li>My skin is dry and sensitive, but CeraVe isn&#x27;t irritating, soaks in quickly, and leaves my skin soft, smooth, and well-hydrated.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not sure it will fit the bill.</li>
            <li>Have tried several face moisturizers in the last few years, and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s helped calm down the redness and helped with breakouts.</li>
            <li>I switched off all creams except bare bones clinique dramtically different lotion for about 3 days to give my skin time to calm down and return to normal.  </li>
            <li>I used to have relatively normal skin, but at 28, I now have sensitive combination skin (oily t-zone, flaky on other parts, and normal around the cheeks), and it also has redness.</li>
            <li>: they have new packaging, it doesn&#x27;t look like the picture (above) anymore.</li>
            <li>max is what I get when I try a new facial cream.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do much for my dry winter skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I would recommend this for anyone that wants a basic facial lotion, even if they have oily skin</li>
            <li>This is one of those so called drugstore creams you pay less for what they are really worth.</li>
            <li>skin is not sensitive but it is very easy to get white heads and small bumps from some types of lotions.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see any major differences in my skin after using this.</li>
            <li>you can find it at any major retailer e.g. walmart, target, cvs, etc..  </li>
            <li>This was the first lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried that actually moisturized my skin and got rid of the dry flaky patches on my face.  </li>
            <li>If anyone out there is considering using this product, I would be very careful and test it out first.</li>
            <li>like it when my skin is dry, but I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to give it a full review.</li>
            <li>Many companies, as in Johnson and Johnson, have taken parabens out due to the cries and complaints of customers--mothers complained so much to J&amp;J that they finally took them out.  </li>
            <li>Very inexpensive compared to all the other less useful stuff on the market.  </li>
            <li>I use this and the Am SPF 30 because I have eczema and also because these creams have amazing expensive ingredients like ceramides.</li>
            <li>I have extremely dry skin (dry patches on cheeks and forehead) and my T-Zone (nose &amp; inbetween my eyes) gets slightly greasy at times, mostly from products (makeup, creams, lotions, etc.).  </li>
            <li>know I won&#x27;t be purchasing the item again because of the flushing and a couple of breakouts, when my skin had been clear prior.  </li>
            <li>As long as I use Cetephil gentle and Cerave facial lotion I have cured this problem.  </li>
            <li>So, perhaps I&#x27;m just sensitive to the ingredient, because niacinamide is supposed to do the opposite --- decrease redness and even out skin</li>
            <li>I have occasional eczema and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Now if only I can get rid of those old spots.  </li>
            <li>Apparently the formula had as well.</li>
            <li>This is marketed towards those with sensitive skin, but something in it makes my gf&#x27;s skin break out in red bumps</li>
            <li>I will be back to update in a month or so to let you know how my face is doing and how it reacts to this product as my face is sensitive</li>
            <li>and it barely did anything</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re barely noticeable after ONE time of using this.</li>
            <li>Long story short, I have almost finished my first bottle (already bought the second).</li>
            <li>I currently use Cerave AM moisturizing lotion so this was a natural.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin, but I love the fact that CeraVe PM doesn&#x27;t have any potentially irritating ingredients such as fragrances or dyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It actually moisturizes (for real), goes on easy, doesn&#x27;t leave our faces feeling like we have crap left on them, and the price is very right!  </li>
            <li>It moisturizes your face for a pretty long time and doesn&#x27;t leave a dry or sticky feeling.  </li>
            <li>I really like it, especially as it is so hard to find a moisturizer without a sunblock (many sunblocks bother me).</li>
            <li>I used Cerave without incident for about 6 months when I began to notice it was becoming very hard to find.</li>
            <li>In addition to numerous skin-identical ingredients, it contains a generous amount of the cell-communicating ingredient niacinamide, which offers multiple benefits.</li>
            <li>but I bought this last night and tried it last night and WOW</li>
            <li>My doctor ran a skin test with common household chemicals, and found out I am extremely allergic to Methylchloroisothiazolinone (MCI)/Methylisothiazolinone (MI), which can be found in most household cleaners, make-up, shampoo/conditioners and body cleansers.</li>
            <li>Although 3 oz. seems a bit small for the price, I find the product to be worth it, and one upside of this size is that you can travel with it.  </li>
            <li>I live in the desert and it works well enough for our dry climate, and used it while on vacation in Florida</li>
            <li>and I would say slightly greasy (just slightly), but nothing that a light powder won&#x27;t take the sheen off of during the day.</li>
            <li>During this harsh winter, I paired it up with Maracuja oil (patted it on over it) on super dry nights.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin which is very dry during winter and spring months.  </li>
            <li>I have used all sorts of creams; creme de la mer and other high end brands.  </li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Works fantastically under makeup and doesn&#x27;t make my sensitive,  dry skin react.  </li>
            <li>I have always had quite dry (but not too dry) skin with extremely sensitive spots under my eyes and near my cheekbones.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing, the amount is less than the imagination.</li>
            <li>My skin is dry and sensitive.</li>
            <li>Keeps dry skin from flaking ad makes face really soft</li>
            <li>I have dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and when i smile, all these little dimples show up like i have loose skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had problems with acne for over a decade [since early teenage years] and my skin in that time has transitioned from oily all over to quite dry in some parts, oily in others.</li>
            <li>no longer dry, so far he hasn&#x27;t had the same reaction as I did.  </li>
            <li>and she recommended a much less expensive product that was every bit as good...</li>
            <li>I would suggest if you have dry or even normal to dry, STAY AWAY.</li>
            <li>All the CeraVe products are coating (even their cleansers) making them unsuitable for daytime use for anyone who is active or lives in a hot humid climate because they trap sweat and make your face look wet.</li>
            <li>It seems to work for most people, but the ingredients are very irritating to my dry, sensitive skin.  </li>

            <li> I seen this product in a magazine and it had great reviews</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product!!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a winning combo!!</li>
            <li> Very much, very effective</li>
            <li> this one is not as sticky as some and does absorb very nicely.</li>
            <li> Very nice lightweight cream.  </li>
            <li> It is very nice.</li>
            <li> It goes on very light and feels wonderful!</li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> Feels good, but for me,  no visible results that make me happy.  </li>
            <li> Love it as a great moisturizer!</li>
            <li> The ingredients includes ceramide, Niacinamide, and Hyaluronic Acid which are good ingredients for happy skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Very good, very comfortable</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome light hydrating lotion and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to cause or trigger breakouts for me, which is always a good thing.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> but this stuff really is good.</li>
            <li> just cpncentrates on what is good.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for moisturizing.</li>
            <li> feels good.  </li>
            <li> This is a good night moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I like this moisturizer and gave it four stars because of its good ingredients and quality, but don&#x27;t try to wear it during the day if you have oily skin.</li>
            <li> but if you use Cerave cleanser (oily skin) then this works out good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really fair</li>
            <li> This is good for my skin.</li>
            <li> I used it all over my face/neck/under eyes w/ good results.</li>
            <li> Otherwise a good moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t look or feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I want to like this because it&#x27;s inexpensive and seems to have some good ingredients.</li>
            <li> May be good for hands and neck.</li>
            <li> This product contains the ingredients that are supposed to be good for my skin to moisturize and reduce aging: ceramides, niacinamide, and hyaluronic acid.  </li>
            <li> The pump rotates to a locked position, also good for travel.</li>
            <li> All CeraVe&#x27;s product are good, I find.</li>
            <li> Feels really good.</li>
            <li> I looked them up, and they&#x27;re known to be good for the skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good lotion that moisturizes without causing any breakouts.</li>
            <li> To me, this lotion works just as good as the neutrogena one.</li>
            <li> It did not absorb into the skin ....to be fair</li>
            <li> This one is soothing, not too greasy, and has good ingredients for your skin.</li>
            <li> As soon as I put this on, I loved it.</li>
            <li> It also FEELS good going on.  </li>
            <li> bought this product based on the price and good reviews.  </li>
            <li> *** makes my skin feel good.</li>
            <li> Not as good as introduced.  </li>
            <li> but this feels so good after my shave, I always remember...</li>
            <li> This keeps my skin so nice and happy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> and I truly loved it.  </li>
            <li> Good product, like how it feels, not greasy or oily, but moist well.</li>
            <li> I use this day and night because I didn&#x27;t want the sunscreen in it, but this product is really good</li>
            <li> I have used are good and inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t worn makeup in a while and my boyfriend told me I look good waking up in the morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it now for quite sometime, just to give it a fair chance, but it&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
            <li> dermatologist said this is a good product as well and recommended that I keep using it along with what she has prescribed.</li>
            <li> First things - the price difference makes me really happy, and the difference in my skin is wonderful!</li>
            <li> this was packaged great and this is a wonderful product, first time i used it.</li>
            <li> But, I was impressed with the way the product absorbed into the skin and the residual moisturization.  </li>
            <li> That’s great because their formulas contain outstanding blends of emollients and skin-identical ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have tried a number of evening moisturizers and am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I have since re-ordered the product since I am very pleased with the results I have had using it.</li>
            <li> Great products are not always about price, but a couple of my favorite moisturizers were high-priced</li>
            <li> I had read about this cream yahoo and am very satisfied with it.&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li> but if you stick with it you&#x27;ll be very pleased.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s great from some people, but for me, Cerave was better suited for my skin.</li>
            <li> Works great, glad to see it in a 3 pack.</li>
            <li> Great for even acne-prone or problem skin, as it is very light yet effective.</li>
            <li> Love it...!</li>
            <li> I first learned about CeraVe from my excellent dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I really love this moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> I love that this doesn&#x27;t have sunscreen added to it!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve almost finished my first bottle of this Cerave pm lotion, and it&#x27;s wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this face cream!</li>
            <li> Love !</li>
            <li> My face has never looked better!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion!</li>
            <li> I love them both!</li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping to fix this problem, and I love it!</li>
            <li> Also, I love the pump!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did!  </li>
            <li> I love Cerave!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer isn&#x27;t scented, it doesn&#x27;t contain a skin irritants, and it certainly lives up to CeraVe&#x27;s excellent reputation.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an AMAZING moisturizer and helps with lines/wrinkles and also helps mask the ones that I can&#x27;t get rid of..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an amazing product.  </li>
            <li> I started using CeraVe after seeing amazing results on my son&#x27;s excema.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing though.  </li>
            <li> This moisturizer is light, yet does a great job of moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing product, but I am concerned about the parabens.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and is a great under my foundation</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for months now, its truely amazing.</li>
            <li> Its translucent, a bit watery but kind of gel-like.</li>
            <li> My skin does not react kindly to the change in weather.</li>
            <li> was on two rounds of Accutane so moisturizers are kind of an obsession of mine.</li>
            <li> I tried it under my makeup once because I liked how my skin felt in the morning after a night of wear</li>
            <li> This is the best, gentle moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Nice packaging and is unscented ,  which I like .</li>
            <li> and I was delighted that this product didnt give me even a hint of that gunky feeling that most skin products leave behind.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So gentle, and it&#x27;s packed with excellent ingredients like hyaluronic acid, ceramides and niacinamide.  </li>
            <li> But if you are looking for something unscented, lightweight and without sunscreen, this is nice.</li>
            <li> I liked the reviews, liked the price.</li>
            <li> I had used the CeraVe body lotion and liked it.  </li>
            <li> The lotion is a nice texture and non greasy which is also nice for using as a AM lotion.</li>
            <li> Fragrance-free makes it nice.</li>
            <li> better than day for sure, but still not that great</li>
            <li> I value that kind of testimony.</li>
            <li> Some dermatologists are impressed how much info I know about creams and lotions for oily and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> nice product for evening seems to work well and not have a chemical smell.</li>
            <li> This item was received in perfect condition and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> This was also recommended to me from my dermatologist and its really nice.</li>
            <li> Nice weight lotion for you face.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s affordable, feels nice on my skin, and does not cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> If you have normal skin, I think it may be perfect.</li>
            <li> Very light yet effective.</li>
            <li> May try the day time kind with sunscreen built in - but like the way my skin looks so much - why ruin a good thing!</li>
            <li> Also, the lotion is not very thick and oily, but does its job PERFECTLY.</li>
            <li> It packs a good punch, though, for something so light in texture.  </li>
            <li> and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Excellent product if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is the best so far I had.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always struggled with my sensitive skin and this product is perfect!</li>
            <li> So far this is the best product for my face eczema.</li>
            <li> perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> By far the best moisturizer I have ever used in my life.</li>
            <li> CeraVe makes a line of products that are excellent for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Perfect for sensitive or irritated skin.</li>
            <li> The great thing is that it absorbs right into the skin, is not greasy and doesn&#x27;t flake off when applying foundation.  </li>
            <li> Having skin issues, Ive tried many products and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Who knew you can get a great product without spending much!</li>
            <li> Not bad but not that good either.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light gel-like cream.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very light.  </li>
            <li> I even use a very light layer under my makeup.</li>
            <li> Very light.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light</li>
            <li> got cerave AM &amp; PM because they have very high concentrations of niacinamide and ceramides, which are great for your skin.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion-- use this exclusively</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It is my favorite.</li>
            <li> After the bottle ran out I switched to the 16 oz tub and have been pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I found a brand I like much better, called Sea-Chi.</li>
            <li> Ok-- I need a richer cream -this one more like lotion.</li>
            <li> Love the way my face feels.</li>
            <li> and I love this</li>
            <li> I always get compliments on my skin and it beats spending 200$ or more on department store creams.</li>
            <li> and I am really glad to have found this product.  </li>
            <li> Love it...</li>
            <li> My skin looks better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had wonderful results and don&#x27;t have to worry about my skin anymore with different color spots or imperfections after using this.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love it...</li>
            <li> Do your research before deciding which moisturizer is best for your skin AND for your body&#x27;s overall health!</li>
            <li> I love that the moisture I get from this product is not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> I love underneath my makeup.</li>
            <li> I have finally found an EXCELLENT night cream!</li>
            <li> Always love this lotion.</li>
            <li> This has been the best beauty find of the year for me - I only wish I&#x27;d discovered it sooner.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> totally in love with it...</li>
            <li> I Love</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My skin is a lot more supple and the color is brighter.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li> , it sits on top of my skin and doesn&#x27;t absorb as well.</li>
            <li> What I like best is that using the PM Lotion, along with CeraVe facial cleanser, seems to have all but cleared up my acne.</li>
            <li> Love this-</li>
            <li> I use the pm only, and in the am also and it is perfect!!</li>
            <li> After I used this product for a week, she remarked how smooth my face looks!</li>
            <li> I love this face lotion.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is just okay.  </li>
            <li> LOVE this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> many chemicals and parabens in this product.  </li>
            <li> I like this, but don&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this moisturizing lotion.</li>
            <li> The lotion itself is light feeling, kind of a cream/gel hybrid thing.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I use the AM and Pm moisturizing lotions and love them both.</li>
            <li> I love Cerve.</li>
            <li> use CeraVe&#x27;s PM formula during day and at night, because I the &amp;#34;daytime&amp;#34; formula includes sun-tan lotion, which I tend not to need most of the time.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Within 4 days, my husband and I could not believe how much better my skin looked.</li>
            <li> so I bought this thinking it would be ok</li>
            <li> I started using this moisturizer in combination with Rohto Hadalabo Gokujyn Hyaluronic Acid Lotion about a week ago and my skin have never felt smoother or better.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I use that more sparingly and give myself a break by using this in between.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I like the cost too :)</li>
            <li> I use it for my day time lotion, mostly after taking a shower or washing my face.</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> I use this product day and night, I&#x27;m so pleased with it.</li>
            <li> and I love that there is no scent.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s why I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Why spend more on all the pricy night creams.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion and use it AM and PM.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love it &amp; use the day moisturizer to</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> It was recommended to me by dermatologist, and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> Love the way it moisturizes my face without making it feel too greasy.</li>
            <li> my face looks fantastic!</li>
            <li> then I guess I&#x27;m ok with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sure this might be a lovely product for many,</li>
            <li> and it is much better</li>
            <li> Great product for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> but how many hours will it take to fully absorb into the skin?</li>
            <li> I am thinking maybe its better for someone with drier skin then mine....</li>
            <li> however, none have been more efficacious than cerave.  </li>
            <li> This was recommended by my derm and I love it.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully it keeps working :)</li>
            <li> Of course, I was looking to add more to my \\&quot;collection.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s definitely not the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion.</li>
            <li> Ive tried many many moisturizers, and had to eliminate ones with spf</li>
            <li> I love the fact this lotion hydrate my combo type of skin, it&#x27;s moisture,</li>
            <li> Overall, excellent</li>
            <li> love my CeraVe</li>
            <li> that doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts. :-)</li>
            <li> I find my face feels and looks better in the morning.</li>
            <li> I love CeraVe PM b/c</li>
            <li> It works for me better than OTC lotions.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this item.</li>
            <li> I thought it was on sale at duane reade but ended up being more than I thought.</li>
            <li> Also noticed a healthy &amp;#34;glow.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> I can see from the reviews that this is magic for some and for a handful, no idea why, it does encourage pimples etc.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this because everyone loves it</li>
            <li> I have combination skin (but mostly oily)</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been problematic for most of my life.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really, really pleased with it.</li>
            <li> and I have been really pleased with the outcome.  </li>
            <li> If everyone knew what I know about this product now, they&#x27;d never spend $20, $50, $100 or more for a face cream.</li>
            <li> It seems to work better for me on my hands.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> I also like the pump style dispenser because it is more sanitary and helps preserve the beneficial additives in the lotion.</li>
            <li> It is okay for me.</li>
            <li> This lotion is simply the best you can buy for its price point.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more like a gel serum than a lotion.</li>
            <li> And I do notice my skin looking better without makeup as well.</li>
            <li> I have had eczema since childhood, and covering up in the wintertime means more skin problems.  </li>
            <li> They ought to be charging more for this cream.  </li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer alottttt alottt.  </li>
            <li> I love this -- the way it feels, the way it does not have scent, the way it goes on and covers.  </li>
            <li> With that said, I really do love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my skin feels and looks better...</li>
            <li> I use it in the day as well, but since I&#x27;m more on the oily side I can get a bit shiny.  </li>
            <li> It feels slightly better than not putting it on, but it lasts about 3 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it will work better for her.</li>
            <li> This product (CeraVe is supposed to be good, right?)</li>
            <li> /&gt;I have learned that some readily available products in the US are very good substitutes with a decent price point.  </li>
            <li> Very rich and nourishing to the skin.</li>
            <li> This comes highly recommended with a very satisfied CeraVe user!</li>
            <li> This lotion is derma. tested and created to replenish your skins need for hydration (particularly in aging skin),  I am really happy with the results and will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid-thirties and have noticed that my wrinkles aren&#x27;t progressing nearly as quickly as they were before I started using this product, so I&#x27;m beyond pleased!  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the smell, but that dissipates quick and does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The Cerave line has all the wonderful ingredients as the popular Olay Regenerist products at half the price.  </li>
            <li> It has a light, non-greasy texture, absorbs quickly, but still provides good hydration.</li>
            <li> of the first products I found I loved</li>
            <li> Its very light, which is okay, but on some creams after you apply it your skin feels smooth not the case with this.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight, fragrance and irritant free, and it contains a host of really beneficial ingredients for a great price.</li>
            <li> I love the pump, too, which makes it easy to dispense.&lt;br /&gt;NOTE</li>
            <li> Nice feeling, absorbs quickly, but after 4 continous weeks of use</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, nice product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because it was awarded the best night cream for dry skin 2012 by</li>
            <li> The CeraVe lotion seems to be great for sensitive, combination skin types!</li>
            <li> This is a very smooth, light lotion, almost like a serum, that moisturizes fantastically.  </li>
            <li> Love this product, never had any issues with CeraVe Products, goes on evenly and absorbs quickly!  </li>
            <li> Great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Nothing exciting, it just does what you would expect it to do which is pretty great in my book.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no noticeable smell, which is great for people who are sensitive to scents.</li>
            <li> Ladies love the smooth skin, these are the 2000&#x27;s</li>
            <li> CeraVe PM feels great on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> its an ok product line if you want something cheap in the house to have for guests or want to take this traveling</li>
            <li> Great natural product with an affordable price.</li>
            <li> I used to use Aveda&#x27;s All Sensitive line which was great, but they discontinued it two years ago.</li>
            <li> CeraVe is a great line for people with sensitive skin or eczema, and this product is no exception.  </li>
            <li> My skin&#x27;s been looking brighter and reflecting light better, and not because it&#x27;s oily.</li>
            <li> I really like CeraVe&#x27;s moisturizing lotion (for body), and I&#x27;d heard good things about this face lotion.  </li>
            <li> It really moisture your face and is non-comedonic what is good for my acne prone skin, but it still leave my skin feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> While she was checking the incision area, I asked her if the products were really that good.  </li>
            <li> A very inexpensive moisturizer that gives me good result.</li>
            <li> A good ceramide lotion that is reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended by my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> A nice light-weight moisturizer, I use this in the AM right before my sunblock, and in the pm with a drop or two of argan oil.  </li>
            <li> Docked one star because I&#x27;m pretty sure this won&#x27;t be hydrating enough for NY winters, but this formula is perfect for the humid summers.</li>
            <li> By the way, Cerave makes loads of other products that are excellent as well.  </li>
            <li> Some of the other moisturizers I have use make my face look shinny and glossy and that&#x27;s not the best look at 1am.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the CeraVe line after hearing many people rave about it and so far, I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
            <li> It goes on and in easily.  </li>
            <li> I could easily wear this under my makeup as an AM, but I chose to apply at night because I use an SPF moisturizer in the morning.</li>
            <li> It even makes my flaking peel off easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to store, and you can twist the cap to lock it to prevent leaks when traveling.</li>
            <li> Best to use it directly after getting out of the shower or washing your face when it can really soak in and prevent dryness from occurring.</li>
            <li> Prior to this i was using cetaphil but have switched to cerave products because they have more emollients in them which is ironically great for my acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t perform miracles but it is easy on my pocketbook and on my skin.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to tolerate a strong fragrance on your face.</li>
            <li> Needed a strong PM moisturizer for after Retin-A application and this one seems to be working well.</li>
            <li> I would have to strongly disagree.  </li>
            <li> My fine lines on my forehead have diminished significantly and my face looks and feels more even toned.  </li>
            <li> I love the CeraVe hydrating cleanser, but this product wasn&#x27;t anything special.</li>
            <li> no sticky or oily feels and it&#x27;s just soak into my skin right away, I choose the PM one, because it&#x27;s more hydrate and more versatile for AM and PM usage.</li>
            <li> I use it in combination with the Clean&amp;Clear persa-gel, and the two have managed to clear my skin up quite nicely!</li>
            <li> it is awesome &amp; leaves my super dry skin moist -</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried, hands down.</li>
            <li> should be fine with this.  </li>
            <li> My pores are minimized and three fine wrinkles disappear as the skin pumps.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and the touch is comfortable, help to keep skin moisty</li>
            <li> I think this one would be fine.</li>
            <li> Rather than a greasy feel, it&#x27;s just a light, water-based, fragrance-free lotion that smoothes on easily.  </li>
            <li> It is a fine lotion for the summertime.</li>
            <li> Light moisturizer and works fine for daytime too.  </li>
            <li> I am very suitable for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> very gentle, and effective, suitable for any type of skin, hydrates skin very well</li>
            <li> Simple and cheap, yet great for my skin.</li>
            <li> Does not irritate sensitive skin, and does an amazing job - you won&#x27;t find a better moisturizer than this at any price.</li>
            <li> Just a simple, great moisturizer---no fancy bells or whistles.</li>
            <li> This CeraVe PM lotion is light and non-greasy.  </li>
            <li> this lotion is light.  </li>
            <li> 1 1/2 pumps is pleny, sometimes 1 pump, of this light lotion.  </li>
            <li> Again, I think why this applies so lightly is because of that consistency.  </li>
            <li> The PM formula is light weight, and absorbs well into my skin.</li>
            <li> Being acne prone, it is important to use a non-comedogenic lotion.  </li>
            <li> It is as light as air and does the job.  </li>
            <li> but your face is smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li> So smooth, no longer bumpy, and</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s a pump bottle - clean and sanitary, easy to use, and</li>
            <li> So moisturizing but still light.</li>
            <li> This lotion is unscented and light.</li>
            <li> This lotion is fairly light</li>
            <li> But the body creme is fantastic.</li>
            <li> This light lotion seems job done.</li>
            <li> I tried another night product recently and wasn&#x27;t as happy.</li>
            <li> Goes in smooth, not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Is light even with the SPF.  </li>
            <li> I understand that this is a popular product, and it was very well reviewed on Beautipedia (with praise for the ingredients, esp niacinamide), but it did not work at all for me.</li>
            <li> CeraVe comes in a light cream, containing alcohol derivatives that seemed so diluted it</li>
            <li> Overall another great product by CeraVe</li>
            <li> using it druing the day instead of PM, find it a bit light for me for night time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s surprisingly light and watery, with a gel-like texture.</li>
            <li> Great basic moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Unscented, light, and smoothing.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive, feels light and never greasy.</li>
            <li> Feelings light and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is light weight, which works well with my oily skin.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic night cream.</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel smooth after applying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light.</li>
            <li> My skin feel like baby smooth after a week of using.</li>
            <li> No scent, light on the skin.</li>
            <li> so far so good, but it does have an odor</li>
            <li> After about a week or so - noticed that my skin actually looked &amp;#34;plumper&amp;#34; (which is a good thing at 44 :)..).</li>
            <li> From the 1st time I applied this product I LOVED it -- immediately made &amp; continues to make my face &amp; neck skin feel sooo soft.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this seemed like it would be a good match,</li>
            <li> What I like most about it is that in addition to feeling great, this moisturizer improves skin with long-term use due to its beneficial ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and can break out easily, this is a nice light oil-free lotion that is non-irritating.</li>
            <li> Also LoVe that it doesn&#x27;t cost major $$$ to own it.  </li>
            <li> My skin cleared up pretty good after using gentle skin cleanser +</li>
            <li> It is smooth, luxurious and does not clog pores; it also absorbs quickly and makes skin feel smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> My skin is easily irritated, so much so that I make sure to check that everything is non-comodogenic.</li>
            <li> price of Cearve is great, i think much more less then the quality itself.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> There are nine more words required - that&#x27;s kinda funny.</li>
            <li> No pretty bottle or advertising, just good stuff!</li>
            <li> Looking up the ingredients, I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li> and I  would say my acne has significantly improved.</li>
            <li> If you need something rich and creamy, this is probably not the product for you - it&#x27;s a lotion</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s worth the price, but does NOT compare to Dermalogica&#x27;s product!</li>
            <li> I love the whole line!</li>
            <li> Rich &amp; nourishing yet absorbs well.</li>
            <li> Best facial lotion out there for anyone even if you have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> the fine lines are improving, my skin is evening out, and it feels nice and soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a teriffic body lotion, super hydrating, lightweight and thankfully fragrance free.  </li>
            <li> Great for healing dry skins</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a clean moisture, if that makes sense--</li>
            <li> So I decided to give this moisturizer a try, as I was looking for a good, cheap and basic moisturizer for day and night.  </li>
            <li> my face feels so clean and moisturized.</li>
            <li> consistency of the lotion is light, and my skin quickly absorbs it.</li>
            <li> I put it on before bed on a clean face.  </li>
            <li> Light, non greasy, wonderfully mild.</li>
            <li> A great moisturizer for face, hands, and any dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Your skin feels supple and clean in the morning.</li>
            <li> I combine using this with the CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser to clean my face morning and night</li>
            <li> skin is dry and this product is great for the price.</li>
            <li> This by far is the best facial lotion that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 59 years old, and I appreciate having this at my most favorite night cream.</li>
            <li> Great lotion for dry skin.</li>
            <li> It is light enough to use as a daytime moisturizer, which is surprising since I have oily skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice oil free moisturizer, very gentle and really works.</li>
            <li> A great product, which I use day and night on my dry areas!  </li>
            <li> Great for dry skin!  </li>
            <li> When I smile I have tons of fine lines that were not there before.</li>
            <li> It is very comfortable to use, but moisturizing enough, suitable for use in summer</li>
            <li> it is a light moisturizer and does exactly what is promised!</li>
            <li> Read reviews comparing this to Dermalogica&#x27;s Super Rich Repair moisturizer, at a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li> , they have many good ingredients to improve the health of your skin and hardly any irritants (it&#x27;s fragrance free!).</li>
            <li> A really great moisturiser with higher amounts of ceramide that is generally only found in Elizabeth Arden products.  </li>
            <li> This product applies easily and really moisturizes my skin and reduces appearance of fine lines.</li>
            <li> It does a great job of softening up rough patches of skin without provoking an acne flare-up.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized without having any kind of film or gunkiness on it.</li>
            <li> Unforuntately, I have been suckered by products that are supposed to be good, by ordering them-- only to find out when I get the product at home, that they include parabens.  </li>
            <li> Its good not only on your face, but also at your hands and your knees, where there is bump!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer so much I use it both in the morning and in the evening.  </li>
            <li> Love this product and the whole CeraVe line.</li>
            <li> This one is slightly better than the am lotion, but not by much.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion - it&#x27;s very lightweight but still hydrating.  </li>
            <li> product goes on smoothly and is quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li> The very next morning my face already felt more smooth and healthy.  </li>
            <li> BETTER than lotions costing 2 or 3 or 4 times as much ...</li>
            <li> But here&#x27;s what really made me fall in love..</li>
            <li> really does more than just moisturize your skin.</li>
            <li> Now, I have found that most PM lotions tend to be on the thicker side and get very greasy which tends to clog my pores and break me out all over within a day or two.  </li>
            <li> I like to keep it in a cool place and put it on after a shower.</li>
            <li> keeps skin smooth, hydrated, and fresh.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not creamy like most night lotions are, I much prefer the daytime one.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, is absorbed quickly, and you can reapply as needed.</li>
            <li> I saw the strong rating on this product and decided to give it a try, since it was also pretty inexpensive compare to dept. store brands (e.g., Estee Lauder, Clinique).</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to many products, but this is fine.</li>
            <li> Great price for ingredients that sell for 3x the cost under other high-end names.</li>
            <li> I will not use it because of these ingredients even though it contains other great ingredients.</li>
            <li> It has helped my fine lines so much!  </li>
            <li> I have oily skin, not too oily but this product makes my skin SUPER oily like how it gets when I apply argan oil on my face.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly with no residue on face.</li>
            <li> This helped  tremendously  for that.</li>
            <li> My face doesn&#x27;t feel greasy after I put it on and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I had mild acne growing up.</li>
            <li> My pores are also getting more visible and I break out with most facial products (cystic acne!</li>
            <li> It is different then the pm lotion which is nice and smooth on the face, it has sun screen in it</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly without being sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li> I actually stumbled upon this product after reading an interview of a famous person that said this was one of their favorite products.</li>
            <li> At times I have sensitive skin, depending on what I&#x27;m trying out to battle wrinkles, but have had absolutely NO reaction to this awesome product!!  </li>
            <li> However, it packs a tremendous moisturizing punch.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and sealed package.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly into the skin and it creates a protective barrier on the skin.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t recommend CeraVe Moisturizing Lotion, more highly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a miracle put it on at night wake up with healed skin any kind of dryness or cracked skin due to blemishes hands down the best</li>
            <li> Very nice, very inexpensive moisturizing facial lotion.  </li>
            <li> Very gentle and moisturizing!</li>
            <li> I love putting it on because it reminds me of Clinique&#x27;s Dramatically Different Moisturizing Gel--it is a wonderfully lightweight gel and makes my skin feel refreshed instead of heavy.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take much to go a long way, so it lasts for a good while.</li>
            <li> This glides on so easily application is quick and it keeps my face very moisturized</li>
            <li> Over the years, I&#x27;ve found some that I like better than others, but I still feel the need to try out new stuff that I hear about.</li>
            <li> this is my first time trying this product-not sure on how much I like it yet.  </li>
            <li> Admittedly, I have very sensitive skin, but there are many products I can and do use.  </li>
            <li> I check EWG for most of the products I use, this lotion has a danger rating of 3 out of 10 (which is good, very few products have a rating of 0).</li>
            <li> It only took two nights for me to fall in love with it!</li>
            <li> It has a water-y feel and glides on smoothly, my skin absorbs it quickly and it hydrates my skin very well.</li>
            <li> However, unlike Clinique&#x27;s famous DDMG that I used to use back when I had super oily skin, this moisturizer is great for my dry-combination skin and probably suitable for most other skin types except very dry.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly, which is nice, but I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> For the awesome price I would certainly recommend that anyone at least gives it a try.</li>
            <li> Never have a reaction, goes on smooth and moisturizes gently.  </li>
            <li> Amazing lotion for my skin that is often red and irritated from lupus!</li>
            <li> Great non oily lotion that does not feel heavy on your face.</li>
            <li> I do alternate with Renova which gives me amazing results</li>
            <li> I am still looking for a product that can calm the redness without compounding it.</li>
            <li> absorb very well, smooth .like</li>
            <li> I use the cetaphil normal to oily wash though, it&#x27;s be pretty good thus far.</li>
            <li> Light and non-greasy yet intensely moisturizing.</li>
            <li> My skin is feeling great and it is not too heavy.</li>
            <li> This is such a nice texture.</li>
            <li> I think I read about this on Reddit, and have been looking for an affordable, but useful face lotion.  </li>
            <li> I also own the version with SPF, and the consistency of that version is different from this one.  </li>
            <li> I will still occasionally use my go to night treatments - Vitamin E and olive oil if my skin really needs a moisture boost, but this is really good.</li>
            <li> Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> My acne has actually cleared up a lot and more importantly my skin tone has evened out from all the scars I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i switched to something more natural.</li>
            <li> After putting this stuff on (after washing with sulfur soap) my face feels much more moist and really soft.</li>
            <li> Works for me my life partner loved it may be ordering more soon would like larger bottle if possible.</li>
            <li> Face feels so soft after rinsing in the morning :)</li>
            <li> For the price, it is certainly worth the try.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Ceramides, Hyaluronic acid, and niacinamide all in one moisturizer is a rare find.</li>
            <li> My favorite night cream so far.</li>
            <li> Its fantastically moisturizing yet light as air, and actually makes your skin better and healthier -so</li>
            <li> I figured it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer, I have sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Wow I love the texture of this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;m ordering this moisturizer, I also own one of their body lotions.</li>
            <li> my opinion, It&#x27;s well worth the $$.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s kinda pricey, it&#x27;s so well worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been researching ingredients on skincare and kept reading how niacinamide is great for your skin, especially for people with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is a nice basic moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try, it&#x27;s not too expensive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted something that was good for sensitive skin, even though I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for oily skin because I woke up with minimal oil on my face.</li>
            <li> Works great, I&#x27;d suggest taking one a day at first if you have a more sensitive subject</li>
            <li> But if you are OK with a light moisturizer that soaks right into the skin giving just enough moisture and leaves no oily residue feeling, this is for you.</li>
            <li> In my other review of the Cerave Moisturizing Lotion, I mentioned that I also use this facial moisturizer and that I am totally satisfied and happy that I switched over from Aveeno.  </li>
            <li> its a very light formula, it absorbs fast and so far no bad reactions</li>
            <li> Super mild on your skin and very hydrating as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different products to calm it down (without prescriptions) but hadn&#x27;t found the perfect solution.</li>
            <li> I saw results right away.  </li>
            <li> The right product at the right time.</li>
            <li> but this plumped my skin right up</li>
            <li> It comes in a travel-friendly pump bottle that is just the right size and structure for bringing on an airplane if you need to (you can lock the pump by turning it 90 degrees).</li>
            <li> This is just right for night time cream.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t break my skin out and gives me just the right amount of moisture that I need.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight, sort of pearlescent and with the right content of niacinamide (~5%) and lots of ceramides.</li>
            <li> It always makes my face look like the life has been sucked right out.  </li>
            <li> it gives you the right amount of hydration for your face.</li>
            <li> It absorbed quickly and made my face feel soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> While this one doesn&#x27;t pack enough punch to use alone during the dry winter, it is good during the warmer, more humid months.</li>
            <li> I bought the body &amp;#34;Moisturizing Cream&amp;#34; from CeraVe at the exact same time I bought this, and I liked it.</li>
            <li> The skin there is very sensitive and easily irritated.</li>
            <li> Use it after shower and will keep you soft and you will feel clean!</li>
            <li> I past it right by all because it didn&#x27;t have the fancy labels or attractive boxes</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s great for dry skin but oily skin people, steer clear.</li>
            <li> I have skin problems and this works very well in keeping it in check, as I have a tendency to dry out on my cheeks and so far so good!</li>
            <li> This seems to help protect my skin so that I can use makeup without a problem -- although I rarely need it because my skin is so pretty now.</li>
            <li> Has not clogged me yet and have been using this for about 3 weeks :o :)</li>
            <li> The container is small and the head can turn to lock, so it&#x27;s great for travel.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn like other night creams, no scent, feels pretty good.</li>
            <li> It does a nice job, and doesn&#x27;t break out my sensitive skin like many other products have.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed in an overnight cream at the right price.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy, and although it has not turned back the hands of time, I am sure it is doing something useful.  </li>
            <li> Neutrogena always makes my face burn and Cetaphil does when it is in this kind of dry state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non-iritating, non-greasy, unscented and effective for moderately dry skin.</li>
            <li> This also effectively takes care of dry skin resulting from swimming in chlorinated water.  </li>
            <li> It brought back moisture to my face instantly and when I woke up this morning, my face looks GREAT..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure with a few more applications they will be non existent.</li>
            <li> If you suffer from super dry skin this is a great facial lotion for any time of day (despite the pm label).</li>
            <li> To be fair, I do have somewhat sensitive facial skin, as this has happened to me before, but NEVER to this degree!</li>
            <li> Well I decided to give it a try and do what in my mind seemed very counterproductive, as I started to use regularly moisturizers and drinking water regularly my skin balanced out beautifully.  </li>
            <li> I think the price is also very reasonable.</li>
            <li> and it is very gentle on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Unlike some other nighttime moisturizers, it&#x27;s not gloppy or gooey, just lovely and smooth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like lotions where I have to stick my hand in the big, open jar, so this is also nice in packaging and easy to travel with.  </li>
            <li> I guess a good moisturizer is just a good moisturizer with one not much better than another, other than</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to everyone!!</li>
            <li> ;)&lt;br /&gt;My issue?</li>
            <li> Same product, better price.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I could literally feel the moisture being restored on the first application.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty shiny.</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with The CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser at nights and I love it.</li>
            <li> Keeps the face smooth and moisturized and clear looking.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, plan to use it for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li> I have always been hesitant to try this because I already have pretty oily skin</li>
            <li> first tried it out at me dermatologist, when in for acne treatments</li>
            <li> since then this is the ONLY moisturizer I buy, I have tried so many and this is the only that helps me  and does not irritated my skin giving me more breakouts, it says pm</li>
            <li> no complains yet except that this in the only place i can find it at an ok price</li>
            <li> I know the exact amount to put on my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We will be buying more of it later on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helped my skin so much!</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin soft, smooth and doesn&#x27;t cause irritation or breakouts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it consistently for about 3 years.  </li>
            <li> If someone was dealing with extra dryness or eczema on the face this might not be enough but might be the next best thing if you don&#x27;t want something greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I have been using this facial lotion 2x a day for 5 months and it has become my favorite.</li>
            <li> It is a bit greasy at first but then soaks in.</li>
            <li> I had tried many products, including homemade ones using shea butter and various oils, but nothing works as well as CeraVe.</li>
            <li> Also please be aware that the cleanser you are using can also be stripping your face and not have any thing to do with the product, many gentile cleansers exist if thats your issue such as cetaphil.</li>
            <li> I really like this face lotion!</li>
            <li> At first I thought my sheets needed washing, but after sleuthing it turned out it was the lotion.</li>
            <li> I even prefer it to some higher priced department store brands.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have researched the ingredients first.  </li>
            <li> It makes my face soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I use the AM daily and love this product; therefore, when I found out there is a PM moisturizing, I had to try it.</li>
            <li> This product is the only CeraVe product that I can give even an OK rating to.</li>
            <li> so glad that I finally found out about</li>
            <li> We both love the foaming facial wash (it stays in the bathroom), and now we&#x27;re fighting over this moisturizer!  </li>
            <li> I have used so many different moisturizers and this one is no doubt one anyone should have in their repertoire.</li>
            <li> and my face was still soft and smooth with no greasy feel in my T-Zone area.  </li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t seen too many if any commercial for it.  </li>
            <li> I had the first go-round.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s often out of stock at my local stores, so I&#x27;m glad to get on Amazon.</li>
            <li> ok but moisturizing enough in the winter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty bummed that it didn&#x27;t work out for me.  </li>
            <li> CeraVe is the only face wash/moisturizer that my daughter and I are able to use.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be buying some more after I run out.</li>
            <li> Tried it once more with the same result.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty affordable compared to Olay niacinamide product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Actually, it has improved my skin in general, but I&#x27;m really delighted to have eczema under control.  </li>
            <li> get lotion this brand was highly recommended by my dermatologist!!</li>
            <li> I bought this face lotion after researching so many different products.  </li>
            <li> This one is very light and kind to my delicate skin!</li>
            <li> This facial moisturizer is a very good option for normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li> Exactly what one wants from a moisturizer, right?  </li>
            <li> By the next morning my dry patches on my cheeks were diminished greatly, the redness in my face was almost gone</li>
            <li> Less oily than other moisturizers I&#x27;ve used but probably not the best in that department.</li>
            <li> It seems to be a very nourishing cream and feels light, not heavy.</li>
            <li> If that much change happened in one night, I have no doubt that it can only get better.</li>
            <li> My 16 year old used some and the next day asked for a bottle of her own.</li>
            <li> Really nice, basic nightime lotion that won&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any special disease, just somewhat sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I would even use this lotion as my primary day lotion as well (as long as I could supplement with adequate sun block protection.)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what is this lotion for because I haven&#x27;t seen any positive difference on my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight --- and fragrance free, as with other CeraVe products.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty much gone.</li>
            <li> and this stuff is as good if not better.</li>
            <li> I really like the adjustable top that ensures I only get exactly as much lotion as I need.</li>
            <li> I would say this works just as good as La Mer at a 10th of the cost and no more breakouts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so natural and light for sensitive skin but yet have powerful nutritions feed my skin.  </li>
            <li> I hoped that this would be a good facial lotion for my sensitive skin, but it really was a complete dud.</li>
            <li> It sinks in SUPER quickly, so you need to rub it in quickly and use about 2-3 pumps for your whole face.</li>
            <li> The product was 100% fresh and new.</li>
            <li> It has been terrific and this comes after I have used some of the higher end skin care lines where moisturizers cost around $70 (on the cheap end).</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and easy to apply, especially when you just want to go to bed!</li>
            <li> I have been using this every night for years, but it&#x27;s not always easy to find at my local Target or CVS.</li>
            <li> product absorbs into the skin quickly leaving soft and smoothe skin with NO oily residue.</li>
            <li> It may not been strong enough for winter time though</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t cause break out for my sensitive skin, which is pretty rare.</li>
            <li> Sometimes my dry skin is very itchy and most moisturizers can sting.  </li>
            <li> After use it more than one month, I think is helping my skin, AM version is too heavy for me, PM cream absorbs quick.</li>
            <li> Its nice bc my face feels hydrated not too tight or oily,</li>
            <li> This is perfect for summer nights, but for people with super dry skin, especially in the winter, I would advise you pair this up with a light skin oil to boost the moisture if this isn&#x27;t heavy enough for you.</li>
            <li> I have never found a good night time moisturizer as I only use olive oil, coconut oil, and/or argan oil on my face to moisturize day and night and since it&#x27;s winter and the air has changed and much cooler, my face changed alot as well, being flakey and dry!</li>
            <li> It helped with the rosacea problem I sometimes experienced and cleared up some patches of dried out/hyperpigmented skin from a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; face wash I used that brutalized my skin a while back.</li>
            <li> This seller has always sent me the real stuff as well.</li>
            <li> For this to be a PM moisturizer, I found it to be much lighter than CeraVe in the tub and one of the lightest PM lotions I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing but for oily skin, it&#x27;s TOO moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have any antioxidants or skin-improving ingredients, but I use it with a serum, so that doesn&#x27;t matter so much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing without clogging pores.</li>
            <li> It does a great job of moisturizing without irritating.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, CeraVe, and</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate my acne-prone skin, and provides much needed moisture without being too heavy/greasy.</li>
            <li> , I recomended this because is really what I was expecting to receive.</li>
            <li> but it really cleans you out and makes you feel lighter</li>
            <li> It is very moist and makes me feel youthful.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading all the reviews and was really looking forward to it.  </li>
            <li> it so much</li>
            <li> I use a ton of it because I like how it makes it feel so much.</li>
            <li> I really like Cerave products.  </li>
            <li> Gee, thanks.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a gentle, moisturizer with no sunscreen for nighttime use.  </li>
            <li> However, As much as I do like the feel of it (and the price)</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t make you break out, goes on thin, great for summer.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommended if you have a case of eczema in the winter!</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin in the summer</li>
            <li> It is very hydrating.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Non-irritating and very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> I use it every two days trying to not give so much oil to my face.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy and absorbs very well.  </li>
            <li> and it was light enough to handle the humidity.</li>
            <li> and I really haven&#x27;t noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much cheaper than some of the products out there.</li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care how it works at this point.  </li>
            <li> I really like CeraVe, recommended by my doctor.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I use a cerave body lotion that I really like....</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to reviewers</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than buying it in the store.</li>
            <li> Gentle on my skin and works well with medication my dermatologist prescribed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lighter weight moisturizer than I&#x27;m used to, but it has been working very well.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> and it really worked wonders for me.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion.</li>
            <li> It does not require much.  </li>
            <li> I really like the CeraVe products</li>
            <li> It is very non-irritating and not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> It has really improved my skin, may take some time</li>
            <li> I thought it sounded like a sensible product and the cost is reasonable.  </li>
            <li> I use it during the day also and I have really fry skin.</li>
            <li> Really like this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I have very acne-prone skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to not apply niacinamide and vitamin C at the same time though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I really recommend using this product and vitamin C together.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really moisturizing but not oily.  </li>
            <li> However, I do really like to put it on the apples of my cheeks where I have a touch of rosacea.  </li>
            <li> It feels very soothing</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, keeps skin moisturized all day/night.</li>
            <li> It absorbs super quick and somehow leaves my skin feeling dry within 5 min.</li>
            <li> Used more expensive, but this is just as effective.  </li>
            <li> CeraVe is modestly priced and certainly has all the right ingredients.</li>
            <li> Once I started using it, it was clearly better than my old facial moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I would give good grades if it weren&#x27;t for the slow poison of the parabens that are contained within the product.  </li>
            <li> I learned about it from my dermatologist and was happy to find that it&#x27;s not very expensive at approximately $15/bottle.  </li>
            <li> My skin has acted very calm overall, despite a very stressful month.  </li>
            <li> I mostly get oily skin, mild acne and blackheads in my nose and chin area, especially the parentheses - for lack of a better term - from the corners of my nose, around the corners of my mouth, and down the outside crease of my chin.</li>
            <li> not bad however if you have sensitive skin be careful no breakouts but did burn my skin a bit it is just really strong</li>
            <li> We finally stops that two months ago and his face is been great since using a plain cleanser in the morning and Persagel to spot treat, and then wash with 10% Pan oxyl (also dermatologist recommendation) in the evening followed by this Cerave PM lotion.  </li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive face, and pretty much any moisturizer will make me break out or</li>
            <li> It offers the right amount of moisture to my face without leaving it feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Most of my dry patches were gone in the morning, some that were a bit more severe were slightly lingering.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a bargain buy, which is why it&#x27;s popular on Reddit&#x27;s SkincareAddiction, rated highly on Beautypedia, and one of the best-sellers of facial moisturizers on Amazon (which is always changing but it was at the time of my purchase)!</li>
            <li> vitamin b3 can cause an allergic reaction in certain people so make sure your not allergic to it.the only thing missing in this lotion is antioxidants which I easily remedy by mixing some acure marula oil in with this</li>
            <li> I never break out from this, as I do with many other products.  </li>
            <li> no irritation like many other lotions.</li>
            <li> I have Rosacea and many of the other lotions irritate it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation and keeping my skin hydrated better than some other lotions I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many other products and they don&#x27;t seem to have that effect on me.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and I am left feeling clean.</li>
            <li> I have quite sensitive, reactive skin, and using this consistently has really improved my complexion.</li>
            <li> I normally wear Murad or Darphin moisturizers at night, which are available only at Neimans or Nordstrom, but I use CeraVe during the day.</li>
            <li> Both are great, especially if you already had some skin problems in the past.</li>
            <li> I use Tazorac, a very strong prescription Retin A cream that I sometimes apply a bit too heavily.</li>
            <li> However I did find that it still slightly tingles my sensitive spots, but I&#x27;ve tried every other thing out there, all of which burn and irritate, and this one is the best I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> May not be good for extremely dry skin but normal to dry skin</li>
            <li> Nothing too special, but it will work if you need a basic moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I was at my dermatologist&#x27;s office for a check on a tiny odd mole they&#x27;d removed (good news...</li>
            <li> Strong recommendation here, especially for those with sensitive or problem skin.</li>
            <li> Am I the only one with a drawer or cabinet full of skin care products?  </li>
            <li> Since then I&#x27;ve tried many that are without spf and claim to be for dry sensitive skin, but they all still irritate my sensitive spots and don&#x27;t really moisturize my skin as i feel it becoming dry in one or two hours again, or</li>
            <li> It feels very light and absorbs quickly, which I normally like in a regular facial lotion, but it seems a little too light for a PM lotion.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is hands down my favorite moisturizer</li>
            <li> CeraVe has proven itself to not cause new zits for me, when I&#x27;ve been sure that other face creams ~ though not greasy at all ~ have.</li>
            <li> My makeup goes on more evenly and smoothly where as before it was looking powedery and settling into the fine lines and making the dry patches look worse.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find such a great mixture in the more expensive department store brands!  </li>
            <li> Bought a rotating facial brush and some Aveeno Ultra Calming cleanser and lotion, that I quickly returned after my skin felt like it was on fire after 1 use.  </li>
            <li> I made the switch to this from a heavier night cream I was using after I started breaking out (most likely pregnancy related).  </li>
            <li> The main difference between this and the AM formulation is that the PM does not have sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I use it before bed, the skin feels smooth and soft  next day I wake up.</li>
            <li> once I realized it was the main culprit making my skin burn while applying moisturizer.</li>
            <li> my main concern is that i have combination skin type which leads me to the breakouts from using inappropriate products.  </li>
            <li> As I get older my skin is changing.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that breaks out from everything...until now!  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended for anyone.</li>
            <li> But I highly recommend the PM.</li>
            <li> This stuff has Propylparaben in it which is highly toxic and causes endocrine disruption.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use CeraVe, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin prone to  breakouts from certain products - but this is just soothing.</li>
            <li> , in the store cost a little more</li>
            <li> Very nice product a little bit pricey compare to other drugstore product</li>
            <li> I have used products with hyaluronic acid and even salicylic acid Clean &amp; Clear moisturizer, with no facial irritation, or breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i normally spend high $$ on my creams until i found this</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much of a smell, and it dries completely clear unlike sperm.</li>
            <li> I waited til my first bottle was almost empty before reviewing because so often a first impression of a product doesn&#x27;t stand up to continual use but this product really has.  </li>
            <li> So far this product is working very well.  </li>
            <li> Overall a nice lotion that doesn&#x27;t have much fragrance to it, and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or slimy.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use much at all on it.</li>
            <li> Not only does CeraVe help to calm a flare up - it also prevents them.</li>
            <li> I use this at night, and my  nose is actually normal in the morning.  </li>
            <li> So I gave it a try as it costs 1/10 what my normal creams do.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s with &amp;#34; normal skin&amp;#34; and not a lot  of wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Its silky, normal consistence, and has no smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a full year since our daughter has had a flare up, and while not that long for me-</li>
            <li> This is definitely a solid product worth trying out.</li>
            <li> I adore the cleanser for normal to oily skin.</li>
            <li> Target also carries this, but it&#x27;s a few dollars more there.</li>
            <li> Alas, I loved the price.</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate and it was too light for me.</li>
            <li> decent moisturizer and no reaction from my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and this is a sheer light coverage and sinks right into my skin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a nice enough night moisturizer, however it creates an odd smell.  </li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t super sensitive, but I&#x27;m just trying to avoid aggravating it as much as possible while I deal with (what is now)</li>
            <li> /&gt;does left and right of the face</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s silky in texture (very similar to a primer), absorbs quickly, is not greasy and really makes my skin soft and smooth, and most importantly, it doesn&#x27;t break me out, which so many other facial moisturizers I&#x27;ve used in the past have done.  </li>
            <li> This fragrance-free moisturizer is highly recommended for sensitive or rosacea-affected skin, hence the high rating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other facial moisturizers, but CeraVe PM is the very first product I&#x27;ve found that actually keeps my dryness under control.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not able to spend a ton of money like so many gals do these days on beauty creams, but  I found this one really decent &amp; does not break the bank for me.</li>
            <li> I found this to be extremely hydrating and suprisingly extremely light.  </li>
            <li> Cheap compared to other ones out there that contains hyaluronic.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist had recommended it and I cannot live without it :0)</li>
            <li> I live in Vegas</li>
            <li> This is a new product</li>
            <li> I do not like to pay for ingredients that are bad for the body, even though the company finds them cheap and good</li>
            <li> This is one of only a few lotions I can use that both effectively moisturizes and doesn&#x27;t cause me to eventually break out.  </li>
            <li> This must be ordered with a more expensive purchase to ship for free with Prime, but Amazon&#x27;s price is quite a bit cheaper than Walgreens or Walmart.</li>
            <li> an innocent little thing!).  </li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive.  </li>
            <li> They make your skin very soft.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive and acne prone skin and</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> For reference, I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This moisturizer has helped clear and balance my skin, used in combination with a time-released benzoyl peroxide [AcneFree qfoam!].</li>
            <li> , I had facial flushing and my face felt hot to touch.</li>
            <li> I do go without make-up and my skin tone feels more even, although I started other skin care products (recommended by Reddit) at the same time.  </li>
            <li> I emailed them a second time basically ranting and raving and they finally got back to me and told me that Cerave is safe to use under the eyes</li>
            <li> It contains ingredients found in many more expensive, department store products such as ceramides, niacinamide and hyaluronic acid.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend this moisturizer to anyone with sensitive and problematic skin!</li>
            <li> So far, I like it!</li>
            <li> I have been using it nightly for a couple of months and see no more difference in my skin than using the Nivea cream that I have used for many years.</li>
            <li> I read about this online; like many of the other reviewers, I&#x27;ve had various skin issues over the years and have become something of a skin care junkie/expert.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling soft and not greasy!</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;m not sure if it was just me</li>
            <li> I usually put this on before bed on top of my retin a</li>
            <li> It is not heavy (even under makeup!)</li>
            <li> I tried a few high quality and high $$ products and finally gave Cerave products a try after reading many recommendations on the web.  </li>
            <li> I am a little concerned about some of the ingredients but as long as it&#x27;s not past hazardous 5</li>
            <li> I have per the years used so many expensive products that its hard to accept something this cheap to be better</li>
            <li> The Dermatologist prescribed me a very strong topical acne cream and gave me a few samples of this product to put on in case my skin started peeling/flaking.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend this lotion to anyone with skin issues, young or old.</li>
            <li> This is half the price for twice the product and works fantastic.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&amp;#34;CeraVe’s first official facial moisturizer isn’t too far removed from their well-formulated body moisturizers.</li>
            <li> My husband made the comment recently that my face is so soft and pretty.  </li>
            <li> After reading all the positive reviews I decided to give this product a try for my recent Rocasea flair up.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a heavy moisturizer or even something that is super moisturizing for very thirsty skin, you may not want to get this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s NOT a super heavy moisturizer, it&#x27;s very light, but even though it&#x27;s light, it still makes the skin feel properly moisturized after application.</li>
            <li> I have mild to moderate rosacea with frequent flares of red bumps on my face.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed a clear difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance since I started using the CeraVe PM lotions.</li>
            <li> but I have not so clear skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, my skin is not that sensitive.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t irritated my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Neither too light nor too heavy for my combination skin.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly sensitive rosacea skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;*4 stars because I could not put the lotion near my lip--due to the smell giving me a head ache.</li>
            <li> So, busy consumer does not suspect.  </li>
            <li> I use it day and night and near my eyes.  </li>
            <li> It lives up to its claims, and leaves my face soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> After applying, my face feels velvety soft, and when I wake up in the morning, my face is still moisturized.</li>
            <li> I went to a dermatologist to examine pimples on this 78 year old face, after treatment the doctor suggested I use Cerave AM and PM and the cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I have insanely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This is not heavy at all and absorbs completely.</li>
            <li> Also I am sensitive to how a lotion makes my skin feel, and this lotion allows my skin to feel like it can breathe....</li>
            <li> yr old son uses it as well as my husband</li>
            <li> it was for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Maybe my skin is too sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It turns out, many common face lotions aren&#x27;t, go figure.</li>
            <li> My face always feel so soft and in the summer my face is protected by the sun.</li>
            <li> (they&#x27;re near the end of the ingredients list), but there is NO valid, scientific evidence that these compounds are harmful (research it yourself if you don&#x27;t believe me).  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and use the CeraVe moisturizer everywhere except on my face</li>
            <li> price is reasonable ($14 at Target), and the packaging is simple.</li>
            <li> I use CeraVe because it&#x27;s the only thing that really works to soothe the redness from my rosacea.  </li>
            <li> It is considered a non comedogenic and gentle to use on skin for a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I was using neutrogena sensitive skin oil-free moisturizer to help with any dryness before I applied any makeup on face.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I do have combination skin and it  is also sensitive...</li>
            <li> It soaks in and makes your skin feel naturally hydrated.</li>
            <li> I am 56 years old, but have had a problem with zits continuing all the way through my life so far...  </li>
            <li> While it hasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;cured&amp;#34; the SD, combined with gentle cleansing and keeping my paws off, my chin is vastly improved.</li>
            <li> A couple of years ago, I started seeing a dermatologist for still having acne at 35yrs old.  </li>
            <li> My 12 year old daughter is also fighting some early acne and learning how to care for her skin.  </li>
            <li> Nearly every day, she stashes this moisturizer in her room</li>
            <li> With all the thugs I do to exfoliate and renew I&#x27;m 32 years old and this is my go to for a night of guaranteed moisture.</li>
            <li> It does not make my face feel sticky or heavy, and creates a smooth surface for makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product dramatically irritated my skin (inflamed, sensitive to touch, etc.)</li>
            <li> my adult acne.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and is glowing.</li>
            <li> Early 20s sensitive acne-prone</li>
            <li> It leaves my face soft &amp; supple without over drying or breaking out.</li>
            <li> No redness, itching, no trouble at all.</li>
            <li> I am 56 years old.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs almost completely and doesn&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a lotion that wouldn&#x27;t aggravate my sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I cannot attest to the anti aging clams of this product as I am quite young, but I do like it quite a lot.</li>
            <li> Not greasy but leaves skin well moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li> I feel like all the PM creams are a bajillion dollars and promise to wake up looking 15 years old again.</li>
            <li> This is really good lotion, I&#x27;ve always been used expensive stuff for my face but to my surprise</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more lightweight (but still very moisturizing), it absorbs well, never feels greasy, and I have never experienced any sort of a burning sensation with it.</li>
            <li> Many popular moisturizers have strong scents which I find unpleasant and irritating.</li>
            <li> Cerave proves that great products doesn&#x27;t necessarily need fancy packaging or other expensive whatnot.</li>
            <li> It is light and silky and makes the skin on your face very soft, and it lasts even though just a small amount is needed.</li>
            <li> It is a gel cream formula, that sinks right into the skin.  </li>
            <li> This one just sinks right into your skin and stays there.  </li>
            <li> But I have pretty dry skin</li>
            <li> i can put this light lotion all over my face, neck, and under eyes along w/ my other nightly prescribed acne facial regiment, it does not leave my face greasy.</li>
            <li> The product is light, with a very faint but pleasant smell and it blends into my skin unlike any other moisturizer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through several bottles of this and highly recommend it for those of you with sensitive skin or who use a retinoid product.</li>
            <li> After an extensive research I found that this product it&#x27;s simple enough, meaning free of harsh chemicals, and does the job just right in moisturizing my skin overnight.</li>
            <li> My skin is dry and sensitive, but CeraVe isn&#x27;t irritating, soaks in quickly, and leaves my skin soft, smooth, and well-hydrated.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure it will fit the bill.</li>
            <li> Have tried several face moisturizers in the last few years, and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helped calm down the redness and helped with breakouts.</li>
            <li> I switched off all creams except bare bones clinique dramtically different lotion for about 3 days to give my skin time to calm down and return to normal.  </li>
            <li> I used to have relatively normal skin, but at 28, I now have sensitive combination skin (oily t-zone, flaky on other parts, and normal around the cheeks), and it also has redness.</li>
            <li> : they have new packaging, it doesn&#x27;t look like the picture (above) anymore.</li>
            <li> max is what I get when I try a new facial cream.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do much for my dry winter skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I would recommend this for anyone that wants a basic facial lotion, even if they have oily skin</li>
            <li> This is one of those so called drugstore creams you pay less for what they are really worth.</li>
            <li> skin is not sensitive but it is very easy to get white heads and small bumps from some types of lotions.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any major differences in my skin after using this.</li>
            <li> you can find it at any major retailer e.g. walmart, target, cvs, etc..  </li>
            <li> This was the first lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried that actually moisturized my skin and got rid of the dry flaky patches on my face.  </li>
            <li> If anyone out there is considering using this product, I would be very careful and test it out first.</li>
            <li> like it when my skin is dry, but I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to give it a full review.</li>
            <li> Many companies, as in Johnson and Johnson, have taken parabens out due to the cries and complaints of customers--mothers complained so much to J&amp;J that they finally took them out.  </li>
            <li> Very inexpensive compared to all the other less useful stuff on the market.  </li>
            <li> I use this and the Am SPF 30 because I have eczema and also because these creams have amazing expensive ingredients like ceramides.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin (dry patches on cheeks and forehead) and my T-Zone (nose &amp; inbetween my eyes) gets slightly greasy at times, mostly from products (makeup, creams, lotions, etc.).  </li>
            <li> know I won&#x27;t be purchasing the item again because of the flushing and a couple of breakouts, when my skin had been clear prior.  </li>
            <li> As long as I use Cetephil gentle and Cerave facial lotion I have cured this problem.  </li>
            <li> So, perhaps I&#x27;m just sensitive to the ingredient, because niacinamide is supposed to do the opposite --- decrease redness and even out skin</li>
            <li> I have occasional eczema and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Now if only I can get rid of those old spots.  </li>
            <li> Apparently the formula had as well.</li>
            <li> This is marketed towards those with sensitive skin, but something in it makes my gf&#x27;s skin break out in red bumps</li>
            <li> I will be back to update in a month or so to let you know how my face is doing and how it reacts to this product as my face is sensitive</li>
            <li> and it barely did anything</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re barely noticeable after ONE time of using this.</li>
            <li> Long story short, I have almost finished my first bottle (already bought the second).</li>
            <li> I currently use Cerave AM moisturizing lotion so this was a natural.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin, but I love the fact that CeraVe PM doesn&#x27;t have any potentially irritating ingredients such as fragrances or dyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It actually moisturizes (for real), goes on easy, doesn&#x27;t leave our faces feeling like we have crap left on them, and the price is very right!  </li>
            <li> It moisturizes your face for a pretty long time and doesn&#x27;t leave a dry or sticky feeling.  </li>
            <li> I really like it, especially as it is so hard to find a moisturizer without a sunblock (many sunblocks bother me).</li>
            <li> I used Cerave without incident for about 6 months when I began to notice it was becoming very hard to find.</li>
            <li> In addition to numerous skin-identical ingredients, it contains a generous amount of the cell-communicating ingredient niacinamide, which offers multiple benefits.</li>
            <li> but I bought this last night and tried it last night and WOW</li>
            <li> My doctor ran a skin test with common household chemicals, and found out I am extremely allergic to Methylchloroisothiazolinone (MCI)/Methylisothiazolinone (MI), which can be found in most household cleaners, make-up, shampoo/conditioners and body cleansers.</li>
            <li> Although 3 oz. seems a bit small for the price, I find the product to be worth it, and one upside of this size is that you can travel with it.  </li>
            <li> I live in the desert and it works well enough for our dry climate, and used it while on vacation in Florida</li>
            <li> and I would say slightly greasy (just slightly), but nothing that a light powder won&#x27;t take the sheen off of during the day.</li>
            <li> During this harsh winter, I paired it up with Maracuja oil (patted it on over it) on super dry nights.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin which is very dry during winter and spring months.  </li>
            <li> I have used all sorts of creams; creme de la mer and other high end brands.  </li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Works fantastically under makeup and doesn&#x27;t make my sensitive,  dry skin react.  </li>
            <li> I have always had quite dry (but not too dry) skin with extremely sensitive spots under my eyes and near my cheekbones.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, the amount is less than the imagination.</li>
            <li> My skin is dry and sensitive.</li>
            <li> Keeps dry skin from flaking ad makes face really soft</li>
            <li> I have dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and when i smile, all these little dimples show up like i have loose skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with acne for over a decade [since early teenage years] and my skin in that time has transitioned from oily all over to quite dry in some parts, oily in others.</li>
            <li> no longer dry, so far he hasn&#x27;t had the same reaction as I did.  </li>
            <li> and she recommended a much less expensive product that was every bit as good...</li>
            <li> I would suggest if you have dry or even normal to dry, STAY AWAY.</li>
            <li> All the CeraVe products are coating (even their cleansers) making them unsuitable for daytime use for anyone who is active or lives in a hot humid climate because they trap sweat and make your face look wet.</li>
            <li> It seems to work for most people, but the ingredients are very irritating to my dry, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Its not that much more expensive and since you rotate it daily it should last twice as long and equal out.</li>
            <li> The result was continued flushing and some minor breakouts, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only ingredient in the product I have never used topically is the niacinamide.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s taken me a long time to find a combination of products that actually help, that I can actually afford, and that my dermatologist doesn&#x27;t make a face at.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the extra few bucks compared to typical face lotion.</li>
            <li> Also, I found it to be much too lightweight for winters in Colorado; my face had little dry patches everywhere by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> The only lotion that treated my dry chapped facial skin</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t necessarily apply cream there, unless my skin is particularly dry, but when I do I don&#x27;t notice any break outs or extra</li>
            <li> Completely eliminated my lifelong struggle with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have mild seborreic dermatitis, which has been worse recently.</li>
            <li> This is minor, but to be noted.&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of this specific moisturizer is, quite frankly, like sperm.</li>
            <li> For a long time CeraVe has been the only hand lotion I could use</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t mind as long as it doesn&#x27;t cause any zits, which it definitely hasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> well I will try it again and see in the morning if its completely absorbed without any white patches left behind....</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Due to medication, I end up with dry, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The bottle doesn&#x27;t last very long (maybe a month or two).</li>
            <li> If your skin is dry, this may not be enough or you may have to re-apply.</li>
            <li> During really dry seasons I actually will put on the pm wait</li>
            <li> I still have the same dry areas that I started with.</li>
            <li> I get extremely dry skin on my face, especially during the winter months.  </li>
            <li> Cetaphil also had a tendency to make my face sting at times, especially when my skin was dry.</li>
            <li> Just not moisturizing enough for my dry skin in the winter.</li>
            <li> the first application of CeraVe PM Facial, approximately an hour later</li>
            <li> It has ceramindes, hyrulonic acid, and niacinmides, for a mere 12 bucks, if you gathered all those products from Olay, Loreal, and other companies you would spend 75 dollars or more.  </li>
            <li> If it works for dry middle aged skin AND oily tweenager skin, I think we have a solid winner!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a year now and totally love it, and I&#x27;ve tried tons of other (rather expensive) products.</li>
            <li> It also stings to apply on dry to extremely dry skin, which is not necessarily the case with all lotions.  </li>
            <li> I did try the famous &amp;#34;honey mask&amp;#34; touted online; it helped, but just coconut oil for moisturizing wasn&#x27;t cutting it</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like this, at least my skin didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why my skin had such an adverse reaction to this product except for the fact that my skin is extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li> I found myself using it frequently through this really harsh winter to protect my skin.</li>
            <li> I used Retin-A for a long time and now use Differin.</li>
            <li> My skin is not particularly sensitive, but it is acne-prone and combination-oily.  </li>
            <li> feels hydrated and looks plump long after washing it off.</li>
            <li> It was a long journey before I stumble upon CeraVe Moisturizer PM.</li>
            <li> not much to this facial lotion for the price.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I returned it back to the store for a full refund.</li>
            <li> You can put makeup over it without waiting a long time for it to dry.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer has ceramides to repair/support skin, and 4% niacinamide, which also has numerous benefits for skin, such as the ability to fade post-inflammatory pigmentation (the red marks from acne scarring) that I sadly have much of.</li>
            <li> When I used it as I always had, my face became extremely dry/red and irritated, especially under my eyes.</li>
            <li> After I got some allergic pimples due to just moderate sunshine, I applied this thinking</li>
            <li> lady, Angie, who does major research on skincare products, and came across this little gem...  </li>
            <li> (she thinks it&#x27;s the hyaluronic acid based on other products she&#x27;s used with similar results).</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice anything different from other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Finding a moisturizer was so much more difficult!  </li>
            <li> also now used other CeraVe products such as CeraVe Moisturizing Cream and Lotion</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  a lot cheaper than other face creams with similar ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> Notwithstanding, due to sensitivity of some sort to this product, my face stings and gets red every time I use it-have to literally fan my face to get some relief.</li>
            <li> I try to use it every other night and the same issue repeats itself.</li>
            <li> I will even wear it in the daytime, if I notice I&#x27;m a bit dry after using my cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> I have a chronically dry nose and &amp;#34;t-zone&amp;#34; on my face.  </li>
            <li> Its almost as if my dry skin is &amp;#34;cured&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It helps with redness (I&#x27;m assuming from the niacinamide) and keeps my skin from getting too dry or irritated.</li>
            <li> I use this nightly during the fall/winter after I shower, and it helps my combination skin from getting too dry.</li>
            <li> My dry skin has already been improving.</li>
            <li> This is a life savior when you have acne and the cremes the doctors prescribe you dry your skin out.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin in the winter.</li>
            <li> She diagnosed me with extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> My face was so dry, which caused it to produce a lot of oil.</li>
            <li> My face is softer, it isn&#x27;t ridiculously dry and oily, and I don&#x27;t feel so self-conscious when I go out.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin that gets progressively oilier throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I have exceptionally dry skin on my forehead and have used a variety of lotions throughout my life.  </li>
            <li> I use this product because my face tends to dry up after I take a shower</li>
            <li> a ton of dry skin.</li>
            <li> This brand did not moisturize my dry skin at all.  </li>
            <li> During the winter months, my skin gets so incredibly dry, but this moisturizes without the oily feeling.</li>
            <li> Dry patches are all gone.  </li>
            <li> The prescriptions that I have to use to control my acne tend to dry out my face</li>
            <li> my skin still feels dry after two applications.</li>
            <li> It has helped the dry patches of my aging skin.</li>
            <li> I do have one dry spot that it has helped and I have to say</li>
            <li> Alas, shortly after applying this product, my whole face stings, even where I thought was not damaged by the sun.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;daytime&amp;#34; version of this is actually just facial sunscreen, which you wouldnt want to wear everyday</li>
            <li> Asked a friend what she did for her 67 year old skin (which looks at least 15 years younger) and she recommended this product.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a single flake since I started using this product a week ago.</li>
            <li> As we get older, we start noticing small wrinkles on our faces...and if you&#x27;re like me, it freaked me out!  </li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve had eczema since birth, I kept piling on the heavy moisturizer to fight the apparent dryness (peeling), but it didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not right for me and will spend the rest of its short life on my very dry arms and legs.</li>
            <li> My skin had to adjust a little at first, with some minor bumps here and there, which still happens sometimes, but nothing serious.  </li>
            <li> It became red and tight and dry.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I will use it as a mask when I am very dry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend it for very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I started using sulfur soap about a week ago which helped with redness and irritation but my face still felt very dry with some flakes.</li>
            <li> I used this lotion at night and even in the morning when my skin was very dry and irritated.</li>
            <li> The dry patches can get so bad at times that they become break outs, they are severly red and they were causing fine lines to appear on my forehead.  </li>
            <li> I still use those brands for other things and am not knocking them, but so long as CeraVe keeps this product unchanged, and at this price, I&#x27;ll never use anything else.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend it if you have dry skin since it will not moisturize heavy enough.</li>
            <li> but CeraVe did crazy things to my face, made it SUPER red, irritated, itchy and burned on fire.</li>
            <li> I have tried a ton of products, from the expensive to the inexpensive, creams for sensitive skin, dry skin, comination skin, skin with breakouts, products that are all natural, organic...</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s upsetting to me is that over the past month (after using it for about 2) I&#x27;ve developed a reaction to it where my face got large flat red spots and itched like crazy.  </li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m not going to be outside, I use the PM one during the day since it&#x27;s a little lighter.</li>
            <li> Product is a little thinner in consistency than I&#x27;d anticipated (almost gel-like) however have been using for several days and liking the results.</li>
            <li> Personally it leaves me a little greasy on the zones of my face where I tend to get oily, so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m HOPING that it&#x27;s just a case of extreme dry skin and will diminish in time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend other people give it a try if they have itchy dry skin.</li>
            <li> My skin often feels dry, but I have to be very careful not to use products that make my skin oily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> my only complaint is that I want to buy it in a larger size!&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not real greasy either.</li>
            <li> Well, just as I expected, you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li> and she told me to buy this and gave me a few examples that was back in 09,</li>
            <li> Wet ,confortable,and seems like  moisture content</li>
            <li> It provides just enough hydration for my skin without feeling heavy or oily afterwards.</li>
            <li> It really sinks in, and is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I found numerous studies indicating that the skin and scalp over produce oil trying to compensate for the harsh stripping products that we use to correct that.  </li>
            <li> It is my fault for not checking carefully.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s too heavy even though it&#x27;s lighter than the stuff in the tub or the regular lotion with the pump.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy, my go to facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I think there might be coupon that you could find online to save a few bucks but the price here on Amazon is definitely cheaper than CVS.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised how much I hated this product, as I absolutely love the CeraVe hand creams.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s probably not right for someone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I had severely dry skin on my fact after a long and harsh winter.  </li>
            <li> After going through 5-7 types of moisturizers (some very expensive), I finally was smart enough to see what Cereve had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> could* just be that my facial skin reacts weirdly with this particular product, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> ever since my five month old developed moderate eczema, i have bought a litany of lotions - some very expensive.  </li>
            <li> The recent switch to cold, dry, wintery air had completely parched my face and left me with an embarrassing flaky complexion.</li>
            <li> I have always had dry skin and have found this lotion works well on my face after dealing with others that caused a slight reaction in my skin.</li>
            <li> this little bottle goes a long way and works wonders.</li>
            <li> Made me break out and somehow turned my dry, thirsty, winter parched skin into a shiny greasy mess.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been almost 2 and a half MONTHS and the skin under my eyes is still crinkly, dried out and flaking in areas, only from using it two times!!</li>
            <li> It helps heal acne, eczema, and other skin conditions.</li>
            <li> It prevents wrinkles and other aging concerns.</li>
            <li> Not sure how it would compare to other facial lotions</li>
            <li> I tried the expen$$$ive cream that got me through last winter, but it wasn&#x27;t really solving the problem - merely moisturizing for a few hours, after which my face would begin to crack again.</li>
            <li> I will never use any other moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I use other products to help with that.)</li>
            <li> Other moisturizers have irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> No fragrance or other irritants.</li>
            <li> No more flakes within a day of using, my t-zone isn&#x27;t acting up, no break-outs, and the redness of my face</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be using any other brand.</li>
            <li> Other moisturizers (day or night) have not done this to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus, if I use any on my nose I break out in these weird, deep pimples, and I am 60 years old!</li>
            <li> an hour later I could still see small patches on my skin.</li>
            <li> still have my drawer-full of other products.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other creams before bed and in the morning I have not noticed any affects.  </li>
            <li> Face never had that greasy shine that other lotions like cetaphil lotion gave me.</li>
            <li> I used to have extremely oily skin and about two years ago started researching how to deal with this issue.  </li>
            <li> I felt this cream did not add moisture as well as some of the other creams I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I use Retin-A, so must use a non-active moisturizer (one without retinol or all other hosts of stuff found in serums/moisturizers these days).  </li>
            <li> I only use it at night, usually after my acne creams.</li>
            <li> so i must be very careful with what i use in my skin.</li>
            <li> &quot; per se, but it feels hydrated and comforted (my very dry skin feels tight).</li>
            <li> When my face is especially dry</li>
            <li> instantly dried off my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> When my skin feels really dry, I&#x27;ll mix a few drops of jojoba or argan oil into it.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer was recommended to me when I was suffering from severely dry, flaky skin as a result of environmental factors and a battle against an acne flare-up with harsh, drying acne products.</li>
            <li> It was expensive for the size, nothing really fancy about it, it feels oily on skin, doesnt lost that longer compared to other products I used.</li>
            <li> The second time I planned ahead and used this AM and PM and had hardly any of the severe dryness</li>
            <li> I definitely wake up in the morning with a little bit of a slick face, but I wash in the mornings anyways</li>
            <li> the kind that justify a sick day from work!  </li>
            <li> am cutting and pasting a review from beautypeida that I find useful (below).  </li>
            <li> The list of ingredients is a bit scary, and I really dislike that it contains parabens.</li>
            <li> Importing Korean beauty items is very time consuming and difficult to shipping and language</li>
            <li> It feels like an average day moisturizer.</li>
            <li> But when I have used other moisturizers my skin turns into a greasy mess.</li>
            <li> however it did seem to get rid of some dark lines on my neck post-pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I tried it myself and found it average.  </li>
            <li> It also fully absorbs after application which is my only complaint against its AM counterpart.</li>
            <li> The reason i know that it was this lotion because as soon as i stopped using it, the white heads just stopped coming and slowly going away.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also aggravated my eczema (the spots I repeatedly applied on slowly turned red over time).  </li>
            <li> I have dry but sensitive skin thay can be acne prone when i use the wrong thing</li>
            <li> it just tones it down a bit</li>
            <li> and I have to go hunt in down -</li>
            <li> Other products make me break out, but not this one!</li>
            <li> Everything was as expected thx!!</li>
            <li> but I use it for both am and pm (every time i wash my face)&lt;br /&gt;I have oily, dry skin :/ and go thru a lot of breakouts around that time in the month.&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li> Five large, red, painful zits appeared overnight...</li>
            <li> Some potential buyers may be concerned by the presence of very small amounts of parabens</li>
            <li> I have been using this for almost a half year now</li>
            <li> the area around my eyes is much less puffy.</li>
            <li> Also makes my skin on my neck seem less stringy.</li>
            <li> or similar, it was blue, sparkly, and expensive -.-)</li>
            <li> I would suggest you use less of the product than you think you need until you adjust to the consistency.</li>
            <li> and so I&#x27;m using less foundation.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually have any dry skin!</li>
            <li> Its has only been one night, but I definitely  notice that my crazy flaky dry skins is drinking this stuff up.</li>
            <li> this left a weird film on my face and made me break out the very next day.</li>
            <li> it is MUCH less than it used to</li>
            <li> but ever since I&#x27;ve been applying vitamin C serum in the morning in tandem with applying Cerave lotion at night, I&#x27;ve been noticing my skin getting smoother and freckles less noticeable.</li>
            <li> My face&#x27;s been feeling slightly fuller as well.</li>
            <li> Even the redness around my nose is getting a lot less noticable.</li>
            <li> It leaves a a tight feeling, with an odd oily residue.</li>
            <li> CeraVe is recommended by dermatologists for not having any chemicals or artificial colors or dyes in their products, and the result is evident.</li>
            <li> I saw that this has ceramides and NO fragrance or other irritating substances, and it was on sale locally...</li>
            <li> my other night lotions would sit on my skin and end up in my eyes and sting, so rinsing eyes with cold water in the middle of the night was a problem for trying to get back to sleep.  </li>
            <li> I find that the AM formula is a little too sunscreen-like</li>
            <li> I also adore the little bottle it comes in.</li>
            <li> I also broke out a little bit, but I don&#x27;t know if this product is to blame.</li>
            <li> But I leave this little pump bottle out on the bathroom counter within reach of my husband&#x27;s side of the vanity.  </li>
            <li> CeraVe PM has little to no odor and no tingling or burning.</li>
            <li> I have a very hard time finding a moisturizer that is heavy enough to work, yet not leave a greasy film.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this to me, but I found the PABA in it actually made my eczema even worse.  </li>
            <li> My skin broke out a few days after that one application.</li>
            <li> The oderless lotion does not feel heavy or greasy and my skin improved within a day or 2.  </li>
            <li> I know this is the PM formula, but I&#x27;ve also used a few dabs in the morning and it keeps my face moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> Why waste the product?  </li>
            <li> A few seconds after you apply it</li>
            <li> , I look like I have some kind of terrible disease.</li>
            <li> I use to use the pm cream and a sun screen and that was a waste</li>
            <li> and I can usually tell if a product is no good depending on how my pores react and the color of my face sometimes is blotchy red spots with harsh ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No stickiness or heavy feeling.</li>
            <li> Feel heavy and too oily.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be the missing piece of the puzzle all these years.</li>
            <li> I use it year round, during the day and at night.</li>
            <li> It took some heavy duty prescriptions to make it go away.  </li>
            <li> Its not greasy, it doesn&#x27;t have any smell (fragrance or fatty smell)</li>
            <li> and is not greasy or messy.  </li>
            <li> I have used it each night now for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> It never seemed to soak into my skin, and I could still feel a heavy film of lotion on my face when I woke up in the morning.</li>
            <li> Does not leave a heavy film.</li>
            <li> It is not like those heavy night creams that just hangs on the skin&#x27;s surface.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry, it doesn&#x27;t feel waxy or heavy, but</li>
            <li> it is waste my money to buy something</li>
            <li> Not greasy or heavy</li>
            <li> I had people comment that my skin looks glowing a few weeks after I began using it.</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan.  </li>
            <li> I have unfortunately learned that I can&#x27;t experiment with and \\&quot;play\\&quot; with any other facial products</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t nearly as thick and hydrating as other night creams.</li>
            <li> I wish this PM lotion was a little less expensive or came in a larger amount, but I will buy it again.  </li>
            <li> my skin feels like it&#x27;s &amp;#34;healing&amp;#34; from the past few years of being stripped by harsh chemicals/improper</li>
            <li> but I hate to use too much of the steroid cream since it thins skin when used long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too bad, I had high hopes based on other reviews.</li>
            <li> For months I&#x27;ve had little dimply looking things on my cheeks and little tiny vertical lines that drive me crazy bc</li>
            <li> Will be trying other products in the CeraVe line!!!  </li>
            <li> Bad product, too much alcohol.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Dermatologists have recommended Cetaphil in the past, but even that irritated my skin.  </li>
            <li> Both are prescription retinoids that are really irritating and can result in red, angry, peeling skin if you aren&#x27;t careful.</li>
            <li> Result no more pimples around the cheek and chin area.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sold on these products, no more expensive, greasy, over the counter creams and lotions just daily Cerave products.</li>
            <li> Just wish I could say the same about the AM version, which unfortunately doesn&#x27;t work with my skin at all.</li>
            <li> Really not much better than the creams I have bought before.  </li>
            <li> In the past, I always forget to apply lotion</li>
            <li> This so far has been a miracle in clearing my skin since I broke out in acne from the cold weather.</li>
            <li> My routine is usually to apply it at night after I have watched my face with the foam cleanser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spend a small fortune on products from Clinique, Estee Lauder even Proactive.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much more to say that hasn&#x27;t already been said by the 46 reviewers before me.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using his product for the past month or so along with homemade vitamin C.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only sorry I didn&#x27;t hear about it sooner.</li>
            <li> Was using an Equate Beauty lotion for years and was sick of my red, dry, skin.  </li>
            <li> But if you ask a person who suffers from extreme dry skin, they will tell you about CeraVe products.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not suitable for my oily skin</li>
            <li> Sadly this is one on a long list that does cause me to break out (I tested it for about 6 months before I gave up)</li>
            <li> This stuff makes me breakout bad, which is usually not a problem for me.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist for dry skin and it has made a big difference, I hate lotions</li>
            <li> You hardly know you are using it.  </li>
            <li> My skin is soft and I haven&#x27;t had a bad reaction to it</li>
            <li> I also developed contact dermatitis and had a bad breakout of eczema all over my face.  </li>
            <li> I dont get break outs from this cream, it has no sent, Some people complained it did not help.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin in the least.</li>
            <li> Before  I found this cream, I was paying hundreds of dollars for expensive name brand/designer creams that did not much for me.  </li>
            <li> It is not a miracle worker but it is moisturizing without being thick or greasy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too thick to wear under suncreen and it&#x27;s not greasy at all</li>
            <li> just thick gloops that make me break</li>
            <li> but my skin was still dry especially due to the cold weather.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel moisturized in cold, dry winter air.</li>
            <li> I was shocked and disheartened when I looked in the mirror the next morning :</li>
            <li> But regardless, my experience with it was not a good one, so I give it 2 stars, and I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would use this PM lotion too, but the smell is horrible and it is a very unusual color of gray.  </li>
            <li> I was suffering from dry, flaky, painful skin around my mouth after changing face washes.  </li>
            <li> I had a ton of dark marks after a trial of some bad acne they slowly began to fade away using Cerave PM Lotion.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this over a zillion other moisturizers in the world (even over the very very expensive ones), so I&#x27;m going with his wisdom.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have had some negative results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My redness has also decreased.</li>
            <li> and I thought it might make it worse.</li>
            <li> It is a thin odorless lotion.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t broken out or been irritated by it.</li>
            <li> - it feels overly greasy and doesn&#x27;t seem to work, and my usual Olay moisturizer wasn&#x27;t cutting it.</li>
            <li> well it is very thick!</li>
            <li> Sadly, I had to throw out the rest of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of using it since I have combination skin</li>
            <li> I just encountered a terrible skin allergy, and my face was covered in red and swollen blisters.</li>
            <li> Purchased this on advise of a friend, who said her dermatologist suggested she save money on expensive face creams and get cerave instead.  </li>
            <li> I also like the pump bottle and how the pump can be twisted to turn on and off.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need expensive or ~fancy~ creams from nieman marcus and what not.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I had an allergic reaction to this product, but my husband loves the CeraVe line.</li>
            <li> I used expensive creams for years.</li>
            <li> After the birth of my son I started getting breakouts, and my dermatologist recommended this over the expensive creams.</li>
            <li> They had pamphlets for an expensive skin care line with niacin.  </li>
            <li> We never used it though because his skin was so oily that it seemed wrong to put lotion on.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this cream broke me out</li>
            <li> Having the heat on in cold weather is drying.</li>
            <li> I was afraid to show my face for a week while it subsided.</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this lotion, no matter what type skin you have!</li>
            <li> /&gt;i was so mad.</li>
            <li> I use to have oily skin and hated the feeling of thick lotion!</li>
            <li> It was so bad</li>
            <li> I had to stop using it after 3 days because my skin looked so bad.  </li>
            <li> They react together and burn the skin, which I learn through a painful way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Though my eczema still persists :-(</li>
            <li> So disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I use it as a base before serum and lotion.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really annoying and embarrassing.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so annoying.</li>
            <li> Either that or I just have really bad luck with skin care sometimes!</li>
            <li> HATE it--horrible feeling on face, and does not help dryness!  </li>
            <li> I am also one of the unlucky people to have a horrible reaction to CeraVe.</li>
            <li> This face creme made my skin look and feel awful.  </li>
            <li> It also has Methylparaben which is also nasty.  </li>
            <li> I used this lotion three times and it made me break out terribly.  </li>
            <li> but for me, it worked terribly.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a miracle put it on at night wake up with healed skin any kind of dryness or cracked skin due to blemishes hands down the best</li>
            <li> A very good commodity</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive face, and pretty much any moisturizer will make me break out or flush/itch.  This one is very light and kind to my delicate skin! I will even wear it in the daytime, if I notice I&#x27;m a bit dry after using my cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;Very impressed with this one! A+</li>
            <li> Love this lotion-- use this exclusively</li>
            <li> Love it...! very gentle, and effective, suitable for any type of skin, hydrates skin very well</li>
            <li> Very much, very effective</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t recommend CeraVe Moisturizing Lotion, more highly.  It&#x27;s a teriffic body lotion, super hydrating, lightweight and thankfully fragrance free.  But, I have never used it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give the CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion a trial. I was hopeful it would be another &#x27;go to&#x27; product for me.  Unfortunately, I have had some negative results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, my skin is not that sensitive. I have used products with hyaluronic acid and even salicylic acid Clean &amp; Clear moisturizer, with no facial irritation, or breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the first application of CeraVe PM Facial, approximately an hour later, I had facial flushing and my face felt hot to touch. I actually took my temperature thinking I was getting a fever, but that wasn&#x27;t the case.  I noted that it appeared to be &#x27;flushing.&#x27;  I attributed it to being out in the garden and getting some sun during the day.  I thought I&#x27;d try to work through it.  The result was continued flushing and some minor breakouts, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only ingredient in the product I have never used topically is the niacinamide.  I wouldn&#x27;t think the percentage would be enough to cause this problem, but it is the fourth ingredient, out of 19.  So, perhaps I&#x27;m just sensitive to the ingredient, because niacinamide is supposed to do the opposite --- decrease redness and even out skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know I won&#x27;t be purchasing the item again because of the flushing and a couple of breakouts, when my skin had been clear prior.  But, I was impressed with the way the product absorbed into the skin and the residual moisturization.  It&#x27;s light weight --- and fragrance free, as with other CeraVe products.  It is also supposed to be non-comedogenic, so my breakouts could have been coincidental.  So, I can&#x27;t say you shouldn&#x27;t give it a try.</li>
            <li> Moisturizing. Hasn&#x27;t irritated my sensitive skin. I&#x27;m quite happy with it. There are nine more words required - that&#x27;s kinda funny.</li>
            <li> This is such a nice texture. Just a simple, great moisturizer---no fancy bells or whistles. I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good. I like it.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome light hydrating lotion and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy. I use the pm for morning and night.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years and I love it</li>
            <li> I have a chronically dry nose and &amp;#34;t-zone&amp;#34; on my face.  I needed something that could provide moisture that is not greasy.  I use this at night, and my  nose is actually normal in the morning.  I saw results right away.  Its almost as if my dry skin is &amp;#34;cured&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is hands down my favorite moisturizer and I use it daily. It&#x27;s lightweight, fragrance and irritant free, and it contains a host of really beneficial ingredients for a great price. It contains three types of ceramides, which are waxy lipid molecules found on the surface of the skin, as well as niacinamide which is usually only found in more expensive products. I use it in combination with the Clean&amp;Clear persa-gel, and the two have managed to clear my skin up quite nicely!</li>
            <li> Very nice, very inexpensive moisturizing facial lotion.  You get alot for your money with this one.  Never have a reaction, goes on smooth and moisturizes gently.  May not be good for extremely dry skin but normal to dry skin should be fine with this.  I have seen this on all the beauty lists under best buys.</li>
            <li> This is a  wonderful moisturizer.  My dermatologist recommended it for me.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. It is my favorite. It helps heal acne, eczema, and other skin conditions. It prevents wrinkles and other aging concerns. It goes on smooth, is absorbed quickly, and you can reapply as needed. Sometimes I will use it as a mask when I am very dry. This seller has always sent me the real stuff as well.</li>
            <li> For this to be a PM moisturizer, I found it to be much lighter than CeraVe in the tub and one of the lightest PM lotions I&#x27;ve used.  After the bottle ran out I switched to the 16 oz tub and have been pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this over a zillion other moisturizers in the world (even over the very very expensive ones), so I&#x27;m going with his wisdom. It has been terrific and this comes after I have used some of the higher end skin care lines where moisturizers cost around $70 (on the cheap end). Totally impressed. By the way, my doctor says wear the PM CeraVe both day and night.</li>
            <li> I first learned about CeraVe from my excellent dermatologist. I&#x27;ve had problems with acne for over a decade [since early teenage years] and my skin in that time has transitioned from oily all over to quite dry in some parts, oily in others. I&#x27;ve tried dozens of products to balance my face and stop the overproduction of oil that always resulted from over-drying my skin with acne products. This moisturizer has helped clear and balance my skin, used in combination with a time-released benzoyl peroxide [AcneFree qfoam!].</li>
            <li> Best moisturizing cream I have ever used.  It is light and silky and makes the skin on your face very soft, and it lasts even though just a small amount is needed.</li>
            <li> HATE it--horrible feeling on face, and does not help dryness!  I was really surprised how much I hated this product, as I absolutely love the CeraVe hand creams.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizing for a very good price. CeraVe products are very good.</li>
            <li> Not bad but not that good either. I have oily skin, not too oily but this product makes my skin SUPER oily like how it gets when I apply argan oil on my face. It&#x27;s def for night time use but I have used at night and in the morning my face still looks oily. It&#x27;s very moisturizing but for oily skin, it&#x27;s TOO moisturizing. That&#x27;s great for dry skin but oily skin people, steer clear. I think it also broke me out but that could have been something else.</li>
            <li> Burns my eyes, did not like it.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this to me, but I found the PABA in it actually made my eczema even worse.  Also, I found it to be much too lightweight for winters in Colorado; my face had little dry patches everywhere by the end of the day.  I found a brand I like much better, called Sea-Chi.</li>
            <li> Very good, very comfortable</li>
            <li> I have mild to moderate rosacea with frequent flares of red bumps on my face.  As long as I use Cetephil gentle and Cerave facial lotion I have cured this problem.  I have unfortunately learned that I can&#x27;t experiment with and \\&quot;play\\&quot; with any other facial products or I&#x27;ll have a problem that will take weeks to heal.  This seems to help protect my skin so that I can use makeup without a problem -- although I rarely need it because my skin is so pretty now.</li>
            <li> I am very suitable for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Amazing lotion for my skin that is often red and irritated from lupus!</li>
            <li> The right product at the right time. Thanks.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great moisturizer for a great price. It may not been strong enough for winter time though</li>
            <li> People concerned about wrinkles, read on!  As we get older, we start noticing small wrinkles on our faces...and if you&#x27;re like me, it freaked me out!  I asked my dermatologist what she would recommend since I didn&#x27;t want to pay for any type of creams or injections what would cost a TON of money.  She recommended CeraVe.  I picked some up and haven&#x27;t looked back since - it&#x27;s an AMAZING moisturizer and helps with lines/wrinkles and also helps mask the ones that I can&#x27;t get rid of..it&#x27;s an amazing product.  I would highly recommend it to everyone!!</li>
            <li> Excellent nighttime moisturizer. Neither too light nor too heavy for my combination skin. Doesn&#x27;t seem to cause or trigger breakouts for me, which is always a good thing. It doesn&#x27;t have any antioxidants or skin-improving ingredients, but I use it with a serum, so that doesn&#x27;t matter so much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing without clogging pores.</li>
            <li> Great for healing dry skins</li>
            <li> Ok-- I need a richer cream -this one more like lotion.</li>
            <li> Good product. Absorbs quickly with no residue on face. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I am also one of the unlucky people to have a horrible reaction to CeraVe. I heard rave reviews all over Amazon and Reddit about both this product, and the CeraVe Cream in a tub. Both have given me horrid reactions.&lt;br /&gt;First thing that bothers me is that there isn&#x27;t any type of seal on the box or bottle. Cetaphil in the tub has a void sticker when opened. This is minor, but to be noted.&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of this specific moisturizer is, quite frankly, like sperm. Its translucent, a bit watery but kind of gel-like. There isn&#x27;t much of a smell, and it dries completely clear unlike sperm. ;)&lt;br /&gt;My issue? It BURNS my face. Stinging, burning, irritation anywhere I put it on my face. I don&#x27;t have any special disease, just somewhat sensitive skin. My skin broke out a few days after that one application. Sadly, I had to throw out the rest of the bottle. I also have this same reaction to CeraVe in the tub.</li>
            <li> Impressive! I wasn&#x27;t impressed with the smell, but that dissipates quick and does not irritate my sensitive skin. It leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized without having any kind of film or gunkiness on it. I will definitely be ordering this again!</li>
            <li> Love the way my face feels. Non greasy.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended the Ceravae AM and PM as a skin regimen to balance my skin and address some dryness. I use the PM nightly and my skin feels great.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year and I love this and it&#x27;s partner, AM.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice oil free moisturizer, very gentle and really works.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t just use this on my face or just at night. I found myself using it frequently through this really harsh winter to protect my skin. I run outside whenever possible and this helped keep my skin from getting wind burnt or drying out this winter. I have tapered its use as it has gotten warmer but still use a pump or two before bed.</li>
            <li> Great non oily lotion that does not feel heavy on your face.</li>
            <li> This cream is awesome. I use this and the Am SPF 30 because I have eczema and also because these creams have amazing expensive ingredients like ceramides. I always get compliments on my skin and it beats spending 200$ or more on department store creams. I do alternate with Renova which gives me amazing results but this stuff really is good.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for almost a half year now and I am really glad to have found this product.  I have incredibly sensitive rosacea skin and this is the only product in stores that I have found that works for me without giving me skin irritation.  The only thing before this that I found was Lynda Sy&#x27;s moisturizing sunscreen, which I had to order online, but she went out of business years ago.  Since then, it has been a struggle preventing my skin from getting irritated, until I finally found this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dermatologists have recommended Cetaphil in the past, but even that irritated my skin.  This CeraVe PM lotion is light and non-greasy.  It goes on and in easily.  It does a great job of moisturizing without irritating.  My skin had to adjust a little at first, with some minor bumps here and there, which still happens sometimes, but nothing serious.  All-in-all a great buy and I&#x27;d be suffering without it.  Thanks, CeraVe, and I hope that you continue making this great product because it has been a miracle lotion for me.</li>
            <li> I used Retin-A for a long time and now use Differin. Both are prescription retinoids that are really irritating and can result in red, angry, peeling skin if you aren&#x27;t careful. This moisturizer cures all of that. It helps with redness (I&#x27;m assuming from the niacinamide) and keeps my skin from getting too dry or irritated. No flaky patches, even in winter! It doesn&#x27;t break me out at all either. I&#x27;ve gone through several bottles of this and highly recommend it for those of you with sensitive skin or who use a retinoid product.</li>
            <li> Love it... I am still testing it. I dislike cream with a lot of ingredients. CeraVe just cpncentrates on what is good. My skin looks better.</li>
            <li> Used it as a moisturizer. Not sure how it would compare to other facial lotions but I felt like it did not irritate or cause me to have any break outs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*4 stars because I could not put the lotion near my lip--due to the smell giving me a head ache.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate my acne-prone skin, and provides much needed moisture without being too heavy/greasy. I use this nightly during the fall/winter after I shower, and it helps my combination skin from getting too dry. I could easily wear this under my makeup as an AM, but I chose to apply at night because I use an SPF moisturizer in the morning. I also use CeraVe in the tub for when my skin is literally flaking/cracking, but that formula breaks me out (this one though, doesn&#x27;t).</li>
            <li> It was too greasy for me.  I gave it to a friend.  I really like CeraVe&#x27;s moisturizing lotion (for body), and I&#x27;d heard good things about this face lotion.  But it made me greasy and I started to break out.  So I went back to my Clinique Dramatically Different moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Same product, better price. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and easy to apply, especially when you just want to go to bed!</li>
            <li> After reading all the positive reviews I decided to give this product a try for my recent Rocasea flair up. The skin on my forehead, cheeks and nose was red, itchy and pores were enlarged. After using the CeraVe night cream my skin turned fire engine red, the skin under my eyes swelled up and stayed that way for 24 hrs even though I immediately washed the product off. I am not sure why my skin had such an adverse reaction to this product except for the fact that my skin is extremely sensitive. Needless to say I returned it back to the store for a full refund. I am still looking for a product that can calm the redness without compounding it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a excellent product. I like the product anytime, I recomended this because is really what I was expecting to receive.</li>
            <li> Works great, I&#x27;d suggest taking one a day at first if you have a more sensitive subject but it really cleans you out and makes you feel lighter</li>
            <li> I found the smell repugnant. I&#x27;ll describe it as medical smell. It was so bad I couldn&#x27;t wait to wash it off. Also too greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for two weeks and like how my skin looks and feels.  It is very moist and makes me feel youthful.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for moisturizing. It&#x27;s not real greasy either. Having the heat on in cold weather is drying. This helped  tremendously  for that.</li>
            <li> Parabens!!! Parabens!!!  THIS PRODUCT HAS PARABENS!  Over time, parabens accumulate in the human body and cause harm, are associated with metabolic harm!!  Many companies, as in Johnson and Johnson, have taken parabens out due to the cries and complaints of customers--mothers complained so much to J&amp;J that they finally took them out.  Unforuntately, I have been suckered by products that are supposed to be good, by ordering them-- only to find out when I get the product at home, that they include parabens.  This product (CeraVe is supposed to be good, right?) has Methylparaben and Propylparaben, and they appear to try to slide it by the consumer by NOT even revealing it online.  So, busy consumer does not suspect.  It goes back immediately.  I would give good grades if it weren&#x27;t for the slow poison of the parabens that are contained within the product.  I do not like to pay for ingredients that are bad for the body, even though the company finds them cheap and good &#x27;preservatives&#x27;.</li>
            <li> This has been a really great night lotion and for the price its almost a steal. I&#x27;ve had wonderful results and don&#x27;t have to worry about my skin anymore with different color spots or imperfections after using this.</li>
            <li> I think I read about this on Reddit, and have been looking for an affordable, but useful face lotion.  I use it day and night and near my eyes.  I love it.  It is not greasy, and although it has not turned back the hands of time, I am sure it is doing something useful.  I do go without make-up and my skin tone feels more even, although I started other skin care products (recommended by Reddit) at the same time.  I have not stopped using various ones to determine the usefulness of each one.  I don&#x27;t like lotions where I have to stick my hand in the big, open jar, so this is also nice in packaging and easy to travel with.  I think the price is also very reasonable.</li>
            <li> this lotion is light.  feels good.  no breakouts.  seems to help skin discoloration/blemishes/melasma</li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin. This lotion has been a life saver. I use Cerave Hydrating Cleanser and then this Facial PM lotion every night. In the morning I splash with water and then apply this lotion. Works great!</li>
            <li> My dermo recommened that I use this lotion. I love it...it does the job and I purchase it over and over again. I use the AM one as well.</li>
            <li> Was using an Equate Beauty lotion for years and was sick of my red, dry, skin.  Bought a rotating facial brush and some Aveeno Ultra Calming cleanser and lotion, that I quickly returned after my skin felt like it was on fire after 1 use.  I read the reviews for Cerave and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I wish this PM lotion was a little less expensive or came in a larger amount, but I will buy it again.  I did not purchase the AM lotion as I was unsure if the SPF would irritate my face like the Aveeno (also with SPF) did.  For 3 weeks now, every night,  I use the Cerave Hydrating cleanser on my facial brush, rinse the cleanser off and put the PM lotion on.  1 1/2 pumps is pleny, sometimes 1 pump, of this light lotion.  The oderless lotion does not feel heavy or greasy and my skin improved within a day or 2.  There was a couple of nights I missed, so I used it 1st thing in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;Love this product!</li>
            <li> Years ago a dermatology resident at a Boston Hospital (no names please!) recommended this for my face.  Works great, love it! Very inexpensive compared to all the other less useful stuff on the market.  No pretty bottle or advertising, just good stuff!</li>
            <li> Contains parabens! Do your research before deciding which moisturizer is best for your skin AND for your body&#x27;s overall health!</li>
            <li> Hydrating!  Exactly what one wants from a moisturizer, right?  I love that the moisture I get from this product is not greasy at all.  It&#x27;s like a clean moisture, if that makes sense--simple goodness, no muss or fuss.  It says &amp;#34;PM&amp;#34; but I use it in the daytime as well.  I also own the version with SPF, and the consistency of that version is different from this one.  The SPF day version is creamy, whereas this is almost gel-like in consistency.  Again, I think why this applies so lightly is because of that consistency.  It packs a good punch, though, for something so light in texture.  I find my skin is well-hydrated all day with this product, and it helps to impart that glow I love underneath my makeup.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and can break out easily, this is a nice light oil-free lotion that is non-irritating. If your skin is dry, this may not be enough or you may have to re-apply.</li>
            <li> I have occasional eczema and sensitive skin. I have finally found an EXCELLENT night cream! I love it! It moisturizes, and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin. I will still occasionally use my go to night treatments - Vitamin E and olive oil if my skin really needs a moisture boost, but this is really good.</li>
            <li> Its good not only on your face, but also at your hands and your knees, where there is bump!</li>
            <li> Broke out in red bumps after using this lotion.</li>
            <li> One of all time best drugstore moisturizers! Very gentle and moisturizing! I&#x27;ve used it for a year now as my nighttime moisturizer and will continue to repurchase!</li>
            <li> Container allows you to get out all product, versus the pumpers that just do not. I wish I had  &amp;#34;Before&amp;#34; picture...the area around my eyes is much less puffy. It lives up to its claims, and leaves my face soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Always love this lotion. The only lotion that treated my dry chapped facial skin</li>
            <li> This is a good night moisturizer. It absorbs quickly, which is nice, but I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s worth the extra money. I don&#x27;t see any major differences in my skin after using this.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive.  Anytime I wear something different, I start breaking out.  I rinse my face with Cerave and day and night moisturizers are Cerave.  My face doesn&#x27;t breakout anymore.  Now if only I can get rid of those old spots.  I use the the day and night moisturizers and I have not had any problems.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer so much I use it both in the morning and in the evening.  It&#x27;s silky in texture (very similar to a primer), absorbs quickly, is not greasy and really makes my skin soft and smooth, and most importantly, it doesn&#x27;t break me out, which so many other facial moisturizers I&#x27;ve used in the past have done.  Very pleased!</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading all the reviews and was really looking forward to it.  However, it was way to greasy for me so I gave it away.</li>
            <li> My skin does not react kindly to the change in weather. The recent switch to cold, dry, wintery air had completely parched my face and left me with an embarrassing flaky complexion. I tried the expen$$$ive cream that got me through last winter, but it wasn&#x27;t really solving the problem - merely moisturizing for a few hours, after which my face would begin to crack again. Make-up just made things look worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter this drugstore savior. I bought it off the shelves on a whim and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I could literally feel the moisture being restored on the first application. The product is light, with a very faint but pleasant smell and it blends into my skin unlike any other moisturizer I&#x27;ve used. After applying, my face feels velvety soft, and when I wake up in the morning, my face is still moisturized. I know this is the PM formula, but I&#x27;ve also used a few dabs in the morning and it keeps my face moisturized all day. I haven&#x27;t had a single flake since I started using this product a week ago. This has been the best beauty find of the year for me - I only wish I&#x27;d discovered it sooner.</li>
            <li> I went to a dermatologist to examine pimples on this 78 year old face, after treatment the doctor suggested I use Cerave AM and PM and the cleanser.  Result no more pimples around the cheek and chin area.  I&#x27;m sold on these products, no more expensive, greasy, over the counter creams and lotions just daily Cerave products.</li>
            <li> absorb very well, smooth .like it so much</li>
            <li> An affordable face moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Don&#x27;t limit yourself to just night time. You can use it in the day as well.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizing lotion i have used. Keeps my skin from flaking.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist gave me samples for the PM and the AM lotion and now I&#x27;m hooked. I&#x27;ve gotten the Cerave moisturizing body lotion and the facial wash. I use Tazorac, a very strong prescription Retin A cream that I sometimes apply a bit too heavily. I also have eczema and sometimes get patches on my face but I hate to use too much of the steroid cream since it thins skin when used long term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when my skin starts to peel or get flaky, this is the only cream that helps. Neutrogena always makes my face burn and Cetaphil does when it is in this kind of dry state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was on two rounds of Accutane so moisturizers are kind of an obsession of mine. I just wish Cerave would make a lip balm and under eye cream and maybe tinted moisturizer...</li>
            <li> Only thing I use is this line of products.  Doctor recommended for me and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I like this moisturizer and gave it four stars because of its good ingredients and quality, but don&#x27;t try to wear it during the day if you have oily skin. It&#x27;s pretty shiny. I tried it under my makeup once because I liked how my skin felt in the morning after a night of wear and it went everywhere. My mistake, as it is a PM moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and great!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Simple and cheap, yet great for my skin. This was recommended by my doctor. Amazon&#x27;s price is cheaper than the drug store.</li>
            <li> totally in love with it...great looking skin - non greasy on my combination skin.  I was skeptical of using it since I have combination skin but if you use Cerave cleanser (oily skin) then this works out good.</li>
            <li> Great for my rosacea. Also recommended by the rosacea web site.  I Love this product have continued to by it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have insanely sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t break me out or cause itchy rashes. I use a ton of it because I like how it makes it feel so much. I&#x27;m really fair and when I get the tiniest blemish, a red spot stays forever. I think it helps fade them, too. I&#x27;ve read lactic acid can do that. I&#x27;ve gotten my mom hooked on it, too. I always have a backup bottle on hand.</li>
            <li> A great product, which I use day and night on my dry areas!  It has ceramindes, hyrulonic acid, and niacinmides, for a mere 12 bucks, if you gathered all those products from Olay, Loreal, and other companies you would spend 75 dollars or more.  It is a gel cream formula, that sinks right into the skin.  Your dermatologist would recommend this!</li>
            <li> I just encountered a terrible skin allergy, and my face was covered in red and swollen blisters. My doctor ran a skin test with common household chemicals, and found out I am extremely allergic to Methylchloroisothiazolinone (MCI)/Methylisothiazolinone (MI), which can be found in most household cleaners, make-up, shampoo/conditioners and body cleansers. She recommended this lotion for my daily routine, and it&#x27;s been working great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had throw away everything that contains MCI/MI and have been using CeraVe AM &amp; PM. My skin feels and look great now. I would totally recommend this lotion to anyone who has sensitive/allergic skin.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. It&#x27;s non-iritating, non-greasy, unscented and effective for moderately dry skin. Unlike some other nighttime moisturizers, it&#x27;s not gloppy or gooey, just lovely and smooth. I&#x27;d prefer some extra anti-oxidants in the product, but for the price, I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> This is the best, gentle moisturizer. I am sensitive to many products, but this is fine. It does help with neck wrinkles. Highly recommended for anyone.</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with The CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser at nights and I love it. Keeps the face smooth and moisturized and clear looking. Doesn&#x27;t clog pores. It&#x27;s NOT a super heavy moisturizer, it&#x27;s very light, but even though it&#x27;s light, it still makes the skin feel properly moisturized after application. This is perfect for summer nights, but for people with super dry skin, especially in the winter, I would advise you pair this up with a light skin oil to boost the moisture if this isn&#x27;t heavy enough for you. During this harsh winter, I paired it up with Maracuja oil (patted it on over it) on super dry nights. If you&#x27;re looking for a heavy moisturizer or even something that is super moisturizing for very thirsty skin, you may not want to get this. But if you are OK with a light moisturizer that soaks right into the skin giving just enough moisture and leaves no oily residue feeling, this is for you.</li>
            <li> The packaging says it is a night creme.  I use it day and night .  Feels good, but for me,  no visible results that make me happy.  It is just a moisturizer.  Nice packaging and is unscented ,  which I like .</li>
            <li> Love this product and the whole CeraVe line. CeraVe is recommended by dermatologists for not having any chemicals or artificial colors or dyes in their products, and the result is evident. Since discovering CeraVe a couple years ago, I don&#x27;t use anything else on my skin. I have tried every lotion out there prior to finding CeraVe (Aveeno, Olay, Hempz, etc.) and this is by far the best. The technology that they use is built around ceramides, which lock in the moisture to your skin before it ever leaves. Great for even acne-prone or problem skin, as it is very light yet effective. I do wish their bottles were such that you could get every bit of the product out (like their tubs of body lotion and cream), but will continue to buy this product because I believe in it!</li>
            <li> This is the only facial lotion I use. It isn&#x27;t greasy. It is lightweight and I am left feeling clean. I use it morning and night. Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, plan to use it for the foreseeable future. Just wish I could say the same about the AM version, which unfortunately doesn&#x27;t work with my skin at all. But I highly recommend the PM.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to EVERYTHING on my face! I&#x27;ve been using Coconut oil and Olive Oil which do not penetrate into the skin. This product using just a dab around my eyes has been AWESOME!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this pm facial lotion, the am facial lotion and the hydrating cleanser and like I said in my review for the am facial lotion, I am not getting the big deal. This one is slightly better than the am lotion, but not by much. It absorbs super quick and somehow leaves my skin feeling dry within 5 min. There has been no change in the redness I get on my cheeks and the texture of my skin is still the same.</li>
            <li> I will never use any other moisturizer. I use this day and night. My dry skin has already been improving. My redness has also decreased. This is not heavy at all and absorbs completely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been told over and over from my friends and in the magazines that I should moisturize before going to bed. I have always been hesitant to try this because I already have pretty oily skin and I thought it might make it worse. Boy was I wrong! I have noticed a clear difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance since I started using the CeraVe PM lotions. My skin is a lot more supple and the color is brighter. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> This is good for my skin. I use this every morning and night. I like it.</li>
            <li> I really like Cerave products.  I swear by their SA moisturizing cream, their hydrating cleanser and foaming facial cleanser, and I use their moisturizing cream for my daughter&#x27;s eczema.  All of those products work great.  So I decided to give this moisturizer a try, as I was looking for a good, cheap and basic moisturizer for day and night.  It has a lot of great ingredients, like ceramides, niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this products caused my skin to breakout in cystic acne.  My skin is not particularly sensitive, but it is acne-prone and combination-oily.  I wanted to like this product because I knew it wouldn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy like a lot of moisturizers do.  That wasn&#x27;t the case.  Looking up the ingredients, I&#x27;m pretty sure the culprit is Polyglyceryl-3-Diisostearate, an acne irritant.  I will try to avoid that in future moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin &amp;#34;baby soft&amp;#34; and hydrated. My pores are minimized and three fine wrinkles disappear as the skin pumps. Great for my sensitive skin. Happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Not recomended - contains PARABENS!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Purchased this on advise of a friend, who said her dermatologist suggested she save money on expensive face creams and get cerave instead.  So I gave it a try as it costs 1/10 what my normal creams do.  Well, just as I expected, you get what you pay for.  My face broke out all over my cheeks, forehead and chin within about 3 days of using this.  My skin also burned.  I switched off all creams except bare bones clinique dramtically different lotion for about 3 days to give my skin time to calm down and return to normal.  CeraVe may be working for some people but not for me.</li>
            <li> I started using CeraVe after seeing amazing results on my son&#x27;s excema. This is my favorite moisturizer. I choose to use it for daytime as well as nighttime. The PM formula is light weight, and absorbs well into my skin. It does not leave a greasy feeling. I find that the AM formula is a little too sunscreen-like, it sits on top of my skin and doesn&#x27;t absorb as well. (Yes, I know the PM formula provides no sun protection... I use other products to help with that.) What I like best is that using the PM Lotion, along with CeraVe facial cleanser, seems to have all but cleared up my acne.</li>
            <li> This is a life savior when you have acne and the cremes the doctors prescribe you dry your skin out.</li>
            <li> Love this- my face feels so clean and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I used Cerave without incident for about 6 months when I began to notice it was becoming very hard to find. It helped with the rosacea problem I sometimes experienced and cleared up some patches of dried out/hyperpigmented skin from a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; face wash I used that brutalized my skin a while back. I used it all over my face/neck/under eyes w/ good results. When I did see it on shelves again, the packaging had changed. Apparently the formula had as well. When I used it as I always had, my face became extremely dry/red and irritated, especially under my eyes. It&#x27;s been almost 2 and a half MONTHS and the skin under my eyes is still crinkly, dried out and flaking in areas, only from using it two times!! When I smile I have tons of fine lines that were not there before. I&#x27;m HOPING that it&#x27;s just a case of extreme dry skin and will diminish in time. When I emailed the company to tell them about this, they did not even bother getting back to me. I emailed them a second time basically ranting and raving and they finally got back to me and told me that Cerave is safe to use under the eyes and I should contact a Cerave representative by phone. Gee, thanks. They never denied that the formula had been changed, so I&#x27;m thinking that they might have bumped up the amount of niacinamide when they \\&quot;repackaged\\&quot; it, which caused the reaction. Either that or I just have really bad luck with skin care sometimes! If anyone out there is considering using this product, I would be very careful and test it out first. I wouldn&#x27;t want the same thing to happen to someone else!</li>
            <li> I use this moisturizer every morning under my sunscreen like a serum.  I can&#x27;t recommend it enough.  It will keep your skin moist and protected all day without any greasiness.  Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> A really great moisturiser with higher amounts of ceramide that is generally only found in Elizabeth Arden products.  Can&#x27;t even get this in Australia! Works fantastically under makeup and doesn&#x27;t make my sensitive,  dry skin react.  May not be hydrating enough for winter,  however.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer I have ever used in my life, I will never use nothing else again after using this. I use the pm only, and in the am also and it is perfect!!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin drier. I don&#x27;t know what is this lotion for because I haven&#x27;t seen any positive difference on my skin.</li>
            <li> In my other review of the Cerave Moisturizing Lotion, I mentioned that I also use this facial moisturizer and that I am totally satisfied and happy that I switched over from Aveeno.  Being acne prone, it is important to use a non-comedogenic lotion.  Also I am sensitive to how a lotion makes my skin feel, and this lotion allows my skin to feel like it can breathe....not all plugged up as some moisturizers do.  In fact, I have been using this lotion for a couple of months now and I  would say my acne has significantly improved.</li>
            <li> Amazing! My sister has a skincare line which I use. After I used this product for a week, she remarked how smooth my face looks!</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist for dry skin and it has made a big difference, I hate lotions but this is greaseless and odorless, I&#x27;m going on my 2nd bottle in about 8 months now.</li>
            <li> I purchased this when I finally decided I was a grown up and should not be using my AM moisturizer (that has sunscreen) at night.  Why waste the product?  It is as light as air and does the job.  My pores are prone to clogging and I was delighted that this product didnt give me even a hint of that gunky feeling that most skin products leave behind.&lt;br /&gt;I am cutting and pasting a review from beautypeida that I find useful (below).  I think you are getting department store quality at drug store pricing.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;CeraVe’s first official facial moisturizer isn’t too far removed from their well-formulated body moisturizers. That’s great because their formulas contain outstanding blends of emollients and skin-identical ingredients. This facial moisturizer is a very good option for normal to dry skin. In addition to numerous skin-identical ingredients, it contains a generous amount of the cell-communicating ingredient niacinamide, which offers multiple benefits. Its lightweight cream texture provides substantial moisture. This fragrance-free moisturizer is highly recommended for sensitive or rosacea-affected skin, hence the high rating. The only formulary drawback is the lack of antioxidants, but you can remedy that by applying an antioxidant-rich serum under or over Facial Moisturizing Lotion PM.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love it! I use it day and night, and when I use it in days, I use sunscreen. I use it as a base before serum and lotion.</li>
            <li> I really love this moisturizer! I have quite sensitive, reactive skin, and using this consistently has really improved my complexion. The lotion has a great consistency, and has no fragrance, which I appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I am going to try and phase it out of my skincare routine. The list of ingredients is a bit scary, and I really dislike that it contains parabens. Just not something I want to be putting on my skin night after night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll say it again. I love this face lotion. It&#x27;s not greasy at all. A few seconds after you apply it it&#x27;s gone but your face is smooth to the touch. I have dry skin in the winter. This lotion is wonderful.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is just okay.  I had severely dry skin on my fact after a long and harsh winter.  The description and the reviews made it look like this will help.  But it didn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s very light gel-like cream.  I don&#x27;t recommend it for very dry skin.  It didn&#x27;t help with it.  Ultimately the Cetaphil Restoraderm Skin Restoring Moisturizer did the trick for me.</li>
            <li> I love this! first tried it out at me dermatologist, when in for acne treatments and she told me to buy this and gave me a few examples that was back in 09, since then this is the ONLY moisturizer I buy, I have tried so many and this is the only that helps me  and does not irritated my skin giving me more breakouts, it says pm but I use it for both am and pm (every time i wash my face)&lt;br /&gt;I have oily, dry skin :/ and go thru a lot of breakouts around that time in the month.&lt;br /&gt;my 6 yr old son uses it as well as my husband no complains yet except that this in the only place i can find it at an ok price, in the store cost a little more</li>
            <li> I love that this doesn&#x27;t have sunscreen added to it!  I use it both day and night and use a separate mineral sunscreen which is my preference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to the sun. After I got some allergic pimples due to just moderate sunshine, I applied this thinking it was for sensitive skin. Alas, shortly after applying this product, my whole face stings, even where I thought was not damaged by the sun. Maybe my skin is too sensitive.</li>
            <li> great lightweight moisturizer. lighter than cetaphil.  i use it any time of the day unless i require SPF.  The &amp;#34;daytime&amp;#34; version of this is actually just facial sunscreen, which you wouldnt want to wear everyday</li>
            <li> its a very light formula, it absorbs fast and so far no bad reactions and i suffer from dermatitis so i must be very careful with what i use in my skin.</li>
            <li> I recently started using CeraVe&#x27;s Hydrating Facial Wash and the PM Facial Lotion. First things - the price difference makes me really happy, and the difference in my skin is wonderful! So smooth, no longer bumpy, and my skin feels like it&#x27;s &amp;#34;healing&amp;#34; from the past few years of being stripped by harsh chemicals/improper products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love that it&#x27;s a pump bottle - clean and sanitary, easy to use, and I know the exact amount to put on my face. Docked one star because I&#x27;m pretty sure this won&#x27;t be hydrating enough for NY winters, but this formula is perfect for the humid summers.</li>
            <li> Great lightweight moisturiser which doesn&#x27;t break me out. I also like the pump bottle and how the pump can be twisted to turn on and off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve almost finished my first bottle of this Cerave pm lotion, and it&#x27;s wonderful.  So gentle, and it&#x27;s packed with excellent ingredients like hyaluronic acid, ceramides and niacinamide.  I can&#x27;t find such a great mixture in the more expensive department store brands!  It was suggested by youtube&#x27;s &amp;#34;Hot and Flashy&amp;#34; lady, Angie, who does major research on skincare products, and came across this little gem...  By the way, Cerave makes loads of other products that are excellent as well.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this lotion, no matter what type skin you have!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this face cream! My dermatologist had recommended it and I cannot live without it :0) It is smooth, luxurious and does not clog pores; it also absorbs quickly and makes skin feel smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> very good!! Wet ,confortable,and seems like  moisture content</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible. So moisturizing but still light. Improves texture and great for an acne regimen. Love ! Better than a lot if expensive alternatives.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and the touch is comfortable, help to keep skin moisty</li>
            <li> She has been using this for several years and she likes it.&lt;br /&gt;We will be buying more of it later on.</li>
            <li> The Cerave line has all the wonderful ingredients as the popular Olay Regenerist products at half the price.  I use the AM Cerave every day.  I would use this PM lotion too, but the smell is horrible and it is a very unusual color of gray.  I just can&#x27;t bring myself to put it on my face.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a gentle, moisturizer with no sunscreen for nighttime use.  Many popular moisturizers have strong scents which I find unpleasant and irritating. This lotion is unscented and light. I have fairly sensitive skin but this doesn&#x27;t seem to cause my skin problems. It contains ingredients found in many more expensive, department store products such as ceramides, niacinamide and hyaluronic acid.  If you need something rich and creamy, this is probably not the product for you - it&#x27;s a lotion and it&#x27;s very light.  But if you are looking for something unscented, lightweight and without sunscreen, this is nice. It&#x27;s not the cheapest of the drugstore brands - the bottle only contains 3 ounces - but I like it well enough to keep buying it.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and this does a great job of keeping my skin well hydrated, but not oily, during both summer and winter. It also helps that this does not break me out!</li>
            <li> Asked a friend what she did for her 67 year old skin (which looks at least 15 years younger) and she recommended this product.  This product applies easily and really moisturizes my skin and reduces appearance of fine lines.</li>
            <li> So lightweight. I use this every night after i wash my face with the CeraVe Foaming Cleanser. I follow it up in the morning with the AM Facial lotion. My face has never looked better! CeraVe has been such a lifesaver for my super-sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> LOVE this moisturizer. My face doesn&#x27;t feel greasy after I put it on and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with acne for over 10 years. I had been looking into alternative treatments because nothing worked and found an article about applying extra moisturizer to attempt to halt the amount of oil your skin produces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got cerave AM &amp; PM because they have very high concentrations of niacinamide and ceramides, which are great for your skin. I just wash my face with water and use these products. My acne has actually cleared up a lot and more importantly my skin tone has evened out from all the scars I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not saying this is an acne cure, but I am saying it has made my skin a lot healthier which resulted in a reduction of acne for me. For the awesome price I would certainly recommend that anyone at least gives it a try.</li>
            <li> I made the switch to this from a heavier night cream I was using after I started breaking out (most likely pregnancy related).  This is a very smooth, light lotion, almost like a serum, that moisturizes fantastically.  My acne cleared up after about a week of use and I have been using it ever since.  However, As much as I do like the feel of it (and the price) because of the parabens I will probably stop using this lotion once the baby is born and my hormones regulate.</li>
            <li> This is marketed towards those with sensitive skin, but something in it makes my gf&#x27;s skin break out in red bumps (she thinks it&#x27;s the hyaluronic acid based on other products she&#x27;s used with similar results). Otherwise a good moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t look or feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I want to like this because it&#x27;s inexpensive and seems to have some good ingredients. But I have pretty dry skin and I&#x27;m not sure it will fit the bill. If you have normal skin, I think it may be perfect. I need something heavier. I like to literally feel the moisture lock in on my face. I&#x27;ll continue to use this until it&#x27;s gone though. May be good for hands and neck.</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan.  many chemicals and parabens in this product.  i switched to something more natural.</li>
            <li> My skin is easily irritated, so much so that I make sure to check that everything is non-comodogenic. It turns out, many common face lotions aren&#x27;t, go figure. CeraVe is though! Yay! I use the PM for both day and night because I dislike the texture/smell of the non-optional spf in the daytime moisturizer. This lotion is fairly light and I would say slightly greasy (just slightly), but nothing that a light powder won&#x27;t take the sheen off of during the day. Still my best go to in a lower price range, won&#x27;t make you break out, goes on thin, great for summer.</li>
            <li> I just put this on my face five hours ago but I am so happy with it already! I have mild seborreic dermatitis, which has been worse recently. I&#x27;ve tried different products to calm it down (without prescriptions) but hadn&#x27;t found the perfect solution. I started using sulfur soap about a week ago which helped with redness and irritation but my face still felt very dry with some flakes. After putting this stuff on (after washing with sulfur soap) my face feels much more moist and really soft. Other moisturizers have irritated my skin. Now I&#x27;m just going to cross my fingers that I don&#x27;t break out or something.</li>
            <li> I like this, but don&#x27;t love it.  It isn&#x27;t as moisturizing as I had hoped, but perhaps I need a &amp;#34;heavier&amp;#34; cream rather than a lotion. Don&#x27;t be put off by that though. It does a nice job, and doesn&#x27;t break out my sensitive skin like many other products have.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this moisturizing lotion. I have very sensitive skin which is very dry during winter and spring months.  I have used several product but none give me the moisture that CeraVe  does so beautifully while not leaving my skin greasy.  I even use a very light layer under my makeup. I waited til my first bottle was almost empty before reviewing because so often a first impression of a product doesn&#x27;t stand up to continual use but this product really has.  Also l haven&#x27;t had any breakouts while using this. Since switching makeup brands and using this my skin is actually clearer than it&#x27;s ever been.</li>
            <li> This product contains the ingredients that are supposed to be good for my skin to moisturize and reduce aging: ceramides, niacinamide, and hyaluronic acid.  I combine it with Josie Maran Argan Oil to help my skin retain the moisture.</li>
            <li> This brand of products was recommended by my dermatologist. Makes my skin feel moisturized in cold, dry winter air. Also makes my skin on my neck seem less stringy.</li>
            <li> I liked the reviews, liked the price. But upon waking up the two times I used it, I looked like I had a sunburn. I have never had a reaction to a cream before. The lotion itself is light feeling, kind of a cream/gel hybrid thing. It leaves a a tight feeling, with an odd oily residue. I just looked up niacinamide. That&#x27;s what does the redness, facial flushing.</li>
            <li> I received this on time. I&#x27;ve been using this product for two years now and I love it! It&#x27;s helped my skin so much!</li>
            <li> Hydrates my skin without making it too oily, I use it before I go to bed and it really recovers my skin from all of the harsh chemicals I use to treat acne. this is great for acne prone, combination skin. Very light.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about the Cerve brand. I love it. I use the AM and Pm moisturizing lotions and love them both. My face always feel so soft and in the summer my face is protected by the sun. I love Cerve. I have been using the product now for several years after dermatologist recommended it to me.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer! Due to medication, I end up with dry, sensitive skin.  This stuff is amazing though.  Keeps my skin soft, smooth and doesn&#x27;t cause irritation or breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use CeraVe&#x27;s PM formula during day and at night, because I the &amp;#34;daytime&amp;#34; formula includes sun-tan lotion, which I tend not to need most of the time.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion - it&#x27;s very lightweight but still hydrating.  No fragrance or other irritants. Ingredients that are beneficial to the skin are included, such as niacinamide, hyuralonic acid, ceramics, and glycerin.  Some potential buyers may be concerned by the presence of very small amounts of parabens (they&#x27;re near the end of the ingredients list), but there is NO valid, scientific evidence that these compounds are harmful (research it yourself if you don&#x27;t believe me).  Although 3 oz. seems a bit small for the price, I find the product to be worth it, and one upside of this size is that you can travel with it.  The pump rotates to a locked position, also good for travel.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite moisturizer.  I learned about it from my dermatologist and was happy to find that it&#x27;s not very expensive at approximately $15/bottle.  It has a lot of ingredients found in department store products at a fraction of the price.  It moisturizes without leaving any greasy residue or shine.  I never break out from this, as I do with many other products.  I have combination skin, and I use both cleansers too.  The main difference between this and the AM formulation is that the PM does not have sunscreen.  If I&#x27;m not going to be outside, I use the PM one during the day since it&#x27;s a little lighter.</li>
            <li> this is my first time trying this product-not sure on how much I like it yet.  Have not had any reactions to it and it is very gentle on my skin.  Think I will try the cream next instead of the lotion</li>
            <li> Read reviews comparing this to Dermalogica&#x27;s Super Rich Repair moisturizer, at a fraction of the price.  I guess it&#x27;s worth the price, but does NOT compare to Dermalogica&#x27;s product!</li>
            <li> Works for me my life partner loved it may be ordering more soon would like larger bottle if possible. Thanks</li>
            <li> I us the AM and PM CeraVe lotions.  I think they work well together.  They make your skin very soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not able to spend a ton of money like so many gals do these days on beauty creams, but  I found this one really decent &amp; does not break the bank for me.</li>
            <li> It was expensive for the size, nothing really fancy about it, it feels oily on skin, doesnt lost that longer compared to other products I used.</li>
            <li> CeraVe is a great moisturizer. Dermatologist at Duke University in North Carolina advised me to get this to hydrate my face. She diagnosed me with extremely dry skin. This has helped sores heal all over my face, that would not heal. It is a miracle. I have Keratosis Polaris and was tearing my skin up trying to get it out. Within 4 days, my husband and I could not believe how much better my skin looked.</li>
            <li> I tried this because the body creme is incredible.  This face creme made my skin look and feel awful.  It became red and tight and dry.  I had to stop using it after 3 days because my skin looked so bad.  But the body creme is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Just a moisturizer.  I saw no difference from this product. I also have the CeraVe AM and felt it also was just a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and use the CeraVe moisturizer everywhere except on my face so I bought this thinking it would be ok, however I cannot use it daily.</li>
            <li> I never review anything on amazon and I feel compelled to say something about this product. I&#x27;ve tried much more expensive face cremes out there but when winter comes I remain red and blotchy from wind/cold damage/dryness, I look like I have some kind of terrible disease. I started using this moisturizer in combination with Rohto Hadalabo Gokujyn Hyaluronic Acid Lotion about a week ago and my skin have never felt smoother or better. HIGHLY recommended if you have a case of eczema in the winter! Also, the lotion is not very thick and oily, but does its job PERFECTLY.</li>
            <li> Also the cream that my dermatologist recommend and that says something. All CeraVe&#x27;s product are good, I find. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I use this every night after cleansing and toning to keep my skin hydrated. I love it. Face feels so soft after rinsing in the morning :)</li>
            <li> Feels really good. I use it before bed, the skin feels smooth and soft  next day I wake up.</li>
            <li> Delivery was as promised.  It seems to be a very nourishing cream and feels light, not heavy.</li>
            <li> Really not much better than the creams I have bought before.  I guess a good moisturizer is just a good moisturizer with one not much better than another, other than this one is not as sticky as some and does absorb very nicely.</li>
            <li> This is really good lotion, I&#x27;ve always been used expensive stuff for my face but to my surprise This light lotion seems job done. I will use this one from now on and will save lots money.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer for day or night. It only says PM because it contains no sunscreen. I use it for both. It is lightweight and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Very nice product a little bit pricey compare to other drugstore product but if u need it u need it</li>
            <li> So far this product is working very well.  It says it is a hydrating product, yet it is not making my face/t-zone oily at all which was a problem for me at night while sleeping...my other night lotions would sit on my skin and end up in my eyes and sting, so rinsing eyes with cold water in the middle of the night was a problem for trying to get back to sleep.  So this has totally stopped using CeraVe&#x27;s night lotion.</li>
            <li> My friend tipped me off to Cereve based on a recommendation from her dermatologist. This is one of only a few lotions I can use that both effectively moisturizes and doesn&#x27;t cause me to eventually break out.  I&#x27;ve been using it consistently for about 3 years.  I&#x27;m in my mid-thirties and have noticed that my wrinkles aren&#x27;t progressing nearly as quickly as they were before I started using this product, so I&#x27;m beyond pleased!  I&#x27;ve found the SPF daytime lotion will make me break out after continuous use for about a week, so I use that more sparingly and give myself a break by using this in between.  This also effectively takes care of dry skin resulting from swimming in chlorinated water.  I love it.  A bottle lasts me about 2 months with daily use.</li>
            <li> I have tried a number of evening moisturizers and am very satisfied with this product. It is not a miracle worker but it is moisturizing without being thick or greasy. The ingredients seem to similar to much more expensive products.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist to promote skin care.&lt;br /&gt;The product goes on smoothly and is quickly absorbed. My face feels smoother&lt;br /&gt;after using for two weeks.</li>
            <li> I had mild acne growing up. My skin cleared up pretty good after using gentle skin cleanser + this product every morning and before going to bed. I likey.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist. It makes my skin feel moisturized. I like the lack of scent. I like the cost too :) I used to use philosophy breathe it in (or similar, it was blue, sparkly, and expensive -.-) and this stuff is as good if not better. My dermatologist recommended Cerave am and pm and foaming face wash.</li>
            <li> Very rich and nourishing to the skin. Less oily than other moisturizers I&#x27;ve used but probably not the best in that department. I&#x27;ve had no problems with breakouts which is great because almost everything breaks me out. Have used for a year and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I have always had dry skin and have found this lotion works well on my face after dealing with others that caused a slight reaction in my skin. I use it for my day time lotion, mostly after taking a shower or washing my face. Nothing exciting, it just does what you would expect it to do which is pretty great in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for anyone that wants a basic facial lotion, even if they have oily skin I think this one would be fine. If someone was dealing with extra dryness or eczema on the face this might not be enough but might be the next best thing if you don&#x27;t want something greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Got this to try and hydrate my skin when using retin a...works wonderfully. It even makes my flaking peel off easily.</li>
            <li> I have been using this facial lotion 2x a day for 5 months and it has become my favorite. I have very sensitive and acne prone skin and this lotion does not irritate my conditions. I feel that my skin is hydrated. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I got a recommendation from a cosmetic review site on CeraVe PM. I was using a more expensive product and thought I would try this one. I had used the CeraVe body lotion and liked it.  The PM works great and has the ingredients I want and none of the stuff I don&#x27;t want. I would suggest you use less of the product than you think you need until you adjust to the consistency. It is a bit greasy at first but then soaks in. My face was still moisturized the next morning. For the price, it is certainly worth the try.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer was recommended by my dermatologist. I have really oily skin in the summer and this is a sheer light coverage and sinks right into my skin. I do not recommend it if you have dry skin since it will not moisturize heavy enough.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great lotion for moisturizing your face but i give it three stars because it gives me white heads. The reason i know that it was this lotion because as soon as i stopped using it, the white heads just stopped coming and slowly going away.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is not sensitive but it is very easy to get white heads and small bumps from some types of lotions.&lt;br /&gt;I guess this one is not for me.</li>
            <li> can not belive how inexpensive this face cream is. i love it. i normally spend high $$ on my creams until i found this</li>
            <li> My daughters dermotolgist recommended this line, I had never heard of it and decided to give it a try. It is very hydrating. My daughter has acne prone skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate it. I have aging skin and it works great for me too.</li>
            <li> I used to have relatively normal skin, but at 28, I now have sensitive combination skin (oily t-zone, flaky on other parts, and normal around the cheeks), and it also has redness. My pores are also getting more visible and I break out with most facial products (cystic acne! yikes!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is reasonable ($14 at Target), and the packaging is simple. The box says it has Ceramides, Niacinamide, and Hyaluronic Acid. I looked them up, and they&#x27;re known to be good for the skin. I also found that they&#x27;re found mostly in more expensive skin care products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency of the lotion is light, and my skin quickly absorbs it. My face doesn&#x27;t feel \\&quot;soft,\\&quot; per se, but it feels hydrated and comforted (my very dry skin feels tight). No more flakes within a day of using, my t-zone isn&#x27;t acting up, no break-outs, and the redness of my face isn&#x27;t flaring up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this both day and night as I can&#x27;t use moisturizers that have spf mixed into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, an excellent product. Cerave proves that great products doesn&#x27;t necessarily need fancy packaging or other expensive whatnot. I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I use this product day and night, I&#x27;m so pleased with it. I tried another night product recently and wasn&#x27;t as happy. I&#x27;ll probably go back to this one. It&#x27;s not too oily or greasy and I love that there is no scent. My dermatologist recommended it and I can see why. It&#x27;s a good lotion that moisturizes without causing any breakouts.</li>
            <li> I use CeraVe because it&#x27;s the only thing that really works to soothe the redness from my rosacea.  I had tried many products, including homemade ones using shea butter and various oils, but nothing works as well as CeraVe.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer for nighttime.&lt;br /&gt;My life is greatly simplified for my routine. I have used the Face wash for years and don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t try this sooner. My skin feels great and looks refreshed in the morning.</li>
            <li> Goes in smooth, not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a year after being recommended to use it by my Dermo. I had two dermatitis spots . It is different then the pm lotion which is nice and smooth on the face, it has sun screen in it so it is thicker. I use to use the pm cream and a sun screen and that was a waste so i converted to both. I use the pm at night and this am during the day. I have oily skin and it also is pron to break outs. I dont get break outs from this cream, it has no sent, Some people complained it did not help. Honestly to see the best results but an am and a pm and use them rotating. Its not that much more expensive and since you rotate it daily it should last twice as long and equal out. During really dry seasons I actually will put on the pm wait 10 min then apply the am for the extra protection. Also please be aware that the cleanser you are using can also be stripping your face and not have any thing to do with the product, many gentile cleansers exist if thats your issue such as cetaphil.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this on Amazon and also at CVS/Walgreens drugstores. I normally wear Murad or Darphin moisturizers at night, which are available only at Neimans or Nordstrom, but I use CeraVe during the day. It&#x27;s not too thick to wear under suncreen and it&#x27;s not greasy at all, that&#x27;s why I love this stuff. I know it says it&#x27;s for nighttime use, but I find it&#x27;s great during the day. Put it on your neck and decolletage...under sunscreen, of course. I love the pump, too, which makes it easy to dispense.&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: they have new packaging, it doesn&#x27;t look like the picture (above) anymore. It&#x27;s in a white box and it says &amp;#34;new look&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Non-irritating and very moisturizing.  Great price for ingredients that sell for 3x the cost under other high-end names.</li>
            <li> I dont give this product a Five Star rating, just because i would like a product for oily skin. It really moisture your face and is non-comedonic what is good for my acne prone skin, but it still leave my skin feeling greasy. I use it every two days trying to not give so much oil to my face.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this for my husband and myself.  It is not greasy and absorbs very well.  Why spend more on all the pricy night creams.</li>
            <li> Very nice lightweight cream.  I live in the desert and it works well enough for our dry climate, and used it while on vacation in Florida and it was light enough to handle the humidity.</li>
            <li> Love it as a great moisturizer! Doesn&#x27;t break out my face at all! Would recommend this moisturizer to anyone with sensitive and problematic skin!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion and use it AM and PM.  The only difference in the AM formula is added chemical sunscreen which I am allergic to.  This has niacin which is supposed to lessen the depth of wrinkles and I think it does help.  The lotion is a nice texture and non greasy which is also nice for using as a AM lotion.</li>
            <li> I use this every morning.  Is light even with the SPF.  It&#x27;s not greasy and doesn&#x27;t clog pores.  I love the whole line!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! Great for sensitive skin. For a long time CeraVe has been the only hand lotion I could use so I thought I&#x27;d try this. Love it.</li>
            <li> CeraVe are my go-to face products</li>
            <li> My craze for a Korean Skincare regimen with the 10 steps has taken over my beauty life.  Importing Korean beauty items is very time consuming and difficult to shipping and language barriers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have learned that some readily available products in the US are very good substitutes with a decent price point.  I needed an occlusive to help &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; the layers of moisture which I am incorporating into my skin. The CeraVe Moisturizing Facial Lotion PM acts like an oil without having to deal with the headache of using an oil.  The ingredients includes ceramide, Niacinamide, and Hyaluronic Acid which are good ingredients for happy skin. It is considered a non comedogenic and gentle to use on skin for a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion on my face for several weeks and I really haven&#x27;t noticed a difference.  I put it on before bed on a clean face.  My skin is soft and I haven&#x27;t had a bad reaction to it -- I just haven&#x27;t noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> I really like this face lotion! I was using neutrogena sensitive skin oil-free moisturizer to help with any dryness before I applied any makeup on face. To me, this lotion works just as good as the neutrogena one. I love them both! Currently I use this CeraVe lotion for morning and night after using Origins Checks and Balances Frothy Face Wash (morning and night as well). Bioderma Sensibio to remove makeup, Origins Checks and Balances to wash face, and then CeraVe moisturizing face lotion - I am set! The CeraVe lotion seems to be great for sensitive, combination skin types!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a nice enough night moisturizer, however it creates an odd smell.  It has no smell out of the bottle, but it develops a sort of diesel smell after application.  At first I thought my sheets needed washing, but after sleuthing it turned out it was the lotion.</li>
            <li> it is awesome &amp; leaves my super dry skin moist - I love it &amp; use the day moisturizer to</li>
            <li> My face was so dry, which caused it to produce a lot of oil. I bought this product hoping to fix this problem, and I love it! I apply it at night after washing my face before I go to bed, then wash it off in the morning. My face is softer, it isn&#x27;t ridiculously dry and oily, and I don&#x27;t feel so self-conscious when I go out. I also adore the little bottle it comes in. Easy to store, and you can twist the cap to lock it to prevent leaks when traveling.</li>
            <li> I really like the adjustable top that ensures I only get exactly as much lotion as I need. Overall a nice lotion that doesn&#x27;t have much fragrance to it, and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or slimy.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. I have dry skin that gets progressively oilier throughout the day. I was using Target&#x27;s Boot No7 and it was making my forehead too greasy by 6pm. This is half the price for twice the product and works fantastic. I won&#x27;t be using any other brand.</li>
            <li> This lotion started working immediately. It isn&#x27;t greasy at all. The very next morning my face already felt more smooth and healthy.  After one week&#x27;s use I&#x27;m visually seeing a difference in my skin. It looks healthier and so I&#x27;m using less foundation.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Doesn&#x27;t take much to go a long way, so it lasts for a good while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost finished with this bottle and I&#x27;ve been using it every night. It&#x27;s much cheaper than some of the products out there. Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need expensive or ~fancy~ creams from nieman marcus and what not. You really don&#x27;t. Cerave works wonders. It was recommended to me by dermatologist, and I love it. I wish I had been using it my entire life.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. I have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use much at all on it. This doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin in the least. It absorbs quickly without being sticky or greasy. It keeps my skin from getting chapped in the winter. I even prefer it to some higher priced department store brands. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Love the way it moisturizes my face without making it feel too greasy. Fragrance-free makes it nice. You don&#x27;t have to tolerate a strong fragrance on your face.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have researched the ingredients first.  This stuff has Propylparaben in it which is highly toxic and causes endocrine disruption.  It also has Methylparaben which is also nasty.  I don&#x27;t really care how it works at this point.  It&#x27;s going in the trash.  Check your products here:  http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/</li>
            <li> I really like CeraVe, recommended by my doctor. I live in a very dry climate and it was too light for me.</li>
            <li> My skin was constantly flaking.  I have sensitive skin. I tried multiple moisturizers. This was the only thing that stopped the flakes without causing me to break out.</li>
            <li> I have exceptionally dry skin on my forehead and have used a variety of lotions throughout my life.  This one was recommended by my dermatologist and I now use it daily.  I have since re-ordered the product since I am very pleased with the results I have had using it.</li>
            <li> I use this product because my face tends to dry up after I take a shower and it&#x27;s really annoying and embarrassing. It makes my face soft and smooth. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I use the AM daily and love this product; therefore, when I found out there is a PM moisturizing, I had to try it.</li>
            <li> I saw the strong rating on this product and decided to give it a try, since it was also pretty inexpensive compare to dept. store brands (e.g., Estee Lauder, Clinique). So far, I like it! It offers the right amount of moisture to my face without leaving it feeling greasy. I will continue to buy and use this product!!</li>
            <li> I have never found a good night time moisturizer as I only use olive oil, coconut oil, and/or argan oil on my face to moisturize day and night and since it&#x27;s winter and the air has changed and much cooler, my face changed alot as well, being flakey and dry! None of my oils have been working but I bought this last night and tried it last night and WOW my face looks fantastic! Now I want to buy the AM one. It brought back moisture to my face instantly and when I woke up this morning, my face looks GREAT.. I am a little concerned about some of the ingredients but as long as it&#x27;s not past hazardous 5 then I guess I&#x27;m ok with it. I constantly check with cosmeticdatabase.com with hazards in beauty products and also baby products and deoderant...basically anything you can think of! I will be back to update in a month or so to let you know how my face is doing and how it reacts to this product as my face is sensitive and I can usually tell if a product is no good depending on how my pores react and the color of my face sometimes is blotchy red spots with harsh ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/11/15:&lt;br /&gt;I do not use this but once in a blue moon I will try it but I think I made up my mind lol I haven&#x27;t used this for a loooong time now!</li>
            <li> I used this lotion three times and it made me break out terribly.  Five large, red, painful zits appeared overnight... the kind that justify a sick day from work!  It seems to work for most people, but the ingredients are very irritating to my dry, sensitive skin.  I did like the feel of it on my skin.  It&#x27;s non-greasy and hydrating.  Guess I&#x27;ll use it as a hand lotion.</li>
            <li> I understand that this is a popular product, and it was very well reviewed on Beautipedia (with praise for the ingredients, esp niacinamide), but it did not work at all for me. Every time I used this moisturizer, I woke up with.... a ton of dry skin. I don&#x27;t usually have any dry skin! Other moisturizers (day or night) have not done this to me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure this might be a lovely product for many, but for me, it worked terribly.</li>
            <li> like it when my skin is dry, but I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to give it a full review.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice anything different from other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> A great product. Ceramides, Hyaluronic acid, and niacinamide all in one moisturizer is a rare find. I use this in the morning and at night.</li>
            <li> My favorite night cream so far.</li>
            <li> not bad however if you have sensitive skin be careful no breakouts but did burn my skin a bit it is just really strong so i mix it with cetaphil regular lotion and it is much better it just tones it down a bit</li>
            <li> This review is coming from a firefighter who works around the clock.  Event at work I like to put moisturizing lotion on before bed.  When I get up for a call in the middle of the night I still need to look presentable to the people that I&#x27;m helping.  The CeraVe is perfect for me because unlike others lotions I&#x27;ve use it absorbs into my skin and you can&#x27;t tell it&#x27;s on.  Some of the other moisturizers I have use make my face look shinny and glossy and that&#x27;s not the best look at 1am.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist. Very light yet effective.</li>
            <li> Recommended by a dermatologist.  I just started using it.  I am 64, and this moisturizes without being greasy.</li>
            <li> Great product for a reasonable price.  My dermatologist is recommending this brand.  Unfortunately I had an allergic reaction to this product, but my husband loves the CeraVe line.</li>
            <li> Light, non greasy, wonderfully mild.</li>
            <li> I used expensive creams for years. After the birth of my son I started getting breakouts, and my dermatologist recommended this over the expensive creams. I would say this works just as good as La Mer at a 10th of the cost and no more breakouts.</li>
            <li> BETTER than lotions costing 2 or 3 or 4 times as much ... and i&#x27;ve tried them all ... i also bought the CeraVe eye lotion; it&#x27;s a terrific addition for my eyes at night</li>
            <li> This product is the only CeraVe product that I can give even an OK rating to. I have been using it nightly for a couple of months and see no more difference in my skin than using the Nivea cream that I have used for many years. All the CeraVe products are coating (even their cleansers) making them unsuitable for daytime use for anyone who is active or lives in a hot humid climate because they trap sweat and make your face look wet. Plus, if I use any on my nose I break out in these weird, deep pimples, and I am 60 years old! I won&#x27;t buy it again and will go back to Nivea or stick with the SkinCeutical products that my dermatologist recommends.</li>
            <li> I use a cerave body lotion that I really like....So I decided to give this facial one a try......well it is very thick! I realize its a night cream but an hour later I could still see small patches on my skin. It did not absorb into the skin ....to be fair I do have combination skin and it  is also sensitive...that said it did not irritate it....but how many hours will it take to fully absorb into the skin? well I will try it again and see in the morning if its completely absorbed without any white patches left behind....I am thinking maybe its better for someone with drier skin then mine....</li>
            <li> ever since my five month old developed moderate eczema, i have bought a litany of lotions - some very expensive.  however, none have been more efficacious than cerave.  it was recommended to me by two people, a physician&#x27;s assistant (who uses it personally) and a dermatologist.  you can find it at any major retailer e.g. walmart, target, cvs, etc..  i highly recommend this lotion to anyone with skin issues, young or old.</li>
            <li> makes my skin feel great!  I use a lot.  I have used all sorts of creams; creme de la mer and other high end brands.  This was recommended by my derm and I love it.  Will buy in bulk!</li>
            <li> A great moisturizer for face, hands, and any dry skin.  Sometimes my dry skin is very itchy and most moisturizers can sting.  This one is soothing, not too greasy, and has good ingredients for your skin.</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t nearly as thick and hydrating as other night creams. It feels like an average day moisturizer. I have dry/normal skin, and I found that this moisturizer didn&#x27;t keep my skin hydrated through the night, even when I kept reapplying it. I also broke out a little bit, but I don&#x27;t know if this product is to blame. I love the CeraVe hydrating cleanser, but this product wasn&#x27;t anything special.</li>
            <li> As soon as I put this on, I loved it. It doesn&#x27;t just sit on your skin. It soaks in and makes your skin feel naturally hydrated. You can put makeup over it without waiting a long time for it to dry. But here&#x27;s what really made me fall in love.. I woke up this morning and my skin was plumped up. For months I&#x27;ve had little dimply looking things on my cheeks and little tiny vertical lines that drive me crazy bc I&#x27;m only 26. It&#x27;s like i lost fat in my cheeks or something and when i smile, all these little dimples show up like i have loose skin and it&#x27;s so annoying. I&#x27;ve tried hyarulonic acid serum with vitamin c and it barely did anything but this plumped my skin right up and they&#x27;re barely noticeable after ONE time of using this. I didn&#x27;t even put it on when I went to bed, just yesterday before my makeup.. But today i woke up my skin feels hydrated and looks plump long after washing it off. Hopefully it keeps working :)</li>
            <li> Am I the only one with a drawer or cabinet full of skin care products?  Over the years, I&#x27;ve found some that I like better than others, but I still feel the need to try out new stuff that I hear about. Great products are not always about price, but a couple of my favorite moisturizers were high-priced products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad that I finally found out about CeraVe PM.  I was at my dermatologist&#x27;s office for a check on a tiny odd mole they&#x27;d removed (good news...an innocent little thing!).  They had pamphlets for an expensive skin care line with niacin.  While she was checking the incision area, I asked her if the products were really that good.  Of course, I was looking to add more to my \\&quot;collection.\\&quot;  Instead, she informed me that her business partner was the one promoting that line and she recommended a much less expensive product that was every bit as good...this CeraVe PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion has ceramides, hyaluronic acid, triglycerides, niacinamide...all things that make a big difference on your skin.  It also FEELS good going on.  Rather than a greasy feel, it&#x27;s just a light, water-based, fragrance-free lotion that smoothes on easily.  I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin, but I love the fact that CeraVe PM doesn&#x27;t have any potentially irritating ingredients such as fragrances or dyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And you can&#x27;t beat the price for what this moisturizer does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still have my drawer-full of other products.  But I leave this little pump bottle out on the bathroom counter within reach of my husband&#x27;s side of the vanity.  He&#x27;s never been one to have a concern about skin care, but I&#x27;ve noticed him occasionally adding some to areas of his face that are drier, too.</li>
            <li> I like the moisturizer but it&#x27;s definitely not the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This stuff feels so wonderful on my skin that I don&#x27;t even know how to describe it...  I can&#x27;t think of anything to compare it to.  I am 56 years old, but have had a problem with zits continuing all the way through my life so far...  CeraVe has proven itself to not cause new zits for me, when I&#x27;ve been sure that other face creams ~ though not greasy at all ~ have.</li>
            <li> so far so good, but it does have an odor</li>
            <li> better than day for sure, but still not that great</li>
            <li> Nice feeling, absorbs quickly, but after 4 continous weeks of use I still have the same dry areas that I started with.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion. During the winter I use the PM during the day as well. It goes on very light and feels wonderful! No stickiness or heavy feeling. Doesnt block your pores. Well worth the extra few bucks compared to typical face lotion.</li>
            <li> I read about this online; like many of the other reviewers, I&#x27;ve had various skin issues over the years and have become something of a skin care junkie/expert. Recently, I&#x27;ve had problems with a &amp;#34;rash&amp;#34; on my chin: whiteheads (and occasional pimples) under the skin, redness, peeling, itching. Since I&#x27;ve had eczema since birth, I kept piling on the heavy moisturizer to fight the apparent dryness (peeling), but it didn&#x27;t help. Research online finally led me to conclude it was seborrheic dermatitis, probably caused by overplucking of the chin area. I did try the famous &amp;#34;honey mask&amp;#34; touted online; it helped, but just coconut oil for moisturizing wasn&#x27;t cutting it (I&#x27;m in my fifites). I saw that this has ceramides and NO fragrance or other irritating substances, and it was on sale locally...Long story short, I have almost finished my first bottle (already bought the second). While it hasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;cured&amp;#34; the SD, combined with gentle cleansing and keeping my paws off, my chin is vastly improved.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried, hands down. I use it at night after cleansing. Does not irritate sensitive skin, and does an amazing job - you won&#x27;t find a better moisturizer than this at any price.</li>
            <li> This is a great night cream.  I wake up noticing my face glowing!  I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s with &amp;#34; normal skin&amp;#34; and not a lot  of wrinkles.  I was looking for a night cream that would be impacting on my skin.  I have tried other creams before bed and in the morning I have not noticed any affects.  This cream is also not grease, which is just great.</li>
            <li> makes my skin smoother, minimizes pores</li>
            <li> I have always had quite dry (but not too dry) skin with extremely sensitive spots under my eyes and near my cheekbones. Ive tried many many moisturizers, and had to eliminate ones with spf once I realized it was the main culprit making my skin burn while applying moisturizer. Since then I&#x27;ve tried many that are without spf and claim to be for dry sensitive skin, but they all still irritate my sensitive spots and don&#x27;t really moisturize my skin as i feel it becoming dry in one or two hours again, or just thick gloops that make me break out.&lt;br /&gt;Cerave does none of this. Its fantastically moisturizing yet light as air, and actually makes your skin better and healthier -so really does more than just moisturize your skin. However I did find that it still slightly tingles my sensitive spots, but I&#x27;ve tried every other thing out there, all of which burn and irritate, and this one is the best I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> A couple of years ago, I started seeing a dermatologist for still having acne at 35yrs old.  It&#x27;s taken me a long time to find a combination of products that actually help, that I can actually afford, and that my dermatologist doesn&#x27;t make a face at.  My skin often feels dry, but I have to be very careful not to use products that make my skin oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the first products I found I loved was the Cereve foaming wash.  Finding a moisturizer was so much more difficult!  Moisturizers always seem 1) Not moisturizing enough or 2) Feel heavy and too oily.  After going through 5-7 types of moisturizers (some very expensive), I finally was smart enough to see what Cereve had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product based on the price and good reviews.  My 12 year old daughter is also fighting some early acne and learning how to care for her skin.  We both love the foaming facial wash (it stays in the bathroom), and now we&#x27;re fighting over this moisturizer!  Nearly every day, she stashes this moisturizer in her room and I have to go hunt in down - so I&#x27;m back for another one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The benefits of this product are simple.  It actually moisturizes (for real), goes on easy, doesn&#x27;t leave our faces feeling like we have crap left on them, and the price is very right!  If it works for dry middle aged skin AND oily tweenager skin, I think we have a solid winner!</li>
            <li> I use this on my combo oily/normal skin at night.  It absorbs well, and does not make my face feel greasy. This moisturizer is light, yet does a great job of moisturizing.  It has helped my fine lines so much!  I would buy this again, and I would recommend this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This brand did not moisturize my dry skin at all.  I returned it.  I ended up buying Oil of Olay Rengenerist night cream. It is working great.  Moisturizing, evening out my skin tone and no break outs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing product, but I am concerned about the parabens. Therefore I am looking for alternatives. I hope they will leave out the parabens at some point in the future.</li>
            <li> Without fragrance，good！</li>
            <li> I have used so many different moisturizers and this one is no doubt one anyone should have in their repertoire. I use retinol and sometimes I throw in skinceuticals retexturizing activator. I have per the years used so many expensive products that its hard to accept something this cheap to be better but it is. With all the thugs I do to exfoliate and renew I&#x27;m 32 years old and this is my go to for a night of guaranteed moisture. I will never be without it because I am so picky over my sun screen I use this sometimes in the day when my skin needs moisture. Trust me.. This is science at its best. Take advantage of what they did u wont regret it.</li>
            <li> I hoped that this would be a good facial lotion for my sensitive skin, but it really was a complete dud. I used it twice, and my entire face became splotchy and red. I was afraid to show my face for a week while it subsided. Too bad, I had high hopes based on other reviews.</li>
            <li> Its has only been one night, but I definitely  notice that my crazy flaky dry skins is drinking this stuff up. Its silky, normal consistence, and has no smell. Most of my dry patches were gone in the morning, some that were a bit more severe were slightly lingering. I&#x27;m sure with a few more applications they will be non existent. If that much change happened in one night, I have no doubt that it can only get better. I wish I would&#x27;ve done a before and after close up shot of these areas to show the difference, I know when I&#x27;m shopping I value that kind of testimony.</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer.  Used more expensive, but this is just as effective.  No mineral oil or any oils and does not break me out.  I have sensitive skin prone to  breakouts from certain products - but this is just soothing.</li>
            <li> Four stars m&#x27;er f&#x27;er. This s*** makes my skin feel good. Princess status. I will recommend it throughout my kingdom. It shall be the foremost moisturizer of the ages.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn like other night creams, no scent, feels pretty good.</li>
            <li> Thanks to reviewers we tried this again. I had purchased it years ago at the dermatologist&#x27;s recommendation for my teenage son.  We never used it though because his skin was so oily that it seemed wrong to put lotion on. That was a mistake.  We tried all sorts of prescription strength creams that even when they worked just made his skin leathery.  We finally stops that two months ago and his face is been great since using a plain cleanser in the morning and Persagel to spot treat, and then wash with 10% Pan oxyl (also dermatologist recommendation) in the evening followed by this Cerave PM lotion.  It seems to be the missing piece of the puzzle all these years.</li>
            <li> Has not clogged me yet and have been using this for about 3 weeks :o :)</li>
            <li> I was looking for a great quality, won&#x27;t clog pores, and won&#x27;t hurt my wallet. It was a long journey before I stumble upon CeraVe Moisturizer PM. I love the fact this lotion hydrate my combo type of skin, it&#x27;s moisture, no sticky or oily feels and it&#x27;s just soak into my skin right away, I choose the PM one, because it&#x27;s more hydrate and more versatile for AM and PM usage. I can add my Neutrogena SPF30 after for morning regimen and without SPF for evening regimen.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and this was recommended to me by a dermatologist for using as a moisturizer at night.  It does not make my skin flare or burn.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, the amount is less than the imagination.</li>
            <li> Excellent product if you have sensitive skin. Recommended by my dermatologist. Much cheaper than buying it in the store.</li>
            <li> A nice light-weight moisturizer, I use this in the AM right before my sunblock, and in the pm with a drop or two of argan oil.  My skin has acted very calm overall, despite a very stressful month.  Overall, excellent buy- I will buy again when I run out.  Also, I love the pump!</li>
            <li> Rich &amp; nourishing yet absorbs well. Your skin feels supple and clean in the morning. Is like CeraVe&#x27;s hydrating cleanser, too.</li>
            <li> I have been using Cerave Cream all over my body including my face for about a year. I thought I would try the facial PM product. THIS STUFF IS AMAZING!!!  It&#x27;s like it locks in the moisture in my face and neck. I&#x27;m in love with this product!! TRY IT!</li>
            <li> CeraVe comes in a light cream, containing alcohol derivatives that seemed so diluted it instantly dried off my dry skin.  It also aggravated my eczema (the spots I repeatedly applied on slowly turned red over time).  It also stings to apply on dry to extremely dry skin, which is not necessarily the case with all lotions.  Overall my skin showed no moisture as claimed by their &amp;#34;patented controlled release of ingredients&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s time for me to move on to another product.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, nice product. After use it more than one month, I think is helping my skin, AM version is too heavy for me, PM cream absorbs quick.</li>
            <li> This is a great product recommended by my dermatologist.  During the winter months, my skin gets so incredibly dry, but this moisturizes without the oily feeling.</li>
            <li> I get extremely dry skin on my face, especially during the winter months.  My skin will crack and peel while I am at the office and it can be extremely gross and embarrassing for others to see this.  I&#x27;ve tried many other facial moisturizers, but CeraVe PM is the very first product I&#x27;ve found that actually keeps my dryness under control.  When my face is especially dry I wear this cream at night before bed and in the morning after washing my face but before putting on makeup.  It does not make my face feel sticky or heavy, and creates a smooth surface for makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love my CeraVe and I don&#x27;t know where I would be without it.  This comes highly recommended with a very satisfied CeraVe user!</li>
            <li> This is a great night moisturizer.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy even after a night&#x27;s sleep.  I&#x27;m new to the CeraVe line after hearing many people rave about it and so far, I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I have very sensitive skin, but there are many products I can and do use.  This product dramatically irritated my skin (inflamed, sensitive to touch, etc.) for a couple of days.  I tried it twice, a week or so apart, and tried sticking it out for several days, but my skin did not adjust.  I gave the product to my mom...</li>
            <li> Wonderful moisturizer for the price.  I have been using it for years and it is great.  I would recommend for all skin types.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer to use at night! It has a water-y feel and glides on smoothly, my skin absorbs it quickly and it hydrates my skin very well. I wake up with a bit of oil in my t-zone, but I have combination skin so naturally that&#x27;s expected. Overall another great product by CeraVe that doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts. :-)</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin!  I was suffering from dry, flaky, painful skin around my mouth after changing face washes.  I&#x27;ve been using this for about two weeks.  It works better than expensive Clinique, Lancome, etc.  I love this product!  I even bought a second bottle!</li>
            <li> using it druing the day instead of PM, find it a bit light for me for night time.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin (dry patches on cheeks and forehead) and my T-Zone (nose &amp; inbetween my eyes) gets slightly greasy at times, mostly from products (makeup, creams, lotions, etc.).  The dry patches can get so bad at times that they become break outs, they are severly red and they were causing fine lines to appear on my forehead.  I live in Vegas so the sun/heat exposure and lack of humidity doesn&#x27;t help at all.  I have tried a ton of products, from the expensive to the inexpensive, creams for sensitive skin, dry skin, comination skin, skin with breakouts, products that are all natural, organic...blah blah blah.  You name it, I&#x27;ve tried it.  Then I read about this lotion.  Now, I have found that most PM lotions tend to be on the thicker side and get very greasy which tends to clog my pores and break me out all over within a day or two.  I found this to be extremely hydrating and suprisingly extremely light.  It absorbed quickly and made my face feel soft and smooth.  By the next morning my dry patches on my cheeks were diminished greatly, the redness in my face was almost gone and my face was still soft and smooth with no greasy feel in my T-Zone area.  I was hooked.  I have been using it since.  Dry patches are all gone.  My fine lines on my forehead have diminished significantly and my face looks and feels more even toned.  My makeup goes on more evenly and smoothly where as before it was looking powedery and settling into the fine lines and making the dry patches look worse.  I can&#x27;t believe I went all this time without trying this product out.  I past it right by all because it didn&#x27;t have the fancy labels or attractive boxes and I haven&#x27;t seen too many if any commercial for it.  But if you ask a person who suffers from extreme dry skin, they will tell you about CeraVe products.  I combine using this with the CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser to clean my face morning and night and it&#x27;s a winning combo!!</li>
            <li> I have acne-prone, oily skin that NEEDS hydration but tends to break out from any lotion under the sun.  However, two of my dermatologists recommended the Cerave line so I decided to take the plunge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cerave PM is now my holy grail. It&#x27;s surprisingly light and watery, with a gel-like texture. It sinks in SUPER quickly, so you need to rub it in quickly and use about 2-3 pumps for your whole face. It comes in a travel-friendly pump bottle that is just the right size and structure for bringing on an airplane if you need to (you can lock the pump by turning it 90 degrees). There&#x27;s no noticeable smell, which is great for people who are sensitive to scents. It provides just enough hydration for my skin without feeling heavy or oily afterwards. (NOTE: I don&#x27;t think this would provide enough hydration for dryer skin types).</li>
            <li> Great basic moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on accutane twice.  The second time I planned ahead and used this AM and PM and had hardly any of the severe dryness I had the first go-round.  Very good moisturizer. Also was recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Great nighttime &amp;#34;no sun screen lotion&amp;#34;, put it on before you go to sleep and wake up with your skin rejuvenated. Ladies love the smooth skin, these are the 2000&#x27;s and everybody needs to take care of their appearance.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it and uses it daily.  He prefers night over daytime because the sunscreen; says makes skin feel greasy (although I disagree).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been faithfully using CeraVe for over three years now. I use to have oily skin and hated the feeling of thick lotion! I started using this to wear under my make up and haven&#x27;t looked back! Face never had that greasy shine that other lotions like cetaphil lotion gave me. I use the cetaphil normal to oily wash though, it&#x27;s be pretty good thus far. I personally feel the combo between CeraVe PM and Cetaphil daily facial wash both twice a day healed my oily skin problem!</li>
            <li> I actually stumbled upon this product after reading an interview of a famous person that said this was one of their favorite products. I figured it was worth a try. I really like it, especially as it is so hard to find a moisturizer without a sunblock (many sunblocks bother me). CeraVe PM feels great on my sensitive skin. I use it for day and night moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for healing irritated skin.  I use it all the time....not just at night.  It really sinks in, and is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> have been using it on rocasea skin for 3 month now. decent moisturizer and no reaction from my very sensitive skin. recommend.</li>
            <li> I have combination, acne-prone skin, which is a pain in winter up in the northeast. Finally decided it was time to change my winter skincare routine, so I researched my butt off and this was the product I decided to go with. My skin isn&#x27;t super sensitive, but I&#x27;m just trying to avoid aggravating it as much as possible while I deal with (what is now) my adult acne. This moisturizer isn&#x27;t scented, it doesn&#x27;t contain a skin irritants, and it certainly lives up to CeraVe&#x27;s excellent reputation. It does a great job of softening up rough patches of skin without provoking an acne flare-up. I definitely wake up in the morning with a little bit of a slick face, but I wash in the mornings anyways and I don&#x27;t mind as long as it doesn&#x27;t cause any zits, which it definitely hasn&#x27;t for me. I mostly get oily skin, mild acne and blackheads in my nose and chin area, especially the parentheses - for lack of a better term - from the corners of my nose, around the corners of my mouth, and down the outside crease of my chin. I don&#x27;t necessarily apply cream there, unless my skin is particularly dry, but when I do I don&#x27;t notice any break outs or extra blackheads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely wouldn&#x27;t use it during the day (also because it&#x27;s not SPF), and I&#x27;ll probably switch to a gel-based moisturizer now that the summer months are approaching, but it does the trick for me in winter!</li>
            <li> This is just right for night time cream. Unscented, light, and smoothing. I find my face feels and looks better in the morning. It may be my imagination but maybe not!</li>
            <li> Gentle on my skin and works well with medication my dermatologist prescribed. I this it is a light moisturizer and does exactly what is promised!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this cream broke me out but I have not so clear skin but my family uses this facial cream and loves it!</li>
            <li> I have combo skin, (oily/adult acne/dry winter). I love CeraVe PM b/c i can put this light lotion all over my face, neck, and under eyes along w/ my other nightly prescribed acne facial regiment, it does not leave my face greasy. It works for me better than OTC lotions. I can even use it around my eyes w/ no irritation like many other lotions. I will continue to use CeraVe, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Cerave makes an excellent product. My dermatologist recommends it. I&#x27;m using it with their daytime SPF 30 moisturizer. This must be ordered with a more expensive purchase to ship for free with Prime, but Amazon&#x27;s price is quite a bit cheaper than Walgreens or Walmart. It&#x27;s a lighter weight moisturizer than I&#x27;m used to, but it has been working very well.</li>
            <li> Not as good as introduced.  It</li>
            <li> I currently use Cerave AM moisturizing lotion so this was a natural. My daughter is a dermatologist and suggested this product.I really like it. Not greasy.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive, feels light and never greasy. In the past, I always forget to apply lotion but this feels so good after my shave, I always remember...Great!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer, I have sensitive acne prone skin. The prescriptions that I have to use to control my acne tend to dry out my face so I need to use a moisturizer. But when I have used other moisturizers my skin turns into a greasy mess. But not with this product. It doesn&#x27;t break my skin out and gives me just the right amount of moisture that I need. I feel like my skin can still breathe. Big Fan!</li>
            <li> I did not notice any difference in my skin, such as wrinkle reduction or firmness. I am still on the hunt for a firmibg  and wrinkle cream that actually works.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea. My skin is dry and sensitive. I have a very hard time finding a moisturizer that is heavy enough to work, yet not leave a greasy film. While this one doesn&#x27;t pack enough punch to use alone during the dry winter, it is good during the warmer, more humid months. In the winter, I have to use a prescription lotion and another protectant.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this item. I thought it was on sale at duane reade but ended up being more than I thought. I use the facial foam cleanser by Cerave twice a day but my skin was still dry especially due to the cold weather. This so far has been a miracle in clearing my skin since I broke out in acne from the cold weather. My skin feels soft and is glowing. My routine is usually to apply it at night after I have watched my face with the foam cleanser. I wonder what the difference is with the AM lotion?</li>
            <li> Feelings light and not greasy at all. After about a week or so - noticed that my skin actually looked &amp;#34;plumper&amp;#34; (which is a good thing at 44 :)..). Also noticed a healthy &amp;#34;glow.&amp;#34;  I use it day and night - and out my sunscreen over it during the day. May try the day time kind with sunscreen built in - but like the way my skin looks so much - why ruin a good thing!</li>
            <li> I have skin problems and this works very well in keeping it in check, as I have a tendency to dry out on my cheeks and so far so good!</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling soft and not greasy!</li>
            <li> works great my only complaint is that I want to buy it in a larger size!&lt;br /&gt;We also now used other CeraVe products such as CeraVe Moisturizing Cream and Lotion&lt;br /&gt;dermatologist recommended and our pediatrician recommended can&#x27;t go wrong&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ASIN: B000YJ2SLG&lt;br /&gt;ASIN: B001V9SXXU</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this stuff is awesome. Super mild on your skin and very hydrating as well. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of stuff and I wake up in the morning with an oily face. Using this stuff doesn&#x27;t make that happen.</li>
            <li> Best facial lotion out there for anyone even if you have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> its an ok product line if you want something cheap in the house to have for guests or want to take this traveling</li>
            <li> This is a truly wonderful moisturizer!  I watched a youtube vlog where someone raved about it so I took a chance and purchased it.  I&#x27;m so glad I did!  I have very sensitive skin that breaks out from everything...until now!  The great thing is that it absorbs right into the skin, is not greasy and doesn&#x27;t flake off when applying foundation.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> This keeps my skin so nice and happy.  Light and non-greasy yet intensely moisturizing. Stops any irritation overnight. Wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it!!! Early 20s sensitive acne-prone</li>
            <li> i have been dealing with acne since 14 ( 28 now). I have tried all possible formulas and moisturizers over 14 years. Some dermatologists are impressed how much info I know about creams and lotions for oily and acne prone skin. This is the best so far I had. How ever , one chooses product to his or her liking.</li>
            <li> CeraVe is modestly priced and certainly has all the right ingredients. I can see from the reviews that this is magic for some and for a handful, no idea why, it does encourage pimples etc. It&#x27;s not right for me and will spend the rest of its short life on my very dry arms and legs. Alas, I loved the price.</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;m not sure if it was just me but CeraVe did crazy things to my face, made it SUPER red, irritated, itchy and burned on fire. NOW, I was using Differin, which is a topical oinment for acne that makes your face red too...but CeraVe with Acne medication - NO GO. I wanted to love this because everyone loves it but it just wasn&#x27;t for me. I have been using Murad Clarifying Cleanser and Philosophy Purity Cleanser with Josie Maron oil at night. It&#x27;s helped calm down the redness and helped with breakouts.</li>
            <li> I love Cerave! My dermatologist told me about it years ago and it&#x27;s the only brand of moisturizer I use on my face. I have combination skin (but mostly oily) and it&#x27;s been problematic for most of my life. I&#x27;ve always struggled with my sensitive skin and this product is perfect! I&#x27;ve tried knock off brands and it&#x27;s not the same.</li>
            <li> From the 1st time I applied this product I LOVED it -- immediately made &amp; continues to make my face &amp; neck skin feel sooo soft.  Would highly recommend it.  At times I have sensitive skin, depending on what I&#x27;m trying out to battle wrinkles, but have had absolutely NO reaction to this awesome product!!  Also LoVe that it doesn&#x27;t cost major $$$ to own it.  Will be trying other products in the CeraVe line!!!  :)</li>
            <li> I think this is the best product I&#x27;ve ever tried. I&#x27;ve spend a small fortune on products from Clinique, Estee Lauder even Proactive. my main concern is that i have combination skin type which leads me to the breakouts from using inappropriate products.  even proactive burned my skin, and left me with tons of wrinkles. after watching a video from Youtube.com  ([...] i decided to use this products from Cerave along with the scrub( forgot the name). and it really worked wonders for me. no break outs, no visible wrinkles. my skin looks great. although i did one procedure of plasma lifting( which fights the sines of aging and acne).&lt;br /&gt;The price of Cearve is great, i think much more less then the quality itself.&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck....</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist.  Once I started using it, it was clearly better than my old facial moisturizer.  It&#x27;s often out of stock at my local stores, so I&#x27;m glad to get on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for three months now and it has become a staple in my beauty regimen. After an extensive research I found that this product it&#x27;s simple enough, meaning free of harsh chemicals, and does the job just right in moisturizing my skin overnight. It leaves my face soft &amp; supple without over drying or breaking out. Great natural product with an affordable price. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love this product, never had any issues with CeraVe Products, goes on evenly and absorbs quickly!  Great night time moisturizer!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this night lotion ever since it was suggested by my dermatologist.  I figure she knows what she is talking about and actually used this product herself.  Great deal on Amazon too.</li>
            <li> Cerave it&#x27;s the best moisturizer you will use.  I used to have extremely oily skin and about two years ago started researching how to deal with this issue.  I found numerous studies indicating that the skin and scalp over produce oil trying to compensate for the harsh stripping products that we use to correct that.  So in drying your skin it becomes oily trying to save itself.  Well I decided to give it a try and do what in my mind seemed very counterproductive, as I started to use regularly moisturizers and drinking water regularly my skin balanced out beautifully.  I tried a few high quality and high $$ products and finally gave Cerave products a try after reading many recommendations on the web.  They work beautifully and the PM lotion absorbs like a dream.  I won&#x27;t use anything else, I use the entire line except the AM moisturizer which I find does not work that well for me.  I use it on my neck a shoulders but I stick to Paula&#x27;s Choice for the face SPF moisturizer, that is the into instance where I deviate from Cerave.</li>
            <li> Use it every day. Goes on smoothly and is a great under my foundation</li>
            <li> I have been using this every night for years, but it&#x27;s not always easy to find at my local Target or CVS. I like to keep it in a cool place and put it on after a shower. It doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts and moisturizes my skin beautifully.</li>
            <li> this left a weird film on my face and made me break out the very next day. I have dry but sensitive skin thay can be acne prone when i use the wrong thing</li>
            <li> I had read about this cream yahoo and am very satisfied with it.&lt;br /&gt;my skin is dry and this product is great for the price.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion. I use it year round, during the day and at night. It absorbs well and still provides the moisture my skin needs. I have Rosacea and many of the other lotions irritate it. CeraVe PM has little to no odor and no tingling or burning. This one doesn&#x27;t cause any problems at all. I can&#x27;t even use the SPF CeraVe Day Lotion which is a great product as well. My 16 year old used some and the next day asked for a bottle of her own. It&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> It is very comfortable to use, but moisturizing enough, suitable for use in summer</li>
            <li> ok but moisturizing enough in the winter. my skin still feels dry after two applications. however it did seem to get rid of some dark lines on my neck post-pregnancy.</li>
            <li> Wow I love the texture of this stuff. It&#x27;s lightweight, sort of pearlescent and with the right content of niacinamide (~5%) and lots of ceramides. I&#x27;m really, really pleased with it. Layers well under my sunscreen in the morning.</li>
            <li> I did not realize that this product contains parabens or I would not have ordered it.  It is my fault for not checking carefully.  It won&#x27;t happen again!  I will not use it because of these ingredients even though it contains other great ingredients.</li>
            <li> The Lord led me to this moisturizer and I have been really pleased with the outcome.  My husband made the comment recently that my face is so soft and pretty.  This lotion is derma. tested and created to replenish your skins need for hydration (particularly in aging skin),  I am really happy with the results and will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing and I truly loved it.  What&#x27;s upsetting to me is that over the past month (after using it for about 2) I&#x27;ve developed a reaction to it where my face got large flat red spots and itched like crazy.  I also developed contact dermatitis and had a bad breakout of eczema all over my face.  It took some heavy duty prescriptions to make it go away.  This was the first lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried that actually moisturized my skin and got rid of the dry flaky patches on my face.  I&#x27;ve got combination skin and it seemed to even it out for me. I even noticed that my foundation went on smoother and lasted longer when using the lotion.  I&#x27;m pretty bummed that it didn&#x27;t work out for me.  My 16yo son is now using it and his skin no longer dry, so far he hasn&#x27;t had the same reaction as I did.  Hopefully it will continue to work for him.  Even though it caused a reaction for me i totally recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> Good product, like how it feels, not greasy or oily, but moist well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got very sensitive skin so I make a great guinea pig for these things, and no reservations -  this is a great product.  No redness, itching, no trouble at all. Its not greasy, it doesn&#x27;t have any smell (fragrance or fatty smell), my skin is healthy-looking and well moisturized all day. I use this day and night because I didn&#x27;t want the sunscreen in it, but this product is really good so I&#x27;m going to try the &amp;#34;daytime&amp;#34; one with the sunscreen too. If everyone knew what I know about this product now, they&#x27;d never spend $20, $50, $100 or more for a face cream. I used to use Aveda&#x27;s All Sensitive line which was great, but they discontinued it two years ago. Then I bounced around between a bunch of others (Keihl&#x27;s, Strivectin, etc) that didn&#x27;t work out for various reasons (oily, redness, pimples, cost, etc). I still use those brands for other things and am not knocking them, but so long as CeraVe keeps this product unchanged, and at this price, I&#x27;ll never use anything else. This is the best out there, and its 12 bucks.  Strong recommendation here, especially for those with sensitive or problem skin. If you guys at CeraVe are reading this - please just don&#x27;t change a thing.</li>
            <li> I tried this cream after hearing a recommendation from a friend.  I tried it myself and found it average.  I am 56 years old.  I felt this cream did not add moisture as well as some of the other creams I have tried.  Maybe it will work for someone, but not for me.  I now use it on my hands before bed.  It seems to work better for me on my hands.</li>
            <li> Who knew you can get a great product without spending much! My skin is feeling great and it is not too heavy. love it.</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion.  It does not require much.  Three pumps.&lt;br /&gt;does left and right of the face and then the neck.  It feels&lt;br /&gt;wonderful and is not greasy or messy.  This is a new product&lt;br /&gt;for me and the best I have ever used.  All of the CeraVe&lt;br /&gt;products I have used are good and inexpensive.  Hope it&lt;br /&gt;stays that way.  A dermatologist recommended the products.</li>
            <li> CeraVe is a great line for people with sensitive skin or eczema, and this product is no exception.  It moisturizes well, doesn&#x27;t break me out, and never irritates.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;m ordering this moisturizer, I also own one of their body lotions. I really like the CeraVe products, they have many good ingredients to improve the health of your skin and hardly any irritants (it&#x27;s fragrance free!). I check EWG for most of the products I use, this lotion has a danger rating of 3 out of 10 (which is good, very few products have a rating of 0). This moisturizer is light weight, which works well with my oily skin. I alternate between this and a heavier moisturizer, which I use after an exfoliating mask. The container is small and the head can turn to lock, so it&#x27;s great for travel. I also like the pump style dispenser because it is more sanitary and helps preserve the beneficial additives in the lotion.</li>
            <li> I use Retin-A, so must use a non-active moisturizer (one without retinol or all other hosts of stuff found in serums/moisturizers these days).  I use this one at night, and Cerave AM (with sunscreen) during the day.  It also has niacinimide, which is usually only found in much more expensive products.  There&#x27;s probably not a dermatologist on the planet that *doesn&#x27;t* recommend this stuff.  And the price?!!  OMG...what a bargain!</li>
            <li> This is the lotion I use daily.  It is very non-irritating and not greasy at all.  I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> nice product for evening seems to work well and not have a chemical smell. I use a serum underneath it but probably don&#x27;t need to</li>
            <li> CeraVe is the only face wash/moisturizer that my daughter and I are able to use. She has psoriasis and I have sebhorric dermatitis that flares when we use anything else. Not only does CeraVe help to calm a flare up - it also prevents them. It&#x27;s been a full year since our daughter has had a flare up, and while not that long for me- it is MUCH less than it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;The product absorbs into the skin quickly leaving soft and smoothe skin with NO oily residue. I use it under makeup and again after washing at night.&lt;br /&gt;I have not yet tried the AM formula but plan to pick some up soon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for months now, its truely amazing. It has really improved my skin, may take some time but if you stick with it you&#x27;ll be very pleased. I use it everynight even after derma rolling, for the price this little bottle goes a long way and works wonders. I had a ton of dark marks after a trial of some bad acne they slowly began to fade away using Cerave PM Lotion. Its been a life saver for me and I actually purchsed it by accident.. Ha!! Who Knew...</li>
            <li> I heard dermatologists on satellite radio mention CeraVe.  They like the ingredients ceramides, niacinamide and hyaluronic acid.  I thought it sounded like a sensible product and the cost is reasonable.  I have used it each night now for a few weeks.  You hardly know you are using it.  It is odorless, non-irritating , absorbs rapidly and has not caused breakouts.  It has helped the dry patches of my aging skin. I plan to continue using it.</li>
            <li> I used to use Cetaphil moisturizer at night time, but my skin didn&#x27;t seem to handle it too well. I was bothered by its greasy feeling. It never seemed to soak into my skin, and I could still feel a heavy film of lotion on my face when I woke up in the morning. Cetaphil also had a tendency to make my face sting at times, especially when my skin was dry. I know it&#x27;s great from some people, but for me, Cerave was better suited for my skin. It&#x27;s more lightweight (but still very moisturizing), it absorbs well, never feels greasy, and I have never experienced any sort of a burning sensation with it.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion that I have ever used! Other products make me break out, but not this one!</li>
            <li> It is okay for me. The tiny bottle could be bigger for the price.</li>
            <li> not for me, break outs</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic night cream. It is a thin odorless lotion. However, it packs a tremendous moisturizing punch. I purchased this product because it was awarded the best night cream for dry skin 2012 by In Style Magazine and I have not regretted that decision. I am on my second bottle. It leaves my skin soft without weighing it down. It also fully absorbs after application which is my only complaint against its AM counterpart. I would even use this lotion as my primary day lotion as well (as long as I could supplement with adequate sun block protection.) This is definitely a solid product worth trying out.</li>
            <li> I have eczema on my eyelids and cheek. The skin there is very sensitive and easily irritated. So far this is the best product for my face eczema. It deffinitely calms it and is not greasy. Though my eczema still persists :-(</li>
            <li> Great for moisturizing without the greasiness.  I use it during the day also and I have really fry skin. Cheap compared to other ones out there that contains hyaluronic. Will buy again from this company. Prompt service.</li>
            <li> If you suffer from super dry skin this is a great facial lotion for any time of day (despite the pm label). Best to use it directly after getting out of the shower or washing your face when it can really soak in and prevent dryness from occurring.</li>
            <li> Product is a little thinner in consistency than I&#x27;d anticipated (almost gel-like) however have been using for several days and liking the results. Needed a strong PM moisturizer for after Retin-A application and this one seems to be working well. Doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation and keeping my skin hydrated better than some other lotions I&#x27;ve tried. I also like that it has quality ingredients.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product because of the wonderful reviews, but it is so drying for my face.  I&#x27;ve even tried spraying my face with water before putting it on.  It always makes my face look like the life has been sucked right out.  So disappointed.  I decided to use it for pedicures.</li>
            <li> A must have lotion for night time application, men and women.</li>
            <li> This lotion is simply the best you can buy for its price point.That being said I&#x27;ve noticed alot of reviews saying after using this product it felt like their face was on fire or they broke out,warning niacinimide aka vitamin b3 can cause an allergic reaction in certain people so make sure your not allergic to it.the only thing missing in this lotion is antioxidants which I easily remedy by mixing some acure marula oil in with this then I&#x27;m covered.I usually put this on before bed on top of my retin a and I&#x27;ve also used this underneath my foundation and have had no problems whatsoever.highly recommend if your skin can handle the niacinimide in this product.</li>
            <li> Really like this moisturizer.  I have very sensitive skin and this product does not irritate at all.  I use it twice daily, morning and night.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product but it&#x27;s not suitable for my oily skin, it&#x27;s too heavy even though it&#x27;s lighter than the stuff in the tub or the regular lotion with the pump. Please, CeraVe, come up with a gel moisturizer for oily skin!!! I adore the cleanser for normal to oily skin.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy, my go to facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and sealed package. it&#x27;s more like a gel serum than a lotion. I have been using this for a year now and totally love it, and I&#x27;ve tried tons of other (rather expensive) products. This was recommended to my by 2 dermatologists in Seattle and LA, and I can see why. keeps skin smooth, hydrated, and fresh.</li>
            <li> I used this along with the Phytoceramides w/ Lipowheat (350mg) tabs. Seemed to work well together.&lt;br /&gt;I will definately order the Lotion again. It is very nice.</li>
            <li> I use this daily to moisturize my face.  It moisturizes your face for a pretty long time and doesn&#x27;t leave a dry or sticky feeling.  Will definitely be buying some more after I run out.</li>
            <li> great product, my dermatologist recomended it to me. i have acne prone skin, this product doesnt seem to clog my pours. the texture is perfect its not to liquidy or too clumppy. it soaks in perfectly feeling like its not even on your skin after. it gives you the right amount of hydration for your face.</li>
            <li> This does a great job moisturizing my face without introducing an onslaught of bulbous pimples.</li>
            <li> Small bumps ALL OVER my face for a couple days after first use. Tried it once more with the same result. To be fair, I do have somewhat sensitive facial skin, as this has happened to me before, but NEVER to this degree! Two or three bumps max is what I get when I try a new facial cream. I was shocked and disheartened when I looked in the mirror the next morning :(&lt;br /&gt;But I bought the body &amp;#34;Moisturizing Cream&amp;#34; from CeraVe at the exact same time I bought this, and I liked it. No problems at all. It *could* just be that my facial skin reacts weirdly with this particular product, I don&#x27;t know. But regardless, my experience with it was not a good one, so I give it 2 stars, and I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Really nice, basic nightime lotion that won&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Works great, glad to see it in a 3 pack. Doesn&#x27;t make my face greasy. I use this daily. Great for eczema.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much more to say that hasn&#x27;t already been said by the 46 reviewers before me.&lt;br /&gt;The big pluses for me are:&lt;br /&gt;1)  the ingredient of niacinamide, which has published research that it can improve your skin.&lt;br /&gt;2)  No Odor.&lt;br /&gt;3)  Absorbs fairly quickly.&lt;br /&gt;4) The PH is balanced so it doesn&#x27;t sting if your face is irritated.&lt;br /&gt;5) It&#x27;s  a lot cheaper than other face creams with similar ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, It&#x27;s well worth the $$.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizing lotion I have used.</li>
            <li> Light moisturizer and works fine for daytime too.  Does not leave a greasy feel.  I do have one dry spot that it has helped and I have to say it&#x27;s pretty much gone.</li>
            <li> Decided to use CeraVe as my dermatologist office had samples. I tried it and have been using this brand ever since. I use the daytime and nighttime formula&#x27;s. I am in my 50&#x27;s and people think I am much younger. It may be genes or maybe this product?</li>
            <li> I have very acne-prone skin and I&#x27;d tried a lot of facial moisturizers - this one has never caused a break out. It&#x27;s very light so it&#x27;s probably not right for someone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion was recommended by my dermatologist. I like it very much. It&#x27;s not oily and you can&#x27;t feel it setting on your skin like a coating, like you can some lotions. I would recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this brand. This by far is the best facial lotion that I&#x27;ve ever used. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy and it&#x27;s unscented. It makes my face feel smooth after applying. The AM lotion works well too! It&#x27;s kinda thicker but it does the job. Although it&#x27;s kinda pricey, it&#x27;s so well worth it. I think there might be coupon that you could find online to save a few bucks but the price here on Amazon is definitely cheaper than CVS.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been researching ingredients on skincare and kept reading how niacinamide is great for your skin, especially for people with sensitive skin. That&#x27;s how I found this product. It&#x27;s pretty affordable compared to Olay niacinamide product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using his product for the past month or so along with homemade vitamin C. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the product itself, the vitamin C toner, or both but ever since I&#x27;ve been applying vitamin C serum in the morning in tandem with applying Cerave lotion at night, I&#x27;ve been noticing my skin getting smoother and freckles less noticeable. My face&#x27;s been feeling slightly fuller as well. Even the redness around my nose is getting a lot less noticable. My skin&#x27;s been looking brighter and reflecting light better, and not because it&#x27;s oily. It&#x27;s important to not apply niacinamide and vitamin C at the same time though. They react together and burn the skin, which I learn through a painful way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really recommend using this product and vitamin C together. They don&#x27;t cause break out for my sensitive skin, which is pretty rare. I haven&#x27;t worn makeup in a while and my boyfriend told me I look good waking up in the morning. And I do notice my skin looking better without makeup as well.</li>
            <li> perfect for sensitive skin. I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light. Does not leave a heavy film. I&#x27;ve been applying it AM/PM. Target also carries this, but it&#x27;s a few dollars more there.</li>
            <li> This is part of my bedtime routine.  I alternate this one with another lotion.  Seems to help my 50-ish skin in terms of firmness, wrinkles, and dryness.</li>
            <li> not much to this facial lotion for the price. It&#x27;s not creamy like most night lotions are, I much prefer the daytime one.</li>
            <li> I have had eczema since childhood, and covering up in the wintertime means more skin problems.  I&#x27;ve used cortisone cream, but that is a temporary solution.  After using CeraVe Cream, my skin problem is under control.  I decided to add the facial lotion, and it is a terrific moisturizer ... and a corrective for eczema.  Actually, it has improved my skin in general, but I&#x27;m really delighted to have eczema under control.  I&#x27;d recommend other people give it a try if they have itchy dry skin.</li>
            <li> They ought to be charging more for this cream.  This is one of those so called drugstore creams you pay less for what they are really worth. Before  I found this cream, I was paying hundreds of dollars for expensive name brand/designer creams that did not much for me.  I have been using this cream for over 5 years and do not see any reason to look for another. It is not like those heavy night creams that just hangs on the skin&#x27;s surface.  This one just sinks right into your skin and stays there.  You wake up with a plumped refreshed look. I&#x27;m 59 years old, and I appreciate having this at my most favorite night cream.</li>
            <li> I love this. I actually use it AM and PM. Keeps dry skin from flaking ad makes face really soft</li>
            <li> It has hyaluronic acid. It&#x27;s really moisturizing but not oily.  Great for combo skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like this, at least my skin didn&#x27;t. I have sensitive skin and this seemed like it would be a good match, but I guess it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> get lotion this brand was highly recommended by my dermatologist!!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer alottttt alottt.  It&#x27;s so natural and light for sensitive skin but yet have powerful nutritions feed my skin.  My skin feel like baby smooth after a week of using. The company please DON&#x27;T discontinue this lotion or I can survive.</li>
            <li> I may never buy a different moisturizer.  I love this -- the way it feels, the way it does not have scent, the way it goes on and covers.  Great value.</li>
            <li> 2 stars for this product. 5 Stars for the Seller. This item was received in perfect condition and shipping was fast. The product was 100% fresh and new. Notwithstanding, due to sensitivity of some sort to this product, my face stings and gets red every time I use it-have to literally fan my face to get some relief. I try to use it every other night and the same issue repeats itself. I&#x27;m convinced that there&#x27;s  ingredient(s) in this product that cause this allergic reaction, but I just can&#x27;t pinpoint which one it is. I&#x27;ve been using it now for quite sometime, just to give it a fair chance, but it&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this moisturizer! The only reason I deducted one star is because it isn&#x27;t quite as hydrating as I would like. It feels very light and absorbs quickly, which I normally like in a regular facial lotion, but it seems a little too light for a PM lotion. With that said, I really do love this product. I&#x27;ve noticed my skin feels and looks better... the fine lines are improving, my skin is evening out, and it feels nice and soft. I&#x27;ve actually been using this in the daytime as well (with SPF over it since it doesn&#x27;t contain SPF). I&#x27;ll definitely continue to use this lotion in combination with my CeraVe cleanser.</li>
            <li> Another one that makes me breakout, and Bummed out.</li>
            <li> This is a nice basic moisturizer. It absorbs almost completely and doesn&#x27;t smell. I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple months and haven&#x27;t had any reactions or breakouts.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Been looking and trying several moisturizers and this one its a keeper! Use it after shower and will keep you soft and you will feel clean! Also recommended by my physician.</li>
            <li> Not great,but enough for a man like me.</li>
            <li> Prior to this i was using cetaphil but have switched to cerave products because they have more emollients in them which is ironically great for my acne prone skin. This glides on so easily application is quick and it keeps my face very moisturized</li>
            <li> I recently started getting cystic acne, for whatever reason. The Dermatologist prescribed me a very strong topical acne cream and gave me a few samples of this product to put on in case my skin started peeling/flaking. It only took two nights for me to fall in love with it! It absorbs quickly into the skin and it creates a protective barrier on the skin. Don&#x27;t worry, it doesn&#x27;t feel waxy or heavy, but almost like you have a foundation primer on your face. I use it in the day as well, but since I&#x27;m more on the oily side I can get a bit shiny.  Great for night time though!</li>
            <li> Great lotion for dry skin. No greasy feel.</li>
            <li> This was also recommended to me from my dermatologist and its really nice. I have combo skin, sensitivity, and acne. Its nice bc my face feels hydrated not too tight or oily, Im using my retin-a and acne products</li>
            <li> the lotion leaking all over the box. it is waste my money to buy something so bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i was so mad.</li>
            <li> By far the best moisturizer I have ever used in my life. Completely eliminated my lifelong struggle with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever. Dermatologist recommended.</li>
            <li> My face did not like this product. I&#x27;ve been searching for a lotion that wouldn&#x27;t aggravate my sensitive acne prone skin. Sadly this is one on a long list that does cause me to break out (I tested it for about 6 months before I gave up)</li>
            <li> Nothing too special, but it will work if you need a basic moisturizer.</li>
            <li> A great moisturizer.  Not too heavy or greasy and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I never run out of this. A very inexpensive moisturizer that gives me good result. My teens use this and they never get any breakouts. We use facial brush and then apply this every night.</li>
            <li> Have tried several face moisturizers in the last few years, and this is my favorite. It has a light, non-greasy texture, absorbs quickly, but still provides good hydration. When my skin feels really dry, I&#x27;ll mix a few drops of jojoba or argan oil into it. I often use this in the morning during the winter, too -- no SPF isn&#x27;t a big deal then, since I don&#x27;t see any daylight before or after work.</li>
            <li> Just not moisturizing enough for my dry skin in the winter. It is a fine lotion for the summertime. No scent, light on the skin.</li>
            <li> this was packaged great and this is a wonderful product, first time i used it. my dermatologist recommended and its a great product. i will order this product again.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer has loads of ingredients that skin loves.  Personally it leaves me a little greasy on the zones of my face where I tend to get oily, so I don&#x27;t use this moisturizing lotion on my T-zone.  However, I do really like to put it on the apples of my cheeks where I have a touch of rosacea.  It feels very soothing and I think my skin likes it.</li>
            <li> Made me break out and somehow turned my dry, thirsty, winter parched skin into a shiny greasy mess.</li>
            <li> Bad product, too much alcohol. I wii no buy it again</li>
            <li> I read this moisturzer is great. I would have to strongly disagree.  I would not recommend this to anyone.  It didn&#x27;t do much for my dry winter skin.  Its very light, which is okay, but on some creams after you apply it your skin feels smooth not the case with this.  It feels slightly better than not putting it on, but it lasts about 3 minutes.  I would suggest if you have dry or even normal to dry, STAY AWAY.</li>
            <li> CeraVe makes a line of products that are excellent for sensitive skin. I used this lotion at night and even in the morning when my skin was very dry and irritated. It is not heavy (even under makeup!) and has virtually no scent. After a week of usage I noticed a remarkable difference in the texture of my skin!</li>
            <li> Nice weight lotion for you face.  Not greasy or heavy</li>
            <li> Everything was as expected thx!!</li>
            <li> I wholeheartedly recommend this moisturizer! I love putting it on because it reminds me of Clinique&#x27;s Dramatically Different Moisturizing Gel--it is a wonderfully lightweight gel and makes my skin feel refreshed instead of heavy. However, unlike Clinique&#x27;s famous DDMG that I used to use back when I had super oily skin, this moisturizer is great for my dry-combination skin and probably suitable for most other skin types except very dry. What I like most about it is that in addition to feeling great, this moisturizer improves skin with long-term use due to its beneficial ingredients. This moisturizer has ceramides to repair/support skin, and 4% niacinamide, which also has numerous benefits for skin, such as the ability to fade post-inflammatory pigmentation (the red marks from acne scarring) that I sadly have much of. It&#x27;s definitely a bargain buy, which is why it&#x27;s popular on Reddit&#x27;s SkincareAddiction, rated highly on Beautypedia, and one of the best-sellers of facial moisturizers on Amazon (which is always changing but it was at the time of my purchase)!</li>
            <li> I had several dermatologists recommend Cerave products to me over the years. And recently I read about this product in a beauty magazine, so I finally caved in and tried it. I have combination skin and this is working beautifully on me. I noticed that my skin looks healthier since I started using it! I use an acne product under it, and haven&#x27;t had any problems with dryness or peeling since I started using this. Wished I had listen to dermatologists years ago!</li>
            <li> Great product, I&#x27;m using the AM and PM version. Both are great, especially if you already had some skin problems in the past. In my case it was rosacea and CeraVe helped me a lot</li>
            <li> I cannot attest to the anti aging clams of this product as I am quite young, but I do like it quite a lot. It&#x27;s affordable, feels nice on my skin, and does not cause breakouts. I only use it at night, usually after my acne creams. Some of my treatments cause irrritation to my skin and cause it to itch. This product reduces the irritability caused by my creams and does not further contribute to my breakouts. I feel like I wake up with a \\&quot;fresher\\&quot; face after using this cream. It&#x27;s worth a try, it&#x27;s not too expensive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dermatologist said this is a good product as well and recommended that I keep using it along with what she has prescribed.</li>
            <li> I seen this product in a magazine and it had great reviews so I decided to try it to see how it worked for me. I did not like this product but everyone is different. It was packaged well and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I have dry sensitive skin. This stuff makes me breakout bad, which is usually not a problem for me.</li>
            <li> Very good for my oily skin, the best product to use on my face, i would like to recommend it to all oily skin people.</li>
            <li> Perfect for sensitive or irritated skin. Not greasy but leaves skin well moisturized and soft. Having skin issues, Ive tried many products and this is by far the best. There is no irritants like perfumes.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin. This product is greasy and made me wake up with big swollen sore pimples. Gave it to my sister. Maybe it will work better for her.</li>
            <li> I bought this face lotion after researching so many different products.  As I get older my skin is changing.  I wanted something that was good for sensitive skin, even though I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.  Just taking precautions with aging and my skin changing.  I use the PM moisturizer for day time too.  I love this moisturizer!!!  There is no fragrance to it, and it makes your face feel moisturized.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd bottle of this product I have purchased. I use it in the morning and at night. It is light enough to use as a daytime moisturizer, which is surprising since I have oily skin. Very moisturizing, keeps skin moisturized all day/night. The bottle doesn&#x27;t last very long (maybe a month or two). I love it! I had people comment that my skin looks glowing a few weeks after I began using it.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer was recommended to me when I was suffering from severely dry, flaky skin as a result of environmental factors and a battle against an acne flare-up with harsh, drying acne products. I don&#x27;t like Cetaphil - it feels overly greasy and doesn&#x27;t seem to work, and my usual Olay moisturizer wasn&#x27;t cutting it. My skin is dry and sensitive, but CeraVe isn&#x27;t irritating, soaks in quickly, and leaves my skin soft, smooth, and well-hydrated. I&#x27;m only sorry I didn&#x27;t hear about it sooner. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever look at another nighttime moisturizer again.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this for my oily acne prone skin. It&#x27;s for night time. It&#x27;s good for oily skin because I woke up with minimal oil on my face. I&#x27;ve used many other products and they don&#x27;t seem to have that effect on me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> A good ceramide lotion that is reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended by my dermatologist.  I prefer the&lt;br /&gt;PM formula during the day as well since it doesn&#x27;t have&lt;br /&gt;any of those sunscreen chemicals.</li>
            <li> I feel like all the PM creams are a bajillion dollars and promise to wake up looking 15 years old again. Is it just me?! This is exactly what I needed in an overnight cream at the right price. It doesn&#x27;t perform miracles but it is easy on my pocketbook and on my skin. There are no offensive odors. For reference, I have very sensitive skin and I haven&#x27;t broken out or been irritated by it. Before I go to bed, I wash my face (w/ LM cleanser) and then apply this lotion. Good night!</li>
