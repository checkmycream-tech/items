            <li>I have loved this product for many years.  </li>
            <li>It seldom lasts more than an hour.</li>
            <li>but I do like its smell and am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>She will more of this again soon..</li>
            <li>this has always been my favorite perfume</li>
            <li>I WAS GLAD</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>Love the Intimate fragrance and nice to know</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s still available.  </li>
            <li>but I liked the older formula</li>
            <li>The smell was not like the original...</li>
            <li>Quick delivery and</li>
            <li>my first review gave it 2 stars, but because it does develop into a pleasant scent after a short while, i added a star.</li>
            <li>My favorite perfume (Enjoli by Revlon) has been discontinued and this is the only reasonably-priced scent I can find that is somewhat close.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s short-lasting, but it&#x27;s not expensive.  </li>
            <li>at first when you spray it, it has an unpleasant note, but this note disappears and the scent does develop nicely, not into the wonderful original intimate scent, but nice.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much for finding it for me.</li>
            <li>this newer version (the second version of intimate) does have a hint of the original scent.  </li>
            <li>this definitely is not the original scent.  </li>
            <li>I have used this perfume since high school in the 60&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t have the exact same fragrance as before.  </li>
            <li>Thought I&#x27;d have to try something new, but it&#x27;s hard to change after so many years.  </li>
            <li>It is a most becoming scent...not too heavy and very subtle.</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s getting difficult to find Intimate, too, so when I saw it on Amazon for a terrific price, I was thrilled.  </li>
            <li>thank you so very much for this and all the other items I have purchased here.</li>

            <li> It was not exactly like the product by Revlon</li>

            <li> I have loved this product for many years.  The problem has arisen in finding it..  I am hoping that it is still in production.  It is a most becoming scent...not too heavy and very subtle.</li>

            <li> when I was looking for the perfume intimate the smell is terrible</li>
            <li> the other reviewer is correct:  this definitely is not the original scent.  this newer version (the second version of intimate) does have a hint of the original scent.  at first when you spray it, it has an unpleasant note, but this note disappears and the scent does develop nicely, not into the wonderful original intimate scent, but nice.  it&#x27;s short-lasting, but it&#x27;s not expensive.  my first review gave it 2 stars, but because it does develop into a pleasant scent after a short while, i added a star.</li>
            <li> I love the smell. I still have some left. Plan to reorder.</li>

            <li> EXCELLENT PERFUME.  MY WIFE LOVED IT.</li>
            <li> Very good perfume. Item met my expectation.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this perfume before but it appears they have changed it a bit and it doesn&#x27;t have the exact same fragrance as before.  I like it but I liked the older formula better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I have used this perfume since high school in the 60&#x27;s.  I loved it then and Iove it now.  I hope they never discontinue it.  I only wear two perfumes and this is one of them.  Thank you so much for finding it for me.</li>
