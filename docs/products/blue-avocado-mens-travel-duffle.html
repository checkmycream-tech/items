    <ol>
            <li>The perfect size for a suit, towel, shampoo, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this duffel appears to be an excellent buy</li>
            <li>This handy-dandy bag--made from 50% recycled bottles--is perfect for an overnight trip.</li>
            <li>and I was impressed!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an ideal bag for just grabbing and throwing stuff into when you&#x27;re in a hurry.</li>
            <li>Good going!</li>
            <li>Very handy.</li>
            <li>comes in very handy.  </li>
            <li>I was amazed that this bag can be folded up into it&#x27;s own pocket!</li>
            <li>Nice colors and design too!</li>
            <li>(haven&#x27;t tried this yet).&lt;br /&gt;And, perhaps best of all, it&#x27;s fairly easy to collapse into the attached pouch - which also serves as a pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  </li>
            <li>If you put this bag over your head, you can still navigate a room fairly easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This bag is surprisingly sturdy.</li>
            <li>Sometimes recycling isn&#x27;t a good idea.  </li>
            <li>Good sized&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>and handy--</li>
            <li>That said, I picked this up to use as our souvenir bag for trips to Disney World, and I think it&#x27;ll come in handy for that purpose.</li>
            <li>When folded up has a nice strap and clip to carry it with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Comes cleverly folded up in its own pocket, so perfect when you want to carry a bag with you on a trip to fill up for the way home</li>
            <li>This bag is ideal for carrying light groceries, travelling lightly, or even hiking.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed and most certainly be looking out for more products not just by BlueAvocado</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed and most certainly be looking out for more products not just by BlueAvocado</li>
            <li>When I first requested this bag I thought it would be great for an upcoming trip.</li>
            <li>But...beyond the color, it&#x27;s worked great for our trips to the neighborhood pool and hot tub.  </li>
            <li>like the fact that it is made from recycled plastic bottles and so is better for the environment.  </li>
            <li>The recycled bottles in the material must make it more durable.</li>
            <li>:)&lt;</li>
            <li>maybe I&#x27;d like it better without the stripes.  </li>
            <li>so I was hesitant to pile all my precious \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; into it</li>
            <li>This is a solidly made, space saving duffel bag that is perfect for travel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many duffel bags over the years and storing them was always a pain.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the navy one, and the color is nice and cheerful.</li>
            <li>Considering the price, you would think the quality of the fabric would be better.</li>
            <li>However, if you want something with better quality fabric, I&#x27;d look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I sure was suprised when I received this duffle bag.  </li>
            <li>Still, over all, a worthwhile bag to have in your collection when planning  a trip.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a good, useful idea executed on the cheap.</li>
            <li>think it would have been good if it had a strap, but the handles seem good enough for the type of bag.</li>
            <li>The BlueAvocado-Ross Bennett Travel Duffle is fabulous bag to invest in if you are looking to save space in your home and if your aim is to purchase products that are better for the environment.</li>
            <li>But the handles fit over my shoulders OK as a mock backpack.</li>
            <li>Made a good part of recycled material, yet material quality is very sturdy</li>
            <li>It is light and durable feeling, as well as being able to store away easily.  </li>
            <li>This handsome duffle bag is ideal for travel because of the way it folds into itself, making it extremely compact, and then opens up to carry laundry or create more luggage space for items bought or otherwise obtained during your stay away from home.</li>
            <li>But for such relatively light use, it&#x27;s ideal.</li>
            <li>Handles are fine and strong quality, but would like a strap too&lt;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more for quick overnight trips or a jaunt to the day spa.</li>
            <li>It also wipes clean and does not seem to stain easily.  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great product to bring along when you might need an extra bag.  </li>
            <li>This bag is cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>It will fit under the seat in front of you.  </li>
            <li>The pouch format is fabulous for saving space.</li>
            <li>Highest of recommendations!easonable in my eyes for a fabulous sustainable product that will be used over and over again.</li>
            <li>And I would not and do not carry anything heavier in it than some clothes and an iPad and maybe a book and lightly packed toiletry kit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with this Blue Avocado-Ross Bennett Duffle Bag</li>
            <li>Cheap and flimsy.  </li>
            <li>Because the fabric is so light and flexible, it provides no protection or structure for the packed items.  </li>
            <li>Oh I see now, the sleeve could indeed fit over the pullman handle of a roller bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s machine washable, comfortable, and collapses into the front zippered pouch for convenient storage.</li>
            <li>The straps are somewhat elastic and can be comfortably worn over the shoulder.</li>
            <li>My ecological views like the fact it is made from plastic bottles.</li>
            <li>For other uses, this bag is ideal, but one should not place hefty items into the bag.</li>
            <li>(this is the way it arrives when originally packaged).</li>
            <li>Perfect everyday bag!</li>
            <li>The only improvement I might suggest would be one or two more pockets on the inside - that might come in handy.  </li>
            <li>so wiping clean ought to work fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This bag is BY FAR the thinnest bag I own.</li>
            <li>I really like the stylish colors.</li>
            <li>This is a neat little bag that would be ideal for overnights, quick getaways, and kids sleepovers.</li>
            <li>What I really like about the bag is the fact that it is super light (7.8 ounces)!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fold up back into the pocket easily, you have to kind of wrestle with</li>
            <li>The large inner area of the bag can hold a good amount of items easily.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a very large bag, but it is a very useful one.</li>
            <li>The colors are a bit bold for me, ...</li>
            <li>and I recommend it if you need a duffle for quick trips.</li>
            <li>29.99 price tag is actually very reasonable in my eyes for a fabulous sustainable product that will be used over and over again.</li>
            <li>bag is good for small trips, and holds enough items for one.&lt;br /&gt;PS, don&#x27;t put sharp objects in this bag as it will most likely rip.&lt;br /&gt;Not the greatest travel bag I own, but it will get used!</li>
            <li>And, after a short learning curve, I found it very easy to refold into it&#x27;s original shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is good for a carry-on bag, and because it can be completely stuffed inside the zipper pocket, it&#x27;s good for those who might want to bring a small bag on a trip, knowing they will expand it and fill it with goods acquired on the trip.</li>
            <li>The bottom line is that this bag is useful for lightweight use.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a handy carabiner hook on the side of the pouch as well as upper hook to hang the pouch from when not in use.</li>
            <li>I think this will save daily wear and tear on my nice backpack, which is overkill to use as a gym bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice when you are traveling and can just stick the collapsed bag in a suitcase for later use.</li>
            <li>I gave up trying, it wasn&#x27;t worth my time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On the other hand, to simply transfer clothes and lightweight shoes, this bag works perfectly for a while.</li>
            <li>The duffle wipes clean easily and doesn&#x27;t seem like it would pick up any major staining or flaws from what I can</li>
            <li>x 10&amp;#34; x 10&amp;#34;h, just about the right size for a change of clothes, pajamas, a towel, toiletries, and a book or two.</li>
            <li>The fact that it is also machine washable is great because my duffels tend to get dirty rather quickly, and it&#x27;s nice knowing</li>
            <li>While the material is sturdy enough - its sturdy like a very strong plastic/vinyl not like a canvas</li>
            <li>I have owned and currently own many different types of duffle bags that I use for various things:</li>
            <li>bag is very lightweight, and seems sturdy enough, I would NOT want to use it as a check-in while traveling, or as anything more than for light use.</li>
            <li>This is a small, cutely designed bag for many uses.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really quite fashionable!</li>
            <li>It takes the pressure off your shoulders which tells me the product was very well thought out for its user!</li>
            <li>It seemed rather flimsy at first</li>
            <li>That being said, there are a TON of other duffles under $30 that are sturdier, more practical and PRETTIER!</li>
            <li>It folds out into a pretty large size and the handles are very large and sturdy.  </li>
            <li>This bag has several great features: it folds up neatly into a small unit that&#x27;s easily packed away in a suitcase for when you return home from vacation with extra stuff; it is lightweight, yet the fabric seems pretty strong; and it&#x27;s cute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe that&#x27;s why it smells nice, unlike other synthetic bags I&#x27;ve owned that reeked of plastic.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This collapsible travel duffle bag was great to use as an extra carry-on for my family as when empty it can be stowed inside another suitcase where it takes up virtually no room until needed.  </li>
            <li>With airlines getting more particular about the weight and size of both checked and hand carried luggage an extra bag to redistribute luggage and avoid additional fees</li>
            <li>A very clever design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bag can be folded back in, but it isn&#x27;t as easy</li>
            <li>This is a nice little tote, although when I received it, the price was a bit more than I&#x27;ve paid for other more sturdy totes that serve the same purpose.</li>
            <li>The price is a little steep but may be worth it to many in order to support the use of recycled fabric.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very practical</li>
            <li>that much</li>
            <li>I recently returned from a holiday trip where I came back with quite a bit more more stuff than with which I had left.  </li>
            <li>All you have to do is stuff whole duffel into the interior pocket and zip</li>
            <li>I really like the colors and the pattern of the bag.</li>
            <li>The red, blue, and beige look nice together and the stripes adds a touch of cuteness to the bag.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s not a heavy duty duffle, it&#x27;s better for clothing (clean or laundry) than heavy items, but one can always shift lighter items from a suitcase to the duffle to make room in the suitcase for heavier items.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colors are attractive, and I can readily see using this stuffed into its pouch and taking it on short or long trips to haul stuff back.</li>
            <li>Smart travelers know that it is a good idea to always carry a spare piece of luggage -- especially when going on a longer trip -- that you can throw into your main bag and pull out for either side trips or just for extra room on the flight back.  </li>
            <li>but it comes in handy for things like toiletries or a small gym bag.  </li>
            <li>but I personally liked the design that stands out a bit from the usual gym bag style of travel  duffles.  </li>
            <li>From my point of view, it would be good for soft items such as T-shirts, jeans, and underwear, but unless I use packing cubes or envelopes other items will smash together.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nothing more, nolthing less.</li>
            <li>It consists of one smallish main compartment and a zippered pouch that the rest of the bag can be stuffed into for compact storage.  </li>
            <li>This BlueAvocado-Ross Bennett Travel Duffle bag is a decent bag to use while traveling, going to the gym, or to use as a carry on while flying.</li>
            <li>The bag is made out of a lightweight material that I think will stand up to normal wear and tear easily, you might not want to be too rough with it.  </li>
            <li>Priced too high for the durability factor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, the quality of the materials really reminds me of something you&#x27;d get for free at a conference or some other giveaway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very light and takes up little room so one could stuff this duffle in your suitcase and use it to store all the new items bought while on vacation.</li>
            <li>it closed - it&#x27;s very easy becaus the zipper is double sided!</li>
            <li>The bag is also pretty darn ugly, the strips are a very bright orange</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how much it held, and how sturdy it was,</li>
            <li>At that I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to hold up for more than a few trips.</li>
            <li>Aesthetics aside (as that&#x27;s a matter of personal opinion), the basic design of this bag is pretty cool.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While I won&#x27;t use this for traveling with (just not big enough or durable enough), it could come in handy to keep in the car for carrying miscellaneous stuff.  </li>
            <li>It might also be useful to stuff in your suitcase so that you have an extra bag in case of emergency or in case you need something to carry sunscreen and a towel out to the beach</li>
            <li>The fabric seems strong and durable and the bag handles have a little bit of elastic type stretch without it being too much.</li>
            <li>The description says it is an over sized duffle bag, when in reality it is no bigger than maybe a medium size bag that can fit something for overnight, or possibly 2 nights.  </li>
            <li>This duffle bag collapses down to a small zipped up pouch, great for packing in case</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably use it most for trips to the gym to carry my clothes and small shower toiletries.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this one can be folded up neatly into the size of a small paperback and stored until use.</li>
            <li>It looks nice, and can even be folded down and compacted enough to fit inside the small side pouch</li>
            <li>but I (a graphic designer) also think the colors go really well</li>
            <li>That being said it isn&#x27;t really that big of a duffle bag.  </li>
            <li>It readily holds my change of clothing, toiletries and and random items in the main compartment, which measures 20x10x10 inches, more than enough space (largely than a backpack).</li>
            <li>Not a large bag, but something useful for shorter trips.  </li>
            <li>The nice thing is when you are done with it, it scrunches back into a very small pouch and can be put away.  </li>
            <li>Bright and loud colors, it is pretty ugly looking (in my opinion).  </li>
            <li>You definitely won&#x27;t be looking stylish with this on your arm.&lt;br /&gt;- Small in size&lt;br</li>
            <li>For that purpose, this bag has a lot of features to recommend it: extremely light, folds small, and (despite appearances), quite sturdy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The bag doesn&#x27;t come with instructions on how to convert the bag from large duffel back to portable pouch, but luckily it&#x27;s not necessary.</li>
            <li>I finally got an opportunity to use my new bag</li>
            <li>Also neat is that it has a pocket open at both ends on the back that allows you to slide the whole thing over your extended luggage handle (on a roller bag).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a small duffel bag as shown in the picture with a small zippered compartment in front that has inside a carabineer hook good for holding your keys in place.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly not all things to all people, and the material doesn&#x27;t look nearly thick enough to withstand a lot of rugged use, but I think it&#x27;s fine for its limited use ... something to carry light items on a flight, overnight trip, picnic, etc.</li>
            <li>However, it is a practical everyday bag (couldn&#x27;t recommend it for travel, however) and it fits into itself and condenses into a tiny pouch, which is cool.  </li>
            <li>When transformed, it&#x27;s now a small zippered pack holding a duffle for later, with the same carabineer hook available to attach to something else.  </li>
            <li>My only concern is its durability - it feels tear resistant, but when you look through the panels of the empty bag, it&#x27;s actually sheer - at first</li>
            <li>it closed all ready for future travel</li>
            <li>/&gt;It opens up to a generous size for a travel bag, with one large main zip pocket and small external pocket, two handles, and an opening in the back to slide over the arm of a rolling bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Though when you empty the bag and are ready to store it, you simply tuck the duffle part of the bag all back into that outer pocket and zip</li>
            <li>/&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for extra heavy or sharp items, and I wouldn&#x27;t check it as an airline bag, unless it had nothing but clothing in it, but it would be fine for carrying onto the plane.  </li>
            <li>If not filled to full capacity, it will look a little wrinkled, since the material is not stiff.</li>

            <li> Still, over all, a worthwhile bag to have in your collection when planning  a trip.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a good, useful idea executed on the cheap.</li>
            <li> think it would have been good if it had a strap, but the handles seem good enough for the type of bag.</li>
            <li> The BlueAvocado-Ross Bennett Travel Duffle is fabulous bag to invest in if you are looking to save space in your home and if your aim is to purchase products that are better for the environment.</li>
            <li> But the handles fit over my shoulders OK as a mock backpack.</li>
            <li> Made a good part of recycled material, yet material quality is very sturdy</li>
            <li> It is light and durable feeling, as well as being able to store away easily.  </li>
            <li> This handsome duffle bag is ideal for travel because of the way it folds into itself, making it extremely compact, and then opens up to carry laundry or create more luggage space for items bought or otherwise obtained during your stay away from home.</li>
            <li> But for such relatively light use, it&#x27;s ideal.</li>
            <li> Handles are fine and strong quality, but would like a strap too&lt;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more for quick overnight trips or a jaunt to the day spa.</li>
            <li> It also wipes clean and does not seem to stain easily.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great product to bring along when you might need an extra bag.  </li>
            <li> This bag is cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> It will fit under the seat in front of you.  </li>
            <li> The pouch format is fabulous for saving space.</li>
            <li> Highest of recommendations!easonable in my eyes for a fabulous sustainable product that will be used over and over again.</li>
            <li> And I would not and do not carry anything heavier in it than some clothes and an iPad and maybe a book and lightly packed toiletry kit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this Blue Avocado-Ross Bennett Duffle Bag</li>
            <li> Cheap and flimsy.  </li>
            <li> Because the fabric is so light and flexible, it provides no protection or structure for the packed items.  </li>
            <li> Oh I see now, the sleeve could indeed fit over the pullman handle of a roller bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s machine washable, comfortable, and collapses into the front zippered pouch for convenient storage.</li>
            <li> The straps are somewhat elastic and can be comfortably worn over the shoulder.</li>
            <li> My ecological views like the fact it is made from plastic bottles.</li>
            <li> For other uses, this bag is ideal, but one should not place hefty items into the bag.</li>
            <li> (this is the way it arrives when originally packaged).</li>
            <li> Perfect everyday bag!</li>
            <li> The only improvement I might suggest would be one or two more pockets on the inside - that might come in handy.  </li>
            <li> so wiping clean ought to work fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This bag is BY FAR the thinnest bag I own.</li>
            <li> I really like the stylish colors.</li>
            <li> This is a neat little bag that would be ideal for overnights, quick getaways, and kids sleepovers.</li>
            <li> What I really like about the bag is the fact that it is super light (7.8 ounces)!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fold up back into the pocket easily, you have to kind of wrestle with</li>
            <li> The large inner area of the bag can hold a good amount of items easily.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a very large bag, but it is a very useful one.</li>
            <li> The colors are a bit bold for me, ...</li>
            <li> and I recommend it if you need a duffle for quick trips.</li>
            <li> 29.99 price tag is actually very reasonable in my eyes for a fabulous sustainable product that will be used over and over again.</li>
            <li> bag is good for small trips, and holds enough items for one.&lt;br /&gt;PS, don&#x27;t put sharp objects in this bag as it will most likely rip.&lt;br /&gt;Not the greatest travel bag I own, but it will get used!</li>
            <li> And, after a short learning curve, I found it very easy to refold into it&#x27;s original shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is good for a carry-on bag, and because it can be completely stuffed inside the zipper pocket, it&#x27;s good for those who might want to bring a small bag on a trip, knowing they will expand it and fill it with goods acquired on the trip.</li>
            <li> The bottom line is that this bag is useful for lightweight use.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a handy carabiner hook on the side of the pouch as well as upper hook to hang the pouch from when not in use.</li>
            <li> I think this will save daily wear and tear on my nice backpack, which is overkill to use as a gym bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice when you are traveling and can just stick the collapsed bag in a suitcase for later use.</li>
            <li> I gave up trying, it wasn&#x27;t worth my time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On the other hand, to simply transfer clothes and lightweight shoes, this bag works perfectly for a while.</li>
            <li> The duffle wipes clean easily and doesn&#x27;t seem like it would pick up any major staining or flaws from what I can</li>
            <li> x 10&amp;#34; x 10&amp;#34;h, just about the right size for a change of clothes, pajamas, a towel, toiletries, and a book or two.</li>
            <li> The fact that it is also machine washable is great because my duffels tend to get dirty rather quickly, and it&#x27;s nice knowing</li>
            <li> While the material is sturdy enough - its sturdy like a very strong plastic/vinyl not like a canvas</li>
            <li> I have owned and currently own many different types of duffle bags that I use for various things:</li>
            <li> bag is very lightweight, and seems sturdy enough, I would NOT want to use it as a check-in while traveling, or as anything more than for light use.</li>
            <li> This is a small, cutely designed bag for many uses.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really quite fashionable!</li>
            <li> It takes the pressure off your shoulders which tells me the product was very well thought out for its user!</li>
            <li> It seemed rather flimsy at first</li>
            <li> That being said, there are a TON of other duffles under $30 that are sturdier, more practical and PRETTIER!</li>
            <li> It folds out into a pretty large size and the handles are very large and sturdy.  </li>
            <li> This bag has several great features: it folds up neatly into a small unit that&#x27;s easily packed away in a suitcase for when you return home from vacation with extra stuff; it is lightweight, yet the fabric seems pretty strong; and it&#x27;s cute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe that&#x27;s why it smells nice, unlike other synthetic bags I&#x27;ve owned that reeked of plastic.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This collapsible travel duffle bag was great to use as an extra carry-on for my family as when empty it can be stowed inside another suitcase where it takes up virtually no room until needed.  </li>
            <li> With airlines getting more particular about the weight and size of both checked and hand carried luggage an extra bag to redistribute luggage and avoid additional fees</li>
            <li> A very clever design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bag can be folded back in, but it isn&#x27;t as easy</li>
            <li> This is a nice little tote, although when I received it, the price was a bit more than I&#x27;ve paid for other more sturdy totes that serve the same purpose.</li>
            <li> The price is a little steep but may be worth it to many in order to support the use of recycled fabric.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very practical</li>
            <li> that much</li>
            <li> I recently returned from a holiday trip where I came back with quite a bit more more stuff than with which I had left.  </li>
            <li> All you have to do is stuff whole duffel into the interior pocket and zip</li>
            <li> I really like the colors and the pattern of the bag.</li>
            <li> The red, blue, and beige look nice together and the stripes adds a touch of cuteness to the bag.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s not a heavy duty duffle, it&#x27;s better for clothing (clean or laundry) than heavy items, but one can always shift lighter items from a suitcase to the duffle to make room in the suitcase for heavier items.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colors are attractive, and I can readily see using this stuffed into its pouch and taking it on short or long trips to haul stuff back.</li>
            <li> Smart travelers know that it is a good idea to always carry a spare piece of luggage -- especially when going on a longer trip -- that you can throw into your main bag and pull out for either side trips or just for extra room on the flight back.  </li>
            <li> but it comes in handy for things like toiletries or a small gym bag.  </li>
            <li> but I personally liked the design that stands out a bit from the usual gym bag style of travel  duffles.  </li>
            <li> From my point of view, it would be good for soft items such as T-shirts, jeans, and underwear, but unless I use packing cubes or envelopes other items will smash together.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nothing more, nolthing less.</li>
            <li> It consists of one smallish main compartment and a zippered pouch that the rest of the bag can be stuffed into for compact storage.  </li>
            <li> This BlueAvocado-Ross Bennett Travel Duffle bag is a decent bag to use while traveling, going to the gym, or to use as a carry on while flying.</li>
            <li> The bag is made out of a lightweight material that I think will stand up to normal wear and tear easily, you might not want to be too rough with it.  </li>
            <li> Priced too high for the durability factor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, the quality of the materials really reminds me of something you&#x27;d get for free at a conference or some other giveaway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very light and takes up little room so one could stuff this duffle in your suitcase and use it to store all the new items bought while on vacation.</li>
            <li> it closed - it&#x27;s very easy becaus the zipper is double sided!</li>
            <li> The bag is also pretty darn ugly, the strips are a very bright orange</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how much it held, and how sturdy it was,</li>
            <li> At that I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to hold up for more than a few trips.</li>
            <li> Aesthetics aside (as that&#x27;s a matter of personal opinion), the basic design of this bag is pretty cool.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While I won&#x27;t use this for traveling with (just not big enough or durable enough), it could come in handy to keep in the car for carrying miscellaneous stuff.  </li>
            <li> It might also be useful to stuff in your suitcase so that you have an extra bag in case of emergency or in case you need something to carry sunscreen and a towel out to the beach</li>
            <li> The fabric seems strong and durable and the bag handles have a little bit of elastic type stretch without it being too much.</li>
            <li> The description says it is an over sized duffle bag, when in reality it is no bigger than maybe a medium size bag that can fit something for overnight, or possibly 2 nights.  </li>
            <li> This duffle bag collapses down to a small zipped up pouch, great for packing in case</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably use it most for trips to the gym to carry my clothes and small shower toiletries.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this one can be folded up neatly into the size of a small paperback and stored until use.</li>
            <li> It looks nice, and can even be folded down and compacted enough to fit inside the small side pouch</li>
            <li> but I (a graphic designer) also think the colors go really well</li>
            <li> That being said it isn&#x27;t really that big of a duffle bag.  </li>
            <li> It readily holds my change of clothing, toiletries and and random items in the main compartment, which measures 20x10x10 inches, more than enough space (largely than a backpack).</li>
            <li> Not a large bag, but something useful for shorter trips.  </li>
            <li> The nice thing is when you are done with it, it scrunches back into a very small pouch and can be put away.  </li>
            <li> Bright and loud colors, it is pretty ugly looking (in my opinion).  </li>
            <li> You definitely won&#x27;t be looking stylish with this on your arm.&lt;br /&gt;- Small in size&lt;br</li>
            <li> For that purpose, this bag has a lot of features to recommend it: extremely light, folds small, and (despite appearances), quite sturdy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The bag doesn&#x27;t come with instructions on how to convert the bag from large duffel back to portable pouch, but luckily it&#x27;s not necessary.</li>
            <li> I finally got an opportunity to use my new bag</li>
            <li> Also neat is that it has a pocket open at both ends on the back that allows you to slide the whole thing over your extended luggage handle (on a roller bag).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small duffel bag as shown in the picture with a small zippered compartment in front that has inside a carabineer hook good for holding your keys in place.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly not all things to all people, and the material doesn&#x27;t look nearly thick enough to withstand a lot of rugged use, but I think it&#x27;s fine for its limited use ... something to carry light items on a flight, overnight trip, picnic, etc.</li>
            <li> However, it is a practical everyday bag (couldn&#x27;t recommend it for travel, however) and it fits into itself and condenses into a tiny pouch, which is cool.  </li>
            <li> When transformed, it&#x27;s now a small zippered pack holding a duffle for later, with the same carabineer hook available to attach to something else.  </li>
            <li> My only concern is its durability - it feels tear resistant, but when you look through the panels of the empty bag, it&#x27;s actually sheer - at first</li>
            <li> it closed all ready for future travel</li>
            <li> /&gt;It opens up to a generous size for a travel bag, with one large main zip pocket and small external pocket, two handles, and an opening in the back to slide over the arm of a rolling bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Though when you empty the bag and are ready to store it, you simply tuck the duffle part of the bag all back into that outer pocket and zip</li>
            <li> /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for extra heavy or sharp items, and I wouldn&#x27;t check it as an airline bag, unless it had nothing but clothing in it, but it would be fine for carrying onto the plane.  </li>
            <li> If not filled to full capacity, it will look a little wrinkled, since the material is not stiff.</li>
            <li> and I can put everything I need for the long hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t figure out what the empty sleeve on the opposite side to the zippered side pocket does, but the notes say it is a &amp;#34;luggage sleeve to slip onto a roller bag.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Perhaps this is not a big deal for those who plan to use the bag sporadically, but for everyday use, one might want to take extra care of it.  </li>
            <li> Put anything heavy or sharp into it and it will probably not last long.</li>
            <li> You can find bags like this for a few bucks at Asian markets around America.  </li>
            <li> I imagine it will last for a few trips before it falls apart.  </li>
            <li> When the bag is in the duffle format, the outer zip pocket can hold a few helpful essential items.</li>
            <li> An empty duffel bag can take up valuable space, though...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough for a carry-on (at a total of 40 linear inches, it&#x27;s five inches less than the Delta</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other bags made from a different type of plastic that just tore at the seems when a few pounds were stuffed into it.</li>
            <li> I am hardly a &amp;#34;fashion maven&amp;#34; but the striped olive green and red pattern with the navy is a notch above hideous on the esthetic scale.  </li>
            <li> I have other bags I use for the kids that I paid $10 each for and</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said, this is probably not the bag you want to take as your vacation luggage.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers may complain about the colors, but I&#x27;ve got to admit that I rather like the look</li>
            <li> (My Wife usually packs a duffel bag that goes down to Florida empty, and we fill it up with the kid&#x27;s stuffed animals and souvenirs on the way back.</li>
            <li> The material is tough enough to handle some shoving similar to a kid&#x27;s backpack.  </li>
            <li> It was stored as a small little pouch, maybe 3 inches by 3 inches, and didn&#x27;t think it was as big as it was until I opened it.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is the &amp;#34;fits in a pocket&amp;#34; feature.  </li>
            <li> (and you&#x27;re not going to miss it when it comes down the baggage claim).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a full size duffle bag</li>
            <li> The colors of the bag might be a little &amp;#34;loud&amp;#34; for some (like my teenaged son for example)</li>
            <li> and it did take me a little bit to figure out how to do so.</li>
            <li> This can make for a bulky, shifting, uneven load.  </li>
            <li> When I first inspected the bag, I noticed two things: (1) the bag was slightly transparent, and (2) the bag did not come with a shoulder strap,</li>
            <li> just two small straps for transporting.</li>
            <li> This is basically a medium to small sized duffle bag than can be stuffed into the side pocket to make it small and compact.  </li>
            <li> It is 20\\&quot;x10\\&quot;x10\\&quot;, which does make it rather small for a travel tote - 2 or 3 sweatshirts as souvenirs would fill it up.</li>
            <li> (because should I bump into a hard object with this bag with something like my iPad in it, the bag is not going to protect it).</li>
            <li> This bag is not ideal for holding heavy items.</li>
            <li> The material is fairly thin, so I am not sure how well this will wear over time.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m a bit disappointed by this product.</li>
            <li> Thin material</li>
            <li> I just received this product and I have to say that the thinness of the material was a bit startling.</li>
            <li> The material of the bag is very thin in my opinion though.</li>
            <li> Ugly as ugly can get.  </li>
            <li> Did I mention ugly?</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This duffle bag collapses down to a small zipped up pouch, great for packing in case you might need an extra bag!  (The pouch is the size of the striped section on the above photo.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It opens up to a generous size for a travel bag, with one large main zip pocket and small external pocket, two handles, and an opening in the back to slide over the arm of a rolling bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that it is made from recycled plastic bottles and so is better for the environment.  It also wipes clean and does not seem to stain easily.  It seems tear resistant too.  The recycled bottles in the material must make it more durable. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great product to bring along when you might need an extra bag.  The only improvement I might suggest would be one or two more pockets on the inside - that might come in handy.  Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> I just received this product and I have to say that the thinness of the material was a bit startling. I have owned and currently own many different types of duffle bags that I use for various things: bags for carrying gym shoes and clothing, bags for carrying tools, bags for weekend trips, and bags for a trip into the city. This bag is BY FAR the thinnest bag I own. It looks nice, and can even be folded down and compacted enough to fit inside the small side pouch (this is the way it arrives when originally packaged). However, I think I have recyclable grocery sack made of thicker materials. If you put this bag over your head, you can still navigate a room fairly easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bag like this may serve for a youngster&#x27;s overnight trip to a neighbor&#x27;s house, but that&#x27;s about it. Put anything heavy or sharp into it and it will probably not last long. Overall, I&#x27;m a bit disappointed by this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a full size duffle bag but it comes in handy for things like toiletries or a small gym bag.  I wouldn&#x27;t use it for extended travels but it helps keep things organized.  I like that it can fold into itself for a compact bag.  The material is tough enough to handle some shoving similar to a kid&#x27;s backpack.  I&#x27;ll probably use it most for trips to the gym to carry my clothes and small shower toiletries.</li>
            <li> This is a small, cutely designed bag for many uses. One must remember that is made of man-made materials; therefore, quality-wise, it may not be a long-lasting bag, depending on its owner’s use. This bag is NOT the type of duffle bag you can use as a gym bag long-term. On the other hand, to simply transfer clothes and lightweight shoes, this bag works perfectly for a while. For other uses, this bag is ideal, but one should not place hefty items into the bag. When I first inspected the bag, I noticed two things: (1) the bag was slightly transparent, and (2) the bag did not come with a shoulder strap, just two small straps for transporting. Perhaps this is not a big deal for those who plan to use the bag sporadically, but for everyday use, one might want to take extra care of it.  The bottom line is that this bag is useful for lightweight use. This bag is ideal for carrying light groceries, travelling lightly, or even hiking. This bag is not ideal for holding heavy items. I recommend this bag for those who plan to use it with care; otherwise, choose another duffle bag.</li>
            <li> This bag is cheaply made.  It consists of one smallish main compartment and a zippered pouch that the rest of the bag can be stuffed into for compact storage.  The fabric is super-thin.  You can find bags like this for a few bucks at Asian markets around America.  The advantage of this bag is that you can, if you&#x27;re traveling on vacation and plan to purchase some gifts, bring it in your suitcase and pull it out for taking your extra stuff home.  I imagine it will last for a few trips before it falls apart.  Not recommended.</li>
            <li> This bag has several great features: it folds up neatly into a small unit that&#x27;s easily packed away in a suitcase for when you return home from vacation with extra stuff; it is lightweight, yet the fabric seems pretty strong; and it&#x27;s cute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for extra heavy or sharp items, and I wouldn&#x27;t check it as an airline bag, unless it had nothing but clothing in it, but it would be fine for carrying onto the plane.  It will fit under the seat in front of you.  It&#x27;s very practical and handy-- I have already used it several times to carry food and wine to parties and picnics.  I now keep it folded up in the trunk of my car just in case I need it.  Very handy.</li>
            <li> The BlueAvocado-Ross Bennett Travel Duffle is fabulous bag to invest in if you are looking to save space in your home and if your aim is to purchase products that are better for the environment. The bag is made out of 50% post-consumer recycled bottle fabric from repreve as well as polyester. Inside the bag includes audited impact label featuring carbon footprint &amp; bottles up-cycled to create it (14)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This duffle bag comes in two color options which are Navy or Stone. The bag I have is Navy and the pocket as well as the carrying handle features the colors stone as well as red in a striped format. It&#x27;s really quite fashionable! Not just my husband but I (a graphic designer) also think the colors go really well together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product arrived after ordered in its pouch format. The pouch format is fabulous for saving space. There&#x27;s a handy carabiner hook on the side of the pouch as well as upper hook to hang the pouch from when not in use. When the bag is in duffle format, there&#x27;s a roller sleeve for roller bags to make your traveling that much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dimensions of the bag are 20 x 10 x 10 inches. The large inner area of the bag can hold a good amount of items easily. When the bag is in the duffle format, the outer zip pocket can hold a few helpful essential items. Though when you empty the bag and are ready to store it, you simply tuck the duffle part of the bag all back into that outer pocket and zip it closed all ready for future travel needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; What I really like about the bag is the fact that it is super light (7.8 ounces)! The fabric seems strong and durable and the bag handles have a little bit of elastic type stretch without it being too much. It takes the pressure off your shoulders which tells me the product was very well thought out for its user! The duffle wipes clean easily and doesn&#x27;t seem like it would pick up any major staining or flaws from what I can tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 29.99 price tag is actually very reasonable in my eyes for a fabulous sustainable product that will be used over and over again. I&#x27;m impressed and most certainly be looking out for more products not just by BlueAvocado but in the Ross Bennett line as well!

            <li> I recently returned from a holiday trip where I came back with quite a bit more more stuff than with which I had left.  This collapsible travel duffle bag was great to use as an extra carry-on for my family as when empty it can be stowed inside another suitcase where it takes up virtually no room until needed.  With airlines getting more particular about the weight and size of both checked and hand carried luggage an extra bag to redistribute luggage and avoid additional fees comes in very handy.  I also like the fact that 50% of the materials made to construct the bag comes from recycled cans.  The colors of the bag might be a little &amp;#34;loud&amp;#34; for some (like my teenaged son for example) but I personally liked the design that stands out a bit from the usual gym bag style of travel  duffles.  The price is a little steep but may be worth it to many in order to support the use of recycled fabric.</li>
            <li> When I first requested this bag I thought it would be great for an upcoming trip. Something I can take along and stuff in my suitcase so that I can bring back extra goodies easier. The only problem with this idea is I would not trust the bag to hold up to airline travel. Local travel with the same idea, yes, but not airline travel. At that I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to hold up for more than a few trips. I have other bags I use for the kids that I paid $10 each for and the material is thicker and the bag is bigger. Priced too high for the durability factor.</li>
            <li> I have mixed feelings about this bag.  The colors are a bit bold for me, ... maybe I&#x27;d like it better without the stripes.  But...beyond the color, it&#x27;s worked great for our trips to the neighborhood pool and hot tub.  The perfect size for a suit, towel, shampoo, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bag is very lightweight, and seems sturdy enough, I would NOT want to use it as a check-in while traveling, or as anything more than for light use.</li>
            <li> Aesthetics aside (as that&#x27;s a matter of personal opinion), the basic design of this bag is pretty cool.  It&#x27;s a small duffel bag as shown in the picture with a small zippered compartment in front that has inside a carabineer hook good for holding your keys in place.  When transformed, it&#x27;s now a small zippered pack holding a duffle for later, with the same carabineer hook available to attach to something else.  Also neat is that it has a pocket open at both ends on the back that allows you to slide the whole thing over your extended luggage handle (on a roller bag).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the quality of the materials really reminds me of something you&#x27;d get for free at a conference or some other giveaway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good, useful idea executed on the cheap.</li>
            <li> This handsome duffle bag is ideal for travel because of the way it folds into itself, making it extremely compact, and then opens up to carry laundry or create more luggage space for items bought or otherwise obtained during your stay away from home. Because it&#x27;s not a heavy duty duffle, it&#x27;s better for clothing (clean or laundry) than heavy items, but one can always shift lighter items from a suitcase to the duffle to make room in the suitcase for heavier items. I&#x27;ve brought it to yoga class when I had to change after class out of my sweats. It&#x27;s an ideal bag for just grabbing and throwing stuff into when you&#x27;re in a hurry. Is it a &amp;#34;flimsy&amp;#34; bag? I wouldn&#x27;t carry my DSLR in it, and though I have carried my iPad in it, I only do so when my iPad is in a rugged case (because should I bump into a hard object with this bag with something like my iPad in it, the bag is not going to protect it). And I would not and do not carry anything heavier in it than some clothes and an iPad and maybe a book and lightly packed toiletry kit. But for such relatively light use, it&#x27;s ideal.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said, this is probably not the bag you want to take as your vacation luggage. That said, I picked this up to use as our souvenir bag for trips to Disney World, and I think it&#x27;ll come in handy for that purpose. (My Wife usually packs a duffel bag that goes down to Florida empty, and we fill it up with the kid&#x27;s stuffed animals and souvenirs on the way back. An empty duffel bag can take up valuable space, though...this bag folds almost into nothing, so that won&#x27;t be an issue.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A power outage necessitated spending the night away from home recently, and I got to give this bag a test run. I was surprised at how much it held, and how sturdy it was, And, after a short learning curve, I found it very easy to refold into it&#x27;s original shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is a neat little bag that would be ideal for overnights, quick getaways, and kids sleepovers.</li>
            <li> I was amazed that this bag can be folded up into it&#x27;s own pocket! It isn&#x27;t a very large bag, but it is a very useful one. A couple of these could be brought on any vacation or trip and might come in handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The material, fifty percent of which is made from recycled plastic, seems rather durable. I&#x27;ve had other bags made from a different type of plastic that just tore at the seems when a few pounds were stuffed into it. I have a job which takes me to various locations for the day and I can put everything I need for the long hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it would have been good if it had a strap, but the handles seem good enough for the type of bag.</li>
            <li> Nothing more, nolthing less. It seemed rather flimsy at first so I was hesitant to pile all my precious \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; into it thinking it would rip. This bag is surprisingly sturdy. I like the fact that it is made of recycled products. I always wondered what they did with the tons of recycling that gets picked up each week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a bag you&#x27;re going to want to use on your international tour of Europe. It&#x27;s more for quick overnight trips or a jaunt to the day spa. It is very light and takes up little room so one could stuff this duffle in your suitcase and use it to store all the new items bought while on vacation. I really like the stylish colors. I&#x27;m happy with this Blue Avocado-Ross Bennett Duffle Bag and I recommend it if you need a duffle for quick trips.</li>
            <li> There is no getting around it for me.  This duffle bag is U-L-G-Y!  I am hardly a &amp;#34;fashion maven&amp;#34; but the striped olive green and red pattern with the navy is a notch above hideous on the esthetic scale.  However, it is a practical everyday bag (couldn&#x27;t recommend it for travel, however) and it fits into itself and condenses into a tiny pouch, which is cool.  I plan on putting this in my car to use at farmer&#x27;s markets, grocery shopping and the like.  That being said, there are a TON of other duffles under $30 that are sturdier, more practical and PRETTIER!</li>
            <li> Cheap and flimsy.  Ugly as ugly can get.  Sometimes recycling isn&#x27;t a good idea.  This bag won&#x27;t stand up to anything.  Not rugged.  Did I mention ugly?</li>
            <li> This is a solidly made, space saving duffel bag that is perfect for travel. I&#x27;ve had many duffel bags over the years and storing them was always a pain. I love the fact that this one can be folded up neatly into the size of a small paperback and stored until use. The fact that it is also machine washable is great because my duffels tend to get dirty rather quickly, and it&#x27;s nice knowing I can just toss this into the laundry when necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also eco-friendly, made from 50% post consumer recycled bottle fabric. Maybe that&#x27;s why it smells nice, unlike other synthetic bags I&#x27;ve owned that reeked of plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the navy one, and the color is nice and cheerful. My only concern is its durability - it feels tear resistant, but when you look through the panels of the empty bag, it&#x27;s actually sheer - at first I was worried that the bag&#x27;s contents could be seen from outside, but luckily it is totally opaque from the outside, like one of the those private cars where you can look outside, but no one can look in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bag doesn&#x27;t come with instructions on how to convert the bag from large duffel back to portable pouch, but luckily it&#x27;s not necessary. All you have to do is stuff whole duffel into the interior pocket and zip it closed - it&#x27;s very easy becaus the zipper is double sided! A very clever design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this duffel appears to be an excellent buy and I look forward to using it a lot.</li>
            <li> Here were the ups and downs of this bag for me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ups:&lt;br /&gt;- Made a good part of recycled material, yet material quality is very sturdy&lt;br /&gt;- Comes cleverly folded up in its own pocket, so perfect when you want to carry a bag with you on a trip to fill up for the way home&lt;br /&gt;- Good sized&lt;br /&gt;- Has a pocket&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downs/could use improving:&lt;br /&gt;- Couldn&#x27;t figure out how to get it to refold up the way it had been, so it&#x27;s foldability, for me, is a one time use&lt;br /&gt;- Handles are fine and strong quality, but would like a strap too&lt;br /&gt;- While the material is sturdy enough - its sturdy like a very strong plastic/vinyl not like a canvas</li>
            <li> I got this to review through the Amazon Vine program.  This is basically a medium to small sized duffle bag than can be stuffed into the side pocket to make it small and compact.  The material is fairly thin, so I am not sure how well this will wear over time.  The bag is also pretty darn ugly, the strips are a very bright orange red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I won&#x27;t use this for traveling with (just not big enough or durable enough), it could come in handy to keep in the car for carrying miscellaneous stuff.  It might also be useful to stuff in your suitcase so that you have an extra bag in case of emergency or in case you need something to carry sunscreen and a towel out to the beach in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Folds up compactly&lt;br /&gt;- When folded up has a nice strap and clip to carry it with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Bright and loud colors, it is pretty ugly looking (in my opinion).  You definitely won&#x27;t be looking stylish with this on your arm.&lt;br /&gt;- Small in size&lt;br /&gt;- Thin material&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t fold up back into the pocket easily, you have to kind of wrestle with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this, I think there probably nicer products out there.</li>
            <li> This is good for a carry-on bag, and because it can be completely stuffed inside the zipper pocket, it&#x27;s good for those who might want to bring a small bag on a trip, knowing they will expand it and fill it with goods acquired on the trip. It&#x27;s certainly not all things to all people, and the material doesn&#x27;t look nearly thick enough to withstand a lot of rugged use, but I think it&#x27;s fine for its limited use ... something to carry light items on a flight, overnight trip, picnic, etc.</li>
            <li> Simply put, the pros and cons of the Blue Avocado Ross Bennett Travel Duffle:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  It&#x27;s small enough for a carry-on (at a total of 40 linear inches, it&#x27;s five inches less than the Delta limit).&lt;br /&gt;At 7.8 ounces it&#x27;s light-weight.&lt;br /&gt;The recycled fabric is machine washable (haven&#x27;t tried this yet).&lt;br /&gt;And, perhaps best of all, it&#x27;s fairly easy to collapse into the attached pouch - which also serves as a pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Because the fabric is so light and flexible, it provides no protection or structure for the packed items.  This can make for a bulky, shifting, uneven load.  From my point of view, it would be good for soft items such as T-shirts, jeans, and underwear, but unless I use packing cubes or envelopes other items will smash together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fabric durability is as yet an untried factor; until it&#x27;s proved itself I&#x27;ll keep mine away from baggage handlers.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this out as a sport duffle. It readily holds my change of clothing, toiletries and and random items in the main compartment, which measures 20x10x10 inches, more than enough space (largely than a backpack). I can also squish some food shopping in there too on the way home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I can put squash balls, a notebook and pen in the zippered side pocket. That measures about 8x8 inches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t figure out what the empty sleeve on the opposite side to the zippered side pocket does, but the notes say it is a &amp;#34;luggage sleeve to slip onto a roller bag.&amp;#34; ** Oh I see now, the sleeve could indeed fit over the pullman handle of a roller bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I ordered this, I had not quite figured out how it would replace my backpack as I ride to the gym. But the handles fit over my shoulders OK as a mock backpack. I think this will save daily wear and tear on my nice backpack, which is overkill to use as a gym bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colors are attractive, and I can readily see using this stuffed into its pouch and taking it on short or long trips to haul stuff back. Nice colors and design too! The navy and red work well together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says &amp;#34;wipe clean&amp;#34; so I guess you can&#x27;t throw it in the washer ... oh wait, this is made of recycled plastic bottles so wiping clean ought to work fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The maker, Blue Avocado, is a group of three women entrepreneurs, friends and sisters, in Austin, Texas. Good going! They have lines of travel gear, shopping totes and storage items, and kid&#x27;s lunch carriers.</li>
            <li> This handy-dandy bag--made from 50% recycled bottles--is perfect for an overnight trip. It&#x27;s machine washable, comfortable, and collapses into the front zippered pouch for convenient storage. On the back is a luggage slip that you can use to attach the bag to your luggage handle, and inside the pouch is a loop for your keys. It is, however, smaller than what I picture as a &amp;#34;duffle.&amp;#34; Its dimensions are 20&amp;#34; x 10&amp;#34; x 10&amp;#34;h, just about the right size for a change of clothes, pajamas, a towel, toiletries, and a book or two. This would make a convenient carry-on for airline travel. If not filled to full capacity, it will look a little wrinkled, since the material is not stiff. The straps are somewhat elastic and can be comfortably worn over the shoulder.</li>
            <li> This BlueAvocado-Ross Bennett Travel Duffle bag is a decent bag to use while traveling, going to the gym, or to use as a carry on while flying. I really like the colors and the pattern of the bag. The red, blue, and beige look nice together and the stripes adds a touch of cuteness to the bag. The material of the bag is very thin in my opinion though. Considering the price, you would think the quality of the fabric would be better. I also wish there was a sturdy piece (that could be removable) on the bottom to make the bag stand up easier. There does seem to be a lot of room in the bag though which is a definite plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like how the bag is collapsible. When you get it in the mail, it will be in its collapsed state. I undid it and tried to re-collapse it and it did take me a little bit to figure out how to do so. You basically flip the bag inside out and then stuff everything into the pocket. It&#x27;s nice when you are traveling and can just stick the collapsed bag in a suitcase for later use. I also like how the material is made from recycled bottles and that it is machine washable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;ll probably be using this to put clothes in when I go on short trips or if I have a carry on. However, if you want something with better quality fabric, I&#x27;d look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> This is made of recycled material.&lt;br /&gt;This bag is good for small trips, and holds enough items for one.&lt;br /&gt;PS, don&#x27;t put sharp objects in this bag as it will most likely rip.&lt;br /&gt;Not the greatest travel bag I own, but it will get used!</li>
            <li> This is a nice little tote, although when I received it, the price was a bit more than I&#x27;ve paid for other more sturdy totes that serve the same purpose. My ecological views like the fact it is made from plastic bottles. Perhaps that is why it made my hands itched before I washed it. It is labeled as washable. I wish there were instructions for folding it back up into the tote pocket. I gave up trying, it wasn&#x27;t worth my time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do like this for is the fact that I can use it to put my grandsons&#x27; clothes in when we go for an overnight stay or just somewhere that we might need to take an extra change of clothes. With the zipper I can also use it to carry a change of clothes or swimwear to the gym and not have to worry about my open sided tote falling over and spilling stuff out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a strap for attaching to rolling luggage and a zippered pocket. I would pay close attention to the dimensions, since it appears to be larger in the photo that is shown with it, unless you see the photo with a hand in it. It is 20\\&quot;x10\\&quot;x10\\&quot;, which does make it rather small for a travel tote - 2 or 3 sweatshirts as souvenirs would fill it up.</li>
            <li> I sure was suprised when I received this duffle bag.  It was stored as a small little pouch, maybe 3 inches by 3 inches, and didn&#x27;t think it was as big as it was until I opened it.  That being said it isn&#x27;t really that big of a duffle bag.  The description says it is an over sized duffle bag, when in reality it is no bigger than maybe a medium size bag that can fit something for overnight, or possibly 2 nights.  It is light and durable feeling, as well as being able to store away easily.  Not a large bag, but something useful for shorter trips.  A recommend.</li>
            <li> Smart travelers know that it is a good idea to always carry a spare piece of luggage -- especially when going on a longer trip -- that you can throw into your main bag and pull out for either side trips or just for extra room on the flight back.  For that purpose, this bag has a lot of features to recommend it: extremely light, folds small, and (despite appearances), quite sturdy.  Some may complain about the price -- and I suspect part of this results from the use of recycled material -- but based on what I&#x27;ve seen, this bag will hold up.  Other reviewers may complain about the colors, but I&#x27;ve got to admit that I rather like the look (and you&#x27;re not going to miss it when it comes down the baggage claim).  My only complaint is the &amp;#34;fits in a pocket&amp;#34; feature.  The bag can be folded back in, but it isn&#x27;t as easy you&#x27;d hope.  Still, over all, a worthwhile bag to have in your collection when planning  a trip.</li>
            <li> I finally got an opportunity to use my new bag and I was impressed!  It folds out into a pretty large size and the handles are very large and sturdy.  The bag is made out of a lightweight material that I think will stand up to normal wear and tear easily, you might not want to be too rough with it.  The nice thing is when you are done with it, it scrunches back into a very small pouch and can be put away.  I keep it in my closet and close at hand in case there is somewhere I need to go on the spur of the moment.  Perfect everyday bag!</li>
