            <li>Love this shampoo, leaves my color damaged hair feeling healthy and happy.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is so nice and excellent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never bought into claims by companies selling this kind of stuff, always thought \\&quot;shampoo is shampoo\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use with the pump .</li>
            <li>Best shampoo I&#x27;ve used so far.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>

            <li>This shampoo is so very moisturizing and it has that good clean scent that lingers and smells so light and wonderful.</li>

            <li>great product fast shipping</li>
            <li>Let me just say that i love the organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased</li>
            <li>I use the conditioner from the brand as well, and it is not my favorite product as it doesn&#x27;t feel like anything improves with smooth/softness of my hair</li>
            <li>I love the organic properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is water soluble, and helps the body function better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can review the effects of Biotin more here - http://www.md-health.com/Biotin-Side-Effects.html.</li>
            <li>They should of packaged it better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not color-safe, so I don&#x27;t feel misled, but that&#x27;s a con to the product for sure.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love that its organic.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>LOVE Avalon products..</li>
            <li>My favorite shampoo of all time</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t give you more hair, please understand.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo works very well and smells great</li>
            <li>I have went through this bottle already;  This shampoo is okay,</li>
            <li>It has an okay smell to it, and it massages better than the conditioner.</li>
            <li>Nice clean finish, does not feel like a bunch of gunk in my hair at day&#x27;s end.</li>
            <li>So glad to be able to buy it in a large container!!!</li>
            <li>It is required to be sealed more securely</li>
            <li>A great deal; better than buying the smaller bottles.</li>
            <li>Shampoo clean my hair and I love it</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not making me into a lion with a full mane, but the shampoo has slowed the shedding, which makes me feel so much better about myself.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much to work up a good lather and thoroughly clean your hair.  </li>
            <li>Plus I love the mild scent and the fact that my hair does appear to seem thicker.</li>
            <li>Luckily I found this shampoo again and it does a great job at thickening my cherished, naturally curly tresses.  </li>
            <li>the bottle is in a huge plastic bag and had leaked shampoo everywhere, the pump is opened already.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>feel this item completely filled my expectations.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much, I got a bottle for my Mom</li>
            <li>good shampoo as far as I can see.</li>
            <li>but this was the first organic shampoo I ever tried and fell in love with its benefits and the way it smells too.</li>
            <li>and it does make my super fine hair seem thicker.&lt;br</li>
            <li>smells like sprite and leaves your hair clean without all the SLS.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it takes a lot of shampoo to feel a good foam.  </li>
            <li>I like the idea of using a much more gentle shampoo on my hair.  </li>
            <li>Gives me the feeling of a man with full hair.</li>
            <li>it has no bad smells or anything and leaves your hair again</li>
            <li>Great product, use it for couple years and wouldn&#x27;t change it for other one.</li>
            <li>I could tell almost immediately the very first time I used this shampoo that it was benefitting my hair.  </li>
            <li>We have used this for several years and love it!  </li>
            <li>I was experiencing some pretty significant hair loss after my daughter was born.</li>
            <li>The bottle is huge and you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>This biotin rich shampoo really does strengthen my hair.</li>
            <li>The only positive is that I liked the soothing smell.</li>
            <li>so I would certainly recommend it to my friends!</li>
            <li>This is a very gentle shampoo.</li>
            <li>pretty clean plus bitoin b complex is good for your scalp but</li>
            <li>It really does help my hair look thicker!</li>
            <li>The shampoo was leaking, and this is not the first time.</li>
            <li>From the first day I used it</li>
            <li>It made my hair feel more coarse and thicker/fuller in my fingers as I massaged the lather into my hair.  </li>
            <li>Pleased to find the larger bottle.</li>
            <li>It has a funny after feeling</li>
            <li>BTW - Amazon - you need to take more care packaging the larger, heavier products</li>
            <li>After unwrapping it, I just brought the zip-lock into the shower with me and used the shampoo in it for my first couple of shampoos.  </li>
            <li>if you are experiencing any unusual  hair loss go to see a doctor and get a blood test!</li>
            <li>Everything else I&#x27;ve received from Avalon has been great - a little surprised with this one.  </li>
            <li>I have curly, somewhat frizzy hair that is easily tangled and found that along with my hair loss I was experiencing more breakage than usual.</li>
            <li>I have a long hair, maybe it feels better on shorter hair...</li>
            <li>leaves my hair fuller and I can pretty much disguise the thinning areas...  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is dry, cleans real good but makes your hair so thick and voluminous.</li>
            <li>, just make sure your hair is totally wet.</li>
            <li>my hair feels thicker and doesn&#x27;t shed as much.  </li>
            <li>It really makes noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li>Really does make hair feel thicker ... and softer without a conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Firstly, Thanks.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to this shampoo...</li>
            <li>It cleans really well</li>
            <li>The shampoo really strips the hair of all chemicals.</li>
            <li>but the next day it just feels different - kind of heavier, doesn&#x27;t want to hold a style....</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Avalon Organics Biotin B.</li>
            <li>Has worked really well so far.</li>
            <li>This is good for my oily and thin hair.</li>
            <li>Just wish it was a smaller item to hold since is very large.  </li>
            <li>and I thought about for the ease of things and to go with a new drugstore shampoo</li>
            <li>Made my hair super dry</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a big and inexpensive bottle of okay shampoo that totally strips the red out of my hair.</li>
            <li>First tried this while visiting a relative.  </li>
            <li>~ they open easily - and the leakage from this ruined other boxes packed with it.  </li>
            <li>I got the shampoo from my local Whole Foods, and tried it for a month before giving up on this shampoo entirely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather because it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li>I was young and unconcerned then, since my hair wasn&#x27;t something I needed to worry about.  </li>
            <li>Considering how packages are handled, I don&#x27;t see how you could completely avoid this.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel soft, but not greasy.  </li>
            <li>and it is natural.</li>
            <li>It may not be as natural as you prefer.  </li>
            <li>The scent is subtle and appealing to me.</li>
            <li>And for sure you will need a hair conditioner after it, because the hair feels iuuuu after that, like you would never be able to brush it if you don&#x27;t use condition :(</li>
            <li>i highly recommend this if you have obviously thinning hair...</li>
            <li>If you have a problem with a dry scalp, this really improves the condition.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using straight apple cider vinegar for the last year and decided to use an actual &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>but it was a major difference in volume and texture</li>
            <li>This shampoo really seems to help cut down on that breakage.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>From natural shampoo usually you don&#x27;t get so much foam like from this one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had thin, fine hair my entire life.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> The only positive is that I liked the soothing smell.</li>
            <li> so I would certainly recommend it to my friends!</li>
            <li> This is a very gentle shampoo.</li>
            <li> pretty clean plus bitoin b complex is good for your scalp but</li>
            <li> It really does help my hair look thicker!</li>
            <li> The shampoo was leaking, and this is not the first time.</li>
            <li> From the first day I used it</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel more coarse and thicker/fuller in my fingers as I massaged the lather into my hair.  </li>
            <li> Pleased to find the larger bottle.</li>
            <li> It has a funny after feeling</li>
            <li> BTW - Amazon - you need to take more care packaging the larger, heavier products</li>
            <li> After unwrapping it, I just brought the zip-lock into the shower with me and used the shampoo in it for my first couple of shampoos.  </li>
            <li> if you are experiencing any unusual  hair loss go to see a doctor and get a blood test!</li>
            <li> Everything else I&#x27;ve received from Avalon has been great - a little surprised with this one.  </li>
            <li> I have curly, somewhat frizzy hair that is easily tangled and found that along with my hair loss I was experiencing more breakage than usual.</li>
            <li> I have a long hair, maybe it feels better on shorter hair...</li>
            <li> leaves my hair fuller and I can pretty much disguise the thinning areas...  </li>
            <li> This shampoo is dry, cleans real good but makes your hair so thick and voluminous.</li>
            <li> , just make sure your hair is totally wet.</li>
            <li> my hair feels thicker and doesn&#x27;t shed as much.  </li>
            <li> It really makes noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li> Really does make hair feel thicker ... and softer without a conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Firstly, Thanks.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to this shampoo...</li>
            <li> It cleans really well</li>
            <li> The shampoo really strips the hair of all chemicals.</li>
            <li> but the next day it just feels different - kind of heavier, doesn&#x27;t want to hold a style....</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Avalon Organics Biotin B.</li>
            <li> Has worked really well so far.</li>
            <li> This is good for my oily and thin hair.</li>
            <li> Just wish it was a smaller item to hold since is very large.  </li>
            <li> and I thought about for the ease of things and to go with a new drugstore shampoo</li>
            <li> Made my hair super dry</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a big and inexpensive bottle of okay shampoo that totally strips the red out of my hair.</li>
            <li> First tried this while visiting a relative.  </li>
            <li> ~ they open easily - and the leakage from this ruined other boxes packed with it.  </li>
            <li> I got the shampoo from my local Whole Foods, and tried it for a month before giving up on this shampoo entirely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather because it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li> I was young and unconcerned then, since my hair wasn&#x27;t something I needed to worry about.  </li>
            <li> Considering how packages are handled, I don&#x27;t see how you could completely avoid this.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel soft, but not greasy.  </li>
            <li> and it is natural.</li>
            <li> It may not be as natural as you prefer.  </li>
            <li> The scent is subtle and appealing to me.</li>
            <li> And for sure you will need a hair conditioner after it, because the hair feels iuuuu after that, like you would never be able to brush it if you don&#x27;t use condition :(</li>
            <li> i highly recommend this if you have obviously thinning hair...</li>
            <li> If you have a problem with a dry scalp, this really improves the condition.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using straight apple cider vinegar for the last year and decided to use an actual &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> but it was a major difference in volume and texture</li>
            <li> This shampoo really seems to help cut down on that breakage.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> From natural shampoo usually you don&#x27;t get so much foam like from this one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had thin, fine hair my entire life.  </li>
            <li> I have also noticed that my hair has grown faster than usual after using this shampoo for a few months, nothing crazy but it has definitely gained more length than I&#x27;ve experienced in the past with other products.</li>
            <li> Instead of energizing my scalp (as advertised on the product), it seems to have stripped it of any natural oils I had in my scalp!&lt;br /&gt;I should also point out that I could barely pull a brush through my hair after a few uses of this product.  </li>
            <li> You should try the shampoo in a small quantity before buying the large batch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure if the &amp;#34;thickening&amp;#34; claim is real,</li>
            <li> TOO much $ to be throwing away the waste!</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I can say is that it&#x27;s kind of a thin consistency</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much change in hair growth, also it made my hair very dry and heavy.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It seems to dry out may hair rather than condition it.  </li>
            <li> It feels even thicker that way but is not too dry and wiry.&lt;br /&gt;Read</li>
            <li> My African American hair is way thicker and my growth rate has doubled; I am a firm believer in this biotin shampoo.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every two or three days so the natural oils don&#x27;t get stripped off (which can happen with any shampoo if you are excessive with using it).</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s less lather than other shampoos but my hair is growing back</li>
            <li> Not much of a lather and made my hair feel like straw.</li>
            <li> please, Be careful of packing because it was leak opened</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Do not use if you have very fine hair, because it is already difficult to comb through your hair and this makes it 10x worse.</li>
            <li> As soon as I stopped using the shampoo, the entire scalp cleared up with no more itchiness in a week.</li>
            <li> (my hair is coarse and thick).</li>
            <li> The bottle is a pump bottle and it was not locked down</li>
            <li> I highly recommend to anyone that has thin hair or excessive shedding.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed less hair shedding while using this product in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Basically the shampoo bottles were half way when I got them.</li>
            <li> Almost half of the bottle was leaked.</li>
            <li> Been using Avalon Organics Biotin B-Complex Shampoo for a little while now about a couple of years but still didn&#x27;t think I would miss it if I ran out one day and bought something else.</li>
            <li> the average hair growth and with this and supplement I am over 40 without any gray, yet!</li>
            <li> I also accredit the slowing down of my hair loss to this shampoo!</li>
            <li> I have had this about a month now and noticed my hair feeling &#x27;heavy&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> CANT BRASH MY HAIR AFTER THIS SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER..</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair fuller and manageable without heavy perfume odors.</li>
            <li> Cleans my hair with very little shampoo (I have shoulder length hair).  </li>
            <li> Well I did I run out of my usual order since I get in through the mail</li>
            <li> but i have been unable to find it in stores the last couple years.</li>
            <li> Staying away from all of the excessive chemicals and it works well.</li>
            <li> I lose very few hairs after shampooing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going to take a very long time to use this size of a bottle but way too expensive to not use it.  </li>
            <li> but..it was late...</li>
            <li> was embarrassed to say the least.  </li>
            <li> I am hoping my hair will grow thick after I used it</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t mean all the contents are...</li>
            <li> Bought this product from a local store, but I had to review it as it&#x27;s so bad.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a couple of washes and already my scalp has really, really bad dandruff.  </li>
            <li> My entire scalp broke out in an itchy rash, with painful postulates all over the scalp.</li>
            <li> The entire skin started peeling and it was a painful ordeal.</li>
            <li> the package was came in a bad sharp.</li>
            <li> It gave my hair a wirey feel and made the ends of the hairs stick together, so it was really difficult to get a brush</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it leaked into the carton.  </li>
            <li> The bottle was sticky and dirty from rolling around inside the box covered in shampoo.</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t something I went crazy for.</li>
            <li> It smells kinda like medicine which isn&#x27;t bad...</li>
            <li> notice that a couple of people have given this product a bad review because it had leaked during shipping.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so bad that my hairdresser today commented on it.  </li>
            <li> Her words to me were, you have a really bad dandruff problem that you need to sort</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t even give it one star but seems I can&#x27;t post this review without giving it one star :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed with what should be a quality product.  </li>
            <li> Soo mad!</li>
            <li> Hated it.</li>
            <li> I have a terrible hair loss problem....</li>
            <li> However, the conditioner is awful.  </li>
            <li> However, side effects of Biotin can be nasty.</li>
            <li> Probably the worst shampoo I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I heard that it works....I have a terrible hair loss problem....I just got this today and just used...It smells kinda like medicine which isn&#x27;t bad...and it dries your hair....I am hoping my hair will grow thick after I used it</li>
            <li> Very happy with my hair.</li>
            <li> Been using Avalon Organics Biotin B-Complex Shampoo for a little while now about a couple of years but still didn&#x27;t think I would miss it if I ran out one day and bought something else. Well I did I run out of my usual order since I get in through the mail and I thought about for the ease of things and to go with a new drugstore shampoo so I tried something else I will not name the brand starts with P ends with E but it was a major difference in volume and texture and I need all the volume I can get at this juncture. This shampoo is dry, cleans real good but makes your hair so thick and voluminous. I had! to get it back and found out they have this in this 32 ounce? you don&#x27;t say and I bought two which should last me some. Fast shipping great price I would recommend this shampoo it has no bad smells or anything and leaves your hair again pretty clean plus bitoin b complex is good for your scalp but the volume oh the volume mon ami is where it shines.... ok cheers.</li>
            <li> I just received this last week and I love it. It smells good and does a great job getting my hair clean, just make sure your hair is totally wet.</li>
            <li> Excellent shampoo that doesn&#x27;t irritate skin. Price was lower than drug or food stores.</li>
            <li> SATISFIED WITH EVERYTHING!</li>
            <li> Love this product! It really does help my hair look thicker!</li>
            <li> I order this hoping for a fix. Let me tell you it is good! I waited to make sure I had results before I do this.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to everyone it works. You don&#x27;t need a lot to make enough foam to wash your hair.&lt;br /&gt;After using it for about two month I started seen results. It lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Hated it. Not much of a lather and made my hair feel like straw. The only positive is that I liked the soothing smell. Will not buy again!</li>
            <li> great product fast shipping</li>
            <li> Smells good. Not sure if the &amp;#34;thickening&amp;#34; claim is real, but it&#x27;s a nice shampoo nonetheless.</li>
            <li> The shampoo was leaking, and this is not the first time.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo! my hair feels thicker and doesn&#x27;t shed as much.  I had twins 7 months ago and my hair started falling out in chunks.  Nothing was stopping the shedding until I started using this shampoo.  From the first day I used it I immediately felt a difference.  I highly recommend to anyone that has thin hair or excessive shedding.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it takes a lot of shampoo to feel a good foam.  Overall, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Ive used this shampoo before but i have been unable to find it in stores the last couple years. Found it on Amazon. Let me just say that i love the organic ingredients. I find it does help my hair growth a bit too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had thin, fine hair my entire life.  This is the only shampoo that has ever added thickness to it.  It really makes noticeable difference.  I love this shampoo.  However, the conditioner is awful.  It seems to dry out may hair rather than condition it.  I use this shampoo all the time, but I use a different conditioner with it.</li>
            <li> i love my item! &amp;#60;3&lt;br /&gt;I feel this item completely filled my expectations. therefore deserves 5 stars. I am pleased</li>
            <li> Really does make hair feel thicker ... and softer without a conditioner.  Both my husband and I like it since we&#x27;re at the age where every hair counts.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo, leaves my color damaged hair feeling healthy and happy. I wash my hair every two or three days so the natural oils don&#x27;t get stripped off (which can happen with any shampoo if you are excessive with using it). I use the conditioner from the brand as well, and it is not my favorite product as it doesn&#x27;t feel like anything improves with smooth/softness of my hair (my hair is coarse and thick). BUT I will stick with the shampoo! I have also noticed that my hair has grown faster than usual after using this shampoo for a few months, nothing crazy but it has definitely gained more length than I&#x27;ve experienced in the past with other products.</li>
            <li> Staying away from all of the excessive chemicals and it works well.</li>
            <li> I could tell almost immediately the very first time I used this shampoo that it was benefitting my hair.  It made my hair feel more coarse and thicker/fuller in my fingers as I massaged the lather into my hair.  I liked it so much, I got a bottle for my Mom and she loves it too.  The smell is good and the lather is good.  It doesn&#x27;t take much to work up a good lather and thoroughly clean your hair.  I got some for my Mom so I would certainly recommend it to my friends!</li>
            <li> Hair feels very clean and smells really nice. The only negative thing I can say is that it&#x27;s kind of a thin consistency so it seems like I have to use quite a bit for  my longer hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo definitely lives up to its promises. I have been growing out my hair for awhile and this product fits wonderfully with my hair care routine. I love the organic properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller is awesome and the product was delivered promptly and packaged very well!</li>
            <li> Been using it for about 6 months and the hair is thicker and fuller now.</li>
            <li> This shampoo did not work for me. I was possibly allergic to Biotin. My entire scalp broke out in an itchy rash, with painful postulates all over the scalp. The entire skin started peeling and it was a painful ordeal. I got the shampoo from my local Whole Foods, and tried it for a month before giving up on this shampoo entirely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Typically Biotin is known as vitamin B7 or vitamin H. It is water soluble, and helps the body function better. However, side effects of Biotin can be nasty. As soon as I stopped using the shampoo, the entire scalp cleared up with no more itchiness in a week. You should try the shampoo in a small quantity before buying the large batch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can review the effects of Biotin more here - http://www.md-health.com/Biotin-Side-Effects.html.</li>
            <li> A great deal; better than buying the smaller bottles. The pump helps save on product use, rather than pouring it into your hand.</li>
            <li> WIFE HAS USED THIS SHAMPOO FOR YEARS.  SHE FEELS IT IS THE BEST SHE HAS EVER USED.  VERY GOOD PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> The best organic shampoo that I have found, including professionalbrands.</li>
            <li> Great product. Don&#x27;t ever get rid of it amazon!&lt;br /&gt;See if you can&#x27;t drop the price point</li>
            <li> Thank you!!&lt;br /&gt;good!!</li>
            <li> We have used this for several years and love it!  Pleased to find the larger bottle.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is suppose to be great...but..it was late...&amp; it was open &amp; dripping..! I probably lost 2 ounces of shampoo..that I&#x27;ll need later.!:(. They should of packaged it better.  Soo mad!</li>
            <li> The cardboard box it was mailed in was damaged and part of the shampoo had spilled out. When I washed my hair, it took three washings before I got suds. I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel like straw!! I have very fine hair and it broke it all OFF! Buyer be ware</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using straight apple cider vinegar for the last year and decided to use an actual &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34;. This is great. I was told it is Curly Girl Method approved and it seems to have done well with my hair. It has a funny after feeling but once I put conditioner on I don&#x27;t notice it. It foams instantly once I rub it on my scalp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a big and inexpensive bottle of okay shampoo that totally strips the red out of my hair. It&#x27;s not color-safe, so I don&#x27;t feel misled, but that&#x27;s a con to the product for sure.</li>
            <li> Probably the worst shampoo I&#x27;ve ever bought. Very disappointed! Leaves my hair in knots!! Can&#x27;t brush it after washing! Will never buy again! I wouldn&#x27;t even give it one star but seems I can&#x27;t post this review without giving it one star :(</li>
            <li> That shampoo is sooooo good</li>
            <li> This shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather because it&#x27;s natural but it adds tons of volume to my hair</li>
            <li> Firstly, Thanks. I love this shampoo. This shampoo is so nice and excellent.&lt;br /&gt;Natural ingredients are very good and smell is ok.  This is good for my oily and thin hair. Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;But please, Be careful of packing because it was leak opened lid.&lt;br /&gt;Totally, Very good shampoo,</li>
            <li> I bought the smaller bottle and I ordered this 32 oz bottle before I finished my fist bottle. I love that its organic. I noticed hair growth after using this shampoo and my hair FINALLY stopped falling out. I had tried numerous products for hair loss but this was the first organic shampoo I ever tried and fell in love with its benefits and the way it smells too. Well worth the price, and a little goes a long way. there&#x27;s less lather than other shampoos but my hair is growing back and so i&#x27;m HAPPY.</li>
            <li> Nice clean finish, does not feel like a bunch of gunk in my hair at day&#x27;s end.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product! This shampoo is so very moisturizing and it has that good clean scent that lingers and smells so light and wonderful. The bottle is huge and you don&#x27;t need much. A little goes a long way. My African American hair is way thicker and my growth rate has doubled; I am a firm believer in this biotin shampoo. I absolutely love it. Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> I am over 50, and I have thinning hair.  This is great stuff.  Don&#x27;t buy the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo I&#x27;ve used so far.  I used to use this years ago and I stopped using it.  I don&#x27;t remember why.  I was young and unconcerned then, since my hair wasn&#x27;t something I needed to worry about.  Forward to 2015, and things are now noticeably different, like my thinning hair!  Nooooo!  Luckily I found this shampoo again and it does a great job at thickening my cherished, naturally curly tresses.  Suddenly, my thinning hair doesn&#x27;t look so &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34; anymore.  Yes! What a relief.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to this shampoo... LOVE Avalon products.. the smell is wonderful!  I have had this about a month now and noticed my hair feeling &#x27;heavy&#x27;.  It cleans really well but the next day it just feels different - kind of heavier, doesn&#x27;t want to hold a style.... my hair is longer so this may not be an issue if you have shorter hair.  I have now moved it into the 2nd bath.  It&#x27;s going to take a very long time to use this size of a bottle but way too expensive to not use it.  Everything else I&#x27;ve received from Avalon has been great - a little surprised with this one.  BTW - Amazon - you need to take more care packaging the larger, heavier products ~ they open easily - and the leakage from this ruined other boxes packed with it.  TOO much $ to be throwing away the waste!</li>
            <li> I bought this product since I saw all the good review for hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;And the package was came in a bad sharp. the bottle is in a huge plastic bag and had leaked shampoo everywhere, the pump is opened already. It must be a display or someone used bottle.&lt;br /&gt;  Since i need it for my hair, i didn&#x27;t return it. I been used this for several weeks, no improve for my hair loss. but the smell is good though</li>
            <li> Do not use if you have very fine hair, because it is already difficult to comb through your hair and this makes it 10x worse.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T LIKE IT!!!!!!  CANT BRASH MY HAIR AFTER THIS SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER..</li>
            <li> First tried this while visiting a relative.  Noticed it made my hair feel fuller.  I&#x27;ve never bought into claims by companies selling this kind of stuff, always thought \\&quot;shampoo is shampoo\\&quot;.  I just want it to do a good job cleaning my hair.  But, I have to admit this does something which is improving the health of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I notice that a couple of people have given this product a bad review because it had leaked during shipping.  Mine came in a box, well padded, and the shampoo container itself was enclosed in a zip-lock plastic bag.  There was some shampoo that had seeped from it&#x27;s bottle, but was still in the ziplock.  Considering how packages are handled, I don&#x27;t see how you could completely avoid this.  But really, it is not a big deal at all!  After unwrapping it, I just brought the zip-lock into the shower with me and used the shampoo in it for my first couple of shampoos.  So lighten up people!  This is an excellent product!</li>
            <li> Shampoo clean my hair and I love it, it&#x27;s not making me into a lion with a full mane, but the shampoo has slowed the shedding, which makes me feel so much better about myself.</li>
            <li> Been using this product nightly for several months. My hair grows longer then the average hair growth and with this and supplement I am over 40 without any gray, yet!</li>
            <li> I like the idea of using a much more gentle shampoo on my hair.  I plan to use this shampoo from now on.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Avalon Organics Biotin B. My fine/thinning hair is noticeably fuller, shinier and softer. The scent is subtle and appealing to me. This product has improved any flakiness. Bought big bottle at Sprout&#x27;s (San Diego, CA).</li>
            <li> The shampoo really strips the hair of all chemicals. This formula is different from the one they had before.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I bought it for my daughter as well. So glad to be able to buy it in a large container!!! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Made my hair super dry</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo of all time</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a quality shampoo that isn&#x27;t loaded with chemicals and I believe I&#x27;ve found it. Over 70% organic ingredients with no sodium lauryl sulfate,  sodium laureth sulfate, ether or propylene glycol which are all known poisons. Leaves my hair fuller and manageable without heavy perfume odors. Nice!</li>
            <li> It smells like Pledge and makes my hair feel like straw and then it&#x27;s greasy by midday. Even my boyfriend and housemate dislike this shampoo and conditioner set. I won&#x27;t ever buy this product again...</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.  It makes my hair feel soft, but not greasy.  Thank god for the larger pump container!  I also accredit the slowing down of my hair loss to this shampoo!</li>
            <li> This is a very gentle shampoo. If you have a problem with a dry scalp, this really improves the condition. Noticeable decrease in flaking and dryness.</li>
            <li> Bought this product from a local store, but I had to review it as it&#x27;s so bad.  I&#x27;ve only used it for a couple of washes and already my scalp has really, really bad dandruff.  It&#x27;s so bad that my hairdresser today commented on it.  Her words to me were, you have a really bad dandruff problem that you need to sort out.&lt;br /&gt;I was embarrassed to say the least.  This was not a problem before I started using this product.  I&#x27;m disappointed with what should be a quality product.  Instead of energizing my scalp (as advertised on the product), it seems to have stripped it of any natural oils I had in my scalp!&lt;br /&gt;I should also point out that I could barely pull a brush through my hair after a few uses of this product.  It gave my hair a wirey feel and made the ends of the hairs stick together, so it was really difficult to get a brush all the way through it.</li>
            <li> I have noticed less hair shedding while using this product in the shower.  It cleans very nicely.  It won&#x27;t give you more hair, please understand.  But, for me, it did what the label says.</li>
            <li> I was using this product before, and now it came out in bigger size. Love it! Makes my hair looks fuller, and it grows faster (for those who have hair lose problem, will work great).</li>
            <li> Will never order this item again. Very disappointed! Basically the shampoo bottles were half way when I got them. I&#x27;ve order Nature Gate shampoo and never had that problem.</li>
            <li> this shampoo is awesome. smells like sprite and leaves your hair clean without all the SLS. Its the only shampoo i use now.</li>
            <li> I was experiencing some pretty significant hair loss after my daughter was born. One of my friends recommended this shampoo so I decided to give it a try. I have curly, somewhat frizzy hair that is easily tangled and found that along with my hair loss I was experiencing more breakage than usual. This shampoo really seems to help cut down on that breakage. It also helps with the frizz.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it leaked into the carton.  That is why I gave it only 4 stars.  The product itself is very nice. Very easy to use with the pump . Cleans my hair with very little shampoo (I have shoulder length hair).  Plus I love the mild scent and the fact that my hair does appear to seem thicker.</li>
            <li> The delivery was good, not any licking or anything.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using it for a month already. But it feels like a deep cleaning shampoo, if you&#x27;ve ever used it..  They use is at the salons before any treatment for her. From natural shampoo usually you don&#x27;t get so much foam like from this one.  And for sure you will need a hair conditioner after it, because the hair feels iuuuu after that, like you would never be able to brush it if you don&#x27;t use condition :( I have a long hair, maybe it feels better on shorter hair... I&#x27;m still loosing some hair.&lt;br /&gt;So I will keep using it and will see If I will change my opinion about it.&lt;br /&gt;PS if you are experiencing any unusual  hair loss go to see a doctor and get a blood test! I&#x27;ve spend tons of money on different treatments here with no results, and I found out from blood test that my ferritin is very low, and it&#x27;s the reason why I&#x27;m loosing hair. So nothing would help till I didn&#x27;t start taking iron pills.&lt;br /&gt;GEt A Blood test!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my hair in thicker and I do not lose hair after shampooing as before.  I have been very pleased with the  results.  I noticed the reduced number in hair loss after I had used the shampoo after several washing and it continues to show results.</li>
            <li> good shampoo as far as I can see. Just wish it was a smaller item to hold since is very large.  Should come with a refillable bottle.</li>
            <li> Has worked really well so far. It soothes my scalp, thickens my hair and has noticeably reduced my hair loss.  I switched from Nioxin No. 2 and am pretty happy with the results.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works very well and smells great and it is natural.</li>
            <li> Love love love the product!!!! I&#x27;ve been using it fir over two weeks and it does make my super fine hair seem thicker.&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is with the actual shipping.  The bottle is a pump bottle and it was not locked down so when I opened the box there was shampoo EVERYWHERE!  The bottle was sticky and dirty from rolling around inside the box covered in shampoo.</li>
            <li> Great product, use it for couple years and wouldn&#x27;t change it for other one.</li>
            <li> It does make my hair seem thicker. I prefer to use it without the conditioner.  It feels even thicker that way but is not too dry and wiry.&lt;br /&gt;Read the ingredients.  It may not be as natural as you prefer.  The name is Organics... doesn&#x27;t mean all the contents are...</li>
            <li> Gives me the feeling of a man with full hair.</li>
            <li> This biotin rich shampoo really does strengthen my hair. I lose very few hairs after shampooing.</li>
            <li> Almost half of the bottle was leaked. It is required to be sealed more securely</li>
            <li> leaves my hair fuller and I can pretty much disguise the thinning areas...  just ordered this after using smaller size... and going to get the conditioner also...  i highly recommend this if you have obviously thinning hair...</li>
            <li> I have went through this bottle already;  This shampoo is okay, it isn&#x27;t something I went crazy for. I didn&#x27;t see much change in hair growth, also it made my hair very dry and heavy. I was also using the conditioner on my ends, but it didn&#x27;t help with the dryness. It has an okay smell to it, and it massages better than the conditioner. its not something I will be buying again though.</li>
