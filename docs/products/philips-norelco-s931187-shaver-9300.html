            <li>Great gift for my husband!</li>
            <li>I was doing some research on updated Norelcos and read a lot of reviews that called this one of the best electric shavers out there.</li>
            <li>I can say with certainty that this is the best shave I have ever had with an electric.</li>
            <li>shaver is perfect, but shop did not send hair trimmer</li>
            <li>excellent shaver.</li>
            <li>Best shaver I have ever used and the self-cleaning stand works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Great shave!</li>
            <li>Shopped around for best price.&lt;br /&gt;Delivered</li>
            <li>How perfect was that?</li>
            <li>Best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li>The shaver body would perfectly align with the power connector once placed into the holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are excellent heads</li>
            <li>The shave itself is excellent and lasts until mid-evening.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect solution.  </li>
            <li>I get the closest, best shave in years.  </li>
            <li>I have owned Norelco shavers for over 40 years and this one is the best one yet.</li>
            <li>Best razor ever.  </li>
            <li>would be nice if it came with a power cord!!</li>
            <li>Very good quality.</li>
            <li>Very good and works well.</li>

            <li>Great service, great product - very happy.</li>
            <li>The quality of the shaver is excellent and the cleaning system is a nice touch.</li>
            <li>Razor works great.  </li>
            <li>Well, It has a great battery.</li>
            <li>The charging stand of the 8000 series was quite convenient for home use, but not so great for having to take it on the road, so like the option now with the charging cord and cleaning system.</li>
            <li>Great shaver,easy cleaning</li>
            <li>Great for multi-day growths.  </li>
            <li>what a great idea that Philips Norelco genious had.</li>
            <li>as stated&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with prduct.</li>
            <li>I decided to give Philips a try since I got a great deal on it</li>
            <li>LOL I can&#x27;t help my weakness for electric shavers</li>
            <li>The speed settings are nice, but I don&#x27;t change them often and the battery meter is the best option-</li>
            <li>Best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned, awesome comfortable shave</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It looks very nice in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;-it</li>
            <li>He really liked it!</li>
            <li>I love it, best shaver I ever owned.</li>
            <li>best yet used norelco shavers since 1960 and this is the best yet not to sure about the clean tank</li>
            <li>The razor has a good graphical display, SO WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BEEP?  </li>
            <li>The items was good no problem at all</li>
            <li>Good for curly or irregular hair growth patterns.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Philips shavers for 30 years, since I was 18 and have always had good experience.  </li>
            <li>The shave I get from it would be comparable to that of a good safety razor.</li>
            <li>good equipment for the price - good shaver in and of itself</li>
            <li>By comparison Braun was the best designed, most ergonomic, and felt more quality.  </li>
            <li>i bought this for my workmate, she will love this!</li>
            <li>Amazing shave.  </li>
            <li>Amazing shaver.</li>
            <li>Nice close shave.</li>
            <li>It does provide a nice shave</li>
            <li>Panasonic&#x27;s ES-LV61-A Arc5, which I also own.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely the best electric shaver l have ever used.</li>
            <li>Works as good or better than described.</li>
            <li>Really Nice razor...</li>
            <li>has a nice and convenient cleaning</li>
            <li>Gives a nice close shave.</li>
            <li>The Norelco head fits and follows the contours of your face nicely.</li>
            <li>Besides, I have my own bathroom and there is plenty of room on my counter</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very close to being perfect and that is after 5 days of shaving.</li>
            <li>This Norelco is the best by far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is where Norelco is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>This is my 5th Norelco over about a 30 year span and by far the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had from any of them.  </li>
            <li>So far the shaver has performed excellently and has had an amazng battery life.  </li>
            <li>While it was purchaged for my 17 year old son, I occationally use it with excellent results.  </li>
            <li>At this price I expect a good clean comfortable shave and that is not what I got!  </li>
            <li>Leaves face very smooth</li>
            <li>Nice razor - easy to use,</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>and I have enjoyed all of them.</li>
            <li>Too many bells and whistles&lt;</li>
            <li>Works perfect, very quiet, and</li>
            <li>I love the razor.</li>
            <li>Outstanding, exceeded expectations</li>
            <li>Yes, way more convenient - I love sitting in my bed shaving, without the hassle of water, shave cream, etc.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many Brauns, a Remington</li>
            <li>It feels like it gives a better shave on the neck than my foil shaver.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-I have to re-shave everywhere with a Norelco Arcitec, which I love.</li>
            <li>Easily better than its Braun equivalent.</li>
            <li>The razor I had before this one was much better.</li>
            <li>Razor is good but the cleaner that comes with it isn&#x27;t worth a flip.</li>
            <li>Love this Norelco shaver.  </li>
            <li>and my dad was satisfied with his Norelco.</li>
            <li>At one point the electric pump just pumped all the cleaning fluid out of the container- brilliant!!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t get burned like I did buy a better brand like Braun or Remington.</li>
            <li>In order to facilitate shaver glide across my skin, I have found that a good pre-shave such as the Aramis Lab Series for Men Electric Shave Solution available here on Amazon is ideal.</li>
            <li>I guess Norelco figures this configuration is better than the flip up design of my 3100?  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Outstanding smoothness and the flexibility of the heads is better than advertised-</li>
            <li>It is OK.</li>
            <li>and I thought of buying it since Brauns have served me well for the better part of two decades,</li>
            <li>Great shaver, easy to operate and a very close shave.</li>
            <li>I feel that good hot water works just as well as their cleaning system.</li>
            <li>Closest most comfortable shaver I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>At the end of the day I have owned an old phillips shaver that still works great</li>
            <li>I love the cleaning mechanism as it is hassle free.</li>
            <li>and so far happy with it.</li>
            <li>Works great for me, and the new cleaning system is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Expecting great things, I was excited to try the new shave.  </li>
            <li>so you can&#x27;t take it easy on your face if you are easily irritated.</li>
            <li>The save on the chin and face was close and easy</li>
            <li>Cleaning is easy</li>
            <li>this thing easily gets to every part of your face.</li>
            <li>so I gave him my 8000 series purchased from Amazon a couple of months ago, hands down the best electric I ever had.</li>
            <li>I have to say that I was excited to use this as I was many reviews says its good for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I quickly decided that even though a foil irritated my face more it gave a quicker and closer shave compared to a Norelco, and I stuck with Brauns since then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to charge, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The 9300 is a good shaver, but not as good as the previous ones.  </li>
            <li>Does not feel comfortable on the face, drags and does not follow contours well</li>
            <li>As someone stated earlier, the Braun cleaning system works great.</li>
            <li>Oh, and the designers offer no setting to turn off the sound.  </li>
            <li>, it made a screeching sound as I shaved, it didn&#x27;t shave any closer than the 1250</li>
            <li>Tore my face to shreds and could never get a completely smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>I replaced it with a cheap Braun WaterFlex (3 Series) and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li>easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic shaver.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>This Philips razor feels cheap and plastic like.</li>
            <li>My primary reason for returning this razor was the cleaning station.</li>
            <li>I have found that the razor heads for the 8000 fit on the 9000.</li>
            <li>What is supremely important in this time trial is that you not &amp;#34;clean up&amp;#34; with a blade or mix and match with a foil shaver.</li>
            <li>There is sound associated with this procedure that goes on for hours.  </li>
            <li>Clean easy shave.</li>
            <li>but so far so good some people don&#x27;t like change</li>
            <li>This shaver has the closest shave I have had with any Norelco Product, not only that it has my full support as a great product just because of the Company.</li>
            <li>I was really excited when I got this razor.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I will give you an honest and thorough review of my new shaver.</li>
            <li>Braun&#x27;s cleaning system is by far the best as the razor keeps time that you used it between cleanings and the overall cleaning time is adjusted accordingly.  </li>
            <li>My husband was always complaining that it wouldn&#x27;t give him a clean shave.</li>
            <li>Have not used the cleaning device as of yet just clean with a brush and water at the moment.</li>
            <li>The head is easy to remove and a quick rinse on the head and the top of the headless shaver, is easily accomplished.</li>
            <li>BUT I would buy it again in a heart beat as I love the Shaver and the Smart Jet Clean</li>
            <li>Of course, when I&#x27;m not shaving for more than 4-5 days after shaving with Norelco I have to use a blade razor, but on a day-to-day shaving - clearance of face is on a very high level.</li>
            <li>I currently have a Panasonic ES-LA63-S (which I love as far as foil shavers go) and a Braun 790 cc (which I also love given its smaller head and superb cleaning module).</li>
            <li>Big mistake, but to be fair</li>
            <li>the shave would be just as good if I made some 15 passes over the same area instead of 2-3.  </li>
            <li>It hugs my face much better and is much quieter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but that was the only good thing about it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Been a philipshaver user for last 15 years, and this one&#x27;s as good as a shaver should be.</li>
            <li>The instructions say this is necessary for optimum hygiene, but does not sterilize the shaver.</li>
            <li>Panasonic&#x27;s cleaning station is not as advanced as Braun&#x27;s, but far better than Norelco&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>The giant cleaning bucket system seems to be nothing more than an elaborate gimmick to require you to buy cleaning solution every month or two.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the Norelco and highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>The Philips produces a quiet &amp;#34;whirling&amp;#34; sound in operation, which is a welcome improvement over the loud buzz emitted by Braun&#x27;s foil</li>
            <li>With the new detachable head, opening the blade cavity and emptying clippings is more challenging.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Panasonic shaved very well, but the build quality felt cheap and the LCD display was not as informative as Braun&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Shaves and trims really close, even though it doesn&#x27;t sound powerful.  </li>
            <li>Phillips really made a cheap product here</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll discover that with patience and a calm demeanor (don&#x27;t panic whatever you do), your shaves will improve.</li>
            <li>I figure it&#x27;s well worth it.  </li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t seem worth it.</li>
            <li>It did do a superior job on the neck area, but again that always caused irritation and I&#x27;m sure several extra passes with Braun or Panasonic would&#x27;ve done just as well as this razor.  </li>
            <li>It also has quick clean mode, and because the cleaning solution is 40% alcohol with some additives, it dries rather fast.</li>
            <li>I am debating if getting the SmartClean stand replaced is worth it at this point.</li>
            <li>only gave this razor a couple days and during that time I did get some nice shaves out of it.</li>
            <li>If you can get it on sale, definitely worth the investment</li>
            <li>then I pop it into the hygiene console which, with the aid of electricity, irrigates  the cutters with a fresh smelling liquid then dries it with a fan.  </li>
            <li>I use it right and have lots of experience with Norelco rotary shavers.</li>
            <li>right.</li>
            <li>Requires way too much maintenance to keep it clean</li>
            <li>The only thing I can give a 5 star to is Amazons easy hassle free return policy.</li>
            <li>I have had Braun, Panasonic, Remington and Norelco shavers in the past but the 9000 series is great.</li>
            <li>Regarding Braun and Panasonic--Braun was better on the neck area, while Panasonic gave an overall better and faster shave with most areas requiring no more than 2-3 smooth, straight-line passes.  </li>
            <li>nice but still feel a little cheap with</li>
            <li>What is particularly noticeable is the fact that flat-lying hairs on my neck are easily caught by the Norelco, not something easily accomplished with a foil shaver.</li>
            <li>The razor is very light and very quiet.  </li>
            <li>The Philips Norelco S9311 is very light and produces very low noise while shaving.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>Use the 3rd speed setting and it gives a very smooth shave without any irritation.</li>
            <li>I returned my first razor.</li>
            <li>, thus lesser irritation, and their cleaning systems are way better.  </li>
            <li>I tended to get a moldy smell after many uses in my prior Norelco.</li>
            <li>I really like and prefer Norelco Shavers, generally, and have used them for many years.</li>
            <li>So I must shave twice, which is a pain.&lt;br /&gt;-It is recommended to rinse it under hot running water after each shave.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>Have always used Norelco in the past and they just keep getting better and better.  </li>
            <li>Did exactly what it said in instruction and even video tutorials online.</li>
            <li>Since so many others are reporting issues with the cleaning station, I don&#x27;t think mine was necessarily a lemon.</li>
            <li>But basically the shaver works much better than the former generation and entry-level machines.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s pretty quite when running.</li>
            <li>I disraged the pain at first as the instruction mentioned that I need 3-weeks to get to use to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m well aware of their strengths and weaknesses.</li>
            <li>the shaver is light, easy to hold (in spite of its lack of the curvature of older Norelcos) and supremely quiet.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;ve been reasonably pleased with the shaver and its cleaning module.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Smartclean system works pretty neat,</li>
            <li>After six months though, my face evidently still hasn&#x27;t adjusted because there is still stubble.  </li>
            <li>I first started shaving</li>
            <li>Shaver has performed well for the first week of usage.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Norelco razors for over 50 years, and each new one was better than the old one, until now.</li>
            <li>I can only imagine that in another week&#x27;s time this will become my one and only shaver, it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li>got this guy to replace my aging 9100 series (older model) and right out the box</li>
            <li>So, it is it worth more than the other shavers?</li>
            <li>The first one I received didn&#x27;t cut very close, but I thought it was just breaking in.  </li>
            <li>The quality is far superior to other shavers.</li>
            <li>The new style works as well as the old one, but I think it&#x27;s more of a styling innovation than a new way of shaving.</li>
            <li>I used blades, and then quickly moved over to electric shavers, trying out the newest models at the time (A Norelco Quadra Action, and what I believe was a Braun Flex Control)</li>
            <li>and I have large hands</li>
            <li>That cleaning station is LARGE -- it&#x27;s 8&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Cleaning module: The cleaning module is NOT overly large as some have suggested.</li>
            <li>I find the complaints lodged against the cleaning module to be largely without merit.</li>
            <li>this must be my final assessment.ying hairs on my neck are easily caught by the Norelco, not something easily accomplished with a foil shaver.</li>
            <li>The cleaner worked fine for about 6 months and then it stopped cleaning altogether, only I never realized it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also fine if you are not in a historic drought and can spare the water.  </li>
            <li>It takes many passes (more than the other two shavers) and, when I finish shaving with it, I can still feel that hair was not completely removed.</li>
            <li>This would be ideal if you have soft and little facial hair.</li>
            <li>The new shaving heads definitely work better than my older SpeedXL model.</li>
            <li>I love the wet shave as it is not irritating to my skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks goodness for the Amazon rerun policy</li>
            <li>After 1 year and a whole replacement set of the orange retainers, my shaver routinely falls apart.  </li>
            <li>But this is not by design, it&#x27;s just very low-power razor.  </li>
            <li>and oh yes, the washer doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>how much easier it is on your skin.  </li>
            <li>the cleaning accessory doesn&#x27;t add much</li>
            <li>I really like all the improvements.</li>
            <li>More than expected</li>
            <li>Fast and as promised.</li>
            <li>Follows facial contours fabulously.  </li>
            <li>DON&#x27;T Shave very close</li>
            <li>The friction between the skin and the  3 shaving heads is too much.  </li>
            <li>It is much lighter, which is both a pro and a con.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give the Norelco credit here that it provided a very close shave and the head design</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like the Norelco but the build quality and quality control issues</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep that money for myself, thanks.  </li>
            <li>Do not apply too much pressure since that will lead to irritation and defeat the lift and cut design of the heads.</li>
            <li>I would say it&#x27;s very close to perfection</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pleased to report that the shaves have improved minimally.</li>
            <li>All this flexibility means that with a light touch it simply floats around my face removing whiskers with robot kisses.</li>
            <li>I am 62 years old and have finally found an electric shaver that is good enough.</li>
            <li>was much better than my old Series 3, which only pivoted one way.</li>
            <li>The first 9300 had a defective washing device and the replacement was also defective, so Norelco sent a completely new razor and washing unit.</li>
            <li>It turns out that now I have to clean it daily</li>
            <li>Philips customer support was very helpful and sent out a new one right away and included a return shipping label for the old one.</li>
            <li>Oh, and the cleaning process is really no better than running your shaving screens under warm water once per week.  </li>
            <li>have a very rich beard hair and sensitive skin, I regularly use Gillet type razors (power type 5 blades) with sensitive skin type shaver cream to shave with no issue.</li>
            <li>The entire setup including cleaning station is huge takes up considerable counter space</li>
            <li>This one us even better than the previous.  </li>
            <li>Cuts almost as smoothly as a blade; I think the lubricant from the cleaning solution must dry on the head and help the shaver slide across the skin.</li>
            <li>I particularly like the self cleaning feature.</li>
            <li>BECAUSE IT&#x27;S ANNOYINGLY LOUD AND LEAVES THE RAZOR WET MOST OF THE TIME.  </li>
            <li>Updated 10/3/2015 - Had a problem with the main housing.</li>
            <li>though this more expensive model would do a better job</li>
            <li>/&gt;Build quality&lt;br /&gt;Definitely inferior to my cheaper and older Braun 390cc.</li>
            <li>and I have not seen any reason to downgrade them over the older RQ12 Sensotouch heads.</li>
            <li>This morning I pulled out my older Norelco AT895 and was able to duplicate the shave of the 9311 at about half the cost.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve taken out 1 star as I still have to use my manual blade on one particular area.</li>
            <li>Both the first razor and its replacement made loud screeching, metal against metal type sounds, as it passed from my cheek to my neck, so loud that my wife called from the other room and asked if I were OK.</li>
            <li>but instead I decided to take a gamble and try a new rotary razor for the first time in nearly 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just clean it daily with an old tooth brush and run water through it once a week.</li>
            <li>Shaves great but the on off button in the wrong place.usually turn it off 2 to 3 times while shaving.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this shaver (got this at Costco - 9400 series) and so far works very well for my face.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s enough of an upgrade from the cheaper styles to make it worth the money.</li>
            <li>Bottom line, I think it is worth it simply for</li>
            <li>is worth the extra effort shaving with electrics require.</li>
            <li>Very close shave,seems to be pretty durable so far,hope it last</li>
            <li>I took 3-4 times the normal shaving time and still i needed to use a Gillette razor on the neck.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not about to rush through the shaving process to save a few precious minutes</li>
            <li>But I found that it is not enough powerful for me.</li>
            <li>Simply put, a rotary razor does not need as powerful of motor to keep it moving at an optimal speed.</li>
            <li>You finally got it right.  </li>
            <li>Final Update: After about five weeks I must conclude that the Norelco S9300 series shaver is a very good shaver, albeit not perfect.</li>
            <li>I have used Norelco Shavers for years, decided I wanted to try one of the new designs.  </li>
            <li>The new detachable head is wobbly and takes getting used to.  </li>
            <li>Philips Norelco claims that it takes 21 days to have the skin adapted to this new shaver.</li>
            <li>appearance.&lt;br /&gt;After the new shave experience, a flashing icon prompts to wash out the shaver.  </li>
            <li>Now I have the new one, and it basically shaves me to a &amp;#34;5-O&#x27;clock shadow&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I buy a new razor about every 10yrs</li>
            <li>as the foil wore out I went in search of a new shaver, The Braun series 9 was newly released</li>
            <li>Does not shave my beard nearly as close as the older shavers</li>
            <li>The Trimmer that comes with it is a little clunky and does not work as well as the one from the older Norelco Razor that I replaced that Still works fine by the way so for me</li>
            <li>Those users that praise this shaver must have a very soft beard.</li>
            <li>While the shave isn&#x27;t as close as a blade, the skin on my neck is very sensitive and I would get lots of razor bumps.</li>
            <li>If you have very sensitive skin, I would probably stick to a foil razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In conclusion, I have found through my six month trial, that the 9300 is less convenient, more time consuming, more energy and water consuming, and the same shave closeness as my old 3100 that cost $160 less.</li>
            <li>am white and have full growth but it is fine and straight, not heavy and thick or curly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Might step down a model and avoid the cleaning station or buy one of the older looking models that makes it easier to clean the clippings.  </li>
            <li>all my complaints of missed spots are gone because there are no more missed spots with this shaver :)</li>
            <li>This was my first big shaver purchase.</li>
            <li>The on/off switch is located where my thumb would normally rest and thus I end up turning off the razor during a shave or I have to hold the razor in a manner that does not feel natural to me.</li>
            <li>It is a tad bit nosier than my SpeedXL, the speed settings are mostly a gimmick (not sure why anyone would need slower settings).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No many how many times I go over my face, I still have end of day stubble.  </li>
            <li>I take the time and make several passes (particularly with the straight motions I mentioned).  </li>
            <li>I was in the market for a new electric razor after the battery in my old Braun 390cc</li>
            <li>Panasonic and Braun shave almost as good and take far less time and less passes</li>
            <li>Everyday cleaning is easy - I have not use the cleaning bath yet.</li>
            <li>The shave is exactly the same as my old razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The case is stylish and wit works well with both wet and dry shaving.</li>
            <li>Always on the lookout for a better electric razor and after a couple weeks with this one, I can say it is definitely an improvement over their previous model.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light weight and the rough case especially.</li>
            <li>/&gt;As far as the cleaning system.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After nearly a year of use, I here are some CONS:&lt;br /</li>
            <li>The cleaning process is loud....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to rinsing my old razor under warmwater once per week and this worked well for years --</li>
            <li>As mentioned earlier the rotary shaving blades aregood and are not gimmicky--they really pull up the hair for closer shave, unlike Braun&#x27;s claims of some &amp;#34;sonic vibrations&amp;#34; that supposedly lift the hair.  </li>
            <li>Both Braun and Panasonic are much faster -- to clean/charge you simply drop the shaver into the system and press a button.  </li>
            <li>Battery lasts for about 5 10-minute shaves, which is the time it takes me to complete my shaving</li>
            <li>After having the unit for several months I really like the razor.  </li>
            <li>I will probably go back to blade shaving for a while, it&#x27;s really a tossup.</li>
            <li>really turned me off on this product, especially considering it&#x27;s at the top-end of the market.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to use an aftershave balm with natural ingredients to replenish the moisture in my skin.</li>
            <li>If need be, I will use straight strokes horizontally and vertically on the upper lip (and jawline) even though this is not the recommended Philips&#x27; method.</li>
            <li>charge.fortunately, I have a old Philips shaver, the old charger can work with 9300.</li>
            <li>The only downside to shaving is the sideburn trimmer is not integrated so it takes a few more seconds to finish your shave.  </li>
            <li>I keep buying Norelco shavers every few years, keep hoping they will have improved enough to be clearly better than blade shaving, but it never quite happens.  </li>
            <li>The soft whir of its cutters compared to other shavers is distinctly noticeable and a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li>The 9000 is a quantum leap from the quadra action of days past, the familiar slots are still there (though now in a V shape), but now with a huge open chasm with a comb to capture very (and I mean very it chews through a 5 day beard like nothing) hairs.</li>
            <li>I could not bear the pain or waste the time to have a clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s MUCH BIGGER than the older models.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;d stick with one of Norelco&#x27;s older models and save the cash, even though I do like the bells and whistles.</li>
            <li>and I discovered that to take the blades out one needs to unscrew a small unmarked top piece with a plastic gadget that you will soon lose, and then wash the blades and somehow keep turning and turning the locking unit (remember its unmarked) until it finally clicks into place.</li>
            <li>Very large and does not fit the hand as well as older Norelco&#x27;s,</li>
            <li>I genuinely enjoy shaving (hey... it&#x27;s my celebrating of being male for crying out loud)</li>
            <li>Changing the shaving heads means carefully reading the manual first.  </li>
            <li>The more expensive Norelco&#x27;s seem to prove themselves worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>My Philips stable include my newly purchased Norelco 9400 (Costco branded but essentially an S9311) and an AT895 with HQ8 heads.</li>
            <li>It does clean, but operation is awkward, takes over four hours overall, and you can&#x27;t just place the razor into the cleaning system--you have to clamp it on top.  </li>
            <li>The detergent solution is water-based and doesn&#x27;t dry as readily as Braun&#x27;s--it takes about an hour, but still beats Norelco&#x27;s four hours.</li>
            <li>I have divided my review into objective for the problems it really has and subjective for the things I did not personally care for but others may like.</li>
            <li>This is a replacement of a 12 year old Norelco regular style which had worn parts and a 12 year old pattery.</li>
            <li>The net result is sideburns are trimmed less often now, leaving me with a less tidy</li>
            <li>example: If I tell you to run in a straight line you can probably do this for quite some time, but If I tell you to run to a line, turn around, and run back to another line until exhaustion, you would probably tap out much earlier.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fine if you aren&#x27;t running late in effort to get to work on time.  </li>
            <li>But.... it takes multiple passes to fully shave a particular area, and likely with Braun or Panasonic</li>
            <li>Also, the Norelco is very slow and if feels that it pulls the hair more than it cuts it.  </li>
            <li>It is nice that you can shave wet or dry and when shaving wet, you can use shaving cream, but the whole idea behind using an electric shaver is to use it dry and shave quickly.  </li>
            <li>Not sure how necessary the cleaner gadget is, but the shaver itself is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Far surpasses the prior generation (which I also owned).  </li>
            <li>The Braun can&#x27;t get nearly as close a shave as this shaver (especially in the neck area).</li>
            <li>If want better design/ergonomics, go with Braun, and if you want faster shave despite worse design/quality/ergonomics go with Panasonic Arc4 or Arc5</li>
            <li>Start with the neck while the heads/cutters are cool and shave in small circular motions against the growth.</li>
            <li>I do not recommend this if you have strong and thick facial hair.</li>
            <li>tried with dry shave first two times, it took me at least twice or more amount time to shave and it was not clean shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slightly larger than either the older Sensotouch module or the Braun model but in truth, it&#x27;s not nearly what some reviewers have made it out to be.</li>
            <li>It was also much heavier than the other two.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say from the onset that neither one of them is perfect, but this is by far the worst of three in every respect.  </li>
            <li>Both are left to dry on the bathroom counter and ready for use the following morning.   </li>
            <li>Who wants to be assaulted by some harsh buzzing in one&#x27;s ears early in the morning?</li>
            <li>There is no irritation whatsoever, the shaves last between 8 and 10 minutes and I have been following them with a skin moisturizer (i.e. I use one by Pacific Shaving Company since their products use natural, organic ingredients).</li>
            <li>I have my replacement, and it is not dry sometimes after being in for 24 hours.</li>
            <li>I have no way to rate the shavers long term reliability, but my last Norelco shaver lasted five years and died the morning that my new 9000 was delivered.</li>
            <li>I have strong thick hair and it takes long time to shave.</li>
            <li>Would much prefer the flat matte black on my old Braun&#x27;s cleaning station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My first few times shaving with this</li>
            <li>I have been shaving with Norelco razors for over 40 years, and this razor is the most expensive and most poorly designed razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li>The older Norelco doesn&#x27;t look as sleek or sharp but it does the job just as well as the newer design.</li>
            <li>It started making noises, and after a cleaning the razer head was so jammed I had to purchase a new one.  </li>
            <li>It takes me half the time to shave with the Braun shaver, and it is provides a much closer shave.</li>
            <li>It takes me half the time to shave with the Braun shaver, and it is provides a much closer shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes at least 10 minutes to get an adequate shave and even then it is not a close shave, and you have to switch heads to use the sideburn trim function.</li>
            <li>The new handle is simply over designed (looks ergonomic but is not) and not nearly as effective as the older solid-body razor design.  </li>

            <li> Gives a nice close shave.</li>

            <li> Besides, I have my own bathroom and there is plenty of room on my counter</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very close to being perfect and that is after 5 days of shaving.</li>
            <li> This Norelco is the best by far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is where Norelco is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> This is my 5th Norelco over about a 30 year span and by far the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had from any of them.  </li>
            <li> So far the shaver has performed excellently and has had an amazng battery life.  </li>

            <li> I love the razor.</li>
            <li> Outstanding, exceeded expectations</li>
            <li> Yes, way more convenient - I love sitting in my bed shaving, without the hassle of water, shave cream, etc.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many Brauns, a Remington</li>
            <li> It feels like it gives a better shave on the neck than my foil shaver.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-I have to re-shave everywhere with a Norelco Arcitec, which I love.</li>
            <li> Easily better than its Braun equivalent.</li>
            <li> The razor I had before this one was much better.</li>
            <li> Razor is good but the cleaner that comes with it isn&#x27;t worth a flip.</li>
            <li> Love this Norelco shaver.  </li>
            <li> and my dad was satisfied with his Norelco.</li>
            <li> At one point the electric pump just pumped all the cleaning fluid out of the container- brilliant!!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t get burned like I did buy a better brand like Braun or Remington.</li>
            <li> In order to facilitate shaver glide across my skin, I have found that a good pre-shave such as the Aramis Lab Series for Men Electric Shave Solution available here on Amazon is ideal.</li>
            <li> I guess Norelco figures this configuration is better than the flip up design of my 3100?  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Outstanding smoothness and the flexibility of the heads is better than advertised-</li>
            <li> It is OK.</li>
            <li> and I thought of buying it since Brauns have served me well for the better part of two decades,</li>
            <li> Great shaver, easy to operate and a very close shave.</li>
            <li> I feel that good hot water works just as well as their cleaning system.</li>
            <li> Closest most comfortable shaver I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> At the end of the day I have owned an old phillips shaver that still works great</li>
            <li> I love the cleaning mechanism as it is hassle free.</li>
            <li> and so far happy with it.</li>
            <li> Works great for me, and the new cleaning system is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Expecting great things, I was excited to try the new shave.  </li>
            <li> so you can&#x27;t take it easy on your face if you are easily irritated.</li>
            <li> The save on the chin and face was close and easy</li>
            <li> Cleaning is easy</li>
            <li> this thing easily gets to every part of your face.</li>
            <li> so I gave him my 8000 series purchased from Amazon a couple of months ago, hands down the best electric I ever had.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I was excited to use this as I was many reviews says its good for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I quickly decided that even though a foil irritated my face more it gave a quicker and closer shave compared to a Norelco, and I stuck with Brauns since then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to charge, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The 9300 is a good shaver, but not as good as the previous ones.  </li>
            <li> Does not feel comfortable on the face, drags and does not follow contours well</li>
            <li> As someone stated earlier, the Braun cleaning system works great.</li>
            <li> Oh, and the designers offer no setting to turn off the sound.  </li>
            <li> , it made a screeching sound as I shaved, it didn&#x27;t shave any closer than the 1250</li>
            <li> Tore my face to shreds and could never get a completely smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> I replaced it with a cheap Braun WaterFlex (3 Series) and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> This is a fantastic shaver.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> This Philips razor feels cheap and plastic like.</li>
            <li> My primary reason for returning this razor was the cleaning station.</li>
            <li> I have found that the razor heads for the 8000 fit on the 9000.</li>
            <li> What is supremely important in this time trial is that you not &amp;#34;clean up&amp;#34; with a blade or mix and match with a foil shaver.</li>
            <li> There is sound associated with this procedure that goes on for hours.  </li>
            <li> Clean easy shave.</li>
            <li> but so far so good some people don&#x27;t like change</li>
            <li> This shaver has the closest shave I have had with any Norelco Product, not only that it has my full support as a great product just because of the Company.</li>
            <li> I was really excited when I got this razor.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I will give you an honest and thorough review of my new shaver.</li>
            <li> Braun&#x27;s cleaning system is by far the best as the razor keeps time that you used it between cleanings and the overall cleaning time is adjusted accordingly.  </li>
            <li> My husband was always complaining that it wouldn&#x27;t give him a clean shave.</li>
            <li> Have not used the cleaning device as of yet just clean with a brush and water at the moment.</li>
            <li> The head is easy to remove and a quick rinse on the head and the top of the headless shaver, is easily accomplished.</li>
            <li> BUT I would buy it again in a heart beat as I love the Shaver and the Smart Jet Clean</li>
            <li> Of course, when I&#x27;m not shaving for more than 4-5 days after shaving with Norelco I have to use a blade razor, but on a day-to-day shaving - clearance of face is on a very high level.</li>
            <li> I currently have a Panasonic ES-LA63-S (which I love as far as foil shavers go) and a Braun 790 cc (which I also love given its smaller head and superb cleaning module).</li>
            <li> Big mistake, but to be fair</li>
            <li> the shave would be just as good if I made some 15 passes over the same area instead of 2-3.  </li>
            <li> It hugs my face much better and is much quieter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but that was the only good thing about it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Been a philipshaver user for last 15 years, and this one&#x27;s as good as a shaver should be.</li>
            <li> The instructions say this is necessary for optimum hygiene, but does not sterilize the shaver.</li>
            <li> Panasonic&#x27;s cleaning station is not as advanced as Braun&#x27;s, but far better than Norelco&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> The giant cleaning bucket system seems to be nothing more than an elaborate gimmick to require you to buy cleaning solution every month or two.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Norelco and highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> The Philips produces a quiet &amp;#34;whirling&amp;#34; sound in operation, which is a welcome improvement over the loud buzz emitted by Braun&#x27;s foil</li>
            <li> With the new detachable head, opening the blade cavity and emptying clippings is more challenging.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Panasonic shaved very well, but the build quality felt cheap and the LCD display was not as informative as Braun&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Shaves and trims really close, even though it doesn&#x27;t sound powerful.  </li>
            <li> Phillips really made a cheap product here</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll discover that with patience and a calm demeanor (don&#x27;t panic whatever you do), your shaves will improve.</li>
            <li> I figure it&#x27;s well worth it.  </li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t seem worth it.</li>
            <li> It did do a superior job on the neck area, but again that always caused irritation and I&#x27;m sure several extra passes with Braun or Panasonic would&#x27;ve done just as well as this razor.  </li>
            <li> It also has quick clean mode, and because the cleaning solution is 40% alcohol with some additives, it dries rather fast.</li>
            <li> I am debating if getting the SmartClean stand replaced is worth it at this point.</li>
            <li> only gave this razor a couple days and during that time I did get some nice shaves out of it.</li>
            <li> If you can get it on sale, definitely worth the investment</li>
            <li> then I pop it into the hygiene console which, with the aid of electricity, irrigates  the cutters with a fresh smelling liquid then dries it with a fan.  </li>
            <li> I use it right and have lots of experience with Norelco rotary shavers.</li>
            <li> right.</li>
            <li> Requires way too much maintenance to keep it clean</li>
            <li> The only thing I can give a 5 star to is Amazons easy hassle free return policy.</li>
            <li> I have had Braun, Panasonic, Remington and Norelco shavers in the past but the 9000 series is great.</li>
            <li> Regarding Braun and Panasonic--Braun was better on the neck area, while Panasonic gave an overall better and faster shave with most areas requiring no more than 2-3 smooth, straight-line passes.  </li>
            <li> nice but still feel a little cheap with</li>
            <li> What is particularly noticeable is the fact that flat-lying hairs on my neck are easily caught by the Norelco, not something easily accomplished with a foil shaver.</li>
            <li> The razor is very light and very quiet.  </li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco S9311 is very light and produces very low noise while shaving.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Use the 3rd speed setting and it gives a very smooth shave without any irritation.</li>
            <li> I returned my first razor.</li>
            <li> , thus lesser irritation, and their cleaning systems are way better.  </li>
            <li> I tended to get a moldy smell after many uses in my prior Norelco.</li>
            <li> I really like and prefer Norelco Shavers, generally, and have used them for many years.</li>
            <li> So I must shave twice, which is a pain.&lt;br /&gt;-It is recommended to rinse it under hot running water after each shave.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> Have always used Norelco in the past and they just keep getting better and better.  </li>
            <li> Did exactly what it said in instruction and even video tutorials online.</li>
            <li> Since so many others are reporting issues with the cleaning station, I don&#x27;t think mine was necessarily a lemon.</li>
            <li> But basically the shaver works much better than the former generation and entry-level machines.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s pretty quite when running.</li>
            <li> I disraged the pain at first as the instruction mentioned that I need 3-weeks to get to use to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m well aware of their strengths and weaknesses.</li>
            <li> the shaver is light, easy to hold (in spite of its lack of the curvature of older Norelcos) and supremely quiet.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;ve been reasonably pleased with the shaver and its cleaning module.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Smartclean system works pretty neat,</li>
            <li> After six months though, my face evidently still hasn&#x27;t adjusted because there is still stubble.  </li>
            <li> I first started shaving</li>
            <li> Shaver has performed well for the first week of usage.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco razors for over 50 years, and each new one was better than the old one, until now.</li>
            <li> I can only imagine that in another week&#x27;s time this will become my one and only shaver, it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> got this guy to replace my aging 9100 series (older model) and right out the box</li>
            <li> So, it is it worth more than the other shavers?</li>
            <li> The first one I received didn&#x27;t cut very close, but I thought it was just breaking in.  </li>
            <li> The quality is far superior to other shavers.</li>
            <li> The new style works as well as the old one, but I think it&#x27;s more of a styling innovation than a new way of shaving.</li>
            <li> I used blades, and then quickly moved over to electric shavers, trying out the newest models at the time (A Norelco Quadra Action, and what I believe was a Braun Flex Control)</li>
            <li> and I have large hands</li>
            <li> That cleaning station is LARGE -- it&#x27;s 8&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Cleaning module: The cleaning module is NOT overly large as some have suggested.</li>
            <li> I find the complaints lodged against the cleaning module to be largely without merit.</li>
            <li> this must be my final assessment.ying hairs on my neck are easily caught by the Norelco, not something easily accomplished with a foil shaver.</li>
            <li> The cleaner worked fine for about 6 months and then it stopped cleaning altogether, only I never realized it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also fine if you are not in a historic drought and can spare the water.  </li>
            <li> It takes many passes (more than the other two shavers) and, when I finish shaving with it, I can still feel that hair was not completely removed.</li>
            <li> This would be ideal if you have soft and little facial hair.</li>
            <li> The new shaving heads definitely work better than my older SpeedXL model.</li>
            <li> I love the wet shave as it is not irritating to my skin.</li>
            <li> Thanks goodness for the Amazon rerun policy</li>
            <li> After 1 year and a whole replacement set of the orange retainers, my shaver routinely falls apart.  </li>
            <li> But this is not by design, it&#x27;s just very low-power razor.  </li>
            <li> and oh yes, the washer doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> how much easier it is on your skin.  </li>
            <li> the cleaning accessory doesn&#x27;t add much</li>
            <li> I really like all the improvements.</li>
            <li> More than expected</li>
            <li> Fast and as promised.</li>
            <li> Follows facial contours fabulously.  </li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T Shave very close</li>
            <li> The friction between the skin and the  3 shaving heads is too much.  </li>
            <li> It is much lighter, which is both a pro and a con.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give the Norelco credit here that it provided a very close shave and the head design</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like the Norelco but the build quality and quality control issues</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep that money for myself, thanks.  </li>
            <li> Do not apply too much pressure since that will lead to irritation and defeat the lift and cut design of the heads.</li>
            <li> I would say it&#x27;s very close to perfection</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pleased to report that the shaves have improved minimally.</li>
            <li> All this flexibility means that with a light touch it simply floats around my face removing whiskers with robot kisses.</li>
            <li> I am 62 years old and have finally found an electric shaver that is good enough.</li>
            <li> was much better than my old Series 3, which only pivoted one way.</li>
            <li> The first 9300 had a defective washing device and the replacement was also defective, so Norelco sent a completely new razor and washing unit.</li>
            <li> It turns out that now I have to clean it daily</li>
            <li> Philips customer support was very helpful and sent out a new one right away and included a return shipping label for the old one.</li>
            <li> Oh, and the cleaning process is really no better than running your shaving screens under warm water once per week.  </li>
            <li> have a very rich beard hair and sensitive skin, I regularly use Gillet type razors (power type 5 blades) with sensitive skin type shaver cream to shave with no issue.</li>
            <li> The entire setup including cleaning station is huge takes up considerable counter space</li>
            <li> This one us even better than the previous.  </li>
            <li> Cuts almost as smoothly as a blade; I think the lubricant from the cleaning solution must dry on the head and help the shaver slide across the skin.</li>
            <li> I particularly like the self cleaning feature.</li>
            <li> BECAUSE IT&#x27;S ANNOYINGLY LOUD AND LEAVES THE RAZOR WET MOST OF THE TIME.  </li>
            <li> Updated 10/3/2015 - Had a problem with the main housing.</li>
            <li> though this more expensive model would do a better job</li>
            <li> /&gt;Build quality&lt;br /&gt;Definitely inferior to my cheaper and older Braun 390cc.</li>
            <li> and I have not seen any reason to downgrade them over the older RQ12 Sensotouch heads.</li>
            <li> This morning I pulled out my older Norelco AT895 and was able to duplicate the shave of the 9311 at about half the cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken out 1 star as I still have to use my manual blade on one particular area.</li>
            <li> Both the first razor and its replacement made loud screeching, metal against metal type sounds, as it passed from my cheek to my neck, so loud that my wife called from the other room and asked if I were OK.</li>
            <li> but instead I decided to take a gamble and try a new rotary razor for the first time in nearly 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just clean it daily with an old tooth brush and run water through it once a week.</li>
            <li> Shaves great but the on off button in the wrong place.usually turn it off 2 to 3 times while shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver (got this at Costco - 9400 series) and so far works very well for my face.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s enough of an upgrade from the cheaper styles to make it worth the money.</li>
            <li> Bottom line, I think it is worth it simply for</li>
            <li> is worth the extra effort shaving with electrics require.</li>
            <li> Very close shave,seems to be pretty durable so far,hope it last</li>
            <li> I took 3-4 times the normal shaving time and still i needed to use a Gillette razor on the neck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not about to rush through the shaving process to save a few precious minutes</li>
            <li> But I found that it is not enough powerful for me.</li>
            <li> Simply put, a rotary razor does not need as powerful of motor to keep it moving at an optimal speed.</li>
            <li> You finally got it right.  </li>
            <li> Final Update: After about five weeks I must conclude that the Norelco S9300 series shaver is a very good shaver, albeit not perfect.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco Shavers for years, decided I wanted to try one of the new designs.  </li>
            <li> The new detachable head is wobbly and takes getting used to.  </li>
            <li> Philips Norelco claims that it takes 21 days to have the skin adapted to this new shaver.</li>
            <li> appearance.&lt;br /&gt;After the new shave experience, a flashing icon prompts to wash out the shaver.  </li>
            <li> Now I have the new one, and it basically shaves me to a &amp;#34;5-O&#x27;clock shadow&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I buy a new razor about every 10yrs</li>
            <li> as the foil wore out I went in search of a new shaver, The Braun series 9 was newly released</li>
            <li> Does not shave my beard nearly as close as the older shavers</li>
            <li> The Trimmer that comes with it is a little clunky and does not work as well as the one from the older Norelco Razor that I replaced that Still works fine by the way so for me</li>
            <li> Those users that praise this shaver must have a very soft beard.</li>
            <li> While the shave isn&#x27;t as close as a blade, the skin on my neck is very sensitive and I would get lots of razor bumps.</li>
            <li> If you have very sensitive skin, I would probably stick to a foil razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In conclusion, I have found through my six month trial, that the 9300 is less convenient, more time consuming, more energy and water consuming, and the same shave closeness as my old 3100 that cost $160 less.</li>
            <li> am white and have full growth but it is fine and straight, not heavy and thick or curly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Might step down a model and avoid the cleaning station or buy one of the older looking models that makes it easier to clean the clippings.  </li>
            <li> all my complaints of missed spots are gone because there are no more missed spots with this shaver :)</li>
            <li> This was my first big shaver purchase.</li>
            <li> The on/off switch is located where my thumb would normally rest and thus I end up turning off the razor during a shave or I have to hold the razor in a manner that does not feel natural to me.</li>
            <li> It is a tad bit nosier than my SpeedXL, the speed settings are mostly a gimmick (not sure why anyone would need slower settings).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No many how many times I go over my face, I still have end of day stubble.  </li>
            <li> I take the time and make several passes (particularly with the straight motions I mentioned).  </li>
            <li> I was in the market for a new electric razor after the battery in my old Braun 390cc</li>
            <li> Panasonic and Braun shave almost as good and take far less time and less passes</li>
            <li> Everyday cleaning is easy - I have not use the cleaning bath yet.</li>
            <li> The shave is exactly the same as my old razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The case is stylish and wit works well with both wet and dry shaving.</li>
            <li> Always on the lookout for a better electric razor and after a couple weeks with this one, I can say it is definitely an improvement over their previous model.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s light weight and the rough case especially.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as the cleaning system.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After nearly a year of use, I here are some CONS:&lt;br /</li>
            <li> The cleaning process is loud....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to rinsing my old razor under warmwater once per week and this worked well for years --</li>
            <li> As mentioned earlier the rotary shaving blades aregood and are not gimmicky--they really pull up the hair for closer shave, unlike Braun&#x27;s claims of some &amp;#34;sonic vibrations&amp;#34; that supposedly lift the hair.  </li>
            <li> Both Braun and Panasonic are much faster -- to clean/charge you simply drop the shaver into the system and press a button.  </li>
            <li> Battery lasts for about 5 10-minute shaves, which is the time it takes me to complete my shaving</li>
            <li> After having the unit for several months I really like the razor.  </li>
            <li> I will probably go back to blade shaving for a while, it&#x27;s really a tossup.</li>
            <li> really turned me off on this product, especially considering it&#x27;s at the top-end of the market.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to use an aftershave balm with natural ingredients to replenish the moisture in my skin.</li>
            <li> If need be, I will use straight strokes horizontally and vertically on the upper lip (and jawline) even though this is not the recommended Philips&#x27; method.</li>
            <li> charge.fortunately, I have a old Philips shaver, the old charger can work with 9300.</li>
            <li> The only downside to shaving is the sideburn trimmer is not integrated so it takes a few more seconds to finish your shave.  </li>
            <li> I keep buying Norelco shavers every few years, keep hoping they will have improved enough to be clearly better than blade shaving, but it never quite happens.  </li>
            <li> The soft whir of its cutters compared to other shavers is distinctly noticeable and a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> The 9000 is a quantum leap from the quadra action of days past, the familiar slots are still there (though now in a V shape), but now with a huge open chasm with a comb to capture very (and I mean very it chews through a 5 day beard like nothing) hairs.</li>
            <li> I could not bear the pain or waste the time to have a clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s MUCH BIGGER than the older models.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;d stick with one of Norelco&#x27;s older models and save the cash, even though I do like the bells and whistles.</li>
            <li> and I discovered that to take the blades out one needs to unscrew a small unmarked top piece with a plastic gadget that you will soon lose, and then wash the blades and somehow keep turning and turning the locking unit (remember its unmarked) until it finally clicks into place.</li>
            <li> Very large and does not fit the hand as well as older Norelco&#x27;s,</li>
            <li> I genuinely enjoy shaving (hey... it&#x27;s my celebrating of being male for crying out loud)</li>
            <li> Changing the shaving heads means carefully reading the manual first.  </li>
            <li> The more expensive Norelco&#x27;s seem to prove themselves worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> My Philips stable include my newly purchased Norelco 9400 (Costco branded but essentially an S9311) and an AT895 with HQ8 heads.</li>
            <li> It does clean, but operation is awkward, takes over four hours overall, and you can&#x27;t just place the razor into the cleaning system--you have to clamp it on top.  </li>
            <li> The detergent solution is water-based and doesn&#x27;t dry as readily as Braun&#x27;s--it takes about an hour, but still beats Norelco&#x27;s four hours.</li>
            <li> I have divided my review into objective for the problems it really has and subjective for the things I did not personally care for but others may like.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement of a 12 year old Norelco regular style which had worn parts and a 12 year old pattery.</li>
            <li> The net result is sideburns are trimmed less often now, leaving me with a less tidy</li>
            <li> example: If I tell you to run in a straight line you can probably do this for quite some time, but If I tell you to run to a line, turn around, and run back to another line until exhaustion, you would probably tap out much earlier.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s fine if you aren&#x27;t running late in effort to get to work on time.  </li>
            <li> But.... it takes multiple passes to fully shave a particular area, and likely with Braun or Panasonic</li>
            <li> Also, the Norelco is very slow and if feels that it pulls the hair more than it cuts it.  </li>
            <li> It is nice that you can shave wet or dry and when shaving wet, you can use shaving cream, but the whole idea behind using an electric shaver is to use it dry and shave quickly.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how necessary the cleaner gadget is, but the shaver itself is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Far surpasses the prior generation (which I also owned).  </li>
            <li> The Braun can&#x27;t get nearly as close a shave as this shaver (especially in the neck area).</li>
            <li> If want better design/ergonomics, go with Braun, and if you want faster shave despite worse design/quality/ergonomics go with Panasonic Arc4 or Arc5</li>
            <li> Start with the neck while the heads/cutters are cool and shave in small circular motions against the growth.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this if you have strong and thick facial hair.</li>
            <li> tried with dry shave first two times, it took me at least twice or more amount time to shave and it was not clean shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly larger than either the older Sensotouch module or the Braun model but in truth, it&#x27;s not nearly what some reviewers have made it out to be.</li>
            <li> It was also much heavier than the other two.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say from the onset that neither one of them is perfect, but this is by far the worst of three in every respect.  </li>
            <li> Both are left to dry on the bathroom counter and ready for use the following morning.   </li>
            <li> Who wants to be assaulted by some harsh buzzing in one&#x27;s ears early in the morning?</li>
            <li> There is no irritation whatsoever, the shaves last between 8 and 10 minutes and I have been following them with a skin moisturizer (i.e. I use one by Pacific Shaving Company since their products use natural, organic ingredients).</li>
            <li> I have my replacement, and it is not dry sometimes after being in for 24 hours.</li>
            <li> I have no way to rate the shavers long term reliability, but my last Norelco shaver lasted five years and died the morning that my new 9000 was delivered.</li>
            <li> I have strong thick hair and it takes long time to shave.</li>
            <li> Would much prefer the flat matte black on my old Braun&#x27;s cleaning station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My first few times shaving with this</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with Norelco razors for over 40 years, and this razor is the most expensive and most poorly designed razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li> The older Norelco doesn&#x27;t look as sleek or sharp but it does the job just as well as the newer design.</li>
            <li> It started making noises, and after a cleaning the razer head was so jammed I had to purchase a new one.  </li>
            <li> It takes me half the time to shave with the Braun shaver, and it is provides a much closer shave.</li>
            <li> It takes me half the time to shave with the Braun shaver, and it is provides a much closer shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes at least 10 minutes to get an adequate shave and even then it is not a close shave, and you have to switch heads to use the sideburn trim function.</li>
            <li> The new handle is simply over designed (looks ergonomic but is not) and not nearly as effective as the older solid-body razor design.  </li>
            <li> So far it ranks 3rd place against the other two shavers in terms of closeness of shaving.</li>
            <li> Shaves very close and is quiet operating  but has a major design fault (at least for me).  </li>
            <li> Also Norelco&#x27;s trimmer is much bigger than the other two razors, which makes it more difficult to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does take a few weeks for your skin to acclimate to the new shaver.  </li>
            <li> when it applies the liquid a few times early on you can hear it outside the room and it freaks the cat out.  </li>
            <li> The truth is, I never really looked at the 1280&#x27;s numeric display since I always put it back into its cleaning module following each shave.</li>
            <li> Having spoken a number of times with Philips technical support I was assured that lithium-ion batteries do not need to be partially or fully depleted and in the same vein, will not over-charge.</li>
            <li> The cleaning module takes 20 minutes to flush the heads and cutters with its scented cleaning fluid (and no... it is NOT overly scented as some have complained and it disappears by the time you&#x27;re ready to use the shaver) and 4 hours to dry.</li>
            <li> You can reduce the irritation by shaving with foam or just wet with water, but then it would take far less time to just use a regular razor.  </li>
            <li> Although I have two other electric shavers (Braun and Panasonic), reading the reviews tempted me to try this Norleco shaver because I have a lot of trouble getting a real close shave.</li>
            <li> It left an a acceptable amount of hairs in the neck area even after multiple passes of both dry followed by wet shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to have to go back on my original report but for the sake of honesty and accuracy</li>
            <li> It shaves much closer than anything I had used before (previously owned one of the 4000 series 830 shavers) and after my shaves, I have much less irritation.</li>
            <li> , it is far noiser by comparison, the shave is not nearly as good and the entire device reeks of cheap poor construction.</li>
            <li> When the razor is used wet with cleaning fluid it does not work well.</li>
            <li> The shaver has worked reasonably well over the last year, although one of the rotary blades has broken - it was time to replace the blades any way, so not a big deal.  </li>
            <li> With that out of the way, I bought this shavers for my partially paralyzed husband in order for him to keep some independence and give me a break from constant cleaning.  </li>
            <li> thus, if you have a tough beard, don&#x27;t think twice, the Braun Series 7 is the right choice for you.</li>
            <li> thus, if you have a tough beard, don&#x27;t think twice, the Braun Series 7 is the right choice for you.</li>
            <li> I have been using a previous version for 4 years and when it was time to change there was no other brand that I saw.  </li>
            <li> Your bathroom countertop will definitely notice the new heavy looking black object.  </li>
            <li> Definitely don&#x27;t run this process with other people asleep in the room nearby.  </li>
            <li> I will, however, have something to say about how its shave holds up against other rotaries I have had (Sensotouch 1280) and currently possess (AT895).  </li>
            <li> take the head off and cold-water rinse once a week and let it air dry</li>
            <li> , it irritated my skin, the blades are quite difficult to clean</li>
            <li> It never dried, and would keep coming on every few hours making it wet again.</li>
            <li> But it takes at least 5 minutes, maybe longer, to get a shave that is decent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll break down the review into several categories: shave, build quality and ergonomics, and cleaning system:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave</li>
            <li> It is easy but inconvenient.</li>
            <li> I typically buy the top-of-the-line models and they last me anywhere between 5 and 8 years before the battery dies (won&#x27;t hold charge).  </li>
            <li> I tried both wet and dry.</li>
            <li> wet or dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In Sum, I used it 4 times for dry, 4 times for wet shave ...</li>
            <li> You need a lot less power tokeep moving an object in one constant direction</li>
            <li> As for Norelco&#x27;s cleaning cartridges, they are expensive, and are mix of detergent and alcohol-based cleaner with a built-in filter--guess Phillips engineers just quickly hacked it together from what they saw offered by Panasonic and Braun.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Option to wet shave.</li>
            <li> So now you have to wet shave.</li>
            <li> Skinnier &amp; harder to hold, but 1&amp;#34;-2&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Minus 1 star for waking my wife up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Minus 1 star for waking kids up.  </li>
            <li> Both caused minimal irritation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the wet shave feature.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> The Braun had rock solid build quality and survived a few drops with no damage at all.</li>
            <li> so read carefully)</li>
            <li> Does the job as expected.</li>
            <li> I did not try the wet shave get.</li>
            <li> advice is its not for thick hair and sensitive skin people.</li>
            <li> The cleaning station is constructed out of that nasty piano black plastic that scratches and smudges super easily.</li>
            <li> The entire process is quiet and very slick.</li>
            <li> Third, the screen has small alignment notches that are difficult to notice at first...</li>
            <li> The blade system they advertise, where one blade pulls up the hair and the other cuts it is not a gimmick and worked well for me.  </li>
            <li> The Norelco also doesn&#x27;t have a built in trimmer like the other shavers--you have to pop off the shaving head and pop on the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I am done with Norelcos and will now try some other brands.</li>
            <li> and I use it every other day it seem to be giving me a close shave</li>
            <li> I have had other brand electric razors and they don&#x27;t in my experience come close to what Philips Norelco Products do.</li>
            <li> it is only a small issue.</li>
            <li> I constantly play with these areas, which bothers my wife, until I shave again (usually over the weekend).</li>
            <li> Though it is cleaned regularly it shaves no better</li>
            <li> Mine decided to endlessly run the cleaning cycles no matter what you did.</li>
            <li> Based on other reviews here, this doesn&#x27;t seem to be an isolated problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been cleaning the heads under the tap every other day as advised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this step is necessary, except for making the cutter heads smell</li>
            <li> Extremely expensive to maintain requires cleaning fluid and suggests annual complete head replacement</li>
            <li> Before I returned it I checked to see how dirty the blade mechanism was, even though it was cleaned daily with their automatic washing device; the washing device, as has been noted by others, didn&#x27;t work very well at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Areas that have cropped up as difficult to shave (i.e. upper lip, chin, jawline) require considerable attention and time.</li>
            <li> Norelco recommends that you clean the shaver every day, but I find this impossible.</li>
            <li> I have a complaint it is only 1.</li>
            <li> Razor is not worth what it cost.</li>
            <li> I hesitate to tell you what I have given away in the past few years as I indulged my ESAS but enough said; let&#x27;s get on with the review.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a pretty annoying thing to do early in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Thumbs down.</li>
            <li> I even lost one down the drain and had to go fishing for it.  </li>
            <li> I use this shaver to take down what I grew overnight and finish with a Norelco Arcitec</li>
            <li> I prefer the XL pop-out trimmer to trim down my sideburns and reduce chest hair.</li>
            <li> I had my options narrowed down to the Norelco 9300 and the Braun 790cc (series 7).</li>
            <li> When you press down on the clamp the razor will force itself into position.</li>
            <li> yet you didn&#x27;t have to force the clamp down and cause the razor to shift into position.</li>
            <li> Let me add that I find no reason to put down the newer RQ12+ heads.</li>
            <li> I could do it with the 7100XL and all the previous models I owned over the years; not with this - you need to reduce the friction by using shaving cream or something like lectric shave lotion.  </li>
            <li> Minus 1 star for actually making the razor worse with lots of little hard-to-align parts.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Recently I&#x27;ve been unhappy with my Series 7, it constantly struggles to get sideways growing hairs near where my jawline begins and at least half of my shaving routine since 2012 has been dedicated to shaving them.</li>
            <li> In addition, when I put it at the closest  shave setting, which I do need with a tough beard, it irritated my skin, which prior Norelcos never did.</li>
            <li> but my husband has trouble when pulling the head off with the blades falling out.  </li>
            <li> there are a few things to notice:&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the cleaning station...</li>
            <li> Add that to multiple passes required for a thorough shave, and it is always irritating.  </li>
            <li> Got this as a replacement update to an 8000 series model I&#x27;ve used for a few years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few weeks now</li>
            <li> Some view this as underpowered but in fact it has plenty of power to mow down a three day growth (I would not go past this without using a beard trimmer).</li>
            <li> I recently replaced the shaving head on my Braun Series 7 (after about two years of use), and the difference versus the Norelco Philips was dramatic.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even put into words how bad this product really is!</li>
            <li> They are difficult to get locked back in.</li>
            <li> Not sure what&#x27;s going on.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure why I would want</li>
            <li> The feel is that all there is to this razor is a RC-car toy type of motor that spins at no more than ~300 rpm and a lithium-ion battery.  </li>
            <li> I am sometimes lazy about cleaning, so</li>
            <li> when I look at the cartridge I can see small hair particles &amp;#34;trapped&amp;#34; at the bottom.</li>
            <li> no more dead razor when I&#x27;m in a hurry!</li>
            <li> First off, now there is a stupid orange tool that you have to keep track of.  </li>
            <li> Faster and smoother, less irritating.  </li>
            <li> _ get a closer shave, as it is hard to apply the correct amount of pressure to your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Otherwise, by late afternoon, my face will look as if I did not shave.</li>
            <li> Some have complained that the shaver being placed in backwards prevents the user from seeing its display but who cares?</li>
            <li> It has a slow, even at the highest setting, motor encased in plastic.  </li>
            <li> This is a  real waste of money.</li>
            <li> The heads are plastic, while the unit has three speeds I have found if I use it on the slow speed it pulls my hair and hurts like hell.</li>
            <li> Second, there are stupid orange retaining rings that are very difficult to align and rotate into place and are small enough to go down your sink drain.  </li>
            <li> As I said before, it probably is due to the type of beard I have (very tough),</li>
            <li> tried then with wet shave with water only, then with shaving Gel ,,, This was a painful experience!</li>
            <li> I was honestly bored of buying gillette razors as it was to expensive as i have to shave daily.</li>
            <li> and actually it wasn&#x27;t bad, but I looked forward to an improved one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now to address a common misconception I hear hurled around about Norelco rotaries (They&#x27;re under powered!).</li>
            <li> I have a tough beard that grows in all directions</li>
            <li> Tough it out.</li>
            <li> This unit is so poorly designed I HAVE NOW GIVEN UP ON NORELCO -- Panasonic here</li>
            <li> I have thrown out the entire base (landfill).&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cleaning system is bulky and poorly designed.</li>
            <li> This is a total piece of crap...</li>
            <li> I had become tired of this and</li>
            <li> Philips was dramatic.</li>
            <li> So far, the Philips Norelco shaver does the worst job.</li>
            <li> Way too expensive</li>
            <li> This thing is a piece of expensive junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes it does seem a bit expensive</li>
            <li> but i was wrong</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It does a lousy job around the nose and lip (vermilion boarder), and neck.</li>
            <li> do not recommend this expensive model.</li>
            <li> and it is extremely difficult.</li>
            <li> (series 3) quit working and efforts to replace that battery failed.</li>
            <li> The shaving head is difficult to put on, yet one has to remove it and replace it with the separate grooming head whenever you need a trim.</li>
            <li> I have the Norelco series 8000 but the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; replacement heads are just too expensive.</li>
            <li> Therefore the additional display information the 9711 provides is essentially useless to me.</li>
            <li> use to have Philips shaver 10 years ago and was using it for some time when I had very thin hair.</li>
            <li> The heads a very poor construction and design and step backwards.</li>

            <li> Love it but my husband has trouble when pulling the head off with the blades falling out.  They are difficult to get locked back in.</li>
            <li> I have had several Norelco shavers over the years and I have enjoyed all of them. This Norelco is the best by far. I particularly like the self cleaning feature.</li>
            <li> Irresponsible packaging, lack of power line</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas present I asked my wife to get for me.  Excellent shave, like the cleaning system.  No problems and the quality and performance met expectations.  Have recommended to others.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco Shavers for years, decided I wanted to try one of the new designs.  Big mistake, but to be fair I have divided my review into objective for the problems it really has and subjective for the things I did not personally care for but others may like. I returned mine two days after receiving it.  Thanks goodness for the Amazon rerun policy, it&#x27;s the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Objective&lt;br /&gt;1. Does not shave my beard nearly as close as the older shavers&lt;br /&gt;2. Does not feel comfortable on the face, drags and does not follow contours well&lt;br /&gt;3. Very large and does not fit the hand as well as older Norelco&#x27;s, and I have large hands&lt;br /&gt;4. Requires way too much maintenance to keep it clean&lt;br /&gt;5. Extremely expensive to maintain requires cleaning fluid and suggests annual complete head replacement&lt;br /&gt;6. Does not include a built in trimmer you must remove blades and attach trimmer device&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Subjective&lt;br /&gt;1. Too many bells and whistles&lt;br /&gt;2. Way too expensive&lt;br /&gt;3. Need an engineering degree to understand all the features&lt;br /&gt;4. The entire setup including cleaning station is huge takes up considerable counter space</li>
            <li> Great gift for my husband! He loves it! Works perfect, very quiet, and all my complaints of missed spots are gone because there are no more missed spots with this shaver :)</li>
            <li> I love the razor. Nice close shave. Option to wet shave. I have used the Braun razor prior to this.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the cleaning system. Thumbs down. I returned my first razor. It never dried, and would keep coming on every few hours making it wet again. When the razor is used wet with cleaning fluid it does not work well. So now you have to wet shave. I have my replacement, and it is not dry sometimes after being in for 24 hours. Not sure what&#x27;s going on. I called Phillips, and they do not have replacement  cleaning systems, but the rep said there is one in there online store for $150! We both said that doesn&#x27;t make sense. They need to fix this issue. As someone stated earlier, the Braun cleaning system works great. I used mine for 4 years.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m wondering if anyone else has this issue with theirs?</li>
            <li> UPDATED 5/24/2017  -- AFTER A YEAR WITH THIS UNIT -- I HAVE GIVEN UP!  IT SOUNDS LIKE HEDGE CLIPPERS AND THE RAZOR INSETS KEEP FALLING OUT.  I THREW OUT THE &amp;#34;CLEANING&amp;#34; STATION 3 MONTHS AGO BECAUSE IT&#x27;S ANNOYINGLY LOUD AND LEAVES THE RAZOR WET MOST OF THE TIME.  FINALLY, 1 OUT OF 3 OF THE RAZORS NO LONGER SHAVES.  This thing is a piece of expensive junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m USE TO BE a Norelco fan and have been using their shavers for about 20 years now.  I typically buy the top-of-the-line models and they last me anywhere between 5 and 8 years before the battery dies (won&#x27;t hold charge).  I figure it&#x27;s well worth it.  This unit is so poorly designed I HAVE NOW GIVEN UP ON NORELCO -- Panasonic here I come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just got this guy to replace my aging 9100 series (older model) and right out the box there are a few things to notice:&lt;br /&gt;  (1)  It&#x27;s MUCH BIGGER than the older models.  Skinnier &amp; harder to hold, but 1&amp;#34;-2&amp;#34; longer.&lt;br /&gt;  (2)  The picture doesn&#x27;t do the massive size of the cleaning station justice.  That cleaning station is LARGE -- it&#x27;s 8&amp;#34; tall and the base is 5&amp;#34; diameter and 4&amp;#34; tall.  Your bathroom countertop will definitely notice the new heavy looking black object.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on the cleaning station...take the head off and cold-water rinse once a week and let it air dry -- works just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After nearly a year of use, I here are some CONS:&lt;br /&gt;  (1)  The darn thing BEEPS at you when you charge it.  It beeps when you put it into travel mode.  It beeps when it thinks the razor needs changing. It beeps when the battery is low.  The razor has a good graphical display, SO WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BEEP?  That&#x27;s a pretty annoying thing to do early in the morning.  Oh, and the designers offer no setting to turn off the sound.  Minus 1 star for waking my wife up.&lt;br /&gt;  (2)  The new handle is simply over designed (looks ergonomic but is not) and not nearly as effective as the older solid-body razor design.  Turns out its very difficult to get a grip with all the &amp;#34;ergonomic&amp;#34; curves in the way.&lt;br /&gt;  (3) The new detachable head is wobbly and takes getting used to.  My first few times shaving with this I definitely did _not_ get a closer shave, as it is hard to apply the correct amount of pressure to your face.&lt;br /&gt;  (4) With the new detachable head, opening the blade cavity and emptying clippings is more challenging.&lt;br /&gt;  (5)  The cleaning process is loud....when it applies the liquid a few times early on you can hear it outside the room and it freaks the cat out.  Definitely don&#x27;t run this process with other people asleep in the room nearby.  Minus 1 star for waking kids up.  Oh, and the cleaning process is really no better than running your shaving screens under warm water once per week.  I have thrown out the entire base (landfill).&lt;br /&gt;  (6) Changing the shaving heads means carefully reading the manual first.  First off, now there is a stupid orange tool that you have to keep track of.  Second, there are stupid orange retaining rings that are very difficult to align and rotate into place and are small enough to go down your sink drain.  Third, the screen has small alignment notches that are difficult to notice at first...RTFM again.  Minus 1 star for actually making the razor worse with lots of little hard-to-align parts.  After 1 year and a whole replacement set of the orange retainers, my shaver routinely falls apart.  The plastic has taken on a compression set and no longer holds the razor bits in place....I even lost one down the drain and had to go fishing for it.  THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL FLAW IN THE DESIGN OF THIS SHAVER.&lt;br /&gt;  (7) The clipper is not attached to the razor -- it&#x27;s yet another separate attachment to keep track of.  WHY?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy it again?  No.  Might step down a model and avoid the cleaning station or buy one of the older looking models that makes it easier to clean the clippings.  I&#x27;m used to rinsing my old razor under warmwater once per week and this worked well for years -- so I&#x27;m not sure why I would want a more-difficult-to-clean razor that beeps at me.would want a more-difficult-to-clean razor that beeps at me.</li>
            <li> This was my first big shaver purchase. The quality of the shaver is excellent and the cleaning system is a nice touch. It does provide a nice shave but I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s enough of an upgrade from the cheaper styles to make it worth the money. The case is stylish and wit works well with both wet and dry shaving. Easy to charge, and easy to clean. There are three different levels for shaving so you can&#x27;t take it easy on your face if you are easily irritated. Overall, I&#x27;d stick with one of Norelco&#x27;s older models and save the cash, even though I do like the bells and whistles. It just doesn&#x27;t seem worth it.</li>
            <li> I tried the Braun Series 7 and Panasonic Arc4, as well as this shaver.  I&#x27;d say from the onset that neither one of them is perfect, but this is by far the worst of three in every respect.  I&#x27;ll break down the review into several categories: shave, build quality and ergonomics, and cleaning system:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave Quality:&lt;br /&gt;This is where Norelco is by far the best.  The blade system they advertise, where one blade pulls up the hair and the other cuts it is not a gimmick and worked well for me.  But.... it takes multiple passes to fully shave a particular area, and likely with Braun or Panasonic the shave would be just as good if I made some 15 passes over the same area instead of 2-3.  Also, the Norelco is very slow and if feels that it pulls the hair more than it cuts it.  Add that to multiple passes required for a thorough shave, and it is always irritating.  You can reduce the irritation by shaving with foam or just wet with water, but then it would take far less time to just use a regular razor.  It did do a superior job on the neck area, but again that always caused irritation and I&#x27;m sure several extra passes with Braun or Panasonic would&#x27;ve done just as well as this razor.  Regarding Braun and Panasonic--Braun was better on the neck area, while Panasonic gave an overall better and faster shave with most areas requiring no more than 2-3 smooth, straight-line passes.  Both caused minimal irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Build quality/ergonomics:  The razor is very light and very quiet.  But this is not by design, it&#x27;s just very low-power razor.  It has a slow, even at the highest setting, motor encased in plastic.  The feel is that all there is to this razor is a RC-car toy type of motor that spins at no more than ~300 rpm and a lithium-ion battery.  By comparison Braun Series 7 has a linear motor that moves shaving blades side-to-side at 10,000 times per minute and Panasonic moves these at 14,000 times per minute.  As mentioned earlier the rotary shaving blades aregood and are not gimmicky--they really pull up the hair for closer shave, unlike Braun&#x27;s claims of some &amp;#34;sonic vibrations&amp;#34; that supposedly lift the hair.  By comparison Braun was the best designed, most ergonomic, and felt more quality.  Panasonic shaved very well, but the build quality felt cheap and the LCD display was not as informative as Braun&#x27;s.  It was also much heavier than the other two.  The Norelco also doesn&#x27;t have a built in trimmer like the other shavers--you have to pop off the shaving head and pop on the trimmer.  With Braun and Panasonic, it&#x27;s a simple push of the button.  Also Norelco&#x27;s trimmer is much bigger than the other two razors, which makes it more difficult to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning system:  Norelco&#x27;s cleaning system is junk.  It does clean, but operation is awkward, takes over four hours overall, and you can&#x27;t just place the razor into the cleaning system--you have to clamp it on top.  Both Braun and Panasonic are much faster -- to clean/charge you simply drop the shaver into the system and press a button.  Braun&#x27;s cleaning system is by far the best as the razor keeps time that you used it between cleanings and the overall cleaning time is adjusted accordingly.  It also has quick clean mode, and because the cleaning solution is 40% alcohol with some additives, it dries rather fast. Also it doesn&#x27;t have a filter built into the cleaning cartridge, which makes it possible to refill the cleaning solution instead of buying expensive cartridges--there are many recipes online, e.g. store brand vodka with a drop of lemon essence.  Panasonic&#x27;s cleaning station is not as advanced as Braun&#x27;s, but far better than Norelco&#x27;s.  It uses a detergent solution and the cartridges are cheapest of the three brands, but it also have a built-in filter, so they can&#x27;t be refilled manually once the filter is clogged.  The detergent solution is water-based and doesn&#x27;t dry as readily as Braun&#x27;s--it takes about an hour, but still beats Norelco&#x27;s four hours.As for Norelco&#x27;s cleaning cartridges, they are expensive, and are mix of detergent and alcohol-based cleaner with a built-in filter--guess Phillips engineers just quickly hacked it together from what they saw offered by Panasonic and Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this razor.  Panasonic and Braun shave almost as good and take far less time and less passes, thus lesser irritation, and their cleaning systems are way better.  If want better design/ergonomics, go with Braun, and if you want faster shave despite worse design/quality/ergonomics go with Panasonic Arc4 or Arc5</li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco razors for over 50 years, and each new one was better than the old one, until now. I had been using a Norelco 1250 and actually it wasn&#x27;t bad, but I looked forward to an improved one. The first 9300 had a defective washing device and the replacement was also defective, so Norelco sent a completely new razor and washing unit. Both the first razor and its replacement made loud screeching, metal against metal type sounds, as it passed from my cheek to my neck, so loud that my wife called from the other room and asked if I were OK. In addition, when I put it at the closest  shave setting, which I do need with a tough beard, it irritated my skin, which prior Norelcos never did. I thought perhaps the blades needed to be cleaned and I discovered that to take the blades out one needs to unscrew a small unmarked top piece with a plastic gadget that you will soon lose, and then wash the blades and somehow keep turning and turning the locking unit (remember its unmarked) until it finally clicks into place. Cleaning the blades on the 1250 meant unlocking a simple spring device and that was it.  Before I returned it I checked to see how dirty the blade mechanism was, even though it was cleaned daily with their automatic washing device; the washing device, as has been noted by others, didn&#x27;t work very well at all.&lt;br /&gt;So, it made a screeching sound as I shaved, it didn&#x27;t shave any closer than the 1250, it irritated my skin, the blades are quite difficult to clean and oh yes, the washer doesn&#x27;t work very well. My next razor was the Braun 799, and you can see my review there.</li>
            <li> Although I have two other electric shavers (Braun and Panasonic), reading the reviews tempted me to try this Norleco shaver because I have a lot of trouble getting a real close shave. I have been testing it for about 10 days. Philips Norelco claims that it takes 21 days to have the skin adapted to this new shaver. I know the 21 days are not over. However, I would like to make some preliminary comments, comparing this shaver to Braun&#x27;s Series 7 and Panasonic&#x27;s ES-LV61-A Arc5, which I also own. I have a tough beard that grows in all directions so, I guess my evaluation might not be valid for every one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO&#x27;S: The Philips Norelco S9311 is very light and produces very low noise while shaving. Battery lasts for about 5 10-minute shaves, which is the time it takes me to complete my shaving&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON&#x27;S: So far it ranks 3rd place against the other two shavers in terms of closeness of shaving. The Braun series 7 would be number one, and Panasonic would be number two. None of these give me a close enough shave, and I always have to &amp;#34;fine tune&amp;#34; my shaving with a Gillette razor. Otherwise, by late afternoon, my face will look as if I did not shave. So far, the Philips Norelco shaver does the worst job. It takes many passes (more than the other two shavers) and, when I finish shaving with it, I can still feel that hair was not completely removed. Unless this improves dramatically over the next 10 days (which I doubt), I might return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the shaving experience improves, I will edit my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE MAY 28TH.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this shaver now for over 21 days which is the time Norelco recommends for the user&#x27;s skin/beard to adapt to this shaver. My experience is that this is still a below-expectations shaver. As I said before, it probably is due to the type of beard I have (very tough), Those users that praise this shaver must have a very soft beard. I recently replaced the shaving head on my Braun Series 7 (after about two years of use), and the difference versus the Norelco Philips was dramatic. It takes me half the time to shave with the Braun shaver, and it is provides a much closer shave. thus, if you have a tough beard, don&#x27;t think twice, the Braun Series 7 is the right choice for you.Philips was dramatic.

            <li> Closest most comfortable shaver I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Open box item and it was a bargain it was 40-50% off. I was honestly bored of buying gillette razors as it was to expensive as i have to shave daily. At the end of the day I have owned an old phillips shaver that still works great and it was not maintained at all. So I invested in this shaver. I love the wet shave as it is not irritating to my skin. I love the cleaning mechanism as it is hassle free.</li>
            <li> Razor works great.  Charger/cleaner just takes up a lot of room on the counter.  Update Oct 2015.  After having the unit for several months I really like the razor.  The cleaning system is a disappointment.  It does take up a lot of room and it likes to turn on when ever it pleases.  I feel that good hot water works just as well as their cleaning system.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco three head electric shavers since I was in college. While the shave isn&#x27;t as close as a blade, the skin on my neck is very sensitive and I would get lots of razor bumps. I shave every 2-3 days, replace the blades once a year, and replace the shavers every 3-4 years. I was doing some research on updated Norelcos and read a lot of reviews that called this one of the best electric shavers out there. I can say with certainty that this is the best shave I have ever had with an electric. It shaves much closer than anything I had used before (previously owned one of the 4000 series 830 shavers) and after my shaves, I have much less irritation. The only downside to shaving is the sideburn trimmer is not integrated so it takes a few more seconds to finish your shave.  So, it is it worth more than the other shavers? Well, It has a great battery. The shave is incredibly close. I am sometimes lazy about cleaning, so I like the self cleaning feature, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s absolutely necessary. I don&#x27;t use the wet shave feature. Bottom line, I think it is worth it simply for how much easier it is on your skin.  Updated 10/3/2015 - Had a problem with the main housing. Philips customer support was very helpful and sent out a new one right away and included a return shipping label for the old one.</li>
            <li> I have used Norleco  razors for decades and this is simply a terrible razor.  I received it as a gift at Christmas and I just gave it to Goodwill.&lt;br /&gt;It takes at least 10 minutes to get an adequate shave and even then it is not a close shave, and you have to switch heads to use the sideburn trim function. The last month I have been using a blade razor to shave again after I have used the Norelco. The giant cleaning bucket system seems to be nothing more than an elaborate gimmick to require you to buy cleaning solution every month or two.  I am done with Norelcos and will now try some other brands. This is a  real waste of money.</li>
            <li> I only had a week and I use it every other day it seem to be giving me a close shave</li>
            <li> Outstanding, exceeded expectations</li>
            <li> Close as a blade?  Not even close.  I keep buying Norelco shavers every few years, keep hoping they will have improved enough to be clearly better than blade shaving, but it never quite happens.  Part of that is improvements in blade technology, but ultimately, I think there are just inherent limitations in what electric shavers can do.  Yes, way more convenient - I love sitting in my bed shaving, without the hassle of water, shave cream, etc.  But it takes at least 5 minutes, maybe longer, to get a shave that is decent.  Getting a close shave - not gonna happen.  The shaver has worked reasonably well over the last year, although one of the rotary blades has broken - it was time to replace the blades any way, so not a big deal.  I will probably go back to blade shaving for a while, it&#x27;s really a tossup.</li>
            <li> Closest shave yet with an electric.  I&#x27;ve had many Brauns, a Remington and my last was a Panasonic Wet/Dry.  None gave me the closeness this one does.  Using just medium pressure, the shave is close without irritation.  It hugs my face much better and is much quieter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin was the type that always got cuts using disposables so avoiding that morning ritual alone is worth the extra effort shaving with electrics require.</li>
            <li> shaver is perfect, but shop did not send hair trimmer</li>
            <li> Tore my face to shreds and could never get a completely smooth shave.  I replaced it with a cheap Braun WaterFlex (3 Series) and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> This shaver has the closest shave I have had with any Norelco Product, not only that it has my full support as a great product just because of the Company. I have had other brand electric razors and they don&#x27;t in my experience come close to what Philips Norelco Products do. Yes it does seem a bit expensive BUT I would buy it again in a heart beat as I love the Shaver and the Smart Jet Clean system.&lt;br /&gt;If I have a complaint it is only 1. The Trimmer that comes with it is a little clunky and does not work as well as the one from the older Norelco Razor that I replaced that Still works fine by the way so for me it is only a small issue.</li>
            <li> Very close shave,seems to be pretty durable so far,hope it last</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely the best electric shaver l have ever used. Of course, when I&#x27;m not shaving for more than 4-5 days after shaving with Norelco I have to use a blade razor, but on a day-to-day shaving - clearance of face is on a very high level.</li>
            <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned, awesome comfortable shave</li>
            <li> excellent shaver. the cleaning accessory doesn&#x27;t add much</li>
            <li> Great service, great product - very happy.</li>
            <li> Got this as a replacement update to an 8000 series model I&#x27;ve used for a few years. I really like all the improvements. Works great for me, and the new cleaning system is fantastic. The charging stand of the 8000 series was quite convenient for home use, but not so great for having to take it on the road, so like the option now with the charging cord and cleaning system.</li>
            <li> Great shaver,easy cleaning</li>
            <li> I like it very much. More than expected</li>
            <li> This is my 5th Norelco over about a 30 year span and by far the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had from any of them.  Use the 3rd speed setting and it gives a very smooth shave without any irritation.</li>
            <li> Did not give me a close shave.</li>
            <li> Always on the lookout for a better electric razor and after a couple weeks with this one, I can say it is definitely an improvement over their previous model. For me, it&#x27;s neck irritation that makes or breaks an electric razor and this one does not irritate.</li>
            <li> So far the shaver has performed excellently and has had an amazng battery life.  While it was purchaged for my 17 year old son, I occationally use it with excellent results.  Recommented.  Everyday cleaning is easy - I have not use the cleaning bath yet.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband&#x27;s birthday present! He really liked it!</li>
            <li> It works well, gets the job done.  I switched from a foil shaver to this.  It does take a few weeks for your skin to acclimate to the new shaver.  It feels like it gives a better shave on the neck than my foil shaver.  I like that it has 3 modes of intensity to use.  I do need to use pre-shave lubrication as it is a rougher slide against the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:  After 2 years, the SmartClean stand has stopped working properly.  It started making noises, and after a cleaning the razer head was so jammed I had to purchase a new one.  I am debating if getting the SmartClean stand replaced is worth it at this point.</li>
            <li> Theres a p[roblem with the cleaning unit.</li>
            <li> Works as good or better than described.</li>
            <li> Fast and as promised.</li>
            <li> Really Nice razor...always a well thought out offering at this level from Philips. Very good quality.</li>
            <li> The items was good no problem at all and it was well packed.</li>
            <li> Nice razor - easy to use, easy to clean.  Shaves and trims really close, even though it doesn&#x27;t sound powerful.  Only have had a month, but hoping with cleaning it will last awhile.  Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> Great for multi-day growths.  Far surpasses the prior generation (which I also owned).  Faster and smoother, less irritating.  Follows facial contours fabulously.  I like the cleaning system a lot.  I tended to get a moldy smell after many uses in my prior Norelco.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement of a 12 year old Norelco regular style which had worn parts and a 12 year old pattery. The new style works as well as the old one, but I think it&#x27;s more of a styling innovation than a new way of shaving. The more expensive Norelco&#x27;s seem to prove themselves worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T Shave very close i have another model and i though this more expensive model would do a better job but i was wrong don&#x27;t recommend it at all if you wan&#x27;t a close shave.</li>
            <li> Shaves very close and is quiet operating  but has a major design fault (at least for me).  The on/off switch is located where my thumb would normally rest and thus I end up turning off the razor during a shave or I have to hold the razor in a manner that does not feel natural to me.</li>
            <li> Best shaver I have ever used and the self-cleaning stand works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Amazing shave.  I have been using a previous version for 4 years and when it was time to change there was no other brand that I saw.  This one us even better than the previous.  Both the blades as well as the shaver itself.  The shaver is very quiet. There is no irritation after a close shave.</li>
            <li> I really like and prefer Norelco Shavers, generally, and have used them for many years. I do not like this one for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-It does not shave close.&lt;br /&gt;-I have to re-shave everywhere with a Norelco Arcitec, which I love. So I must shave twice, which is a pain.&lt;br /&gt;-It is recommended to rinse it under hot running water after each shave. I recharge it and run it through the cleaner about once a week.&lt;br /&gt;-It does a lousy job around the nose and lip (vermilion boarder), and neck. I constantly play with these areas, which bothers my wife, until I shave again (usually over the weekend). Though it is cleaned regularly it shaves no better plus I use Norelco spray on it regularly.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-It looks very nice in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;-it has a nice and convenient cleaning system.&lt;br /&gt;I am white and have full growth but it is fine and straight, not heavy and thick or curly.&lt;br /&gt;I did not like the XL model either. I use this shaver to take down what I grew overnight and finish with a Norelco Arcitec 3-D model.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this expensive model. I use it right and have lots of experience with Norelco rotary shavers. This has a separate piece for trimming sideburns. You must remove the shaver and snap-on the trimmer. It is easy but inconvenient. I prefer the XL pop-out trimmer to trim down my sideburns and reduce chest hair. I bought this through Costco so got extras but it does not do what it is supposed to- SHAVE.&lt;br /&gt; I do not recommend this shaver, I would not buy again, and I hope this helps someone.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> Great shave! Easily better than its Braun equivalent. Good for curly or irregular hair growth patterns. Quiet cleaning device. Only draw back is you have to switch out the trimmer head for your sideburns.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver from Costco after accidentally dropping my 7100XL and breaking it.  I&#x27;ve been using Philips shavers for 30 years, since I was 18 and have always had good experience.  The 9300 is a good shaver, but not as good as the previous ones.  The friction between the skin and the  3 shaving heads is too much.  It is nice that you can shave wet or dry and when shaving wet, you can use shaving cream, but the whole idea behind using an electric shaver is to use it dry and shave quickly.  I could do it with the 7100XL and all the previous models I owned over the years; not with this - you need to reduce the friction by using shaving cream or something like lectric shave lotion.  I will keep this but will also get a $59 model 450 that uses the same blades as the 7100XL.</li>
            <li> The razor I had before this one was much better. I still can&#x27;t get a smooth/clean shave after almost 3 months even when using shaving cream. I wish I had the one before this one back. If you want to use the trimmer you have to remove the shave head and replace it with trimmer head...what a great idea that Philips Norelco genious had. I can shave faster and cleaner with a Gillette.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic shaver. I tried the Braun Series 7 before this. The Braun can&#x27;t get nearly as close a shave as this shaver (especially in the neck area). This shaver irritates a bit in the beginning, but once you figure out how to use it it&#x27;s fantastic. Also, the blades are also self-sharpening (unlike the Braun shavers).</li>
            <li> Razor is good but the cleaner that comes with it isn&#x27;t worth a flip. I just clean it daily with an old tooth brush and run water through it once a week.</li>
            <li> I did not buy this from Amazon. With that out of the way, I bought this shavers for my partially paralyzed husband in order for him to keep some independence and give me a break from constant cleaning.  The cleaner worked fine for about 6 months and then it stopped cleaning altogether, only I never realized it. My husband was always complaining that it wouldn&#x27;t give him a clean shave. I took it apart and it was clogged with whiskers. It turns out that now I have to clean it daily and it is extremely difficult. My husband has always said Norelco was trash and I now believe him.</li>
            <li> Love this Norelco shaver.  Have always used Norelco in the past and they just keep getting better and better.  The quality is far superior to other shavers.</li>
            <li> I love it, best shaver I ever owned. Gives a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> Shopped around for best price.&lt;br /&gt;Delivered as stated&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with prduct.</li>
            <li> Very good and works well.</li>
            <li> I am 62 years old and have finally found an electric shaver that is good enough. I have had Braun, Panasonic, Remington and Norelco shavers in the past but the 9000 series is great. I have no way to rate the shavers long term reliability, but my last Norelco shaver lasted five years and died the morning that my new 9000 was delivered. How perfect was that?</li>
            <li> The save on the chin and face was close and easy but that was the only good thing about it.&lt;br /&gt;The shave in the neck area was terrible. I tried both wet and dry. Did exactly what it said in instruction and even video tutorials online. It left an a acceptable amount of hairs in the neck area even after multiple passes of both dry followed by wet shaving. I took 3-4 times the normal shaving time and still i needed to use a Gillette razor on the neck.</li>
            <li> Best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Not sure how necessary the cleaner gadget is, but the shaver itself is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Shaves great but the on off button in the wrong place.usually turn it off 2 to 3 times while shaving.</li>
            <li> I was in the market for a new electric razor after the battery in my old Braun 390cc (series 3) quit working and efforts to replace that battery failed. I decided to give Philips a try since I got a great deal on it and my dad was satisfied with his Norelco. I had my options narrowed down to the Norelco 9300 and the Braun 790cc (series 7). My experience is as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Build quality&lt;br /&gt;Definitely inferior to my cheaper and older Braun 390cc. The Braun had rock solid build quality and survived a few drops with no damage at all. This Philips razor feels cheap and plastic like. It is much lighter, which is both a pro and a con. Pro because it&#x27;s easier to hold up to your face, con because this 100% plastic razor would probably shatter if you dropped it once. The cleaning station is constructed out of that nasty piano black plastic that scratches and smudges super easily. Would much prefer the flat matte black on my old Braun&#x27;s cleaning station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave quality&lt;br /&gt;I only gave this razor a couple days and during that time I did get some nice shaves out of it. Both manufacturers say you need to give the shaver 21 days of exclusive use to allow your beard to adjust. I&#x27;ll give the Norelco credit here that it provided a very close shave and the head design was much better than my old Series 3, which only pivoted one way. The Norelco head fits and follows the contours of your face nicely. At some points during the shaves I noticed the blades starting to get a bit too close to my skin. Probably a novice mistake but this never happened with my foil razor. If you have very sensitive skin, I would probably stick to a foil razor. The Philips produces a quiet &amp;#34;whirling&amp;#34; sound in operation, which is a welcome improvement over the loud buzz emitted by Braun&#x27;s foil razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning station&lt;br /&gt;I must be spoiled by Braun&#x27;s cleaning station... The Norelco&#x27;s cleaning station is absolutely terrible. Rubbish. My primary reason for returning this razor was the cleaning station. First off, the way you have to clamp it into the station is clunky because usually the razor power connection doesn&#x27;t line up with the plug on the station. When you press down on the clamp the razor will force itself into position. It just lacks polish and my cheap/old Braun Series 3 had a very similar setup yet you didn&#x27;t have to force the clamp down and cause the razor to shift into position. The shaver body would perfectly align with the power connector once placed into the holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning cycles... Mine decided to endlessly run the cleaning cycles no matter what you did. It would run for 24 hours on the same cleaning cycle if you let it, constantly filling and draining and filling and draining the bowl below the razor head. It would never get to the drying stage of the cleaning cycle. At one point the electric pump just pumped all the cleaning fluid out of the container- brilliant!! Based on other reviews here, this doesn&#x27;t seem to be an isolated problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to return the razor for a Braun Series 7. I really wanted to like the Norelco but the build quality and quality control issues really turned me off on this product, especially considering it&#x27;s at the top-end of the market. Since so many others are reporting issues with the cleaning station, I don&#x27;t think mine was necessarily a lemon.</li>
            <li> nice but still feel a little cheap with it&#x27;s light weight and the rough case especially. But basically the shaver works much better than the former generation and entry-level machines. And it&#x27;s pretty quite when running.</li>
            <li> Amazing shaver. Been a philipshaver user for last 15 years, and this one&#x27;s as good as a shaver should be. Very simply a faster and cleaner shaver; wet or dry.</li>
            <li> best yet used norelco shavers since 1960 and this is the best yet not to sure about the clean tank but so far so good some people don&#x27;t like change</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with Norelco razors for over 40 years, and this razor is the most expensive and most poorly designed razor I have ever used. The shaving head is difficult to put on, yet one has to remove it and replace it with the separate grooming head whenever you need a trim. The cleaning system is bulky and poorly designed. Even after owning the razor for two months, it takes minutes of fumbling to finally get the cleaning system to accept the razor. Norelco recommends that you clean the shaver every day, but I find this impossible. When you travel, you cannot take the cleaning system with you. Take my advice and buy another electric razor.</li>
            <li> This is a total piece of crap...I have the Norelco series 8000 but the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; replacement heads are just too expensive. So I bought this unit. The heads are plastic, while the unit has three speeds I have found if I use it on the slow speed it pulls my hair and hurts like hell. This is a very, very low quality product. I have found that the razor heads for the 8000 fit on the 9000. I won&#x27;t be purchasing another Norelco product....the unit is cheap, plastic flimsy and does a poor job of shaving my head and face. I replaced the head of the 9000 unit with the head of the 8000 unit (and yes the cleaning unit works with the 8000 head) I already invested in cleaning cartridges but once they are used up I will go back to Braun and donate this shaver. It is really, really bad and sad...don&#x27;t get burned like I did buy a better brand like Braun or Remington. Phillips really made a cheap product here and I have used Norelco razors for over two decades. This thing is just so bad I can&#x27;t even put into words how bad this product really is!</li>
            <li> Great shaver, easy to operate and a very close shave. Cleaning is easy</li>
            <li> I was really excited when I got this razor.  The. Cleaning system sounded awesome...but turns out that was the only thing that I like about it.  Razor is not worth what it cost. At this price I expect a good clean comfortable shave and that is not what I got!  I returned the razor after the second use.  The only thing I can give a 5 star to is Amazons easy hassle free return policy.</li>
            <li> very unhappy - i have been using norelco savers for years. very unhappy with this one.&lt;br /&gt;feels like the shaver is pulling the whiskers instead of cutting them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tom davis</li>
            <li> I have to say that I was excited to use this as I was many reviews says its good for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My current status:&lt;br /&gt;I have a very rich beard hair and sensitive skin, I regularly use Gillet type razors (power type 5 blades) with sensitive skin type shaver cream to shave with no issue. ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My History with electric shavers&lt;br /&gt;I use to have Philips shaver 10 years ago and was using it for some time when I had very thin hair. However, it started to itch and cause pain in time where I had to switch to Brawn type shavers that also didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience with 9300:&lt;br /&gt;I tried with dry shave first two times, it took me at least twice or more amount time to shave and it was not clean shave. I disraged the pain at first as the instruction mentioned that I need 3-weeks to get to use to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried then with wet shave with water only, then with shaving Gel ,,, This was a painful experience! I had gone through all the tutorial vidoes to get this machine to work on my skin without any pain or skin rush but I couldn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Sum, I used it 4 times for dry, 4 times for wet shave ... I could not bear the pain or waste the time to have a clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice is its not for thick hair and sensitive skin people.</li>
            <li> My five-star rating is tentative and will be adjusted if need be after my updates. Let me begin by saying that I have used electric shavers for close to 50 years so I know a thing or two about them. Over the years I have always come back to Philips and to Braun even though I have also used Remingtons and Panasonics. I currently have a Panasonic ES-LA63-S (which I love as far as foil shavers go) and a Braun 790 cc (which I also love given its smaller head and superb cleaning module). My Philips stable include my newly purchased Norelco 9400 (Costco branded but essentially an S9311) and an AT895 with HQ8 heads. You might ask: why all the shavers and why both types (foil and rotary)? I call is - ESAS (electric shaver acquisition syndrome)! LOL I can&#x27;t help my weakness for electric shavers so I indulge myself. I hesitate to tell you what I have given away in the past few years as I indulged my ESAS but enough said; let&#x27;s get on with the review. I&#x27;m not going to address the age-old dispute between foil versus rotary shavers. Each side has its proponents and they will staunchly defend their position. As I said, I use both so I&#x27;m well aware of their strengths and weaknesses. What I&#x27;m trying to say is - I will not be making comparisons between this shaver and any foil shave in my stable. I will, however, have something to say about how its shave holds up against other rotaries I have had (Sensotouch 1280) and currently possess (AT895).  Shaver: the shaver is light, easy to hold (in spite of its lack of the curvature of older Norelcos) and supremely quiet. The soft whir of its cutters compared to other shavers is distinctly noticeable and a pleasure to use. Who wants to be assaulted by some harsh buzzing in one&#x27;s ears early in the morning? Some view this as underpowered but in fact it has plenty of power to mow down a three day growth (I would not go past this without using a beard trimmer). The display, in terms of the battery&#x27;s charge, is sufficient for my needs. I do notneed a digital readout as I had with my 1280. The truth is, I never really looked at the 1280&#x27;s numeric display since I always put it back into its cleaning module following each shave. Having spoken a number of times with Philips technical support I was assured that lithium-ion batteries do not need to be partially or fully depleted and in the same vein, will not over-charge. Besides, I  have no intentions of keeping any shaver beyond three years before I purchase a newer model. I&#x27;ve said all this to explain why I did not opt for the more expensive S9711 whose only advantage beyond this digital display was the cleaning module readout which again made no sense to me. I&#x27;m not about to check in on the progress of the drying of my shaver. When I&#x27;m done shaving the shaver is placed in the cleaning module and I&#x27;ve left for the day. Therefore the additional display information the 9711 provides is essentially useless to me. Beyond these two things, there is no difference between the two shavers except for $100. I&#x27;ll keep that money for myself, thanks.  Cleaning module: The cleaning module is NOT overly large as some have suggested. It&#x27;s slightly larger than either the older Sensotouch module or the Braun model but in truth, it&#x27;s not nearly what some reviewers have made it out to be. Besides, I have my own bathroom and there is plenty of room on my counter, I like the look of the cleaning module AND it protects the shavers heads since there is no protective cap provided. The cleaning module takes 20 minutes to flush the heads and cutters with its scented cleaning fluid (and no... it is NOT overly scented as some have complained and it disappears by the time you&#x27;re ready to use the shaver) and 4 hours to dry. The entire process is quiet and very slick. I like it. Some have complained that the shaver being placed in backwards prevents the user from seeing its display but who cares? I&#x27;m not around during the process and all I need to know is shown on the cleaning module (on/off, cleaning, drying, charging indicators). I find the complaints lodged against the cleaning module to be largely without merit. Now... should it mal-function that would be a different story. I&#x27;ll update you on that eventuality.  The shave: I do not consider speed to be of the essence in determining whether or not a shaver is to be valued. I genuinely enjoy shaving (hey... it&#x27;s my celebrating of being male for crying out loud) so I don&#x27;t mind spending 8 to 10 minutes each morning. We&#x27;re given one face in this life and we either take care of it or we damage it. I&#x27;m not about to rush through the shaving process to save a few precious minutes (get up earlier if time is of the essence) and when the shave is done I&#x27;m going to use an aftershave balm with natural ingredients to replenish the moisture in my skin. You do know that your skin is an organ, right. So... take care of it. Start with the neck while the heads/cutters are cool and shave in small circular motions against the growth. Do not apply too much pressure since that will lead to irritation and defeat the lift and cut design of the heads. Follow the neck with the chin and upper lip. Treat this area as though it were a cheek and make your circular strokes over the entire area. If need be, I will use straight strokes horizontally and vertically on the upper lip (and jawline) even though this is not the recommended Philips&#x27; method. It works for me and that&#x27;s all that matters. Lastly shave the cheeks and sideburns. With this shaver, I find that ALL the stray hairs on the neck are caught IF (big IF here so read carefully) I take the time and make several passes (particularly with the straight motions I mentioned).  Philips recommends 3 weeks in order to allow your facial hair to adjust. Is this scientific? I don&#x27;t know and I don&#x27;t care. My attitude is that it seems to work so perhaps they actually know a thing or two about shaving and it&#x27;s not all marketing hype. What is supremely important in this time trial is that you not &amp;#34;clean up&amp;#34; with a blade or mix and match with a foil shaver. Tough it out. Go solely with the Norelco even if your initial shaves are not quite up to snuff. You&#x27;ll discover that with patience and a calm demeanor (don&#x27;t panic whatever you do), your shaves will improve. Let me add that I find no reason to put down the newer RQ12+ heads. They are excellent heads and I have not seen any reason to downgrade them over the older RQ12 Sensotouch heads. They move in 8 directions and you will feel this as your shaver glides over the contours of your face.  I&#x27;m going to update this review over the next three weeks. I will give you an honest and thorough review of my new shaver. If it turns out that there are problems, I will be forthright in exposing them. Stick with me.  Update One: In order to facilitate shaver glide across my skin, I have found that a good pre-shave such as the Aramis Lab Series for Men Electric Shave Solution available here on Amazon is ideal. The shave itself is excellent and lasts until mid-evening. What is particularly noticeable is the fact that flat-lying hairs on my neck are easily caught by the Norelco, not something easily accomplished with a foil shaver. There is no irritation whatsoever even when the shaving process itself lasts between 8 and 10 minutes. I have been rinsing the heads under the tap, shaking off the excess water and placing the shaver in the cleaning module every day. To ensure that no over-charging occurs, I purchased the Belkin Energy Saving Socket (F7C009) which allows me to set the &amp;#34;timer&amp;#34; on the socket for 6 hours after which it cuts off power to the cleaning module. It&#x27;s the perfect solution.  Is the shaver &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34;? I would say it&#x27;s very close to perfection and I can only imagine that over time this shaver will achieve it. I absolutely love the Norelco and highly recommend it.  Second Update: It&#x27;s been a few weeks now and I&#x27;m pleased to report that the shaves have improved minimally. Overall I&#x27;ve been reasonably pleased with the shaver and its cleaning module.  Final Update: After about five weeks I must conclude that the Norelco S9300 series shaver is a very good shaver, albeit not perfect. Areas that have cropped up as difficult to shave (i.e. upper lip, chin, jawline) require considerable attention and time. To get a &amp;#34;clean, smooth&amp;#34; shave you&#x27;re going to need to devote about ten minutes to the shaving process. This morning I pulled out my older Norelco AT895 and was able to duplicate the shave of the 9311 at about half the cost. The older Norelco doesn&#x27;t look as sleek or sharp but it does the job just as well as the newer design. I&#x27;m sorry to have to go back on my original report but for the sake of honesty and accuracy this must be my final assessment.ying hairs on my neck are easily caught by the Norelco, not something easily accomplished with a foil shaver. There is no irritation whatsoever, the shaves last between 8 and 10 minutes and I have been following them with a skin moisturizer (i.e. I use one by Pacific Shaving Company since their products use natural, organic ingredients). I have been cleaning the heads under the tap every other day as advised. The head is easy to remove and a quick rinse on the head and the top of the headless shaver, is easily accomplished. Both are left to dry on the bathroom counter and ready for use the following morning.   Is the shaver &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34;? It&#x27;s very close to being perfect and that is after 5 days of shaving. I can only imagine that in another week&#x27;s time this will become my one and only shaver, it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric razor for over 40 years.  You finally got it right.  I get the closest, best shave in years.  Please Please don&#x27;t lose this design technology.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver (got this at Costco - 9400 series) and so far works very well for my face. The new shaving heads definitely work better than my older SpeedXL model. I&#x27;ve taken out 1 star as I still have to use my manual blade on one particular area. It is a tad bit nosier than my SpeedXL, the speed settings are mostly a gimmick (not sure why anyone would need slower settings).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smartclean system works pretty neat, when I look at the cartridge I can see small hair particles &amp;#34;trapped&amp;#34; at the bottom. This is inspite of me diligently cleaning the head under running water after each shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been about a month since I got it and so far happy with it. If you can get it on sale, definitely worth the investment</li>
            <li> I got this razor as a gift to replace my aging 3100 series Norelco (a $40 razor).  Expecting great things, I was excited to try the new shave.  It promptly disappointed when I found uncut stubble all over my face.  The instructions explained that there is a three week adjustment period before your skin allows for a close shave.  After six months though, my face evidently still hasn&#x27;t adjusted because there is still stubble.  The shave is exactly the same as my old razor.&lt;br /&gt;After the shave, I wanted to trim the burns...where&#x27;s the trimmer?  Oh, the instructions say I have to pull off the shaver and install a trimmer...how convenient.  I guess Norelco figures this configuration is better than the flip up design of my 3100?  I can tell you from experience that it is not.  The net result is sideburns are trimmed less often now, leaving me with a less tidy appearance.&lt;br /&gt;After the new shave experience, a flashing icon prompts to wash out the shaver.  This requires popping off the cutters and rinse and tap.  That&#x27;s fine if you aren&#x27;t running late in effort to get to work on time.  It&#x27;s also fine if you are not in a historic drought and can spare the water.  This procedure must be done after EACH shave.  My 3100 required cleaning after about ten shaves.&lt;br /&gt;Once the shaver is rinsed then I pop it into the hygiene console which, with the aid of electricity, irrigates  the cutters with a fresh smelling liquid then dries it with a fan.  There is sound associated with this procedure that goes on for hours.  The instructions say this is necessary for optimum hygiene, but does not sterilize the shaver. What?  I&#x27;m not sure why this step is necessary, except for making the cutter heads smell fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I have found through my six month trial, that the 9300 is less convenient, more time consuming, more energy and water consuming, and the same shave closeness as my old 3100 that cost $160 less.</li>
            <li> The first one I received didn&#x27;t cut very close, but I thought it was just breaking in.  Then after 2 weeks the display quit working, so I sent it back for a replacement.  Now I have the new one, and it basically shaves me to a &amp;#34;5-O&#x27;clock shadow&amp;#34;.  No many how many times I go over my face, I still have end of day stubble.  It has no closeness adjustment.  The adjustment it does have just gives you the option between &amp;#34;regular speed motor&amp;#34;, and slower.  I&#x27;m sending it back too.  I&#x27;ve had Norelcos for the last 20 years, and never had one that wouldn&#x27;t give me a close shave.</li>
            <li> I buy a new razor about every 10yrs and this is my 3rd electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outstanding smoothness and the flexibility of the heads is better than advertised- this thing easily gets to every part of your face. The speed settings are nice, but I don&#x27;t change them often and the battery meter is the best option- no more dead razor when I&#x27;m in a hurry!</li>
            <li> I have owned Norelco shavers for over 40 years and this one is the best one yet. The shave I get from it would be comparable to that of a good safety razor.</li>
            <li> good equipment for the price - good shaver in and of itself</li>
            <li> Does the job as expected. Clean easy shave. I did not try the wet shave get.</li>
            <li> It is OK. But I found that it is not enough powerful for me. I have strong thick hair and it takes long time to shave. I do not recommend this if you have strong and thick facial hair. Else after blade shave you can use this for a final touch. This would be ideal if you have soft and little facial hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awlful! I can&#x27;t find the charger from the package, everything&#x27;s in the package but charge.fortunately, I have a old Philips shaver, the old charger can work with 9300.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my workmate, she will love this!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item at a different store during a Fathers Day sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first started shaving I used blades, and then quickly moved over to electric shavers, trying out the newest models at the time (A Norelco Quadra Action, and what I believe was a Braun Flex Control), I quickly decided that even though a foil irritated my face more it gave a quicker and closer shave compared to a Norelco, and I stuck with Brauns since then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I&#x27;ve been unhappy with my Series 7, it constantly struggles to get sideways growing hairs near where my jawline begins and at least half of my shaving routine since 2012 has been dedicated to shaving them. I had become tired of this and as the foil wore out I went in search of a new shaver, The Braun series 9 was newly released and I thought of buying it since Brauns have served me well for the better part of two decades, but instead I decided to take a gamble and try a new rotary razor for the first time in nearly 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not disappointed. The 9000 is a quantum leap from the quadra action of days past, the familiar slots are still there (though now in a V shape), but now with a huge open chasm with a comb to capture very (and I mean very it chews through a 5 day beard like nothing) hairs. The simple inward flex has been replaced with two individual pivot points on each head (vertical and horizontal) as well as a 360 degree flexing shaver assembly. All this flexibility means that with a light touch it simply floats around my face removing whiskers with robot kisses. Giving me a shave closer than my Brauns but with zero (as in I don&#x27;t feel like I even shaved) irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to address a common misconception I hear hurled around about Norelco rotaries (They&#x27;re under powered!). A rotaries blades move in a constant circle, meaning that they constantly move in one direction, while a foils blades move back and forth, meaning they have to change direction. You need a lot less power tokeep moving an object in one constant direction then you need to keep an object moving while constantly changing direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An example: If I tell you to run in a straight line you can probably do this for quite some time, but If I tell you to run to a line, turn around, and run back to another line until exhaustion, you would probably tap out much earlier. Simply put, a rotary razor does not need as powerful of motor to keep it moving at an optimal speed.</li>
            <li> Cuts almost as smoothly as a blade; I think the lubricant from the cleaning solution must dry on the head and help the shaver slide across the skin.</li>
            <li> Best razor ever.  Leaves face very smooth</li>
            <li> Shaver has performed well for the first week of usage.  Have not used the cleaning device as of yet just clean with a brush and water at the moment.</li>
            <li> would be nice if it came with a power cord!!</li>
            <li> My grandson needed a razor so I gave him my 8000 series purchased from Amazon a couple of months ago, hands down the best electric I ever had. I thought I&#x27;ll move up a notch and got a 9311 from Walmart.&lt;br /&gt;Well, it is far noiser by comparison, the shave is not nearly as good and the entire device reeks of cheap poor construction. The heads a very poor construction and design and step backwards. Save your money their is something about this device. I can&#x27;t call it&#x27;s razor. My grandson loves his 8000.</li>
