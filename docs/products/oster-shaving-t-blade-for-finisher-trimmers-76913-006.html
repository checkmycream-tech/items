    <ol>
            <li>It was a perfect screw in, no itches.</li>
            <li>He really loved it!!</li>
            <li>Cryonyx via Amazon is an excellent source to individuals who need replacement blades from Oster, and you probably will not elsewhere beat Amazon&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li>This brand is the best in the business.</li>
            <li>but he&#x27;s still looking for the perfect one.</li>
            <li>these blades are perfect!!!!!</li>
            <li>Excellent quality blades</li>
            <li>Perfect!</li>
            <li>great product, Perfect!!!!</li>
            <li>Proud to say it, I am a Neanderthal, covered head to toe in body hair.  </li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>Great blades if you get them sharpened by an expert (</li>
            <li>This blade is great couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better the cut is great</li>
            <li>I have a T-Finisher trimmer that lost one of its &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; and this replacement T-blade fit it perfectly.</li>
            <li>I feel as though the quality of the blade isn&#x27;t too spectacular for this reason</li>
            <li>Great item i found it very useful.</li>
            <li>First off i would like so say how great of a blade this is...</li>
            <li>This shaving blade was outstanding</li>
            <li>and I would love manufacturers to look into reinforcing the &amp;#34;t&amp;#34; sections of the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If your a professional barber or cosmetologist and own the oster t finisher then this is the blade, its a good one.</li>
            <li>I got my oster fast feed to cut as close as this but cant trim as good as this trimmer.</li>
            <li>Primarily used on beard, neck, and around the ears.</li>
            <li>I really needed this and the price was substantially less than most beauty supply stores.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped quickly, great quality will buy again!</li>
            <li>Cut very well and does the edges very well and perfectly and although have only used them twice, they cut much better than the ones that came with the clippers.</li>
            <li>It did pull my beard, so I had to order the ones with the original gap.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve spent good money for a quality trimmer and the blade breaks, you want to be able to replace it.</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick.</li>
            <li>I love my new blade thought I would have to purchase a new set of clippers, but this did the trick thanks!</li>
            <li>He said that this takes his hair down to where it is a breeze to shave it because it is exceptionally close.</li>
            <li>First day edger&#x27;s dropped broke corner teeth, was glad to see I could order for only 18.00.</li>
            <li>He said it was better than the last blade we bought, it works for now</li>
            <li>The blade fit the old shaver that had a different model number and gives a smooth cut to the neck.  </li>
            <li>nice and tight...... thank you...</li>
            <li>I noticed the teeth are much finer</li>
            <li>Primarily use it to shave my back and it cuts close without nicking me.  </li>
            <li>It takes longer to shave facial hair and necklines because it does not cut as well as the original blade.  </li>
            <li>Always cuts clean crisp lines and last several years.</li>
            <li>I never used this blade as I use the narrow hair trimmer blade which is better suited to my needs.</li>
            <li>Took five minutes to swap in the new blade.</li>
            <li>Works like a brand new edger.</li>
            <li>Saved me from buying a new one.</li>
            <li>Did receive money back but really needed blade had to purchase whole new Oster edgers .</li>
            <li>Bought this to replace the old blade on my Oster, and this blade works like a champ.  </li>
            <li>but i advise extreme caution when using it because if it doesn&#x27;t last one small tumble,  you will have to replace this blade many times and will be a costly investment.</li>

            <li> but I&#x27;d rather buy a blade and have it be perfectly sharp out of the box..</li>

            <li> Bought blade from retail store spent 32.00. First day edger&#x27;s dropped broke corner teeth, was glad to see I could order for only 18.00. Blades came in a timely fashion , however, they had a tooth missing., had to send back. Did receive money back but really needed blade had to purchase whole new Oster edgers .</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve spent good money for a quality trimmer and the blade breaks, you want to be able to replace it. I have a T-Finisher trimmer that lost one of its &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; and this replacement T-blade fit it perfectly.</li>
            <li> Took five minutes to swap in the new blade. Works like a brand new edger. Saved me from buying a new one.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be sharper. It was a perfect screw in, no itches. However, I was hoping it would be sharper since it is a finisher.</li>
            <li> The Oster - Cryonyx Shaving T-Blade works well.  The blade fit the old shaver that had a different model number and gives a smooth cut to the neck.  Works well for women and men.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son who shaves his head. I was tired of seeing the nicks on his scalp all of the time. He said that this takes his hair down to where it is a breeze to shave it because it is exceptionally close. He really loved it!! NO MORE NICKS AT ALL!!    BTW, Grab it when you can - very hard to find in stock at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> great product, Perfect!!!!</li>
            <li> Extent, what I expected</li>
            <li> Underrated Big Time!!!</li>
            <li> Always cuts clean crisp lines and last several years.</li>
            <li> If your a professional barber or cosmetologist and own the oster t finisher then this is the blade, its a good one.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for the blade that came with the T-Finisher.  It takes longer to shave facial hair and necklines because it does not cut as well as the original blade.  I noticed the teeth are much finer so it does cut a little closer.  I&#x27;m not sure if it just needs a sharpening or what.</li>
            <li> I never used this blade as I use the narrow hair trimmer blade which is better suited to my needs. i gave it a 5 star rating as I have for all my other Oster products as its a quality product.</li>
            <li> Proud to say it, I am a Neanderthal, covered head to toe in body hair.  Bought this to replace the old blade on my Oster, and this blade works like a champ.  Primarily use it to shave my back and it cuts close without nicking me.  Recommend for all.</li>
            <li> This shaving blade was outstanding i needed this a long time ago......</li>
            <li> These blades cut extremely well.</li>
            <li> Cryonyx via Amazon is an excellent source to individuals who need replacement blades from Oster, and you probably will not elsewhere beat Amazon&#x27;s price. Delivery was quick. Well recommended. This brand is the best in the business. Accept no substitutes. Observe: The initials at the bottom of the image display of the blade probably make no difference. We are not sure what they mean.</li>
            <li> Not close enough for satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Previously purchased a \\&quot;Oster Whisper Quiet Finisher/Trimmer Blade Wide T\\&quot; which was absolutely useless on thicker hair.  The Oster- Cryonyx Shaving T-Blade has a bigger gap inbetween the trimming teeth which cut through thicker hair with ease.</li>
            <li> Mine was a bad one. Wouldn&#x27;t cut hair. Should&#x27;ve returned. I am a licensed hairdresser of 23 years and used that clipper for several. I got a bad one because this has never happened but it&#x27;s the negative to buying online.</li>
            <li> Bought this one to replace the one my friend broke. Works great. I got my oster fast feed to cut as close as this but cant trim as good as this trimmer. A little over price but you get what you pay for.(quality)</li>
            <li> I love my new blade thought I would have to purchase a new set of clippers, but this did the trick thanks!</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my husband. He said it was better than the last blade we bought, it works for now but he&#x27;s still looking for the perfect one.</li>
            <li> these blades are perfect!!!!! nice and tight...... thank you...</li>
            <li> Great blades if you get them sharpened by an expert (rust prevention coating makes these blades dull when you get them) don&#x27;t know about you but I&#x27;d rather buy a blade and have it be perfectly sharp out of the box..</li>
            <li> Excellent quality blades</li>
            <li> Perfect! Just what I needed.</li>
            <li> No significant difference from the stock blade.  Adjusted it to shave closer (Not recommended if you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing).  Primarily used on beard, neck, and around the ears.</li>
            <li> I hope I am not mixing this up, I believe this was the one with the narrower gaps. It did pull my beard, so I had to order the ones with the original gap. With thin hair it may work well.</li>
            <li> Great item i found it very useful. i would recommend it to anyone who needs a quality product to buy this.</li>
            <li> I really needed this and the price was substantially less than most beauty supply stores.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped quickly, great quality will buy again!</li>
            <li> First off i would like so say how great of a blade this is... I have never used a t-blade before for cleaning up my men&#x27;s cuts and I had no idea what I was missing out on.  It&#x27;s especially useful for cleaning around the ears in an efficient manner without having to worry about cutting a hole into the haircut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately though, I had my blade for four days and upon dropping it once the entire corner of my blade broke off deeming it unusable (for obvious safety reasons). I feel as though the quality of the blade isn&#x27;t too spectacular for this reason and I would love manufacturers to look into reinforcing the &amp;#34;t&amp;#34; sections of the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I still recommend this blade but i advise extreme caution when using it because if it doesn&#x27;t last one small tumble,  you will have to replace this blade many times and will be a costly investment.</li>
            <li> This blade is great couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better the cut is great they are durable and stay sharp for a long time</li>
            <li> Cut very well and does the edges very well and perfectly and although have only used them twice, they cut much better than the ones that came with the clippers.</li>
