            <li>It does feel nice on my face and is very economical.</li>
            <li>makes skin look smoother  feels good  very pure</li>
            <li>Very excited to see the changes in my skin as the months go on.  </li>

            <li>I love this makes my face look brighter and clean!</li>
            <li>Very light and easy to apply</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s a huge bottle, so I feel better about slathering more of it over my face :)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the line for about 4 months now, and it has done wonders for the fine lines and wrinkles, evened out my skin tone, and has given this maturing face a more youthful look that I haven&#x27;t had in many moons.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m unsure if you can put it around your eyes, which is where most of my fine lines are, so I won&#x27;t try until I can find out if it&#x27;s safe.  </li>
            <li>This was a very nice Vitamin C serum and absorbed quickly into my skin.  </li>
            <li>Great price for a product I won&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li>Nice on the face, quick absorb and not stings my skin.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, so easy to appy, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, can apply moisturizer or makeup immediately.</li>
            <li>Nice texture glides on nicely but don&#x27;t put to much</li>
            <li>The entire Poppy Austin line is the best skin care line available.  </li>
            <li>I dont have so many fine lines</li>
            <li>Love the huge bottle as I go through gallons of Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with the customer service and the delivery of my order on time as well as the purity and natural production process to produce this product.</li>
            <li>Love it not sticky n leaves my face feeling smooth..</li>
            <li>So far it has been great for my face</li>
            <li>The product so far has been great.</li>
            <li>The product came sooner than expected and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>My skin tone is much more even and smooth looking.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far it feels great on my face.</li>
            <li>But I will write that it goes on nicely, has no smell, and is easily absorbed into the skin.  </li>
            <li>It did not block my pores and was not greasy, it absorbed nicely into the skin and didn&#x27;t affect my makeup.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent a complimentary bottle, as I am a product reviewer, in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>Great product, large size &amp; quick shipping.  </li>
            <li>It applies very easily and dries really quickly, and it is not sticky at all.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this vitamin c serum and will probably try out some of the other items in the Poppy Austin beauty product line.</li>
            <li>Originally bought this for my mom to use but fell in love with it myself.</li>
            <li>I love trying new beauty products and I am always looking for the ONE that will make my skin nice and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily</li>
            <li>Easy apply on, feels like oil.</li>
            <li>Received this product 2 days ago and very quickly.</li>
            <li>It works and is easy to use</li>
            <li>I burn and tan easily and am prone to some freckling.</li>
            <li>So far so good, Ive tried so many products, I&#x27;m using all of your products, I just ordered the clay mask...</li>
            <li>Love the effect I see after I use it, specially for a guy&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>My skin does not only look healthier but it also has a beautiful  glow.</li>
            <li>i most certainly will buy this again!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 weeks and can see the difference it is making on my age spots and fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen a difference of fine lines on my face.</li>
            <li>This was my first experience with a Vitamin C serum, but I&#x27;m glad to report that I really enjoyed Poppy Austin&#x27;s serum.</li>
            <li>I quit ALL my face regiments to see it this truly worked, to my surprise it worked on my fine lines by my mouth and on my forehead.</li>
            <li>Hyaluronic Acid also prevent fine lines and wrinkles from forming and helps the skin by retaining moisture and creating a cushion to help plump them out as we age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pores and fine lines are diminished.</li>
            <li>Great product; does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>However, I have yet to see any improvement on my fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It has reduced my pore size, fine lines and has evened my skin tone all within a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>and I like it but no improvement in my fine lines.</li>
            <li>Once I love something, I am loyal to it....</li>
            <li>OK I received the serum quickly.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and safely</li>
            <li>Love how it absorbs quickly, and I already see improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>Nice large size, easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference the very first time I used this serum and would recommend to women of all ages!</li>
            <li>I have noticed a huge improvement in my skin, this is a staple now.</li>
            <li>I am a huge Poppy Austin fan now.</li>
            <li>On the fifth day, I started applying it in the morning and night a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>I saw a huge improvement in my marks in a bit over a week</li>
            <li>Did I mention this bottle is HUGE compared to others</li>
            <li>noticed a great improvement in  my complexion and facial wrinkles!!!</li>
            <li>Fabulous product.</li>
            <li>This product is scent free</li>

            <li>Goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t leave sticky feeling.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s fabulously organic.</li>
            <li>I have tried many things without success because of the sensitivity issue.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The eye creme is fantastic as is the vitamin c.</li>
            <li>I initially bought this for it&#x27;s great price</li>
            <li>love the fresh scent it has.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen great results in the last two weeks since I purchased this Vitamin C.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and soaks into the skin.</li>
            <li>And I am not saying that because they sent me a free bottle of Vitamin C.  </li>
            <li>Vitamin C can also help to prevent or treat hyperigmentation, defend against free radicals and brighten your skin.</li>
            <li>I am happy with this product and will definitely order again!</li>
            <li>Great Vitamin C to use daily</li>
            <li>Light as liquid and no smell.</li>
            <li>So light and absorbs immediately.  </li>
            <li>The surface of my skin has gotten so smooth and it just glows allowing me to go without foundation.  </li>
            <li>Poppy Austin is fabulous.</li>
            <li>Free radicals be gone.</li>
            <li>This followed up with my regular moisturizer was great.</li>
            <li>My make up looked fantastic over this combo</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Product feels light and my skin seems improved.</li>
            <li>The serum is smooth and has the consistency of water and almost no scent to it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 52 years old and have always taken good care of my skin.</li>
            <li>I loved how it made my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>The best skin lotion it is  possible to have, as well as being a real bargain.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a month and so far the results look good.</li>
            <li>far so good.</li>
            <li>Leaving it feeling vibrant with a healthy glow!</li>
            <li>And to make the glow even better,  please buy poppy Austin&#x27;s barbary fig oil and put it on right after you put the vitamin c.  </li>
            <li>I do have pretty good skin, and purchased this product for the large pores I&#x27;ve noticed I&#x27;m developing on my cheeks</li>
            <li>My face feels smooth and fresh!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m starting to see a good result as my face complexion is becoming brighter and clearer (from acne marks).  </li>
            <li>My new favorite.!</li>
            <li>and now I&#x27;m just about to purchase 2 more , for ME and MY husband:)&lt;br /&gt;Leave the skin tight, smooth and definitely a great anti aging serums.</li>
            <li>Am enjoying the serum very much.</li>
            <li>I found the Vitamin C Serum to be very gentle and my skin seemed to love it and would &#x60;drink&#x27; it in.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m at the stage where I&#x27;m willing to try almost any magic elixir in hopes of making a dent (or rather smoothing some dents) in my aging skin.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time using a vitamin c serum, and I love it.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, haven&#x27;t been using it long, but I can already see some improvement.  </li>
            <li>so far this is a very lovely vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li>First let me start by saying I LOVE anything that Poppy Austin makes.</li>
            <li>Originally I rated this product as 4 stars.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed one bit.</li>
            <li>It did significantly reduce my pore size to my delight.</li>
            <li>Overall im happy with this product and plus bonus is that its a double supply for the good price .</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li>I started using this right after I did a peel, and I can honestly say it&#x27;s really helped brighten and smooth my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin already seems to be feeling and looking better, only 2 days into using this Poppy Austin Vitamin C combined with their Rose Water.</li>
            <li>Smooth and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I just loved this non-scented, smooth, and instant treatment for my skin.</li>
            <li>It was easy to apply and absorbed into my skin right away!</li>
            <li>My skin has completely transformed for the better since using this!</li>
            <li>The shipment arrived on time and it is an awesome purchase for the price; twice as much product as other serums I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li>The Poppy Austin Vitamin C Serum is thicker than other serums I&#x27;ve tried and I am also impressed with how much the appearance of my scars have improved.</li>
            <li>Love the large size of this bottle.</li>
            <li>Also, I have not seen this large of a quantity, which makes it a better value.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Until next time... its beautiful to shop smart.</li>
            <li>I was super excited to try it out...</li>
            <li>I think my moisturizer is better absorbed with the Vitamin C used first.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend Vitimin C Serum to anyone who wants to look younger and have beautiful skin,</li>
            <li>Like the way it tighten the skin and overall feels good.  </li>
            <li>Web MD says that &amp;#34;some people apply hyaluronic acid to the skin for healing wounds, burns, skin ulcers, and as a moisturizer.&amp;#34; So maybe it really is the magic elixir found in the fountain of youth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also adds a cool freshness when i use it twice a day.</li>
            <li>yes its true...</li>
            <li>Light fresh nourishing.  </li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t really tell, but I like the feel of this (its refreshing)</li>
            <li>The best one I have found is SkinMedica vitamin C &amp; E complex.</li>
            <li>You can see my full review here:</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>Use Vitamin C serum after cleansing your skin with rose water toner, then apply argan oil or barbary fig oil as a natural moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Very liquidy, or more than I thought.</li>
            <li>Good product but the only results I noticed was that my skin was lightened.</li>
            <li>This came really quick, I live in New Zealand and was very surprised to see it arrive within two weeks, very happy.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised when it only took 2 day to get my package of Poppy Austin vitamin C, that started me off with a very good opinion of the company.</li>

            <li>Great value compared to other vit.</li>
            <li>I have purchased many items from Poppy Austin - all live up to expectations and then some!</li>
            <li>Wonderful Vitamin c serum - plays nicely with all my other skin care and my skin is definitely brighter and clearer - will absolutely repurchase this.</li>
            <li>Delivery was really quick</li>
            <li>, his skin looks more moisturized and perhaps in time his deep lines may begin to look better as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lovely oil doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and makes it look more translucent and younger.</li>
            <li>Shipped was unbelievably quick</li>
            <li>See brighter skin quickly with the use of this twice a day.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast, good packaging, Like it so far....</li>
            <li>Not greasy, and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>(I wonder if this would help with mild acne for teens?).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super grateful for this product.</li>
            <li>Penetrates quickly and makes a difference in the appearance of skin.</li>
            <li>Product was delivered promptly and questions answered quickly.</li>
            <li>highly recommend trying this lovely serum.</li>
            <li>I apply it on my clean face and my skin absorbs it right away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used lots of other &amp; this is by far the best!  </li>
            <li>This was my very first experience with a Vitamin C Serum</li>
            <li>Vitamin C Serum from Poppy Austin¬Æ with Hyaluronic Acid Serum is a pure quality Vitamin C Serum and can be easily found on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I received my order and I am enjoying using my new Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li>I am an esthetician and love to try new product lines to stay up to date and compare product</li>
            <li>bottle is double the normal size and is a great value.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super fun.</li>
            <li>I like the way it feels when applied ,no stickiness, and it is absorbed quickly into skin.</li>
            <li>Cannot say enough about this product, I love it!</li>
            <li>Thank you Poppy Austin for your user friendly website, follow up email and your cause supporting women in Morocco.</li>
            <li>and this had no ill effects on my skin at all!  </li>
            <li>Used this for the first time today and hoping it does the job!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel tight, greasy, or make me break out, which is great.</li>
            <li>When I touched my face after applying the Vitamin C Serum it felt very smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>Thank you Poppy Austin for a fine, reasonably priced product.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous product made of the finest quality, pure ingredients.  </li>
            <li>This may be better for younger women who want to prevent rather then correct fine lines.</li>
            <li>Only a little is needed for good coverage and it feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li>Next the product has been amazing.</li>
            <li>I have been applying it for a few months and my skin is looking great.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing on clean dry skin, then layer your moisturizer of choice over it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing the brown glass to help protect the oil inside from too much exposure to light.</li>
            <li>My skin is definitely more hydrated, and when I wake up in the morning it&#x27;s both soft and sort of &amp;#34;plumped&amp;#34; up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Buy this product, it is so economical.</li>
            <li>This is worth the buy.</li>
            <li>So far am really enjoying the experience, and look forward to improved results over time.</li>
            <li>Just initiated this in addition to Vit C , Rose Hips and finally completing the process to Fig oil.</li>
            <li>Rose water toner is next</li>
            <li>but 2 weeks is kind of short to see.  </li>
            <li>Easily absorbed serum that sits well under moisturizer or BB cream.</li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased so far with the results of this product and&lt;br /&gt;will</li>
            <li>love the fact that this Vitamin C Serum by Poppy Austin is made from naturally derived and organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>lightweight and instantly absorbed</li>
            <li>Ever wondered why babies and small children always look like they have beautiful supple plumpy skin?  </li>
            <li>Nice big bottle, took about a week to get here.</li>
            <li>Extremely pleased so far.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>I have the most sensitive skin and break out with 99% of products applied to my face.  </li>
            <li>I love this product so far.  </li>
            <li>So far I am  pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>Love how soft my face feels after applying this serum.</li>
            <li>So far it is ok</li>
            <li>truly feel that this is a quality skin care product that is worth the money.</li>
            <li>After absorption the skin feels soft and you can notice a brightness about the skin more so</li>
            <li>So far love the appearance of my skin</li>
            <li>Now THIS Vitamin C Serum doesn&#x27;t run off my face (like others I&#x27;ve tried) and you can just feel it being absorbed into your skin.</li>
            <li>spots!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li>No artificial fragrance--no scent at all.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>It has made my skin so soft, I love the scent!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using &amp;</li>
            <li>Received pretty quick and have been pleased so far with this product.</li>
            <li>Absorbed pretty quickly without any sticky residue.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased - my skin shows a clarity and vibrance I have not seen in a very long time.</li>
            <li>, Poppy Austin provides double the amount (compared to other brands) for a great price!</li>
            <li>where needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Poppy Austin Vitamin C Serum twice a day; in the morning after I get out of the shower, and at night after I wash my face right before going to bed.</li>
            <li>soaks right in your skin.</li>
            <li>The price is also right.</li>
            <li>(I use this serum right after I apply Paula&#x27;s choice 2% BHA, and this combination is a bomb)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I got compliments right away.</li>
            <li>I took a chance on a brand that I never had used or sampled based on several positive reviews, and I am glad that I did!</li>
            <li>However with all the advantages of vitamin C, the only draw back is that because it is an antioxidant, it oxidizes itself very quickly and once this happens, it is no longer good.</li>
            <li>I was impressed with how just a couple of small drops of the serum provided complete coverage on my face.</li>
            <li>Very gentle and fresh.</li>
            <li>The most noticeable results I&#x27;ve gotten so far is a clear smooth fresh looking face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fabulous and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This is a really high quality product with fantastic ingredients</li>
            <li>Very Large bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m interested in how it works fpr the long haul, but so far, it&#x27;s really a great product.  </li>
            <li>Waiting patiently on its full effect on my lines and wrinkles though I&#x27;ve noted they are much softer now.....</li>
            <li>I have been using many things on my face and on the first day of using this product , I can see a major difference  on my face .</li>
            <li>So far this is by far the best one yet and I intend to order other products.</li>
            <li>Im using it right now since Nov 2014 the first bottle and Im</li>

            <li>I will be happy to give you feed back as it has not had enough time for me to see a difference .</li>

            <li>no greasy feel, and is fine for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It leaves the skin so soft and together with the retinol serum, I have noticed the fine lines disappearing as well.</li>
            <li>It is too early to give an accurate assessment.</li>
            <li>in all I would definitely give this product a HUGE thumbs up!</li>
            <li>love  this serum..makes my pores look so tiny</li>
            <li>Wish I could use it on my whole body!  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many topical serums to help with wrinkles and complexion that didn&#x27;t help</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and is almost completely odor free,&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>Soaks in, leaving a smooth soft finish.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve watched their video on YouTube and am following instructions for greater results.</li>
            <li>I apply the serum first and then apply my moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>The first time I applied it (and consequently every time) there was a tightness</li>
            <li>My face is so smooth and clear .</li>
            <li>Its first two ingredients is herb; infusion and aloe.  </li>
            <li>All natural and sellers are fantastic</li>
            <li>Maybe when I&#x27;m 98, I&#x27;ll only look 97 :)</li>
            <li>I use twice a day and only top with moisture cream at night.</li>
            <li>First time using Poppy Austin</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes with a money back guarantee, so they&#x27;re confident in their product.</li>
            <li>I had heard about Vitamin C serum, did some research and found this one to be very affordable and it works!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if it was a matter of timing or just a matter of using it more, but I didn&#x27;t notice a big difference when I used it once at night for the first four nights.  </li>
            <li>This bottle is 2x bigger than most.</li>
            <li>It hydrated my face after my first use.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product, with only a week of use I can already see results.</li>
            <li>Ok back to the Vitamin C review</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another thing that I love about this product as stated earlier is that it contains jojoba oil.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this!</li>
            <li>I cannot tell any difference in my skin after using this whole bottle!  </li>
            <li>ON THE FIRST DAY.............</li>
            <li>Thanks !</li>
            <li>My skin is definitely looking smoother and more toned.</li>
            <li>You can feel a difference almost instantly when you apply the serum, sunspots are fading, skin is more radiant and plumped.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to others !!</li>
            <li>I will definitely recommend you to give it a try:)</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more skin products from Poppy Austin.</li>
            <li>I can see a big difference in terms of wrinkle reduction, smoother skin, lightening spots, etc., by using a more liberal application.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased with the first bottle that I just received my  second bottle -</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying the Poppy Austin Brand</li>
            <li>Something that is really important to me because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>already&lt;br /&gt;the color has improved the lines are diminishing the feel of the skin has improve and my hands are looking younger and more cared for every day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It was my first time ever trying a C serum</li>
            <li>His exact words were &amp;#34;No way&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li>- I saw results the first day using it.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for almost a week now - I rub it on my face, forehead and neck and since I have started doing this my skin has not only cleared up quite a bit but also FEELS better.</li>
            <li>but this was my first chance to try it, and</li>
            <li>top is a dropper top which always works well for dispensing a small amount onto your fingertips.</li>
            <li>I just finished my first bottle and purchased another bottle.</li>
            <li>;)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product and will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li>Hope it works ;)</li>
            <li>and recently I decided to switch over to this one because it was a better value for the price.  </li>
            <li>I must say, it really lives up to the hype!</li>
            <li>Definitely will improve your skin giving you a more youthful appearance.</li>
            <li>Just a few days into using, I&#x27;ve read good reviews</li>
            <li>Took a before photo of problem areas, just took a new one and am pleased with results so far.  </li>
            <li>The serum itself has made my skin noticeably more smooth and my pores less noticeable.</li>
            <li>Both came more quickly than expected</li>
            <li>Really diminishes the smaller wrinkles and leaves my skin very smooth.</li>
            <li>I have been blessed with pretty good skin and am only now starting to develop a few fine lines in my forehead and around my mouth  and have not been able to see a difference in them wile using this serum</li>
            <li>Probably the most effective thing I&#x27;ve ever used to remove dark marks from acne scarring along with daily use of sunscreen of course.</li>
            <li>have tried other Vitamin C Serums and have in fact made my own</li>
            <li>It has no scent, rich texture, absorbs immediately leaving skin soft with no residue or sticky feeling.</li>
            <li>It comes in a nice bottle and when I dropped it the other day it didn&#x27;t break</li>
            <li>I am 59 years old and have used Vitamin C Serum in the past and this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>Using this Vitamin C Serum daily has really helped my skin both look and feel better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big animal lover, I love them so much even when I see hurt, abandoned, and lost animals</li>
            <li>I love having an all natural antioxidant to apply directly to my skin.</li>
            <li>love the Poppy Austin Vitamin C Serum so much, that I had to order it a second time...</li>
            <li>my 79 year old skin is not tough looking as many others who live in FL.</li>
            <li>I have only been doing this for over two weeks, but can notably tell the difference in fine lines around eyes and mouth and overall, my skin is smoother and &amp;#34;clearer&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I love the packaging although it seems like a small bottle, a little bit goes a long way:) It&#x27;s great to use during a retinyl treatment, as it&#x27;s very pure and hydrates the skin without any irritation.</li>
            <li>I have been using Poppy Austins Argon oil for two years now, and have had nothing but positive results, with product and company.</li>
            <li>It had lots of positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what is going on with the positive reviews, but this didn&#x27;t work at all for me.</li>
            <li>I know I will have a positive result , for I have used vitamin C before , and am poking forward to the benefits of the Hyaluronic acid , have kept my skin doing well using the products I know work .</li>
            <li>but it has only been a few days, am very happy so far.</li>
            <li>Anyway, as long as it is able to make a difference on my aging face I will continue to use this product.  </li>
            <li>great price in comparison to other brands which advertise to do the same thing</li>
            <li>I loved that this product is not tested on animals, as animals are very close to my heart.&lt;br /&gt;There are several anti-aging benefits (wrinkle reduction, age spots, etc, ), but I have rather troublesome dark circles that I was excited to learn this serum could help.</li>
            <li>My skin began showing an amazing positive difference after the first few days.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you for such a wonderful product and look forward to ordering this and other products in the future.</li>
            <li>I have received compliments since I&#x27;ve been using it for less than a month about how nice my skin looks.</li>
            <li>Goes on nicely and is 1/3 the cost of the previous brand I was using.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly, not greasy and just makes skin nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m waiting to see results--not using it long enough to give a fair evaluation.</li>
            <li>I use Vitamin C Serum everyday with the Rhassoul Clay (1 to 2xtimes a week) and the combo has made a huge positive impact on my skin!!!</li>
            <li>Large 2oz bottle.  </li>
            <li>Large bottle.  </li>
            <li>It is a large sized bottle for what I paid for (~$35) and has 20% Vitamin C stated on the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Large amount for the money.</li>
            <li>Certainly look forward to added benefits from the serum.</li>
            <li>Smart idea.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see a difference, however, I know that Vitamin C is suppose to be good for the face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Poppy Austin is now my new and only favorite skincare.  </li>
            <li>Although I have oily skin, certain areas of my face are starting to show a bit of fine lines.</li>
            <li>Finally got now brand argan oil at the store and used that over the c serum and saw an immediate improvement in my fine lies around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this serum to anyone who wants to fight the aging process!</li>
            <li>but I feel as though I am a little more fresh faced.</li>
            <li>I have so much faith in the brand</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t test the product to see how much of it really is Vit C and hyaluronic acid, but what I can tell you is this;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is so much softer and smoother.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>It is NOT a miracle, but I really like what it is doing for my skin</li>
            <li>I received  it and  started using  it  straight  away .</li>
            <li>Absorbs fast and already seeing improvement on my acne marks, discoloration and scars.</li>
            <li>Highly, highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for a couple weeks, I don&#x27;t really see much difference.</li>
            <li>this product has really improved my skin tone</li>
            <li>You can purchase the Vitamin C Serum on Amazon or the Poppy Austin Website with Free Delivery and there also is a Money Back Guarantee.</li>
            <li>This product really works nicely, no redness (if you are sensitive to products like me), and I have reordered this, which says a lot in itself, thank you for a great product.</li>
            <li>I have been using this serum for about 3 weeks and really like it.</li>
            <li>The dropper is very effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was amazed at how much smoother, brighter, and firmer it became.</li>
            <li>They sell the real deal.</li>
            <li>While we all know that nothing you do (expect a face lift) will get rid of lines and wrinkles, however there are things we can use like hyaluronic acid that can really help tomask them.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>it is much thinner and much clearer</li>
            <li>However, after using a whole bottle; it did NOTHING for my skin.</li>
            <li>It took my skin about two weeks to really start to change.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I really like the way this feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>, I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference yet..</li>
            <li>It is much smoother and softer and feels fuller or thicker.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t ready to start.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>but it sinks into your skin better</li>
            <li>This is extremely gentle and works very well.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see much point in purchasing this again.</li>
            <li>I really like this Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li>I have used Obagi vit c &amp; did not like it because it leaves your face very sticky,</li>
            <li>highly recommend this Vitamin C Serum !</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really does what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li>I will see the result after I completed using a whole bottle.</li>
            <li>I really like this...</li>
            <li>The serum itself is a milky white smooth and silky liquid.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very high-quality product.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Poppy Austin</li>
            <li>so far i am pleased with the product, only time will tell.thank</li>
            <li>Although I have only used this product for a short time, I love that it feels so &#x27;right.&#x27;  </li>
            <li>use it every night right after cleansing and let it get absorbed for several minutes before I apply an oil/moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Poppy Austin Vitamin C serum is a staple in my skincare routine that I certainly won&#x27;t give up (even as someone who frequently changes products and wants to try out new things)!!!</li>
            <li>It is just plain NICE.  </li>
            <li>When I ran out of that brand, I decided to try the Poppy Austin serum due to the larger size &amp; the good reviews.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a serum that gets absorbed quickly without leaving your face dry.</li>
            <li>I had a healthy glow that other people started to compliment.</li>
            <li>I have used other Brands of Vitamin C Serum that I have had better results with, but I find the convenience of the 2 oz.</li>
            <li>I have used it for a week and see more improvement in my skin than with months of using other products.</li>
            <li>This product feels better on my skin than any other serum I have tried.</li>
            <li>My esthetician seemed to think my skin was looking better along with some other advice from her.</li>
            <li>Vit C and other skin brightening and whitening products makes your skin more prone to sun tan , so you should always use sun screen in your regimen</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly leaving a sightly tight feel.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love the glow this gives my skin though, so it is worth the small sacrifice.</li>
            <li>My skin looks smooth and bright with only a few drops used twice daily.</li>
            <li>It instantly gives your skin a drink of intense hydration while directly tackling those stubborn fine lines, age spots, and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>The serum smoothes on easy and sinks in fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, the seller for me here was the Vitamin C.  Vitamin C is an antioxidant that is used to protect and help the face from wrinkles, sun damage, signs of aging, dark spots and brighten your complexion amongst other great benefits.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it&#x27;s in a dark, glass bottle</li>
            <li>Will be buying more and other products from this company!</li>
            <li>Not sure, but it seems previous Vitamin C serums have been more effective.</li>
            <li>I have been buying another serum that costs more and half the size of this one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a light weight serum that actually works for dark spots and fine lines and I&#x27;ve finalIy found it with this serum.</li>
            <li>love how it makes my face and neck feel...seems to be less sagging.</li>
            <li>it came it, the dark glass bottle helps keep the product good for a long time.</li>
            <li>However as we get older we loss a lot of it and thus aging takes it toll.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more in the future.  </li>
            <li>Poppy&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t have that particular ingredient</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and works wonders, especially around my mouth and under my eyes.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and I like that fact that it only takes about 4-6 drops to cover my face, neck and chest area.  </li>
            <li>The effect of these particular products may produce quicker results, however these are also products that I can not use every day.</li>
            <li>I concentrate on the sides of my face in particular, where I have brown sun spots.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly reccommend this company.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend its use.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended to ppl to try</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and will be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>High quality product.</li>
            <li>I will purchase this again and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I am trying to fight my skin&#x27;s ageing as much as possible &amp; have started to try new products &amp; incorporate more into my somewhat simple skin care routine.  </li>
            <li>I first tried another C serum I purchased off amazon for a few months &amp; was overall happy with the results, but the constancy seemed a little watery &amp; the bottle ran out pretty fast since I like to use it on my face, neck &amp; chest.  </li>
            <li>Far better than any other Vitamin C serum I have tried.</li>
            <li>I particularly appreciate the simple label, it looks clean and professional.</li>
            <li>I need a little more time.</li>
            <li>but what about items that need a little more attention?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and hasn&#x27;t made me break out like other products I used.</li>
            <li>Needless to say I am so happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>, I was surprised how fast.</li>
            <li>The serum doesn‚Äôt really have fragrance and it does make your face soft.  </li>
            <li>For the past 5 years, I have been much better with avoiding sunburns or too much exposure to sunlight.</li>
            <li>It is quickly absorbed and totally non-greasy.</li>
            <li>normally don&#x27;t write review for products I purchase, but this one deserves it.</li>
            <li>I will give it a few more days.</li>
            <li>I use it at night mostly for overnight repair and hydration or before work where the air is harsh and recycled.</li>
            <li>the size is double from what i was using before and the price makes me smile.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hyaluronic Acid is found naturally in the human body and seen tremendously in babies.  </li>
            <li>It is a good value and seems to do the same as other similar products I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>have used other skin care products that were really good, yet harsh and very drying.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with my purchase, size is large will last at least 6 months.</li>
            <li>I used the Vitamin C Serum twice daily for two weeks and felt that it did actually help with fine lines and wrinkles, while firming and smoothing my skin.</li>
            <li>I was doing some research for a new serum and came upon this.  </li>
            <li>I can get congested pores from creams and serums so trying anything new is always an experiement.</li>
            <li>It is the type of product that I can&#x27;t live without, even for a night.</li>
            <li>however, I haven&#x27;t seen any new &amp;#34;surprises&amp;#34; since I started using this along with the Rosewater Toner.</li>
            <li>They are my new &amp;#34;holy grail&amp;#34; skin care products.  </li>
            <li>My new regiment - Poppy Austin Products.</li>
            <li>leaves skin feeling soft and firm and fabulous!</li>
            <li>While I could see a slight improvement after several months use, on a recent visit with my sister-in-law she raved about how good I looked.  </li>
            <li>I used a competitor for months but when the price went up, I was forced to find something more reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Their all natural products rejuvenate your skin naturally &amp; show visible results for an extremely reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>You only need a very little and it goes on my face easily and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>My face feels very soft after applying it.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this serum on my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive acne prone skin</li>
            <li>Skin feels very soft in the morning after using it the nite before</li>
            <li>This is the first serum I&#x27;ve tried that has actually made a difference.</li>
            <li>I am liking this product but not sure if I love it.</li>
            <li>First Vitamin C product I&#x27;ve tried, definitely improved skin texture.</li>
            <li>It normally starts off clear and then turns yellow.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I took pictures and looked exactly the same as before.</li>
            <li>after using it consistently you actually do have a noticeable difference in the texture of your skin.</li>
            <li>it just keep my face looking fresh all day long..</li>
            <li>As someone who has tried darn near every product - rest assured - you&#x27;ve fond what you need with Poppy Austin!</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and glowing!</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin that goes dry and breaks out.</li>
            <li>The Vitamin C Serum is a natural way to firm and smooth aged skin by stimulating collagen and neutralizing free radicals.</li>
            <li>The Vitamin C Serum is a natural way to firm and smooth aged skin by stimulating collagen and neutralizing free radicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well I have a new item to review and in order to fully engulf myself in this product I stopped using another all together in order to see this product solely in action.</li>
            <li>This serum leaves my skin soft and the fine lines on my face are less noticeable......</li>
            <li>the bottle is of a dark brown/amber color to help protect from sun light and damage the dropper is a clear glass dropper that works</li>
            <li>I could not really tell much of a difference by the end of my first bottle.</li>
            <li>I never felt greasy and if my skin started to feel a little dry, I simply applied a good moisturizing cream to alleviate the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it makes it feel tight and smooth .I</li>
            <li>Also I only want to put pure ingredients on my skin</li>
            <li>We both get many complaints about how our skin glow, looks much younger and tight .</li>
            <li>My large pores appear smaller too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using the product daily and will write a review of results after a little more time goes by.</li>
            <li>Great company, organic, cold pressed.</li>
            <li>I just received Poppy Austin Vitamin C Serum for Face and my serum is clear.</li>
            <li>The serum has started getting cloudy, whereas it was clear when I opened the bottle.</li>
            <li>Poppy Austin offers.</li>
            <li>I have mature combination/ leaning towards oily skin.</li>
            <li>old complexion.  </li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t bothered my sensitive skin either.</li>
            <li>and this company gives,you twice as much at the same price as other&lt;</li>
            <li>So far I have not seen any change in my skin, but I like the product.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive, so I was worried about a reaction, but I have had no adverse reactions to it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s  too early  </li>
            <li>so far</li>
            <li>Feels lovely and moisturising, have&#x27;nt used it long enough yet to tell if it does anything long term.</li>
            <li>Like it so far</li>
            <li>Although the formula is light enough to use on your entire face, I concentrate on the areas of my neck, upper lip and under eye</li>
            <li>It completely cleared my skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My face looks so refreshed and soft.</li>
            <li>I completely recommend it.</li>
            <li>Their products (vitamin C and Argan Oil) are all natural with nothing added or taken away.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a lady of mature age who still gets breakouts...</li>
            <li>Not harsh on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I haved never used this brand, so far I like the product.</li>
            <li>WOW.  </li>
            <li>Not for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and so far have not noticed any difference in my skin at all.</li>
            <li>Wow, I can already see a change as far to the brightness of my skin.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say definitively that it does what it claims, but I like the product so far.</li>
            <li>No problem so far .</li>
            <li>used this Vitamin C Serum from Poppy Austin¬Æ religiously day and night because it is so gentle.</li>
            <li>was surprised at my age.  </li>
            <li>I also have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The skin is glowing, soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and hydrated without a greasy feel.</li>
            <li>Make sure face is not warm when applying Vit. C serum)</li>
            <li>I do not know if vitamin C really helps skin stay younger looking</li>
            <li>honestly I don&#x27;t have one negative comment about the entire line of face care</li>
            <li>I have not had it long enough to see its full benefit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good Vitamin C serum for my face that wouldn&#x27;t be so expensive.</li>
            <li>The size of the bottle is larger than most other brands, making your purchase last longer.</li>
            <li>The Vitamin C Serum directly tackles fine lines and age spots and dark under eye circles providing instant hydration.</li>
            <li>First it doesn&#x27;t break you out or dry your skin.</li>
            <li>and so glad that I was sent such a big bottle so it will last for a long time!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It tackles those fine lines and age spots and dark under eye circles providing instant hydration.</li>
            <li>, I have normal skin with no blemish problems or wrinkles to speak of, but my husband  (patchy-dry skin, prone to breakouts) started using it everyday for his crows&#x27; feet and forehead lines, and he&#x27;s been blemish free since the third day</li>
            <li>you can see from the first picture above, this Vitamin C Serum is slightly different as far as its appearance.</li>
            <li>Have been using for awhile and am pleased with the subtle changes this serum makes on my face.  </li>
            <li>You should ALWAYS read the back of the packaging label and google what the main ingredients are before applying it on your face.  </li>
            <li>After using for just 2 weeks, most of the small bumps are gone and my skin felt tighter and younger.</li>
            <li>smaller and fine lines are less noticeable.</li>
            <li>particular product comes in a big brown glass bottle.</li>
            <li>; at the end of the day,&lt;br /&gt;5, I&#x27;m highly freckled, but my overall skintone is brighter and clearer, and I&#x27;ve stopped having to use foundation under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for this product</li>
            <li>This bottle is very large in comparison to the other ones I saw online when shopping.</li>
            <li>Its pH is basic and will dried my skin out over time until I began following with a more acidic toner.</li>
            <li>i have used lot of other vit c serums from popular brands, they all helped my skin and no more acne like before.</li>
            <li>Love the slightly thicker consistency than some other VitC serums, it doesnt run away through your fingers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thinner than most facial serum, makes it a bit hard when you drop it on finger&#x27;s tip before apply on your face.</li>
            <li>far as I can tell it is identical to the other brand that I used (quickly absorbed and unscented).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>my skin feels lovely and it&#x27;s all natural without the harsh chemicals, that other companies use.</li>
            <li>This is a huge value on price and the size of the vitamin c because you only need a few drops each time.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing these goods again, although very tempted to purchase the argan oil next time.</li>
            <li>I suffered from acne as a young adult and continue to be prone to occasional breakouts.  </li>
            <li>Because it is a wax ester it is hypothesized that jojoba oil is very comparable to human skin oil which manipulates the skin into thinking it has produced enough and balances out oil production.  </li>
            <li>I notice it is very slightly cloudy, not bad at all.</li>
            <li>When you get down to the bottom of the bottle, it will no longer pump the product up, so I take the top off and turn it upside down &amp; get it out that way</li>
            <li>Its a major component of skin tissue that give babies this effect.  </li>
            <li>Very good product and less expensive than others similar.  </li>
            <li>Everybody who is anybody from the Red Carpet, Dr. Oz, Oprah and Cinder Crawford&#x27;s secret ingredient in her creme de serum, if you&#x27;ve paid enough attention you&#x27;d know the key to shaving 10-15 even 20 years off your age is mixing 2 ingredients together, hyaluronic acid serum and vitamin c serum and the best thing, it dosent cost an arm and a leg, I&#x27;ve found the purest and cheapest on amazon.com mixed them together a little stronger and in 2 weeks time,</li>
            <li>I still have some &amp;#34;age spots&amp;#34; and little fine lines under my eyes (which I believe are simply genetic) but they have definitely improved.</li>
            <li>I only gave this a 3 however because my fine lines look no better</li>
            <li>This one is a very pale whitish color, whilst most other ones that I have tried have been a clear liquid.</li>
            <li>Skin in general holds about fifty percent of your body‚Äôs hyaluronic acid in it.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice any real differences to my skin.  </li>
            <li>All I can say is I literally look 10 years younger and this stuff completely resolved my forming frown lines, crows feet, neck lines, etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 31 years old and a male.  </li>
            <li>As far as I can see, this does nothing for the appearance of facial skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Looking forward to brighter skin in the near future!!</li>
            <li>I would even go as far as to say the same hour</li>
            <li>my older supply of Argan oil, let that dry, then used the Barbary fig oil,&lt;br /&gt;worked</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product numerous times since receiving it and it completely dries up my face immediately.</li>
            <li>My skin is smoother and brighter, and because the bottle is twice the size of the average Vitamin C serum, I&#x27;m not racing to buy more every few months.</li>
            <li>Known for hiding wrinkles, Poppy Austin&#x27;s C serum feels thick and strong, like it is  actually doing something.  </li>
            <li>Higher percentage of vitamin C for less $ than any others.</li>
            <li>Unlike a lot of other products it does not irritate my skin or cause breakouts because I am very acne prone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other higher-priced serums, and this works really really well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s delicately refined infusion of natural derived and organic ingredients and is Highly concentrated with pure vegan Hyaluronic Acid and deeply moisturizing JoJoba Oil.</li>
            <li>Highly concentrated with pure vegan Hyaluronic Acid and deeply moisturizing JoJoba Oil and is naturally free from paragons, fillers, alcohol, artificial colors and fragrances.</li>
            <li>I have only been using this for a couple of weeks, so, I don&#x27;t expect any major results yet.</li>
            <li>I have been using a few weeks and see subtle improvements in the fine lines around my mouth and the dark spots seem to be fading lightly.  </li>
            <li>Using it for the first few days I saw a pronounced softness and smoothness in my skin.  </li>
            <li>After just a few weeks, my skin is smoother, fine wrinkles reduced, and dark circles lightened.</li>
            <li>product absorbs very quickly into the skin, I did notice however that for the few seconds it takes to absorb there is a slight tacky feeling</li>
            <li>It¬¥s too watery, you can hardly put it on your face, it evaporates quickly</li>
            <li>but the serum absorbs so quickly that it is hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li>If you have ever pull aloe on your face that is what the product feels like, a little tight but makes no difference over all to fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li>When I started using this product, I noticed that they diminished a bit and really looked less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>The dry areas are hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li>It is like a face lift for my mature dry skin..</li>
            <li>I have some dark patches on my cheeks from birth control &amp; sun exposure that are my only real pet-peeve.  </li>
            <li>I think it will take a little while to see real results.  </li>
            <li>However from  the very beginning I got a little (just tiny) redness,  </li>
            <li>but i didn&#x27;t think anything of it, most lotions and serums, or anything really is going to have some type of smell, this one wasn&#x27;t bad.</li>

            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this serum...</li>
            <li> Love it, already see an improvement in my &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It does feel nice on my face and is very economical.</li>
            <li> makes skin look smoother  feels good  very pure</li>
            <li> Very excited to see the changes in my skin as the months go on.  </li>
            <li> AGAIN, like the rose water, the quality is amazing and the price is right!&lt;br /&gt;i have experienced profound changes in my skin since i started using poppy austin and am now a loyal customer who will tell all my friends.</li>
            <li> I love this product and think it is the best beauty product I have bought in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love this makes my face look brighter and clean!</li>
            <li> Very light and easy to apply</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s a huge bottle, so I feel better about slathering more of it over my face :)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the line for about 4 months now, and it has done wonders for the fine lines and wrinkles, evened out my skin tone, and has given this maturing face a more youthful look that I haven&#x27;t had in many moons.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unsure if you can put it around your eyes, which is where most of my fine lines are, so I won&#x27;t try until I can find out if it&#x27;s safe.  </li>
            <li> This was a very nice Vitamin C serum and absorbed quickly into my skin.  </li>
            <li> Great price for a product I won&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li> Nice on the face, quick absorb and not stings my skin.  </li>
            <li> Love this product, so easy to appy, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, can apply moisturizer or makeup immediately.</li>
            <li> Nice texture glides on nicely but don&#x27;t put to much</li>
            <li> The entire Poppy Austin line is the best skin care line available.  </li>
            <li> I dont have so many fine lines</li>
            <li> Love the huge bottle as I go through gallons of Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with the customer service and the delivery of my order on time as well as the purity and natural production process to produce this product.</li>
            <li> Love it not sticky n leaves my face feeling smooth..</li>
            <li> So far it has been great for my face</li>
            <li> The product so far has been great.</li>
            <li> The product came sooner than expected and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> My skin tone is much more even and smooth looking.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far it feels great on my face.</li>
            <li> But I will write that it goes on nicely, has no smell, and is easily absorbed into the skin.  </li>
            <li> It did not block my pores and was not greasy, it absorbed nicely into the skin and didn&#x27;t affect my makeup.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent a complimentary bottle, as I am a product reviewer, in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Great product, large size &amp; quick shipping.  </li>
            <li> It applies very easily and dries really quickly, and it is not sticky at all.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this vitamin c serum and will probably try out some of the other items in the Poppy Austin beauty product line.</li>
            <li> Originally bought this for my mom to use but fell in love with it myself.</li>
            <li> I love trying new beauty products and I am always looking for the ONE that will make my skin nice and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily</li>
            <li> Easy apply on, feels like oil.</li>
            <li> Received this product 2 days ago and very quickly.</li>
            <li> It works and is easy to use</li>
            <li> I burn and tan easily and am prone to some freckling.</li>
            <li> So far so good, Ive tried so many products, I&#x27;m using all of your products, I just ordered the clay mask...</li>
            <li> Love the effect I see after I use it, specially for a guy&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> My skin does not only look healthier but it also has a beautiful  glow.</li>
            <li> i most certainly will buy this again!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 weeks and can see the difference it is making on my age spots and fine lines.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a difference of fine lines on my face.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with a Vitamin C serum, but I&#x27;m glad to report that I really enjoyed Poppy Austin&#x27;s serum.</li>
            <li> I quit ALL my face regiments to see it this truly worked, to my surprise it worked on my fine lines by my mouth and on my forehead.</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic Acid also prevent fine lines and wrinkles from forming and helps the skin by retaining moisture and creating a cushion to help plump them out as we age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pores and fine lines are diminished.</li>
            <li> Great product; does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> However, I have yet to see any improvement on my fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It has reduced my pore size, fine lines and has evened my skin tone all within a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> and I like it but no improvement in my fine lines.</li>
            <li> Once I love something, I am loyal to it....</li>
            <li> OK I received the serum quickly.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and safely</li>
            <li> Love how it absorbs quickly, and I already see improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> Nice large size, easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference the very first time I used this serum and would recommend to women of all ages!</li>
            <li> I have noticed a huge improvement in my skin, this is a staple now.</li>
            <li> I am a huge Poppy Austin fan now.</li>
            <li> On the fifth day, I started applying it in the morning and night a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> I saw a huge improvement in my marks in a bit over a week</li>
            <li> Did I mention this bottle is HUGE compared to others</li>
            <li> noticed a great improvement in  my complexion and facial wrinkles!!!</li>
            <li> Fabulous product.</li>
            <li> This product is scent free</li>
            <li> Makes my skin look brighter and feels so smooth.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, fantastic price.</li>
            <li> Enjoy</li>
            <li> The value was fabulous.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t leave sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s fabulously organic.</li>
            <li> I have tried many things without success because of the sensitivity issue.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The eye creme is fantastic as is the vitamin c.</li>
            <li> I initially bought this for it&#x27;s great price</li>
            <li> love the fresh scent it has.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen great results in the last two weeks since I purchased this Vitamin C.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and soaks into the skin.</li>
            <li> And I am not saying that because they sent me a free bottle of Vitamin C.  </li>
            <li> Vitamin C can also help to prevent or treat hyperigmentation, defend against free radicals and brighten your skin.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this product and will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> Great Vitamin C to use daily</li>
            <li> Light as liquid and no smell.</li>
            <li> So light and absorbs immediately.  </li>
            <li> The surface of my skin has gotten so smooth and it just glows allowing me to go without foundation.  </li>
            <li> Poppy Austin is fabulous.</li>
            <li> Free radicals be gone.</li>
            <li> This followed up with my regular moisturizer was great.</li>
            <li> My make up looked fantastic over this combo</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Product feels light and my skin seems improved.</li>
            <li> The serum is smooth and has the consistency of water and almost no scent to it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 52 years old and have always taken good care of my skin.</li>
            <li> I loved how it made my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> The best skin lotion it is  possible to have, as well as being a real bargain.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a month and so far the results look good.</li>
            <li> far so good.</li>
            <li> Leaving it feeling vibrant with a healthy glow!</li>
            <li> And to make the glow even better,  please buy poppy Austin&#x27;s barbary fig oil and put it on right after you put the vitamin c.  </li>
            <li> I do have pretty good skin, and purchased this product for the large pores I&#x27;ve noticed I&#x27;m developing on my cheeks</li>
            <li> My face feels smooth and fresh!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to see a good result as my face complexion is becoming brighter and clearer (from acne marks).  </li>
            <li> My new favorite.!</li>
            <li> and now I&#x27;m just about to purchase 2 more , for ME and MY husband:)&lt;br /&gt;Leave the skin tight, smooth and definitely a great anti aging serums.</li>
            <li> Am enjoying the serum very much.</li>
            <li> I found the Vitamin C Serum to be very gentle and my skin seemed to love it and would &#x60;drink&#x27; it in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m at the stage where I&#x27;m willing to try almost any magic elixir in hopes of making a dent (or rather smoothing some dents) in my aging skin.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time using a vitamin c serum, and I love it.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, haven&#x27;t been using it long, but I can already see some improvement.  </li>
            <li> so far this is a very lovely vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> First let me start by saying I LOVE anything that Poppy Austin makes.</li>
            <li> Originally I rated this product as 4 stars.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed one bit.</li>
            <li> It did significantly reduce my pore size to my delight.</li>
            <li> Overall im happy with this product and plus bonus is that its a double supply for the good price .</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> I started using this right after I did a peel, and I can honestly say it&#x27;s really helped brighten and smooth my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin already seems to be feeling and looking better, only 2 days into using this Poppy Austin Vitamin C combined with their Rose Water.</li>
            <li> Smooth and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I just loved this non-scented, smooth, and instant treatment for my skin.</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply and absorbed into my skin right away!</li>
            <li> My skin has completely transformed for the better since using this!</li>
            <li> The shipment arrived on time and it is an awesome purchase for the price; twice as much product as other serums I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> The Poppy Austin Vitamin C Serum is thicker than other serums I&#x27;ve tried and I am also impressed with how much the appearance of my scars have improved.</li>
            <li> Love the large size of this bottle.</li>
            <li> Also, I have not seen this large of a quantity, which makes it a better value.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Until next time... its beautiful to shop smart.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to try it out...</li>
            <li> I think my moisturizer is better absorbed with the Vitamin C used first.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend Vitimin C Serum to anyone who wants to look younger and have beautiful skin,</li>
            <li> Like the way it tighten the skin and overall feels good.  </li>
            <li> Web MD says that &amp;#34;some people apply hyaluronic acid to the skin for healing wounds, burns, skin ulcers, and as a moisturizer.&amp;#34; So maybe it really is the magic elixir found in the fountain of youth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also adds a cool freshness when i use it twice a day.</li>
            <li> yes its true...</li>
            <li> Light fresh nourishing.  </li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t really tell, but I like the feel of this (its refreshing)</li>
            <li> The best one I have found is SkinMedica vitamin C &amp; E complex.</li>
            <li> You can see my full review here:</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> Use Vitamin C serum after cleansing your skin with rose water toner, then apply argan oil or barbary fig oil as a natural moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Very liquidy, or more than I thought.</li>
            <li> Good product but the only results I noticed was that my skin was lightened.</li>
            <li> This came really quick, I live in New Zealand and was very surprised to see it arrive within two weeks, very happy.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised when it only took 2 day to get my package of Poppy Austin vitamin C, that started me off with a very good opinion of the company.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and really  works!</li>
            <li> Great value compared to other vit.</li>
            <li> I have purchased many items from Poppy Austin - all live up to expectations and then some!</li>
            <li> Wonderful Vitamin c serum - plays nicely with all my other skin care and my skin is definitely brighter and clearer - will absolutely repurchase this.</li>
            <li> Delivery was really quick</li>
            <li> , his skin looks more moisturized and perhaps in time his deep lines may begin to look better as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lovely oil doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and makes it look more translucent and younger.</li>
            <li> Shipped was unbelievably quick</li>
            <li> See brighter skin quickly with the use of this twice a day.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast, good packaging, Like it so far....</li>
            <li> Not greasy, and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> (I wonder if this would help with mild acne for teens?).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super grateful for this product.</li>
            <li> Penetrates quickly and makes a difference in the appearance of skin.</li>
            <li> Product was delivered promptly and questions answered quickly.</li>
            <li> highly recommend trying this lovely serum.</li>
            <li> I apply it on my clean face and my skin absorbs it right away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used lots of other &amp; this is by far the best!  </li>
            <li> This was my very first experience with a Vitamin C Serum</li>
            <li> Vitamin C Serum from Poppy Austin¬Æ with Hyaluronic Acid Serum is a pure quality Vitamin C Serum and can be easily found on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I received my order and I am enjoying using my new Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> I am an esthetician and love to try new product lines to stay up to date and compare product</li>
            <li> bottle is double the normal size and is a great value.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super fun.</li>
            <li> I like the way it feels when applied ,no stickiness, and it is absorbed quickly into skin.</li>
            <li> Cannot say enough about this product, I love it!</li>
            <li> Thank you Poppy Austin for your user friendly website, follow up email and your cause supporting women in Morocco.</li>
            <li> and this had no ill effects on my skin at all!  </li>
            <li> Used this for the first time today and hoping it does the job!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel tight, greasy, or make me break out, which is great.</li>
            <li> When I touched my face after applying the Vitamin C Serum it felt very smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> Thank you Poppy Austin for a fine, reasonably priced product.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product made of the finest quality, pure ingredients.  </li>
            <li> This may be better for younger women who want to prevent rather then correct fine lines.</li>
            <li> Only a little is needed for good coverage and it feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li> Next the product has been amazing.</li>
            <li> I have been applying it for a few months and my skin is looking great.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing on clean dry skin, then layer your moisturizer of choice over it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing the brown glass to help protect the oil inside from too much exposure to light.</li>
            <li> My skin is definitely more hydrated, and when I wake up in the morning it&#x27;s both soft and sort of &amp;#34;plumped&amp;#34; up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Buy this product, it is so economical.</li>
            <li> This is worth the buy.</li>
            <li> So far am really enjoying the experience, and look forward to improved results over time.</li>
            <li> Just initiated this in addition to Vit C , Rose Hips and finally completing the process to Fig oil.</li>
            <li> Rose water toner is next</li>
            <li> but 2 weeks is kind of short to see.  </li>
            <li> Easily absorbed serum that sits well under moisturizer or BB cream.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased so far with the results of this product and&lt;br /&gt;will</li>
            <li> love the fact that this Vitamin C Serum by Poppy Austin is made from naturally derived and organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> lightweight and instantly absorbed</li>
            <li> Ever wondered why babies and small children always look like they have beautiful supple plumpy skin?  </li>
            <li> Nice big bottle, took about a week to get here.</li>
            <li> Extremely pleased so far.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have the most sensitive skin and break out with 99% of products applied to my face.  </li>
            <li> I love this product so far.  </li>
            <li> So far I am  pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Love how soft my face feels after applying this serum.</li>
            <li> So far it is ok</li>
            <li> truly feel that this is a quality skin care product that is worth the money.</li>
            <li> After absorption the skin feels soft and you can notice a brightness about the skin more so</li>
            <li> So far love the appearance of my skin</li>
            <li> Now THIS Vitamin C Serum doesn&#x27;t run off my face (like others I&#x27;ve tried) and you can just feel it being absorbed into your skin.</li>
            <li> spots!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li> No artificial fragrance--no scent at all.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It has made my skin so soft, I love the scent!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using &amp;</li>
            <li> Received pretty quick and have been pleased so far with this product.</li>
            <li> Absorbed pretty quickly without any sticky residue.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased - my skin shows a clarity and vibrance I have not seen in a very long time.</li>
            <li> , Poppy Austin provides double the amount (compared to other brands) for a great price!</li>
            <li> where needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Poppy Austin Vitamin C Serum twice a day; in the morning after I get out of the shower, and at night after I wash my face right before going to bed.</li>
            <li> soaks right in your skin.</li>
            <li> The price is also right.</li>
            <li> (I use this serum right after I apply Paula&#x27;s choice 2% BHA, and this combination is a bomb)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I got compliments right away.</li>
            <li> I took a chance on a brand that I never had used or sampled based on several positive reviews, and I am glad that I did!</li>
            <li> However with all the advantages of vitamin C, the only draw back is that because it is an antioxidant, it oxidizes itself very quickly and once this happens, it is no longer good.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with how just a couple of small drops of the serum provided complete coverage on my face.</li>
            <li> Very gentle and fresh.</li>
            <li> The most noticeable results I&#x27;ve gotten so far is a clear smooth fresh looking face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fabulous and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a really high quality product with fantastic ingredients</li>
            <li> Very Large bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m interested in how it works fpr the long haul, but so far, it&#x27;s really a great product.  </li>
            <li> Waiting patiently on its full effect on my lines and wrinkles though I&#x27;ve noted they are much softer now.....</li>
            <li> I have been using many things on my face and on the first day of using this product , I can see a major difference  on my face .</li>
            <li> So far this is by far the best one yet and I intend to order other products.</li>
            <li> Im using it right now since Nov 2014 the first bottle and Im</li>
            <li> I really didnt see any notable change in my 61 year old face.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much and it absorbs quickly with no greasy or oily residue.  </li>
            <li> Goes on very silky and absorbs quickly in the skin.</li>
            <li> So far so good for I&#x27;m using it regularly - reallymore</li>
            <li> it felt nice being applied, didn&#x27;t leave behind sticky reside and was nice under my makeup.</li>
            <li> So far easy to use.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much that this is my 2nd bottle.</li>
            <li> I will be happy to give you feed back as it has not had enough time for me to see a difference .</li>
            <li> Side by side it seems its the exact same ingredients and same great,  light, fast absorbing serum.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t be without it, makes my skin feel hydrated and soft, which helps to diminish those fine</li>
            <li> no greasy feel, and is fine for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It leaves the skin so soft and together with the retinol serum, I have noticed the fine lines disappearing as well.</li>
            <li> It is too early to give an accurate assessment.</li>
            <li> in all I would definitely give this product a HUGE thumbs up!</li>
            <li> love  this serum..makes my pores look so tiny</li>
            <li> Wish I could use it on my whole body!  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many topical serums to help with wrinkles and complexion that didn&#x27;t help</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and is almost completely odor free,&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> Soaks in, leaving a smooth soft finish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve watched their video on YouTube and am following instructions for greater results.</li>
            <li> I apply the serum first and then apply my moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> The first time I applied it (and consequently every time) there was a tightness</li>
            <li> My face is so smooth and clear .</li>
            <li> Its first two ingredients is herb; infusion and aloe.  </li>
            <li> All natural and sellers are fantastic</li>
            <li> Maybe when I&#x27;m 98, I&#x27;ll only look 97 :)</li>
            <li> I use twice a day and only top with moisture cream at night.</li>
            <li> First time using Poppy Austin</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes with a money back guarantee, so they&#x27;re confident in their product.</li>
            <li> I had heard about Vitamin C serum, did some research and found this one to be very affordable and it works!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if it was a matter of timing or just a matter of using it more, but I didn&#x27;t notice a big difference when I used it once at night for the first four nights.  </li>
            <li> This bottle is 2x bigger than most.</li>
            <li> It hydrated my face after my first use.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, with only a week of use I can already see results.</li>
            <li> Ok back to the Vitamin C review</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another thing that I love about this product as stated earlier is that it contains jojoba oil.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this!</li>
            <li> I cannot tell any difference in my skin after using this whole bottle!  </li>
            <li> ON THE FIRST DAY.............</li>
            <li> Thanks !</li>
            <li> My skin is definitely looking smoother and more toned.</li>
            <li> You can feel a difference almost instantly when you apply the serum, sunspots are fading, skin is more radiant and plumped.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to others !!</li>
            <li> I will definitely recommend you to give it a try:)</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more skin products from Poppy Austin.</li>
            <li> I can see a big difference in terms of wrinkle reduction, smoother skin, lightening spots, etc., by using a more liberal application.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased with the first bottle that I just received my  second bottle -</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying the Poppy Austin Brand</li>
            <li> Something that is really important to me because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> already&lt;br /&gt;the color has improved the lines are diminishing the feel of the skin has improve and my hands are looking younger and more cared for every day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It was my first time ever trying a C serum</li>
            <li> His exact words were &amp;#34;No way&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li> - I saw results the first day using it.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for almost a week now - I rub it on my face, forehead and neck and since I have started doing this my skin has not only cleared up quite a bit but also FEELS better.</li>
            <li> but this was my first chance to try it, and</li>
            <li> top is a dropper top which always works well for dispensing a small amount onto your fingertips.</li>
            <li> I just finished my first bottle and purchased another bottle.</li>
            <li> ;)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product and will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> Hope it works ;)</li>
            <li> and recently I decided to switch over to this one because it was a better value for the price.  </li>
            <li> I must say, it really lives up to the hype!</li>
            <li> Definitely will improve your skin giving you a more youthful appearance.</li>
            <li> Just a few days into using, I&#x27;ve read good reviews</li>
            <li> Took a before photo of problem areas, just took a new one and am pleased with results so far.  </li>
            <li> The serum itself has made my skin noticeably more smooth and my pores less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Both came more quickly than expected</li>
            <li> Really diminishes the smaller wrinkles and leaves my skin very smooth.</li>
            <li> I have been blessed with pretty good skin and am only now starting to develop a few fine lines in my forehead and around my mouth  and have not been able to see a difference in them wile using this serum</li>
            <li> Probably the most effective thing I&#x27;ve ever used to remove dark marks from acne scarring along with daily use of sunscreen of course.</li>
            <li> have tried other Vitamin C Serums and have in fact made my own</li>
            <li> It has no scent, rich texture, absorbs immediately leaving skin soft with no residue or sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> It comes in a nice bottle and when I dropped it the other day it didn&#x27;t break</li>
            <li> I am 59 years old and have used Vitamin C Serum in the past and this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> Using this Vitamin C Serum daily has really helped my skin both look and feel better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big animal lover, I love them so much even when I see hurt, abandoned, and lost animals</li>
            <li> I love having an all natural antioxidant to apply directly to my skin.</li>
            <li> love the Poppy Austin Vitamin C Serum so much, that I had to order it a second time...</li>
            <li> my 79 year old skin is not tough looking as many others who live in FL.</li>
            <li> I have only been doing this for over two weeks, but can notably tell the difference in fine lines around eyes and mouth and overall, my skin is smoother and &amp;#34;clearer&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I love the packaging although it seems like a small bottle, a little bit goes a long way:) It&#x27;s great to use during a retinyl treatment, as it&#x27;s very pure and hydrates the skin without any irritation.</li>
            <li> I have been using Poppy Austins Argon oil for two years now, and have had nothing but positive results, with product and company.</li>
            <li> It had lots of positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what is going on with the positive reviews, but this didn&#x27;t work at all for me.</li>
            <li> I know I will have a positive result , for I have used vitamin C before , and am poking forward to the benefits of the Hyaluronic acid , have kept my skin doing well using the products I know work .</li>
            <li> but it has only been a few days, am very happy so far.</li>
            <li> Anyway, as long as it is able to make a difference on my aging face I will continue to use this product.  </li>
            <li> great price in comparison to other brands which advertise to do the same thing</li>
            <li> I loved that this product is not tested on animals, as animals are very close to my heart.&lt;br /&gt;There are several anti-aging benefits (wrinkle reduction, age spots, etc, ), but I have rather troublesome dark circles that I was excited to learn this serum could help.</li>
            <li> My skin began showing an amazing positive difference after the first few days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you for such a wonderful product and look forward to ordering this and other products in the future.</li>
            <li> I have received compliments since I&#x27;ve been using it for less than a month about how nice my skin looks.</li>
            <li> Goes on nicely and is 1/3 the cost of the previous brand I was using.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly, not greasy and just makes skin nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m waiting to see results--not using it long enough to give a fair evaluation.</li>
            <li> I use Vitamin C Serum everyday with the Rhassoul Clay (1 to 2xtimes a week) and the combo has made a huge positive impact on my skin!!!</li>
            <li> Large 2oz bottle.  </li>
            <li> Large bottle.  </li>
            <li> It is a large sized bottle for what I paid for (~$35) and has 20% Vitamin C stated on the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Large amount for the money.</li>
            <li> Certainly look forward to added benefits from the serum.</li>
            <li> Smart idea.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see a difference, however, I know that Vitamin C is suppose to be good for the face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Poppy Austin is now my new and only favorite skincare.  </li>
            <li> Although I have oily skin, certain areas of my face are starting to show a bit of fine lines.</li>
            <li> Finally got now brand argan oil at the store and used that over the c serum and saw an immediate improvement in my fine lies around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this serum to anyone who wants to fight the aging process!</li>
            <li> but I feel as though I am a little more fresh faced.</li>
            <li> I have so much faith in the brand</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t test the product to see how much of it really is Vit C and hyaluronic acid, but what I can tell you is this;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is so much softer and smoother.  </li>
            <li> Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> It is NOT a miracle, but I really like what it is doing for my skin</li>
            <li> I received  it and  started using  it  straight  away .</li>
            <li> Absorbs fast and already seeing improvement on my acne marks, discoloration and scars.</li>
            <li> Highly, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a couple weeks, I don&#x27;t really see much difference.</li>
            <li> this product has really improved my skin tone</li>
            <li> You can purchase the Vitamin C Serum on Amazon or the Poppy Austin Website with Free Delivery and there also is a Money Back Guarantee.</li>
            <li> This product really works nicely, no redness (if you are sensitive to products like me), and I have reordered this, which says a lot in itself, thank you for a great product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for about 3 weeks and really like it.</li>
            <li> The dropper is very effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was amazed at how much smoother, brighter, and firmer it became.</li>
            <li> They sell the real deal.</li>
            <li> While we all know that nothing you do (expect a face lift) will get rid of lines and wrinkles, however there are things we can use like hyaluronic acid that can really help tomask them.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> it is much thinner and much clearer</li>
            <li> However, after using a whole bottle; it did NOTHING for my skin.</li>
            <li> It took my skin about two weeks to really start to change.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really like the way this feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> , I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference yet..</li>
            <li> It is much smoother and softer and feels fuller or thicker.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t ready to start.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> but it sinks into your skin better</li>
            <li> This is extremely gentle and works very well.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much point in purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> I really like this Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> I have used Obagi vit c &amp; did not like it because it leaves your face very sticky,</li>
            <li> highly recommend this Vitamin C Serum !</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really does what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> I will see the result after I completed using a whole bottle.</li>
            <li> I really like this...</li>
            <li> The serum itself is a milky white smooth and silky liquid.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very high-quality product.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Poppy Austin</li>
            <li> so far i am pleased with the product, only time will tell.thank</li>
            <li> Although I have only used this product for a short time, I love that it feels so &#x27;right.&#x27;  </li>
            <li> use it every night right after cleansing and let it get absorbed for several minutes before I apply an oil/moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Poppy Austin Vitamin C serum is a staple in my skincare routine that I certainly won&#x27;t give up (even as someone who frequently changes products and wants to try out new things)!!!</li>
            <li> It is just plain NICE.  </li>
            <li> When I ran out of that brand, I decided to try the Poppy Austin serum due to the larger size &amp; the good reviews.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a serum that gets absorbed quickly without leaving your face dry.</li>
            <li> I had a healthy glow that other people started to compliment.</li>
            <li> I have used other Brands of Vitamin C Serum that I have had better results with, but I find the convenience of the 2 oz.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a week and see more improvement in my skin than with months of using other products.</li>
            <li> This product feels better on my skin than any other serum I have tried.</li>
            <li> My esthetician seemed to think my skin was looking better along with some other advice from her.</li>
            <li> Vit C and other skin brightening and whitening products makes your skin more prone to sun tan , so you should always use sun screen in your regimen</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly leaving a sightly tight feel.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love the glow this gives my skin though, so it is worth the small sacrifice.</li>
            <li> My skin looks smooth and bright with only a few drops used twice daily.</li>
            <li> It instantly gives your skin a drink of intense hydration while directly tackling those stubborn fine lines, age spots, and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> The serum smoothes on easy and sinks in fast.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, the seller for me here was the Vitamin C.  Vitamin C is an antioxidant that is used to protect and help the face from wrinkles, sun damage, signs of aging, dark spots and brighten your complexion amongst other great benefits.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it&#x27;s in a dark, glass bottle</li>
            <li> Will be buying more and other products from this company!</li>
            <li> Not sure, but it seems previous Vitamin C serums have been more effective.</li>
            <li> I have been buying another serum that costs more and half the size of this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a light weight serum that actually works for dark spots and fine lines and I&#x27;ve finalIy found it with this serum.</li>
            <li> love how it makes my face and neck feel...seems to be less sagging.</li>
            <li> it came it, the dark glass bottle helps keep the product good for a long time.</li>
            <li> However as we get older we loss a lot of it and thus aging takes it toll.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more in the future.  </li>
            <li> Poppy&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t have that particular ingredient</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and works wonders, especially around my mouth and under my eyes.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and I like that fact that it only takes about 4-6 drops to cover my face, neck and chest area.  </li>
            <li> The effect of these particular products may produce quicker results, however these are also products that I can not use every day.</li>
            <li> I concentrate on the sides of my face in particular, where I have brown sun spots.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly reccommend this company.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend its use.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended to ppl to try</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and will be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> High quality product.</li>
            <li> I will purchase this again and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I am trying to fight my skin&#x27;s ageing as much as possible &amp; have started to try new products &amp; incorporate more into my somewhat simple skin care routine.  </li>
            <li> I first tried another C serum I purchased off amazon for a few months &amp; was overall happy with the results, but the constancy seemed a little watery &amp; the bottle ran out pretty fast since I like to use it on my face, neck &amp; chest.  </li>
            <li> Far better than any other Vitamin C serum I have tried.</li>
            <li> I particularly appreciate the simple label, it looks clean and professional.</li>
            <li> I need a little more time.</li>
            <li> but what about items that need a little more attention?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and hasn&#x27;t made me break out like other products I used.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I am so happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> , I was surprised how fast.</li>
            <li> The serum doesn‚Äôt really have fragrance and it does make your face soft.  </li>
            <li> For the past 5 years, I have been much better with avoiding sunburns or too much exposure to sunlight.</li>
            <li> It is quickly absorbed and totally non-greasy.</li>
            <li> normally don&#x27;t write review for products I purchase, but this one deserves it.</li>
            <li> I will give it a few more days.</li>
            <li> I use it at night mostly for overnight repair and hydration or before work where the air is harsh and recycled.</li>
            <li> the size is double from what i was using before and the price makes me smile.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hyaluronic Acid is found naturally in the human body and seen tremendously in babies.  </li>
            <li> It is a good value and seems to do the same as other similar products I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> have used other skin care products that were really good, yet harsh and very drying.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with my purchase, size is large will last at least 6 months.</li>
            <li> I used the Vitamin C Serum twice daily for two weeks and felt that it did actually help with fine lines and wrinkles, while firming and smoothing my skin.</li>
            <li> I was doing some research for a new serum and came upon this.  </li>
            <li> I can get congested pores from creams and serums so trying anything new is always an experiement.</li>
            <li> It is the type of product that I can&#x27;t live without, even for a night.</li>
            <li> however, I haven&#x27;t seen any new &amp;#34;surprises&amp;#34; since I started using this along with the Rosewater Toner.</li>
            <li> They are my new &amp;#34;holy grail&amp;#34; skin care products.  </li>
            <li> My new regiment - Poppy Austin Products.</li>
            <li> leaves skin feeling soft and firm and fabulous!</li>
            <li> While I could see a slight improvement after several months use, on a recent visit with my sister-in-law she raved about how good I looked.  </li>
            <li> I used a competitor for months but when the price went up, I was forced to find something more reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Their all natural products rejuvenate your skin naturally &amp; show visible results for an extremely reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> You only need a very little and it goes on my face easily and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> My face feels very soft after applying it.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this serum on my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive acne prone skin</li>
            <li> Skin feels very soft in the morning after using it the nite before</li>
            <li> This is the first serum I&#x27;ve tried that has actually made a difference.</li>
            <li> I am liking this product but not sure if I love it.</li>
            <li> First Vitamin C product I&#x27;ve tried, definitely improved skin texture.</li>
            <li> It normally starts off clear and then turns yellow.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I took pictures and looked exactly the same as before.</li>
            <li> after using it consistently you actually do have a noticeable difference in the texture of your skin.</li>
            <li> it just keep my face looking fresh all day long..</li>
            <li> As someone who has tried darn near every product - rest assured - you&#x27;ve fond what you need with Poppy Austin!</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and glowing!</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin that goes dry and breaks out.</li>
            <li> The Vitamin C Serum is a natural way to firm and smooth aged skin by stimulating collagen and neutralizing free radicals.</li>
            <li> The Vitamin C Serum is a natural way to firm and smooth aged skin by stimulating collagen and neutralizing free radicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well I have a new item to review and in order to fully engulf myself in this product I stopped using another all together in order to see this product solely in action.</li>
            <li> This serum leaves my skin soft and the fine lines on my face are less noticeable......</li>
            <li> the bottle is of a dark brown/amber color to help protect from sun light and damage the dropper is a clear glass dropper that works</li>
            <li> I could not really tell much of a difference by the end of my first bottle.</li>
            <li> I never felt greasy and if my skin started to feel a little dry, I simply applied a good moisturizing cream to alleviate the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it makes it feel tight and smooth .I</li>
            <li> Also I only want to put pure ingredients on my skin</li>
            <li> We both get many complaints about how our skin glow, looks much younger and tight .</li>
            <li> My large pores appear smaller too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using the product daily and will write a review of results after a little more time goes by.</li>
            <li> Great company, organic, cold pressed.</li>
            <li> I just received Poppy Austin Vitamin C Serum for Face and my serum is clear.</li>
            <li> The serum has started getting cloudy, whereas it was clear when I opened the bottle.</li>
            <li> Poppy Austin offers.</li>
            <li> I have mature combination/ leaning towards oily skin.</li>
            <li> old complexion.  </li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t bothered my sensitive skin either.</li>
            <li> and this company gives,you twice as much at the same price as other&lt;</li>
            <li> So far I have not seen any change in my skin, but I like the product.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive, so I was worried about a reaction, but I have had no adverse reactions to it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s  too early  </li>
            <li> so far</li>
            <li> Feels lovely and moisturising, have&#x27;nt used it long enough yet to tell if it does anything long term.</li>
            <li> Like it so far</li>
            <li> Although the formula is light enough to use on your entire face, I concentrate on the areas of my neck, upper lip and under eye</li>
            <li> It completely cleared my skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My face looks so refreshed and soft.</li>
            <li> I completely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Their products (vitamin C and Argan Oil) are all natural with nothing added or taken away.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lady of mature age who still gets breakouts...</li>
            <li> Not harsh on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I haved never used this brand, so far I like the product.</li>
            <li> WOW.  </li>
            <li> Not for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and so far have not noticed any difference in my skin at all.</li>
            <li> Wow, I can already see a change as far to the brightness of my skin.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say definitively that it does what it claims, but I like the product so far.</li>
            <li> No problem so far .</li>
            <li> used this Vitamin C Serum from Poppy Austin¬Æ religiously day and night because it is so gentle.</li>
            <li> was surprised at my age.  </li>
            <li> I also have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The skin is glowing, soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and hydrated without a greasy feel.</li>
            <li> Make sure face is not warm when applying Vit. C serum)</li>
            <li> I do not know if vitamin C really helps skin stay younger looking</li>
            <li> honestly I don&#x27;t have one negative comment about the entire line of face care</li>
            <li> I have not had it long enough to see its full benefit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good Vitamin C serum for my face that wouldn&#x27;t be so expensive.</li>
            <li> The size of the bottle is larger than most other brands, making your purchase last longer.</li>
            <li> The Vitamin C Serum directly tackles fine lines and age spots and dark under eye circles providing instant hydration.</li>
            <li> First it doesn&#x27;t break you out or dry your skin.</li>
            <li> and so glad that I was sent such a big bottle so it will last for a long time!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It tackles those fine lines and age spots and dark under eye circles providing instant hydration.</li>
            <li> , I have normal skin with no blemish problems or wrinkles to speak of, but my husband  (patchy-dry skin, prone to breakouts) started using it everyday for his crows&#x27; feet and forehead lines, and he&#x27;s been blemish free since the third day</li>
            <li> you can see from the first picture above, this Vitamin C Serum is slightly different as far as its appearance.</li>
            <li> Have been using for awhile and am pleased with the subtle changes this serum makes on my face.  </li>
            <li> You should ALWAYS read the back of the packaging label and google what the main ingredients are before applying it on your face.  </li>
            <li> After using for just 2 weeks, most of the small bumps are gone and my skin felt tighter and younger.</li>
            <li> smaller and fine lines are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> particular product comes in a big brown glass bottle.</li>
            <li> ; at the end of the day,&lt;br /&gt;5, I&#x27;m highly freckled, but my overall skintone is brighter and clearer, and I&#x27;ve stopped having to use foundation under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this product</li>
            <li> This bottle is very large in comparison to the other ones I saw online when shopping.</li>
            <li> Its pH is basic and will dried my skin out over time until I began following with a more acidic toner.</li>
            <li> i have used lot of other vit c serums from popular brands, they all helped my skin and no more acne like before.</li>
            <li> Love the slightly thicker consistency than some other VitC serums, it doesnt run away through your fingers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thinner than most facial serum, makes it a bit hard when you drop it on finger&#x27;s tip before apply on your face.</li>
            <li> far as I can tell it is identical to the other brand that I used (quickly absorbed and unscented).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> my skin feels lovely and it&#x27;s all natural without the harsh chemicals, that other companies use.</li>
            <li> This is a huge value on price and the size of the vitamin c because you only need a few drops each time.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing these goods again, although very tempted to purchase the argan oil next time.</li>
            <li> I suffered from acne as a young adult and continue to be prone to occasional breakouts.  </li>
            <li> Because it is a wax ester it is hypothesized that jojoba oil is very comparable to human skin oil which manipulates the skin into thinking it has produced enough and balances out oil production.  </li>
            <li> I notice it is very slightly cloudy, not bad at all.</li>
            <li> When you get down to the bottom of the bottle, it will no longer pump the product up, so I take the top off and turn it upside down &amp; get it out that way</li>
            <li> Its a major component of skin tissue that give babies this effect.  </li>
            <li> Very good product and less expensive than others similar.  </li>
            <li> Everybody who is anybody from the Red Carpet, Dr. Oz, Oprah and Cinder Crawford&#x27;s secret ingredient in her creme de serum, if you&#x27;ve paid enough attention you&#x27;d know the key to shaving 10-15 even 20 years off your age is mixing 2 ingredients together, hyaluronic acid serum and vitamin c serum and the best thing, it dosent cost an arm and a leg, I&#x27;ve found the purest and cheapest on amazon.com mixed them together a little stronger and in 2 weeks time,</li>
            <li> I still have some &amp;#34;age spots&amp;#34; and little fine lines under my eyes (which I believe are simply genetic) but they have definitely improved.</li>
            <li> I only gave this a 3 however because my fine lines look no better</li>
            <li> This one is a very pale whitish color, whilst most other ones that I have tried have been a clear liquid.</li>
            <li> Skin in general holds about fifty percent of your body‚Äôs hyaluronic acid in it.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice any real differences to my skin.  </li>
            <li> All I can say is I literally look 10 years younger and this stuff completely resolved my forming frown lines, crows feet, neck lines, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 31 years old and a male.  </li>
            <li> As far as I can see, this does nothing for the appearance of facial skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Looking forward to brighter skin in the near future!!</li>
            <li> I would even go as far as to say the same hour</li>
            <li> my older supply of Argan oil, let that dry, then used the Barbary fig oil,&lt;br /&gt;worked</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product numerous times since receiving it and it completely dries up my face immediately.</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother and brighter, and because the bottle is twice the size of the average Vitamin C serum, I&#x27;m not racing to buy more every few months.</li>
            <li> Known for hiding wrinkles, Poppy Austin&#x27;s C serum feels thick and strong, like it is  actually doing something.  </li>
            <li> Higher percentage of vitamin C for less $ than any others.</li>
            <li> Unlike a lot of other products it does not irritate my skin or cause breakouts because I am very acne prone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other higher-priced serums, and this works really really well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s delicately refined infusion of natural derived and organic ingredients and is Highly concentrated with pure vegan Hyaluronic Acid and deeply moisturizing JoJoba Oil.</li>
            <li> Highly concentrated with pure vegan Hyaluronic Acid and deeply moisturizing JoJoba Oil and is naturally free from paragons, fillers, alcohol, artificial colors and fragrances.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a couple of weeks, so, I don&#x27;t expect any major results yet.</li>
            <li> I have been using a few weeks and see subtle improvements in the fine lines around my mouth and the dark spots seem to be fading lightly.  </li>
            <li> Using it for the first few days I saw a pronounced softness and smoothness in my skin.  </li>
            <li> After just a few weeks, my skin is smoother, fine wrinkles reduced, and dark circles lightened.</li>
            <li> product absorbs very quickly into the skin, I did notice however that for the few seconds it takes to absorb there is a slight tacky feeling</li>
            <li> It¬¥s too watery, you can hardly put it on your face, it evaporates quickly</li>
            <li> but the serum absorbs so quickly that it is hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li> If you have ever pull aloe on your face that is what the product feels like, a little tight but makes no difference over all to fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li> When I started using this product, I noticed that they diminished a bit and really looked less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> The dry areas are hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li> It is like a face lift for my mature dry skin..</li>
            <li> I have some dark patches on my cheeks from birth control &amp; sun exposure that are my only real pet-peeve.  </li>
            <li> I think it will take a little while to see real results.  </li>
            <li> However from  the very beginning I got a little (just tiny) redness,  </li>
            <li> but i didn&#x27;t think anything of it, most lotions and serums, or anything really is going to have some type of smell, this one wasn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> I have seen very little positive results, but I&#x27;ll continue using it before making a final decision.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the Poppy Austin C serum is completely the reason (because I am religious about my sunblock &amp; other aspects of my health), but it&#x27;s definitely made my skin brighter, smoother &amp; is evening out the tone already.  </li>
            <li> deposit about half a droppers worth of product into the palm of one hand and rub my hands together slightly then with my fingers</li>
            <li> I did noticed that my skin became very dry the first few days after using it morning and evening.</li>
            <li> C serum for quite awhile and have used other brands and this brand is far superior.&lt;br /&gt;Great service.</li>
            <li> Also, a little really goes a long way with this product.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and other vitamin C products</li>
            <li> then my previous orderI do not like the new products and I will not order again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still getting my occasional break outs, but they may be not lasting as long now.</li>
            <li> It only take a couple of drops so this will last me a very long time.  </li>
            <li> It is truly naturally healing your skin and leaves behind a firm, smooth, and radiant tone to your skin.</li>
            <li> Much too harsh for my skin!</li>
            <li> and I have had only a minor amount of flaky skin on my chin.</li>
            <li> Have used product for 5 days have not used long enough to make a difference yet.</li>
            <li> I have a long way to go, but I did notice that the wrinkles are not as deep as when I started.</li>
            <li> It is a little too early to write a review, since I only have used the product about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Within a few days, I noticed I wasn&#x27;t getting any new pimples.</li>
            <li> My skin is now soft and dewy with less lines.</li>
            <li> The product page states that it has the &amp;#34;faintest citrus scent&amp;#34;, but there needs to be more emphasis on faint as there is really not any fragrance to speak of at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product leaves my skin soft but firm at the same time.</li>
            <li> love that it is made with natural ingredients and free from fillers, alcohol, artificial fragrances, and artificial colors.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on sale and unfortunately have not see any improvement in my fine wrinkles or skin tone.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I put on my face am/pm (other than the occasional spritz of witch hazel).</li>
            <li> It is double the size of other bottles or containers I have purchased for the same money.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using vitamin c serums for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Saw results within a few days as far as texture, tone.  </li>
            <li> Have been using vitamin C for a long time.</li>
            <li> bottle was quite a bit larger than I expected.  </li>
            <li> am a long time</li>
            <li> It also not clear its a cloudy color.</li>
            <li> I previously used a well known serum that was 3x as expensive and worked well, but I think Poppy Austin works better.</li>
            <li> If the change is extremely subtle over time, I&#x27;d appreciate knowing that, and I&#x27;d be pleased to even note subtle improvement in brown spots and pores.</li>
            <li> , that went back and ordered the other products.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m nearly 64 years old and have been abusing my skin with unprotected gardening for the past few years.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s double the size of the other advertised Serums.  </li>
            <li> I read other viewers had the same redness experience</li>
            <li> and I will be using it and recommending it for a long time to come!</li>
            <li> The size of the bottle, larger than other serums, is also a plus.</li>
            <li> &gt; Instead of hydrating, my skin feels a little dry after using this product and I see no other results.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using the Vitamin C Serum very long</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this for very long but already I can tell a difference in the way my skin feels.  </li>
            <li> After using the Vitamin C Serum and Fig Oil all the dry patches are gone and I have glowing skin with the smallest pores I have ever had.  </li>
            <li> Cleanse your face, pat dry, use just nickel size amount of the Vitamin C Serum from Poppy Austin¬Æ on your face and neck, let it absorb for a couple minutes, and then moisturize and soon you will start seeing your skin texture</li>
            <li> I used it on my face after getting out of the shower, let it dry, followed it up</li>
            <li> It did not help to fade my age spots and took a while to dry before I could apply my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My face feels so soft and pores are getting smaller little by little</li>
            <li> I am currently overseas and the water here dried up my face really bad and have used all kind of soaps and cream, lotion with no luck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week or two now but I am dark skinned with hyper pigmentation issues</li>
            <li> I have dark spots from acne and in a short time this serum has faded them!</li>
            <li> I have used the Vitamin C Serum for the last two weeks and have noticed fading of dark spots.</li>
            <li> and my face is less dry even if I only use the serum once a day.</li>
            <li> Therefore, since a little goes a long way and I feel that you definitely get your money&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Well i&#x27;ve only used for about a week and a half, but i am noticing my skin</li>
            <li> It is the same strength but twice the size for less.  </li>
            <li> In less than 2 weeks, I feel that I can see a difference in the overall feel and look of my skin.</li>
            <li> The reason I had purchased it was because I felt like those areas were very de-hydrated looking, making my eyes look tired and dry.  </li>
            <li> I even had a little bit of peeling, but that could have been because me starting to test it with Retin</li>
            <li> for 12 hours with my skin feeling so soft, supple, and feeling great!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s almost hard to believe the amount of serum you&#x27;re getting, thank you Poppy</li>
            <li> But what I really love is my ugly brown spot are lightening up.</li>
            <li> Since I was late doing this, I haven&#x27;t seen any real improvement on my face,but plan to keep using it until I think it&#x27;s a waste of time.</li>
            <li> I have spent a fortune on \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; creams, lotions, serums, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also has absolutely no smell, no tingle, no color.</li>
            <li> Now I know a bunch of you out there use face serums and creams and have absolutely no clue what you are putting on your face.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not delivered to Perth WA for reasons unknown ....?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it nearly everyday for several months now and think its working?</li>
            <li> After using this for just a few days, my skin totally rejuvenated and cleared.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product a few days, but already see a difference.  </li>
            <li> I hate trying so many different products that promise results.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a plain vitamin C serum, this contains jojoba which I discovered I&#x27;m allergic to after only using once.</li>
            <li> I seriously cannot see a difference once my makeup is on (which I believe is only in my head) because I can definitely tell a difference at night after my cleansing...</li>
            <li> The oily areas have smaller pores with less oil production and less breakouts.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when opening the new bottle I received as I just finished the last one I had purchased earlier in the year they were not the same they don&#x27;t look the same they don&#x27;t feel the samehave you reformulated the product from earlier in the year</li>
            <li> you wont&#x27;t be disappointed :)</li>
            <li> I will not need to try or buy any other brands or skincare.  </li>
            <li> Too soon to see any other results but will continue to use it..</li>
            <li> I use it every other night</li>
            <li> I doesn&#x27;t cause burning like the other vitamin c product.</li>
            <li> I will continue to order Poppy Austin vitamin c as well as their other products.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try other products from the Poppy Austin line.</li>
            <li> And yes this works like any other product; if you stop using it then your lines will &#x27;re-appear&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> No glow, no smoothness; nothing like the other reviews.</li>
            <li> my skin is not as &amp;#34;congested&amp;#34; as with other products.</li>
            <li> One other thing I like about this product is that it also has Hyaluronic acid which helps my skin feel</li>
            <li> It is twice the size of other brands.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily and acne-prone skin</li>
            <li> I for a year I noticed numerous small colorless to whitish bumps on my skin which I believe are my oil glands.</li>
            <li> ive ordered all the other products so will update  melchor</li>
            <li> am thinking there may be other places on my body that I may see if some improvement can be found from Poppy Austin Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> I have used another brand of Vit C serum in the past that felt different and from which I saw no visible results.</li>
            <li> I will try some other too.</li>
            <li> I will be trying other Poppy Austin products soon.</li>
            <li> After the end of the week all the dead dry skin came off.</li>
            <li> I received 2 oz for less than I&#x27;ve paid for 1 oz of other brands.  </li>
            <li> Helps with overall looks of my complexion, the lines under my eyes are hardly visable and the bags are gone.</li>
            <li> BUT, I had to return the ROSEWATER, for some reason the scent was foul, maybe I got a bad one, but this VITAMIN c is fantastic,</li>
            <li> My dark spot remains.</li>
            <li> Do you have age spots, wrinkles, or dark under eye circles.</li>
            <li> My skin is brighter and the dark circles under my eyes are diminished.</li>
            <li> That and the product comes in a serum form in a dark bottle with a droplet in order to help it for oxidizing and bacteria.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but I actually really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I appreciate that the bottle is dark to preserve the integrity of the product.  </li>
            <li> This serum has organic ingredients like Jojoba Oil for moisture, and vegan Hyaluronic Acid to fight wrinkles, age spots, and even dark circles.</li>
            <li> have noticed after just 4 days use of this product that the dark cercal under my eyes have started to lessen.</li>
            <li> have tried a LOT of ways to reduce lines and dark spots on my face but nothing worked.</li>
            <li> Using this serum makes me want to try their other products, I am hooked!</li>
            <li> My dark patches are still there, but slightly less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I usually have oily combination skin, that&#x27;s prone to breakouts and since using these two products I haven&#x27;t had a single blemish.</li>
            <li> I also have severe dark under eye circles due to my pale complexion and the structure of my eye socket and this has helped helped make it not as severe looking.</li>
            <li> I left the other ounce in the original bottle in my fridge to retard spoilage.</li>
            <li> my normal-to-dry skin feels and looks less &amp;#34;used</li>
            <li> My face, however, is brighter and the lines appear to be less noticeable.</li>
            <li> but it disappear less than a week.  </li>
            <li> I did not have any of the previous reviewers burning sensation.</li>
            <li> The lines on my forehead and around my mouth seem to be less noticeable as well.</li>
            <li> and I think it is too soon to make any comments; less than one week.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed my complexion is smoother, and less blotchy.  </li>
            <li> My redness has been reduced, scars seem less noticeable, and my face just looks brighter and newer.  </li>
            <li> so I went to the health store for the argan oil and paid half fhe price.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be easier to apply and takes less than a minute to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used almost half of my 2 oz.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit thinner than what I&#x27;m used to, but half a syringe does my face, neck, d√©colletage and hands.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this particular Vitamin C serum.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t sting when you use it on your face like others I have purchased, tend to do and it makes your face feel tight after it dries.</li>
            <li> but my skin felt a little tight.</li>
            <li> I use this together with a product called Black Diamond Skin Serum and add a few drops of copper peptide twice a day.  </li>
            <li> but the little one I have no change.</li>
            <li> A little goes along</li>
            <li> Can get a little flaky when it dries, but I mix it with a little moisturizer, which seems to do the trick.</li>
            <li> Just received this and have been using faithfully for a little over a week.</li>
            <li> The other ones are so small that I used it rather stingily.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t go through dark phase!</li>
            <li> It clears my complexion and with the little bit of acid</li>
            <li> The product is dispensed with a little dropper, and I tended to use 5-6 drops.  </li>
            <li> This serum has little to no effect that I can see.</li>
            <li> When I was younger, I was never good with applying sunscreen and would end up with some pretty bad burns.</li>
            <li> Have used for a few weeks now and appears to be a dud.</li>
            <li> I like how this goes on as compared to a few others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> You use the dropper to place a few drops of the serum on your fingertips and work it into your face</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> Also comes with a money back guarantee if your not happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I can see the difference in my skin just after a few days of using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I noticed some redness reducing and skin looking a bit fresher, and now that I have been using this for a few weeks</li>
            <li> In fact, a few may be getting this in their stockings this Christmas...</li>
            <li> I got the product a few days ago.</li>
            <li> &amp; I noticed results after a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Thinner serums are usually watered down, so thicker serums are a plus.</li>
            <li> It also adsorbs well into the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave it sticky, greasy or just plain</li>
            <li> No strong scent.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;ve used my Retin-A Micro products (Rx) regularly in the past, the improvement is relatively dramatic.</li>
            <li> I ordered Poppy Austin specifically after reviewing their because of their commitment to raw beauty and their initiative in Morocco.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only use this product a few days and not happy with the results!  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it is supposed to be a water-like consistency, but it is.</li>
            <li> Since using this for the past 7-8 months, I&#x27;ve noticed a lot of my hyperpigmentation has improved.</li>
            <li> there is no foul smell like vitamin C serum I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s helping.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually leave reviews about things purchased , but felt like I had to tell the truth about this product....</li>
            <li> Usually can&#x27;t put oils on my face</li>
            <li> Not sure if that helps or not.</li>
            <li> have irritated my skin in the past.  </li>
            <li> unfortunately, this did the same.</li>
            <li> Produced in the US freshly in small batches.</li>
            <li> I noticed an improvement in small blemishes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I will repurchase or reccomend the c serum yet.</li>
            <li> I decanted an ounce into a small dropper bottle I have, where it&#x27;s stored in my medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure if this one measures up.</li>
            <li> Brightened my dull skin.</li>
            <li> And I can relax knowing I&#x27;m using high quality ingredients without the worry of additives, fillers, or any artificial ingredients that could be toxic to my health!</li>
            <li> Once you try Vitamin C Serum, you&#x27;ll probably wonder why you didn&#x27;t start using it sooner...or at least that&#x27;s the case for me...</li>
            <li> If it does, then it&#x27;s happening so slowly that I don&#x27;t notice.  </li>
            <li> and it is a slow process</li>
            <li> Wasted money!!</li>
            <li> Looking for less expensive skin tightners.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how it has lessened those annoying lines near my eyes and the ones appearing across my forehead.</li>
            <li> Due to the severe cold weather this winter, this was delivered frozen and leaking out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a tough container.</li>
            <li> UNBELIEVABLE!!  </li>
            <li> I have broken out all over my face.  </li>
            <li> I had a bad experience with other vit c products, but this one is a keeper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had bad acne, but have always had a few breakouts and always a couple pimples here and there.</li>
            <li> It is also not an antioxidant so it won&#x27;t expire or go bad in a few months.  </li>
            <li> this stuff makes your face hard!!</li>
            <li> Ill find something else.</li>
            <li> but after I went to basic &amp; started working graveshift hours in the hospital my face was just in awful condition.</li>
            <li> I compared it to costlier versions that were not organic and contained the infamous hydraulic acid.</li>
            <li> and was trying desperately to get rid of them.  </li>
            <li> No sensitivity or unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I remember applying my make up for Easter and couldn&#x27;t believe how bad my complexion looked.  </li>
            <li> which is what I needed so badly.  </li>
            <li> but I am a believer, beauty is painful, sometimes.</li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed in any Poppy Austin product I have purchased.</li>
            <li> but I was extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not wearing any face makeup, i.e. Foundation, base.  </li>
            <li> Do you hate having  acne or age spots?</li>
            <li> I used to have bad acne that resulted in terrible scarring.  </li>
            <li> to  say  because  my skin  is very  bad  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed with the product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this.stuff.is.awesome.love.it. i purchased the Barbary fig oil, by Poppy Austin, awhile back and was hooked instantly. I wanted to try the rest of the products so I would have a better idea of what a difference the product might make. I have not been disappointed. I&#x27;m purchasing my second bottle of the vitamin c now, because i was so impressed with the results, I just had to let my mom try it so I gave her the bottle I had. honestly I don&#x27;t have one negative comment about the entire line of face care Poppy Austin offers. I&#x27;ve been using the line for about 4 months now, and it has done wonders for the fine lines and wrinkles, evened out my skin tone, and has given this maturing face a more youthful look that I haven&#x27;t had in many moons. hope this helps in deciding on your purchase. you wont&#x27;t be disappointed :)</li>
            <li> Im using it right now since Nov 2014 the first bottle and Im almost done with it but I think will not rebuy it this time. Ill find something else. I really didnt see any notable change in my 61 year old face. So off I go find something else. My dark spot remains. I dont have so many fine lines but the little one I have no change.</li>
            <li> I did not see any difference i my face.</li>
            <li> I ordered this serum for the amount of vitamin C it contains. It goes on easily and I have had only a minor amount of flaky skin on my chin. I have mature combination/ leaning towards oily skin. I have received compliments since I&#x27;ve been using it for less than a month about how nice my skin looks. I would order this again because I&#x27;ve had good results and it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li> that best for my face, special help to control acne</li>
            <li> Received pretty quick and have been pleased so far with this product.</li>
            <li> So far this is by far the best one yet and I intend to order other products. Have used many expensive things and I love this</li>
            <li> makes skin look smoother  feels good  very pure</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m at the stage where I&#x27;m willing to try almost any magic elixir in hopes of making a dent (or rather smoothing some dents) in my aging skin.  This is the first serum I&#x27;ve tried that has actually made a difference. My skin is definitely more hydrated, and when I wake up in the morning it&#x27;s both soft and sort of &amp;#34;plumped&amp;#34; up. Fewer wrinkles around the eyes &amp; no irritation for my rosacea. This is a product I&#x27;ll stick with.</li>
            <li> Purchased the vitamin C serum and also the Rosehip oil. Entirely happy with service and delivery. And really pleased with the products themselves. Quality products and value for money. I will definitely be purchasing these goods again, although very tempted to purchase the argan oil next time. Also love the fact that Poppy Austin gives a percentage of the profit to a wonderful charity. Well done everyone. Please keep up the good work.</li>
            <li> love  this serum..makes my pores look so tiny</li>
            <li> Delivery was really quick and I love this product! My skin already seems to be feeling and looking better, only 2 days into using this Poppy Austin Vitamin C combined with their Rose Water.</li>
            <li> This is just soooo nice to use, I have not noticed a difference yet but it has only been a few days, am very happy so far.</li>
            <li> Very gentle and fresh. Love vitamin c for my face</li>
            <li> I started using Poppy Austin recently and am very happy with results and the product.  Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Yes , I am a repeat customer and will repeat again and again.  Love this product and what it does for my 68 yr. old complexion.  I have had younger ladies ask me what I am using on my face.  Wish I could use it on my whole body!  Anyway, as long as it is able to make a difference on my aging face I will continue to use this product.  I use this together with a product called Black Diamond Skin Serum and add a few drops of copper peptide twice a day.  Thank you Poppy Austin for a fine, reasonably priced product.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love it!!  in combination with Hylaronic acid serum and Diva Cream.  After three weeks of applying in the a.m. and p.m. noticed a great improvement in  my complexion and facial wrinkles!!! I have tried so many topical serums to help with wrinkles and complexion that didn&#x27;t help but I will definitely be reordering the Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li> I absolutely am in love with this serum.  I was doing some research for a new serum and came upon this.  Read the reviews and saw the video on this serum and decided to give it a try.......I am hooked.  This serum leaves my skin soft and the fine lines on my face are less noticeable......and it&#x27;s only been a week of usage.  Poppy Austin is now my new and only favorite skincare.  I have so much faith in the brand, that went back and ordered the other products.  This is now my skincare regimen, in this order after cleansing.....Rose Water, Vitamin C, Rosehip Oil and the Barbary Fig Oil.  And I follow this regimen twice a day.  My skin is now soft and dewy with less lines. I will not need to try or buy any other brands or skincare.  Once I love something, I am loyal to it....so I will love Poppy Austin for life!  Please continue to sell your products!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Best bang for my buck.&amp;#34; I use a cotton ball to apply on my face. This is my first time using a vitamin c serum, and I love it. My skin feels amazing.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product. This is my second ordered bottle. Can&#x27;t be without it, makes my skin feel hydrated and soft, which helps to diminish those fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this product, it is so economical. I have spent a fortune on \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; creams, lotions, serums, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> I received this two weeks ago, and have added it to my daily beauty routine. I can&#x27;t test the product to see how much of it really is Vit C and hyaluronic acid, but what I can tell you is this;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It goes on smooth and is almost completely odor free,&lt;br /&gt;2. it helps my daily moisturizer absorb faster into my skin,&lt;br /&gt;3. it actually acts as a great base for my eye make-up,&lt;br /&gt;4. my normal-to-dry skin feels and looks less &amp;#34;used up&amp;#34; at the end of the day,&lt;br /&gt;5, I&#x27;m highly freckled, but my overall skintone is brighter and clearer, and I&#x27;ve stopped having to use foundation under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the best part, I have normal skin with no blemish problems or wrinkles to speak of, but my husband  (patchy-dry skin, prone to breakouts) started using it everyday for his crows&#x27; feet and forehead lines, and he&#x27;s been blemish free since the third day, his skin looks more moisturized and perhaps in time his deep lines may begin to look better as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll just have to wait longer and see...!</li>
            <li> Love love love it, it absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.  leaves skin feeling soft and firm and fabulous!</li>
            <li> Very light and easy to apply</li>
            <li> It goes on so nice. Soaks in, leaving a smooth soft finish. It hasn&#x27;t bothered my sensitive skin either. Well done</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a couple of weeks, so, I don&#x27;t expect any major results yet. But, it doesn&#x27;t stink or sting. My face feels very soft after applying it.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with the customer service and the delivery of my order on time as well as the purity and natural production process to produce this product. I am 100% satisfied. Thank you for all you do.</li>
            <li> Feels and smells nice.  No irritation.</li>
            <li> Its great. . Love it not sticky n leaves my face feeling smooth.. it helps with my pigmentation leaving my face looking bright..</li>
            <li> I started using this product for about two weeks, I&#x27;m expecting to see great results. I&#x27;ve watched their video on YouTube and am following instructions for greater results. I&#x27;m noticing some change already. I expect to review it again reporting how good it&#x27;s done to my skin!</li>
            <li> more snake oil.,.....</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE THIS STUFF!!  My skin is so much softer and smoother.  This is a repeat purchase.  I apply the serum first and then apply my moisturizer.  My skin feels so good after I apply the serum that I sometime forget to apply my moisturizer.  You don&#x27;t need much and it absorbs quickly with no greasy or oily residue.  My skin just looks wonderful.</li>
            <li> Far better than any other Vitamin C serum I have tried. Love it. Higher percentage of vitamin C for less $ than any others. I will be a repeat customer. Speedy shipping, also. Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is supposed to be a water-like consistency, but it is. Also has absolutely no smell, no tingle, no color. Sometimes I wonder if this is just water in a bottle..</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Great product.</li>
            <li> This is my third order of this product.  Needless to say I am so happy with the results.  The first time I applied it (and consequently every time) there was a tightness I felt likened to a face mask.  I&#x27;ve received comments from friends who have noticed the lift to my otherwise drooping face.  I have been recommending the product whenever I get a chance.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my second order of this product. Love the effect I see after I use it, specially for a guy&#x27;s skin. Definitely I&#x27;d buy it again and recommend.</li>
            <li> This has been working so awesome</li>
            <li> This vitamin c serum is wonderful. Goes on very silky and absorbs quickly in the skin. I use this every night and it keeps my skin nice and dewy</li>
            <li> Very happy with the Vitamin C Serum. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and can feel the difference in my skin texture already. This product is scent free and I&#x27;ve not had any adverse reaction to it.</li>
            <li> This is a,great product. A lot of people do not know the benifits of vitamin C&lt;br /&gt;Serum. and this company gives,you twice as much at the same price as other&lt;br /&gt;resources.  Poppy Austin also includes hyaluronic which many do not. This&lt;br /&gt;works especially well when your moisturizers has the same ingredient.</li>
            <li> I like the feel on my face.  I have seen very little positive results, but I&#x27;ll continue using it before making a final decision.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin look brighter and feels so smooth. Too soon to see any other results but will continue to use it..</li>
            <li> I wish I could get more info about using it with retinol</li>
            <li> All I can say is I literally look 10 years younger and this stuff completely resolved my forming frown lines, crows feet, neck lines, etc. etc.  I&#x27;m 31 years old and a male.  I just bought another one for when this runs out but realized this bottle will easily last me 6-8 months.  This should be in everyone&#x27;s vanity bag, its vitamin C for your face!!</li>
            <li> It is a little too early to write a review, since I only have used the product about 2 weeks. So far I have not seen any change in my skin, but I like the product.</li>
            <li> This is a must! It has a 20% vitamin C concentration. This is worth the buy.</li>
            <li> Love this serum!  Has helped reduce my lines on my forehead.  Awesome product!</li>
            <li> Lovely product; I have been using this for just over 2 weeks now, and my skin looks brighter and feels smoother. So far am really enjoying the experience, and look forward to improved results over time. Really good product and I would definately recommend.</li>
            <li> Lovely oil doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and makes it look more translucent and younger.</li>
            <li> I use it every other night and I have seen no results yet.</li>
            <li> Works amazing on wrinkles</li>
            <li> Everybody who is anybody from the Red Carpet, Dr. Oz, Oprah and Cinder Crawford&#x27;s secret ingredient in her creme de serum, if you&#x27;ve paid enough attention you&#x27;d know the key to shaving 10-15 even 20 years off your age is mixing 2 ingredients together, hyaluronic acid serum and vitamin c serum and the best thing, it dosent cost an arm and a leg, I&#x27;ve found the purest and cheapest on amazon.com mixed them together a little stronger and in 2 weeks time, UNBELIEVABLE!!  No need to sell it, photos say it all!  sincerely, Treva Windham turning 50 this yearüòÉ</li>
            <li> i think most reviews must be fake... i don&#x27;t see it working</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product. LOVE how it has made my skin look and feel. Definitely a noticeable difference. I had some healing acne spots and this serum made the areas heal faster and the redness disappear faster. Fantastic product, fantastic price.</li>
            <li> After just a few weeks, my skin is smoother, fine wrinkles reduced, and dark circles lightened. My skin is sensitive, so I was worried about a reaction, but I have had no adverse reactions to it. I like it and will continue buying it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 weeks and can see the difference it is making on my age spots and fine lines.  I will definitely purchase this product again!</li>
            <li> Great stuff, haven&#x27;t been using it long, but I can already see some improvement.  After applying the serum I put some coconut oil on my face &amp; neck.  Enjoy</li>
            <li> I waited to review this product until I&#x27;d been using it a while.  It is NOT a miracle, but I really like what it is doing for my skin and I will buy it again when I run out.  I&#x27;m nearly 64 years old and have been abusing my skin with unprotected gardening for the past few years.  Brown spots, lines, you name it.  Using this Vitamin C Serum daily has really helped my skin both look and feel better.  I think my moisturizer is better absorbed with the Vitamin C used first.  I can imagine that someone who is diligent about taking care of their skin would get even better results.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Poppy Austin (PA) products! I bought the Vitamin C serum when I read by a dermatologist that she can always tell when one of her patients is using Vitamin C on their skin. After about a week of using PA Vitamin C Serum, my skin is brighter and smoother! I use PA Argan Oil at night in combination with PA Vitamin C Serum and I get comments constantly about my skin being beautiful! Glass bottles too!</li>
            <li> All I can say at this point is I do like the way It feels on my face. we will see if it makes a difference in a month or so. If it does, I will come back and update this review.</li>
            <li> Best vitamin c product I have ever tried! Brightens completion. Improves skin tone.</li>
            <li> I received  it and  started using  it  straight  away . But @the moment  I don&#x27;t  see  any  difference  may  be  it&#x27;s  too early  to  say  because  my skin  is very  bad  but  I  m gona  use  it  if  I  see any  changes  I ll write  a review  again I  m giving very  low  rating  as I bought  this  item  after  reading  all the reviews  and ratings  I don&#x27;t  know  others  experiences are  different  but I m writing  what  ever  I have  noticed  with  my skin  so far</li>
            <li> I just received Poppy Austin Vitamin C Serum for Face and my serum is clear. I saw on a different photo that the serum was milky in color. Which is it supposed to be...clear or milky???</li>
            <li> Highly reccommend this company.  All of the items have been of superior quality.  I particularly appreciate the simple label, it looks clean and professional.</li>
            <li> Gives consistently beautiful results.</li>
            <li> Great product! I had a bad experience with other vit c products, but this one is a keeper. Absorbs fast and already seeing improvement on my acne marks, discoloration and scars. Love it!</li>
            <li> Product appears to be working with blemishes quite well.  I am sure we will continue to keep using this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 3 weeks, but I didn&#x27;t see any result, nor does it keep the skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> Very smooth and non greasy. Nice product.</li>
            <li> The best serum I&#x27;ve ever used! I&#x27;m 52 years old and have always taken good care of my skin. I bought this product based on the reviews and I have been so delighted! The biggest differences I&#x27;ve noticed are a reduction in pore size, increased hydration and suppleness. I&#x27;m on my second bottle and plan to continue to use. Highly, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have been using Poppy Austins Argon oil for two years now, and have had nothing but positive results, with product and company. Just recently started using the Vitamin C and Fig Oil. Love them both!! Thank you for your wonderful products!!!!</li>
            <li> Love the vitamin c serum, I use it with the eye cream and the Barbary fig seed oil.What amazing results my skin has never looked better</li>
            <li> Cannot say enough about this product, I love it! Truly brightens my face, neck and lightens the freckles on my chest (I use it in the morning and before bedtime). I have noticed a huge improvement in my skin, this is a staple now.</li>
            <li> Love this!!  I seriously cannot see a difference once my makeup is on (which I believe is only in my head) because I can definitely tell a difference at night after my cleansing...AND, I can tell a difference when I look at recent photos taken of me.  I use it on my chest, as well as hands along with the Poppy Austin Argon Oil, which is also the bomb!  I notice no smell whatsoever with either.  The value was fabulous.  I received 2 oz for less than I&#x27;ve paid for 1 oz of other brands.  Will buy again!</li>
            <li> The only thing I put on my face am/pm (other than the occasional spritz of witch hazel). After about 3-4 weeks I noticed a difference in my skin. I had a healthy glow that other people started to compliment. I am a huge Poppy Austin fan now. Awesome job with your product line!</li>
            <li> Perfection in a bottle. I wash my face with Clarisonic and this. A must to read about Vit C oil and skin effects...reduced lines by morning and so sft this comfination. Just initiated this in addition to Vit C , Rose Hips and finally completing the process to Fig oil. Great company, organic, cold pressed.</li>
            <li> Love the slightly thicker consistency than some other VitC serums, it doesnt run away through your fingers. Feels lovely and moisturising, have&#x27;nt used it long enough yet to tell if it does anything long term.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Poppy Austin Vitamin C Serum. I happened to get a hydro facial just before I received my serum in the mail. My face is so smooth and clear . My skin looks and feels youthful. I just love this stuff and I will NOT go without it. Shipped was unbelievably quick, I was surprised how fast. Thank You Poppy Austin.</li>
            <li> i did not like the product</li>
            <li> Great product &amp; speedy delivery!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a couple weeks, I don&#x27;t really see much difference. It may work for others but not my favorite Poppy product.</li>
            <li> it is ok and it works</li>
            <li> I am still using it and hoping it will erase some of the sun damage I have done over the years. My face, however, is brighter and the lines appear to be less noticeable. I am liking this product but not sure if I love it. I doesn&#x27;t cause burning like the other vitamin c product. That is a plus but I am a believer, beauty is painful, sometimes.</li>
            <li> Thank u so much love the stuff ***</li>
            <li> LOVE, love, love! I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a week and I can already notice big changes in my skin! It&#x27;s a bonus that a portion of my purchase goes to help others. And I can relax knowing I&#x27;m using high quality ingredients without the worry of additives, fillers, or any artificial ingredients that could be toxic to my health! I will be re-filling when needed.</li>
            <li> Large 2oz bottle.  It feels nice on my skin.  I&#x27;m an anti-ager this product will do the trick</li>
            <li> It brightens and tightens ... Great Product</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any results with this product.  I bought this product on sale and unfortunately have not see any improvement in my fine wrinkles or skin tone.  Its first two ingredients is herb; infusion and aloe.  If you have ever pull aloe on your face that is what the product feels like, a little tight but makes no difference over all to fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li> As far as I can see, this does nothing for the appearance of facial skin. Have used for a few weeks now and appears to be a dud. Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> this stuff makes your face hard!! never buy this again</li>
            <li> Arrived as described.  First Vitamin C product I&#x27;ve tried, definitely improved skin texture.</li>
            <li> This did not improve my skin condition.</li>
            <li> See brighter skin quickly with the use of this twice a day. A little goes a long way. Vi make my own moisturizer and this is an important ingredient.  All natural and sellers are fantastic</li>
            <li> OK I received the serum quickly. Next the product has been amazing. I can see the difference in my tone and pores. I&#x27;m using it with coconut oil. If you are on the fence about this product don&#x27;t be buy it its great!</li>
            <li> I adore this!  It is just plain NICE.  Easy to use, feels great and absorbs so easily!!</li>
            <li> Real fast good service. I have been using the product for a couple of days and my skin feels better already!</li>
            <li> I have used this for about a week.  My skin feels softer. It will possibly take some time before noticeable reduction of lines.</li>
            <li> It¬¥s too watery, you can hardly put it on your face, it evaporates quickly</li>
            <li> this product has really improved my skin tone</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a difference of fine lines on my face.I feel like this product is overrated.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I love the fact that it is made with love and pure organic products and it feels wonderful on my skin.  I will definitely buy this product again.  Thank you Poppy Austin.</li>
            <li> I just received this but the feel on my skin is amazing.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. I have been using now for just a couple weeks and I can see a difference in the clarity and texture of my skin already. I am looking forward to trying more products from this provider as soon as I use use up some of the products I have. Rose water toner is next I believe</li>
            <li> Excellent product,pure.&lt;br /&gt;Promprt service</li>
            <li> Great product!  Easy to use and really  works!</li>
            <li> Like it so far and it has no smell</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t leave sticky feeling. I use it all over my face, neck and chest twice a day. Plus it&#x27;s fabulously organic.</li>
            <li> Great product. Tightens skin and smooths facial lines</li>
            <li> great product, great service at a very good price. My daughters and I all love Poppy Austin.</li>
            <li> Just a few days into using, I&#x27;ve read good reviews so I know I wil olve it.</li>
            <li> I like how this goes on as compared to a few others I&#x27;ve tried.  As to whether it does anything .... well who knows.  If it does, then it&#x27;s happening so slowly that I don&#x27;t notice.  I&#x27;ll keep using it and keep hoping.  Maybe when I&#x27;m 98, I&#x27;ll only look 97 :)</li>
            <li> was very pleased with this product. will order this again</li>
            <li> I decided to try this serum on my very sensitive skin. I just love it. I have tried many things without success because of the sensitivity issue.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend trying this lovely serum. No scent, iight as a feather and absorbs in seconds.</li>
            <li> Awesome product it leaves skin soft &amp; smooth. Great purchase ! Thx !</li>
            <li> So far so good for I&#x27;m using it regularly - reallymore so since my dermatologist recommended the use of Vitamin C oil.  I&#x27;m almost to the place of re-ordering a bottle!</li>

Thank You for reading my Review of Vitamin C Serum by Poppy Austin.  Jerri Davis</li>
            <li> This product really works nicely, no redness (if you are sensitive to products like me), and I have reordered this, which says a lot in itself, thank you for a great product.</li>
            <li> Very light weight. Does not leave face feeling greasy. I love it. Will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Only gave 4 stars because just start using it on 6/13/15. Like the way it tighten the skin and overall feels good.  I use twice a day and only top with moisture cream at night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a vitamin C serum before, but have read about the serum online, and wanted to give it a try. I did a bit of research and decided to order a bottle of Poppy Austin&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Vitamin C serum, with hyaluronic acid, is a light-weight, non-greasy formula. It comes in a generous 2 fluid ounce bottle with dropper. You use the dropper to place a few drops of the serum on your fingertips and work it into your face where needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Poppy Austin Vitamin C Serum twice a day; in the morning after I get out of the shower, and at night after I wash my face right before going to bed. Although the formula is light enough to use on your entire face, I concentrate on the areas of my neck, upper lip and under eye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is Hyaluronic Acid the Fountain of Youth?&lt;br /&gt;I turned 50 last year, so I&#x27;m not getting any younger. Although I have oily skin, certain areas of my face are starting to show a bit of fine lines. So now I&#x27;m on the quest to find that mysterious youth elixir to &#x27;turn back the hands of time.&#x27; Web MD says that &amp;#34;some people apply hyaluronic acid to the skin for healing wounds, burns, skin ulcers, and as a moisturizer.&amp;#34; So maybe it really is the magic elixir found in the fountain of youth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this vitamin c serum and will probably try out some of the other items in the Poppy Austin beauty product line.</li>
            <li> I receive more compliments on my complection then I ever did before.</li>
            <li> This was a very nice Vitamin C serum and absorbed quickly into my skin.  It didn&#x27;t run all over my hands getting it out of the dropper.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Vitamin C Serum with Hyaluronic Acid for three weeks and am amazed at reduction of the size of pores on my face. I have tried many many products and none have given me the results of this serum used in conjunction with Poppy Austin Barbary Seed Fig Oil.  I had suffered an allergic reaction to something which resulted in hives under my eyes and ultimately skin that looked like leather in several places....I remember applying my make up for Easter and couldn&#x27;t believe how bad my complexion looked.  After using the Vitamin C Serum and Fig Oil all the dry patches are gone and I have glowing skin with the smallest pores I have ever had.  I suffered from acne as a young adult and continue to be prone to occasional breakouts.  I was somewhat concerned that the Fig Oil could cause breakouts.  I am glad to report that this is not the case..  Love, love these products!</li>
            <li> This IS my favorite serum! I will be buying again soon.</li>
            <li> using it now makes my face feel good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using vitamin c serums for a long time.  First time using Poppy Austin and I must say this is the best!!!  I will continue to order Poppy Austin vitamin c as well as their other products.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for about 3 weeks and really like it. I can get congested pores from creams and serums so trying anything new is always an experiement. I have not had issues with this serum and see that my skin seems tighter and smoother. I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 5 months, it seems to be working</li>
            <li> I do like it after using it for 2 weeks now.  First it doesn&#x27;t break you out or dry your skin. No smell noted.  I noticed a brightening of my skin with using it 2x a day - one in the morning and one at night.  No changes though in age spot but 2 weeks is kind of short to see.  Absorbed pretty quickly without any sticky residue.  Will update and see if there&#x27;s any changes with the age spot and acne scars on face.</li>
            <li> great price in comparison to other brands which advertise to do the same thing</li>
            <li> Easily absorbed serum that sits well under moisturizer or BB cream.</li>
            <li> This serum has a wonderful silky texture.  It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly leaving a sightly tight feel.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other Vitamin C Serums and have in fact made my own ; however , they were all a bit drying for my skin texture.&lt;br /&gt;The addition of the hyaluronic acid is giving added hydration, the silky texture and is plumping up my skin cells.&lt;br /&gt;In a short amount of time the Poppy Austin serum has been giving me excellent results.  My skin appears lighter and brighter.&lt;br /&gt;In addition, I have noticed the visible reduction of some very fine lines.  I am extremely pleased so far with the results of this product and&lt;br /&gt;will highly recommend its use.  Thank You</li>
            <li> Truly a better more superior product at a better price. I have not been disappointed in any Poppy Austin product I have purchased. The eye creme is fantastic as is the vitamin c. My latest purchase is the fig moisturizer. Im looking forward to it arriving.</li>
            <li> Didnt do a thing for me that I could tell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this morning and night since July 2014. I am 26 years old with very fair skin. When I was younger, I was never good with applying sunscreen and would end up with some pretty bad burns. For the past 5 years, I have been much better with avoiding sunburns or too much exposure to sunlight. However, I have noticed some hyperpigmentation, including a couple age spots and lasting freckles. I&#x27;ve never had bad acne, but have always had a few breakouts and always a couple pimples here and there. I had never used a vitamin C serum before trying Poppy Austin&#x27;s. Within a few days, I noticed I wasn&#x27;t getting any new pimples. It completely cleared my skin. It was smoother and softer and more radiant. I honestly felt like my skin was glowing. Since using this for the past 7-8 months, I&#x27;ve noticed a lot of my hyperpigmentation has improved. I still have some &amp;#34;age spots&amp;#34; and little fine lines under my eyes (which I believe are simply genetic) but they have definitely improved. I also have severe dark under eye circles due to my pale complexion and the structure of my eye socket and this has helped helped make it not as severe looking. I feel that I look more awake! I initially bought this for it&#x27;s great price and since it comes in a 2 oz bottle. I have bought it 2 more times since and plan to continue using it twice a day. I&#x27;ve also recommended it to my mom who is 60 and she loves it!</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with a Vitamin C serum, but I&#x27;m glad to report that I really enjoyed Poppy Austin&#x27;s serum. This bottle is very large in comparison to the other ones I saw online when shopping. About twice the amount, actually! The dropper is very effective.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a money back guarantee, so they&#x27;re confident in their product. I loved that this product is not tested on animals, as animals are very close to my heart.&lt;br /&gt;There are several anti-aging benefits (wrinkle reduction, age spots, etc, ), but I have rather troublesome dark circles that I was excited to learn this serum could help. My skin already appears brighter and I intend to make it a regular part of my beauty routine.</li>
            <li> Very Large bottle. Goes on smoothly...makes face feel amazing. Works as well as the tiny $80 bottles of serum! Will purchase more!</li>
            <li> Great serum for the face. Easy apply on, feels like oil. Feels great on, I use it at night time, let it do its thing in my sleep. I noticed a difference after a month. But you start to get low on the bottle. Works great though. I have sensitive skin so it worked good for me.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using the Vitamin C Serum very long but it does feel as if it is tightening my skin.  I think it will take a little while to see real results.  Guess I should take a before and after picture.  I have aging skin, I&#x27;m 68, and need some help!  I love the fact that it&#x27;s in a dark, glass bottle and it&#x27;s double the size of the other advertised Serums.  Also I only want to put pure ingredients on my skin so I&#x27;m really pleased with your product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for caring.</li>
            <li> Received this product 2 days ago and very quickly. I like the bottle and dropper it came it, the dark glass bottle helps keep the product good for a long time. I  started applying it before bedtime. My face and neck feel much better. It has a good scent! After a week&#x27;s used I will update my review on how well it has improved my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have been applying it for a few months and my skin is looking great. Never in my life my pores  were minimized that way. My friends want to use it also. In my last purchase I bought one for a friend. Thank you for this great product. I combine it with Poppy Austin argan oil and is a winner combo!!!</li>
            <li> so far this is a very lovely vitamin C serum. my face feels smoother and just one weekend seems to have a glow. there is no foul smell like vitamin C serum I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> So far it has been great for my face it makes it feel tight and smooth .I will order again.</li>
            <li> I love trying new beauty products and I am always looking for the ONE that will make my skin nice and healthy looking. Well recently I was asked to review Vitamin C Serum by Poppy Austin. I know I have told you all how you should add a vitamin C Serum to your beauty routine, I have and I don&#x27;t regret it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that this Vitamin C Serum by Poppy Austin is made from naturally derived and organic ingredients. Highly concentrated with pure vegan Hyaluronic Acid and deeply moisturizing JoJoba Oil and is naturally free from paragons, fillers, alcohol, artificial colors and fragrances. It tackles those fine lines and age spots and dark under eye circles providing instant hydration. The Vitamin C Serum is a natural way to firm and smooth aged skin by stimulating collagen and neutralizing free radicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fresh scent it has. It was easy to apply and absorbed into my skin right away! I loved how it made my skin so soft. I suffer from Eczema and this does not bother my skin at all! I love the results of Vitamin C Serum on my face. My face looks so refreshed and soft.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, makes my skin feel very smooth. Non sticky. Can&#x27;t wait to try other products from the Poppy Austin line.</li>
            <li> Excellent !  However from  the very beginning I got a little (just tiny) redness,  I read other viewers had the same redness experience but it disappear less than a week.  I felt like my skin has glow and the texture on my skin is looking better.  Highly recommended to ppl to try</li>
            <li> Ok...so I just got this three days ago. I am already starting to see a difference in my pores. I had heard about Vitamin C serum, did some research and found this one to be very affordable and it works! I&#x27;ll see if I can find some pictures to submit later and update this post.</li>
            <li> I was searching for something with Hyaluronic Acid in it and came across this.  I had heard about the benefits from Vitamin C a lot recently, including on Dr. Oz&#x27;s \\&quot;Drop a Decade from Your Face.\\&quot;  He recommends 3% to 10%, which this has 20% I believe -- but I opted to try it any ways.  I am very, very, very pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was amazed at how much smoother, brighter, and firmer it became. Using this with my Clarisonic, my face is so shiny and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it was a matter of timing or just a matter of using it more, but I didn&#x27;t notice a big difference when I used it once at night for the first four nights.  On the fifth day, I started applying it in the morning and night a huge difference.  I even had a little bit of peeling, but that could have been because me starting to test it with Retin A one time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the future, I would like to try using this in combination with Retin A in the evenings.</li>
            <li> I continue to be very pleased with the Poppy Austin serum. It has become the key component in my skin care, and I have also used the serum to address the sun damaged skin on my arms. Excellent results, and would highly recommend for all.</li>
            <li> Very good quality product</li>
            <li> lightweight and instantly absorbed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen great results in the last two weeks since I purchased this Vitamin C. I use it in the morning and evening (have a lot of face TLC catching up to do!) and I like how my skin is responding to the vitamin serum!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Saw results within a few days as far as texture, tone.  I&#x27;m not wearing any face makeup, i.e. Foundation, base.  I&#x27;m 53 and haven&#x27;t felt comfortable doing this in years!  Thank you for a wonderful product!  Better than any serum I&#x27;ve tried yet, and I have a drawerful!</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for a few weeks now. I did noticed that my skin became very dry the first few days after using it morning and evening. After the end of the week all the dead dry skin came off. I like how the product makes my skin feel but I haven&#x27;t noticed a big difference yet. I will follow up my status after a couple of months. The rating will change after a longer period of using the product.</li>
            <li> My face is lloking sooooo good! I used to have amazing skin but after I went to basic &amp; started working graveshift hours in the hospital my face was just in awful condition. Ive been using this along with InstaNatural for my eys &amp; Im telling you this is such a great product to add to your skin routine! I completely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I received one bottle of Poppy Austin Vitamin C Serum to review.  The serum doesn‚Äôt really have fragrance and it does make your face soft.  There are a lot of great ingredients, but there three ingredients that I would rather not use, which are  Carbomer,  Phenoxyethanol and Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Organic Herbal Infusion, Organic Aloe, Vitamin C (Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate), Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), Botanical Hyaluronic Acid, Witch Hazel, Kosher Vegetable Glycerin, Carbomer, (2s)-2-Amino-5-guanidinopentanoic Acid, Organic Jojoba Oil, Phenoxyethanol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin.</li>
            <li> Love this product, I have been using Vit. C serum for quite awhile and have used other brands and this brand is far superior.&lt;br /&gt;Great service.</li>
            <li> Do you have age spots, wrinkles, or dark under eye circles. This product is for you!!!! I quit ALL my face regiments to see it this truly worked, to my surprise it worked on my fine lines by my mouth and on my forehead. This bottle is 2x bigger than most. I love the scent its very refreshing. It also not clear its a cloudy color. It goes on smooth and soaks into the skin. It hydrated my face after my first use. No pain or burning sensation during application and no sticky feeling afterwards. This is a huge value on price and the size of the vitamin c because you only need a few drops each time. Also comes with a money back guarantee if your not happy with the product. I love the fact that the company doesn&#x27;t test products on animals. I&#x27;m a big animal lover, I love them so much even when I see hurt, abandoned, and lost animals I stop and help it. The packaging was great and the product came on time with no problems or defects. I recommend to people with age spots or wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Product seems to work like the more expensive Vitamin C serums i have purchased. I keep mine refrigerated to preserve the life of C. It also adds a cool freshness when i use it twice a day.</li>
            <li> I received this product a week ago and started using it immediately. The shipment arrived on time and it is an awesome purchase for the price; twice as much product as other serums I&#x27;ve purchased. In only 5 days I can see results. My skin is brighter and the dark circles under my eyes are diminished. I definitely recommend this product to anyone looking to brighten and even out your skin tone.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, with only a week of use I can already see results. My skin does not only look healthier but it also has a beautiful  glow.</li>
            <li> This product is phenomenal! It makes my skin glow and is a must have. It is the type of product that I can&#x27;t live without, even for a night. Not only is this product awesome, Poppy Austin provides double the amount (compared to other brands) for a great price! Poppy Austin Vitamin C serum is a staple in my skincare routine that I certainly won&#x27;t give up (even as someone who frequently changes products and wants to try out new things)!!!</li>
            <li> Effects seem almost instantaneous</li>
            <li> First let me start by saying I LOVE anything that Poppy Austin makes. So when Poppy Austin contacted Everything Beauty and Beyond to try out their Vitamin C serum I literally almost cried. And I am not saying that because they sent me a free bottle of Vitamin C.  Before I was even contacted by them I was already using their Argan Oil for my face and hair and loved it!! I love them because 1. They sell the real deal. Their products (vitamin C and Argan Oil) are all natural with nothing added or taken away.  2. The dollar amount for the size of product you get is amazing!  Their Argan oil for example is priced at $29.00 US versus their competitor which is $85 US for a much smaller bottle! Ok back to the Vitamin C review here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I love about this product is that it contains Hyaluronic Acid.  Now I know a bunch of you out there use face serums and creams and have absolutely no clue what you are putting on your face. tsk tsk! You should ALWAYS read the back of the packaging label and google what the main ingredients are before applying it on your face.  Things like witch hazel, alochol, parabens, fragrances and perfume should never be applied to face or found in your facial products.  This are all signs of potential irritants for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when I saw that Poppy Austin Vitamin C serum also had hyaluronic acid and jojoba oil I knew I had to try it.  When it arrived to my house I started using it every morning after my skincare routine but before I applied my sunscreen and makeup.  I have to say my skin looks and feels amazing.  I noticed that I was getting fine lines forming on the top of my forehead (gasp!!) and was trying desperately to get rid of them.  When I started using this product, I noticed that they diminished a bit and really looked less noticeable.  While we all know that nothing you do (expect a face lift) will get rid of lines and wrinkles, however there are things we can use like hyaluronic acid that can really help tomask them.  And yes this works like any other product; if you stop using it then your lines will &#x27;re-appear&#x27;.  So lets talk about the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic Acid is found naturally in the human body and seen tremendously in babies.  Ever wondered why babies and small children always look like they have beautiful supple plumpy skin?  Well its because of hyaluronic acid.  Its a major component of skin tissue that give babies this effect.  Skin in general holds about fifty percent of your body‚Äôs hyaluronic acid in it.  However as we get older we loss a lot of it and thus aging takes it toll.  Hyaluronic Acid  plumps and moisturizes skin as well as it helps to heal and comfort it when its damaged. Hyaluronic Acid also prevent fine lines and wrinkles from forming and helps the skin by retaining moisture and creating a cushion to help plump them out as we age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing that I love about this product as stated earlier is that it contains jojoba oil.  Jojoba oil is actually not an oil but a wax ester.  Because it is a wax ester it is hypothesized that jojoba oil is very comparable to human skin oil which manipulates the skin into thinking it has produced enough and balances out oil production.  Thus helping to give you only the added oil you need for your face and stopping the over production of sebum.  It is also not an antioxidant so it won&#x27;t expire or go bad in a few months.  It is stable in that regard.  It also adsorbs well into the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave it sticky, greasy or just plain nasty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the seller for me here was the Vitamin C.  Vitamin C is an antioxidant that is used to protect and help the face from wrinkles, sun damage, signs of aging, dark spots and brighten your complexion amongst other great benefits. Vitamin C can also help to prevent or treat hyperigmentation, defend against free radicals and brighten your skin. However with all the advantages of vitamin C, the only draw back is that because it is an antioxidant, it oxidizes itself very quickly and once this happens, it is no longer good. You will be able to tell by the color when this happens to your product. It normally starts off clear and then turns yellow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on all these amazing properties is while I love love this product.  That and the product comes in a serum form in a dark bottle with a droplet in order to help it for oxidizing and bacteria.  Once Vitamin C hits air and light it starts to breakdown, so its good to see that Poppy Austin nailed it by packaging it correctly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just love Poppy Austin and plan to try out more of their products!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this for very long but already I can tell a difference in the way my skin feels.  It feels MARVELOUS...I&#x27;m hooked!  I&#x27;m a lady of mature age who still gets breakouts...yes its true...however, I haven&#x27;t seen any new &amp;#34;surprises&amp;#34; since I started using this along with the Rosewater Toner. I will continue to use them both.</li>
            <li> This is really good stuff! I love the packaging although it seems like a small bottle, a little bit goes a long way:) It&#x27;s great to use during a retinyl treatment, as it&#x27;s very pure and hydrates the skin without any irritation. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great.It makes my face look younger.</li>
            <li> I love the product. It works and is easy to use</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when opening the new bottle I received as I just finished the last one I had purchased earlier in the year they were not the same they don&#x27;t look the same they don&#x27;t feel the samehave you reformulated the product from earlier in the year it is much thinner and much clearer then my previous orderI do not like the new products and I will not order again</li>
            <li> love the serum and how it feels on my face.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast, good packaging, Like it so far....no complaints :)</li>
            <li> Seems to be a good product.  Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice any real differences to my skin.  I know that Vitamin C is supposed to be good  for the skin so I think that using this will be better than using nothing. Doesn&#x27;t sting or burn in any way.  Will be looking forward to seeing results in skin texture and radiance!</li>
            <li> Love this company and their products!  I will definitely be buying more in the future.  They are my new &amp;#34;holy grail&amp;#34; skin care products.  Now if only I could find my &amp;#34;holy grail&amp;#34; hair care product for my waves I&#x27;ll be in beauty product heaven</li>
            <li> Nice big bottle, took about a week to get here. Evens complexion for sure. Probably the most effective thing I&#x27;ve ever used to remove dark marks from acne scarring along with daily use of sunscreen of course. I saw a huge improvement in my marks in a bit over a week and they&#x27;re basically gone in a month. This serum uses sodium ascorbyl phosphate rather than L-ascorbic acid or magnesium ascorbyl phosphate so it is not as effective at building collagen. Its pH is basic and will dried my skin out over time until I began following with a more acidic toner.</li>
            <li> Love this product will buy it again.</li>
            <li> have been using for several weeks now on face and back of one hand. can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed any difference in either but will give it a bit5 longer yet.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this! it felt nice being applied, didn&#x27;t leave behind sticky reside and was nice under my makeup. However, after using a whole bottle; it did NOTHING for my skin. No glow, no smoothness; nothing like the other reviews. I took pictures and looked exactly the same as before. And I used it diligently day and night without skipping a day. Perhaps this was not designed for African-American skin. Will look for another brand, but will NOT be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product!!  I have noticed a difference in my skin in just 1 week of using it.  Thank you Poppy Austin, I&#x27;m a fan for life!</li>
            <li> Great product and a cheaper price!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good vitamin C serum for years and I think I found it!  Known for hiding wrinkles, Poppy Austin&#x27;s C serum feels thick and strong, like it is  actually doing something.  I can feel it working.</li>
            <li> Love the large size of this bottle. I waited a couple weeks before leaving feedback. I did not have any of the previous reviewers burning sensation. The serum smoothes on easy and sinks in fast. In the two weeks I have been using the product I have notices my skin is not as &amp;#34;congested&amp;#34; as with other products. I will continue to use for a month and see if actually works on my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Satisfied with this product...</li>
            <li> Love it!!!  I&#x27;ve used lots of other &amp; this is by far the best!  Saw results in a very short period of time.  I like the company&#x27;s philosophy and ethics...I trust their products!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing on clean dry skin, then layer your moisturizer of choice over it. My skin has completely transformed for the better since using this! I have combination skin. The dry areas are hydrated and soft. The oily areas have smaller pores with less oil production and less breakouts. I use this twice a day under my moisturizer and I will continue to use this! It took my skin about two weeks to really start to change.</li>
            <li> Love it ! Feels totally beautiful on my skin . Light fresh nourishing.  Wish I could purchase Poppy Austin&#x27;s retinol cream but it&#x27;s not delivered to Perth WA for reasons unknown ....?</li>
            <li> I am LOVING this serum!!!</li>
            <li> I have used other Brands of Vitamin C Serum that I have had better results with, but I find the convenience of the 2 oz. bottle a pus. I just use and extra moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Very pleased. I have been buying another serum that costs more and half the size of this one. Side by side it seems its the exact same ingredients and same great,  light, fast absorbing serum.  Extremely pleased so far.</li>
            <li> Well i&#x27;ve only used for about a week and a half, but i am noticing my skin is feeling tighter and brighter. Thx great product  Been using ever since I received and face is definitely brighter and clearer! This stuff works wonders! Thank you for making this product!  Attention to women reading this review, please try it, it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> great product! noticed a difference immediately in the brightening of my skin and fading of sun spots. Also helps tighten and refresh. My skin looks and feels noticeably healthier</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I can see the difference in my skin just after a few days of using it.&lt;br /&gt;Seller has an excellent price and was very prompt in the transaction.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff already and I just got it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a light weight serum that actually works for dark spots and fine lines and I&#x27;ve finalIy found it with this serum. I highly recommend this product and will be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> Amazing serum! I use it at night after cleansing and before argan oil moisturizer. It has no scent, rich texture, absorbs immediately leaving skin soft with no residue or sticky feeling. Absolutely love this product and will be buying more.</li>
            <li> This is not like a big bottle</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Have seen an improvement in my skin texture and hydration! Will defiantly be buying this again. No strong scent.</li>
            <li> Very nice product to make skin smooth &amp; bright</li>
            <li> Great stuff. soaks right in your skin. no greasy feel, and is fine for my sensitive skin. ill definitely be ordering more. A little goes along way so it lasts.</li>
            <li> So far so good, Ive tried so many products, I&#x27;m using all of your products, I just ordered the clay mask... BUT, I had to return the ROSEWATER, for some reason the scent was foul, maybe I got a bad one, but this VITAMIN c is fantastic,</li>
            <li> I use with Barberry Fig oil.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I have used it for a week and see more improvement in my skin than with months of using other products. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been impressed yet by a vitamin c serum.  I&#x27;ve tried this one, timeless, Instanatural, and cosmetic skin solutions. If I had to pick one brand, I guess I would go with cosmetic skin solutions. I seemed to have brighter skin when I was using theirs, but thought I would try others. Guess I will go back.</li>
            <li> I really like the way this feels on my skin. I can wear alone or with moisturizer. I have been using it for a while and I can see the different. The price is also right. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Great product, large size &amp; quick shipping.  Very impressed with this company and product!  Will order again!</li>
            <li> I have only had this a short time. So far easy to use. It will take some time to see results !</li>
            <li> Awesome product. . Brightened my dull skin.</li>
            <li> Large bottle.  Good value.  Good product.</li>
            <li> The best skin lotion it is  possible to have, as well as being a real bargain.</li>
            <li> So far, so good. I am not noticing miracle results but it seems to be helping my skin a bit after maybe a month of use. It comes in a nice bottle and when I dropped it the other day it didn&#x27;t break so it&#x27;s a tough container.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently purchased the vitamin C serum from poppy Austin and have been using it for about a week. The most noticeable results I&#x27;ve gotten so far is a clear smooth fresh looking face. I had a breakout that cleared by the end of the day with no noticeable signs that It had been there. The lines on my forehead and around my mouth seem to be less noticeable as well. I do have pretty good skin, and purchased this product for the large pores I&#x27;ve noticed I&#x27;m developing on my cheeks, I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference yet.. But have faith in the product so will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Great value, nice size product. Not harsh on my skin.  Shipped quickly and safely</li>
            <li> Due to the severe cold weather this winter, this was delivered frozen and leaking out of the bottle. I was looking for a plain vitamin C serum, this contains jojoba which I discovered I&#x27;m allergic to after only using once.</li>
            <li> after using it consistently you actually do have a noticeable difference in the texture of your skin. It is much smoother and softer and feels fuller or thicker.  I was skeptical, but I actually really like this product.  It may not be the same experience for everyone, but I found that although not a miracle serum, it does have benefits for my skin.</li>
            <li> Soothes my skin, and diminishes lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Love this serum.  I feel like my skin just soaks it up.  I have very sensitive acne prone skin and this does not irritate me:)</li>
            <li> This product feels better on my skin than any other serum I have tried. It is quickly absorbed and totally non-greasy. My skin looks brighter and feels smoother after using. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an Esthetician that works for doctors and have worked with some of the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; product lines around. My goal is to help my clients achieve beautiful, healthy skin. I&#x27;m all about the science not the marketing when it comes to skin care products. I&#x27;m very impressed with the vitamin C w/hyaluronic acid and the Rose Water hydrating Toner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s helping. I plan to use the entire bottle and then I should hopefully see an improvement. It does feel nice on my face and is very economical. However, if it doesn&#x27;t improve my skin, then that doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> Best vitamin c serum ever!</li>
            <li> Love it. Great for wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Not sure, but it seems previous Vitamin C serums have been more effective. Don&#x27;t get the same results on my face.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product! I have super sensitive skin that goes dry and breaks out. It&#x27;s super fun. This product keeps my breakout&#x27;s at bay, blackheads gone and my skin moisturized. Whoever thought to put vitamin C and hydrolaunic acid together was a genius. I find myself sometimes able to go without moisturizer but I can&#x27;t go without this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is double the normal size and is a great value. It has no smell and is a great consistency. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product.  Makes my skin feel wonderful.  Not greasy, and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Love this product and love the company. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I cannot tell any difference in my skin after using this whole bottle!  I would not buy it again!</li>
            <li> LOVE this vit c! LOVE it. AGAIN, like the rose water, the quality is amazing and the price is right!&lt;br /&gt;i have experienced profound changes in my skin since i started using poppy austin and am now a loyal customer who will tell all my friends. if you have not tried it, DO! your skin and pockets will thank you for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it nearly everyday for several months now and think its working? I&#x27;m still getting my occasional break outs, but they may be not lasting as long now. I honestly can&#x27;t really tell, but I like the feel of this (its refreshing) and it is a good moisturizer for oily skin in the summer.</li>
            <li> It is a good value and seems to do the same as other similar products I&#x27;ve used.  Can get a little flaky when it dries, but I mix it with a little moisturizer, which seems to do the trick.</li>
            <li> High quality product.</li>
            <li> I received my order and I am enjoying using my new Vitamin C serum. I am looking forward to seeing a difference in a couple more weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Robin</li>
            <li> Great price for a product I won&#x27;t live without. I have been using many things on my face and on the first day of using this product , I can see a major difference  on my face . I am currently overseas and the water here dried up my face really bad and have used all kind of soaps and cream, lotion with no luck. After this product arrived at my current location , I immediately tried it and was like (.wowwwwwwwwwwww )..it works .I am not using it to look younger or anything like that it just keep my face looking fresh all day long..I will for ever keep this Wonderful product. I don&#x27;t usually leave reviews about things purchased , but felt like I had to tell the truth about this product....IT WORKS FOR ME ON THE FIRST DAY.............Thanks !</li>
            <li> Like this oil. Usually can&#x27;t put oils on my face but this one is very nice. Absorbs well without feeling oily and makes my skin feel sift.</li>
            <li> This product has smoothed out my skin tone in a couple of weeks.  It even appears that some brown spots are lightening up a bit.</li>
            <li> Both came more quickly than expected so I wasn&#x27;t ready to start. Since I was late doing this, I haven&#x27;t seen any real improvement on my face,but plan to keep using it until I think it&#x27;s a waste of time. Hope not!!!</li>
            <li> Well, I just received the product on 8/6/14.  It is a large sized bottle for what I paid for (~$35) and has 20% Vitamin C stated on the bottle.  I have been using every day and I think it is too soon to make any comments; less than one week.  But I will write that it goes on nicely, has no smell, and is easily absorbed into the skin.  I follow it with my Retin A, about 20 minutes later.  Of note, I was at the doctor office and notice that they sell another brand with 20% Vitamin  C for $108.00  Not sure if that helps or not.</li>
            <li> Was happy with the quick delivery. The product so far has been great. My new favorite.! :)  Thanks</li>
            <li> I haved never used this brand, so far I like the product. Also, I have not seen this large of a quantity, which makes it a better value.</li>
            <li> I love it. I notice my face is looking healthy and more uniformed. I also use it on my hands. No sensitivity or unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I use this Vitamin C Serum in the morning after washing my face and using the Rose Water.  You only need a very little and it goes on my face easily and dries quickly.  I love having an all natural antioxidant to apply directly to my skin.</li>
            <li> I will be buying this again! Works great.</li>
            <li> This product is outstanding!  I am 59 years old and have used Vitamin C Serum in the past and this is by far the best.  My face feels so soft and pores are getting smaller little by little which is what I needed so badly.  I have rosacea and am hoping this will help.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for such a wonderful product and look forward to ordering this and other products in the future.</li>
            <li> So far very happy. Skin feels very soft in the morning after using it the nite before</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended that I use a Vitamin C serum in the mornings to fight free-radicals. I love Poppy Austin so I checked into their offerings. My Derm mentioned L-Ascorbic acid as a key ingredient when shopping for the serum. Poppy&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t have that particular ingredient but it does have one that I looked into and found that it is like the L-Ascorbic Acid but it sinks into your skin better that it. I am happy with this product and will definitely order again! Did I mention this bottle is HUGE compared to others and it&#x27;s also a great price!</li>
            <li> Just received this and have been using faithfully for a little over a week. Love how it absorbs quickly, and I already see improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> I started using this right after I did a peel, and I can honestly say it&#x27;s really helped brighten and smooth my skin. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> A GREAT PRODUCT AT AN AMAZING PRICE!</li>
            <li> Simply put... This serum does not work. My face does not look any different than before using it. I used it daily and had no results... nothing. It was like putting water on my face. Wasted money!!</li>
            <li> Great product. It smells nice and is very easy to use. Definitely a noticeable difference in my skin!</li>
            <li> just bought the second bottle..love it</li>
            <li> It softens your skin texture, faded my brown spots, and soften my fine lines!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good Vitamin C serum for my face that wouldn&#x27;t be so expensive. I am so glad I found this product. I liked it so much that this is my 2nd bottle. One other thing I like about this product is that it also has Hyaluronic acid which helps my skin feel smoother.&lt;br /&gt;I use it every night right after cleansing and let it get absorbed for several minutes before I apply an oil/moisturizer.  It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> Great Vitamin C to use daily</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and works wonders, especially around my mouth and under my eyes. My skin is definitely looking smoother and more toned. Back for another bottle soon...</li>
            <li> I took a chance on a brand that I never had used or sampled based on several positive reviews, and I am glad that I did! I previously used a well known serum that was 3x as expensive and worked well, but I think Poppy Austin works better. You can feel a difference almost instantly when you apply the serum, sunspots are fading, skin is more radiant and plumped.</li>
            <li> Do not like the smell at all.  Cannot tell yet if it is doing anything.  Had been using Ole Henrickson truth serum and loved that.  It also has a great smell.</li>
            <li> Have been using vitamin C for a long time. Luv this product! It is twice the size of other brands. It was a great purchase!!</li>
            <li> Worth the price. I am so happy i tried this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 10 days I started using the serum at night. I&#x27;m starting to see a good result as my face complexion is becoming brighter and clearer (from acne marks).  I have extremely oily and acne-prone skin but this serum works great and doesn&#x27;t break me out. Light as liquid and no smell. (I use this serum right after I apply Paula&#x27;s choice 2% BHA, and this combination is a bomb)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally don&#x27;t write review for products I purchase, but this one deserves it.</li>
            <li> I ordered Poppy Austin specifically after reviewing their because of their commitment to raw beauty and their initiative in Morocco.  I have been using a few weeks and see subtle improvements in the fine lines around my mouth and the dark spots seem to be fading lightly.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great product that promots skin firmness and tones the color of your face.  I highly recommend it to others !!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my first purchase and discovery of Poppy Austin. I&#x27;m using the product daily and will write a review of results after a little more time goes by. I&#x27;m planning on ordering more of their products without delay. Thank you Poppy Austin for your user friendly website, follow up email and your cause supporting women in Morocco.</li>
            <li> Great product, good price.  I use this serum with my moisturizer for deeper penetration and it works wonders.  Have noticed wrinkles not so deep anymore and my face is less dry even if I only use the serum once a day.</li>
            <li> This vitamin C serum is fabulous!  I have the most sensitive skin and break out with 99% of products applied to my face.  This is wonderful, no breakout and I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference in the overall quality of my face in the two weeks of using this.  Thank you so much for this product; I love it and will buy it forever!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week or two now but I am dark skinned with hyper pigmentation issues and I&#x27;ve already noticed that my skin tone looks more even and glowing. I use it with a sunscreen on top to protect my skin. Also, a little really goes a long way with this product. Unlike a lot of other products it does not irritate my skin or cause breakouts because I am very acne prone. I would definitely order from this company again! Thank you for the excellent product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Goes on nicely and is 1/3 the cost of the previous brand I was using.  I would definately buy this product again.</li>
            <li> WOW.  I use this morning and night. trust it works.  I use Vitamin C Serum everyday with the Rhassoul Clay (1 to 2xtimes a week) and the combo has made a huge positive impact on my skin!!!</li>
            <li> I just love the idea of having vit c and hyaluronic acid just in one bottle plus ORGANIC! my skin looks great and glowing! hope they never stop making it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best vitamin C I come across too yet.&lt;br /&gt;I purchase this item 2 times already and now I&#x27;m just about to purchase 2 more , for ME and MY husband:)&lt;br /&gt;Leave the skin tight, smooth and definitely a great anti aging serums. We both get many complaints about how our skin glow, looks much younger and tight . And very healthy . I will definitely recommend you to give it a try:)</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, great price.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and I like that fact that it only takes about 4-6 drops to cover my face, neck and chest area.  So it is going to last awhile, which is great!</li>
            <li> I love this product so far.  I&#x27;ve had it for about 3 weeks now and I&#x27;ve noticed my complexion is smoother, and less blotchy.  My pores are much smaller as well.  I&#x27;m unsure if you can put it around your eyes, which is where most of my fine lines are, so I won&#x27;t try until I can find out if it&#x27;s safe.  In the meantime, I&#x27;m very happy with it on the rest of my face, neck and d√©colletage.  I&#x27;m interested in how it works fpr the long haul, but so far, it&#x27;s really a great product.  The buying experience was really good, and their customer service even followed up with me to see how everything is going, which was really nice.</li>
            <li> Love the product. Will get it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a few weeks and I don&#x27;t put it all over my face, just under my eyes and in-between my eyebrows.  The reason I had purchased it was because I felt like those areas were very de-hydrated looking, making my eyes look tired and dry.  I have been very happy with the serum.  I put it on every night before bed.  It&#x27;s not oily at all and has no scent.  When I wake up in the morning, my eyes look and feel hydrated and moisturized.  It only take a couple of drops so this will last me a very long time.  I will definitely be purchasing more skin products from Poppy Austin.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with the product. The serum did not decrease the wrinkles, as indicated.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C serum is awesome. I&#x27;ve tried other higher-priced serums, and this works really really well. Also, it&#x27;s a huge bottle, so I feel better about slathering more of it over my face :)  The other ones are so small that I used it rather stingily. I can see a big difference in terms of wrinkle reduction, smoother skin, lightening spots, etc., by using a more liberal application.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! MIRACLES!</li>
            <li> Great value compared to other vit. C serums on the market.  Nice texture glides on nicely but don&#x27;t put to much I had some irritation from over use.  Just applying in the a.m.Plan to order again. Oh I did apply  some to a burn I had and it didn&#x27;t go through dark phase! Didn&#x27;t scar!</li>
            <li> Great stuff. A totally effective and easy to wear serum. Will never be without it.</li>
            <li> I am now using this morning and night.  It clears my complexion and with the little bit of acid I have noticed my skin looking much more youthful.  My redness has been reduced, scars seem less noticeable, and my face just looks brighter and newer.  I&#x27;m in love with this product.  Day 1-3 I noticed some redness reducing and skin looking a bit fresher, and now that I have been using this for a few weeks I look better than I have in a while.  I would recommend this product to friends and family.  In fact, a few may be getting this in their stockings this Christmas...</li>
            <li> Very Happy with the product so far and customer service has been excellent. Recommended :)</li>
            <li> This came really quick, I live in New Zealand and was very surprised to see it arrive within two weeks, very happy. My face is looking great, would recommend.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. I could see a difference with one application. My husband was so impressed that he asked me to put it on him. My skin feels tighter and fuller. Pores and fine lines are diminished.</li>
            <li> We use Poppy Austin Rose Water as a toner after cleaning and then apply Vitamin C Serum under makeup in the morning.  So light and absorbs immediately.  Pores are diminishing and spots are as well!  Very excited to see the changes in my skin as the months go on.  I&#x27;ve used it for only 2-3 months.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C serum was recommended by a tech who did a microdermabrasion and chemical peel on my face. She recommended using it after morning cleansing. I can tell a difference already in my skin under my eyes. I can actually feel it tightening the skin. I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I am definitely a fan now!  I appreciate that the bottle is dark to preserve the integrity of the product.  The serum itself has made my skin noticeably more smooth and my pores less noticeable. For some reason the week before this arrived, I broke out quite a bit (and I&#x27;m in my 40s). After using this for just a few days, my skin totally rejuvenated and cleared. It was awesome!  (I wonder if this would help with mild acne for teens?). I use 4 drops in the morning and evening. The product came sooner than expected and in perfect condition. I will purchase this again and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Definitely helps brighten skin, but I have noticed more clogged pores on my troubled skin. I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts, I have just noticed an increase on pores needing purging. Love the glow this gives my skin though, so it is worth the small sacrifice.</li>
            <li> So far I am  pleased with the product. I really haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see a difference, however, I know that Vitamin C is suppose to be good for the face.&lt;br /&gt;I do intend to order more and continue to do so.</li>
            <li> Just started using it but it seems like a very good serum !</li>
            <li> Good quality, great quality packaging, Will definitely be back to purchasing more.</li>
            <li> I Love, Love this product.  I bought one bottle and could notice a difference in my face in just one week.  The surface of my skin has gotten so smooth and it just glows allowing me to go without foundation.  I was so pleased with the first bottle that I just received my  second bottle - didn&#x27;t want to go without for even one day!  The quality is absolutely amazing.  This was my first time trying the Poppy Austin Brand and I will be using it and recommending it for a long time to come!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT,LOVE IT,LOVEIT!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have only used this product a few days, but already see a difference.  It&#x27;s fabulous and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> What a wonderful product! Very pleased - my skin shows a clarity and vibrance I have not seen in a very long time. Waiting patiently on its full effect on my lines and wrinkles though I&#x27;ve noted they are much softer now.....I compared it to costlier versions that were not organic and contained the infamous hydraulic acid. I can see why Poppy Austin has realized her mission compounded with a commitment to ethics and respect for our Mother Earth.....</li>
            <li> I got the product a few days ago. Used about 6 times on my face but I haven&#x27;t seen any difference yet. I will give it a few more days. I hope I will see a difference on the way my skin look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a month and so far the results look good. I&#x27;m trying to even out my skin tone and it is a slow process but I&#x27;m hanging in. When I finish this bottle, I&#x27;ll probably buy another.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for two weeks and love it!  My face craves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have a smell nor is it greasy. Sometimes I apply it before I put on moisturizer and sometimes after. It spreads more evenly when I apply it after the moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At night I use it and jojoba oil from Trader Joe&#x27;s (which doesn&#x27;t smell either). It is a great combo. This actually has jojoba oil in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love love love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started to use this and it seems to be doing a nice job. Only a little is needed for good coverage and it feels good on my skin. I like it.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I have sensitive skin and other vitamin C products have irritated my skin in the past.  This is extremely gentle and works very well.  I don&#x27;t know about erasing 10 years from your face, but it&#x27;s still a great product.</li>
            <li> My face feels amazing when I use this stuff !!!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. Will be buying more and other products from this company!</li>
            <li> Originally bought this for my mom to use but fell in love with it myself. Perfect lightweight serum to use before moisterizer. Absorbs quickly, not greasy and just makes skin nice. Can&#x27;t do without this stuff now.</li>
            <li> Great product; does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Broke me out. Not for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several weeks and so far have not noticed any difference in my skin at all.</li>
            <li> It¬¥s really good, you can see your skin face radiant.</li>
            <li> Am enjoying the serum very much. Nice large size, easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Great...Glad I found this product exists.</li>
            <li> Freezes 40-something age wrinkles in the morning, and the wrinkles are back by 5pm!</li>
            <li> Loved the service and quickness of delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just now trying this product and have had no skin side effects, have noticed some exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to brighter skin in the near future!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product at a great price.  Love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and fast delivery. Way over priced!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. It&#x27;s not oily at all, but makes your skin feel very smooth.</li>
            <li> I like how it feels on my face, waiting for some results... Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I could not really tell much of a difference by the end of my first bottle. My esthetician seemed to think my skin was looking better along with some other advice from her. I don&#x27;t see much point in purchasing this again. It did not block my pores and was not greasy, it absorbed nicely into the skin and didn&#x27;t affect my makeup. Some reviews reported an odor but i didn&#x27;t think anything of it, most lotions and serums, or anything really is going to have some type of smell, this one wasn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> I will never be without this serum!  It is like a face lift for my mature dry skin..I love it!!</li>
            <li> Nice serum for price and quantity. Smooth and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I really like this Vitamin C serum. It feels great on my skin! It&#x27;s lightweight and is perfect for morning and night use. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with my purchase, size is large will last at least 6 months. Have used product for 5 days have not used long enough to make a difference yet.</li>
            <li> Very happy with product. I haven&#x27;t seen a miraculous difference in my skin since using it but I feel as though I am a little more fresh faced. Will definitely continue using it</li>
            <li> Does indeed make skin glow...love the product and support their philosophy.</li>
            <li> Great purchase.  Large amount for the money. I have been using for 2 months to help with wrinkles.  Took a before photo of problem areas, just took a new one and am pleased with results so far.  I have a long way to go, but I did notice that the wrinkles are not as deep as when I started. My coworkers have said that my complexion looks better too.</li>
            <li> After using for 3 weeks, it has some brightening effect on my skin. However, I have yet to see any improvement on my fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled with this product! I can see a change in my face and I&#x27;ve started to used it on my hands.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Easily applies and effective.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing and my skin has been glowing since I used it. I know many have asked where do I put this in my regime??? Here is my regime:  CLEANSE with an organic cleanser, Dermalogica or Cetaphil. TONER of choice *or* skip toner and use the Vitamin C serum. MOISTURIZER of choice and that&#x27;s it.  I use it at night mostly for overnight repair and hydration or before work where the air is harsh and recycled. I literally use 4-5 drops (comes with a dropper). This will last forever. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I hate trying so many different products that promise results. Its great to have found one that works, this really helps even out my skin tone. I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I used this serum both in the AM and PM, after eye cream and before moisturizer. The product is dispensed with a little dropper, and I tended to use 5-6 drops.  It applies very easily and dries really quickly, and it is not sticky at all.  The product page states that it has the &amp;#34;faintest citrus scent&amp;#34;, but there needs to be more emphasis on faint as there is really not any fragrance to speak of at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not notice any immediate results, but it would be difficult to see many changes in a month&#x27;s time. That said, I have read numerous good things about the benefits of incorporating a Vitamin C Serum into your beauty routine, so I will happily continue to use this bottle.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I for a year I noticed numerous small colorless to whitish bumps on my skin which I believe are my oil glands. I tried so many products but failed. This Poppy Austin vit C serum made a difference. After using for just 2 weeks, most of the small bumps are gone and my skin felt tighter and younger. I&#x27;m super grateful for this product. It&#x27;s been a month now and my skin is still improving. This product really is effective!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a month now my skin looks so much better my skin tone is more even  pores are smaller and fine lines are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I love this makes my face look brighter and clean!</li>
            <li> Originally I rated this product as 4 stars.  While I could see a slight improvement after several months use, on a recent visit with my sister-in-law she raved about how good I looked.  I hadn&#x27;t seen her in about 6 months and the comment was totally out of the blue.  She had no idea that my beauty routine had changed.  So, with rave reviews I had to give this product 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free or at a reduced price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. The Poppy Austin Vitamin C Serum is thicker than other serums I&#x27;ve tried and I am also impressed with how much the appearance of my scars have improved. Thinner serums are usually watered down, so thicker serums are a plus. Also, most Serums give you 1oz for twice the price.</li>
            <li> love how it makes my face and neck feel...seems to be less sagging.</li>
            <li> I have mixed reviews on this one.</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d tried this because of all the great benefits of vitamin c for the face. Also because it&#x27;s organic.  Wow, I can already see a change as far to the brightness of my skin. And to make the glow even better,  please buy poppy Austin&#x27;s barbary fig oil and put it on right after you put the vitamin c.  It&#x27;s the best.  Definitely will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love how soft my face feels after applying this serum.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this product but I did not care for it. I have used Obagi vit c &amp; did not like it because it leaves your face very sticky, unfortunately, this did the same. I totally believe in the benefits of vit c for your face. The best one I have found is SkinMedica vitamin C &amp; E complex. The texture is like putting silk on your skin. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about SkinMedica is the pump bottle it&#x27;s in. When you get down to the bottom of the bottle, it will no longer pump the product up, so I take the top off and turn it upside down &amp; get it out that way &amp; I use a Q-tip. I just love this product, it works, &amp; I just put up with the pump situation...it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> My wife is pleased with the product you supplied.  Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Star Rating &#x3D; 5</li>
            <li> Poppy Austin is fabulous.My skin looks smooth and bright with only a few drops used twice daily.I would recommend Vitimin C Serum to anyone who wants to look younger and have beautiful skin,</li>
            <li> It is too early to give an accurate assessment. So far it is ok</li>
            <li> This is an outstanding serum! It has reduced my pore size, fine lines and has evened my skin tone all within a couple of weeks. I use it under my Barbary fig oil and I am absolutely in love. I have dark spots from acne and in a short time this serum has faded them! Thank you Poppy Austin!!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any difference after using for 6 weeks</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say definitively that it does what it claims, but I like the product so far. Prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> This is a good vitamin C serum to purchase. It doesn&#x27;t sting when you use it on your face like others I have purchased, tend to do and it makes your face feel tight after it dries. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like the professionalism of the company and the product.  Vitamin C leaves my skin feeling very smooth.  It&#x27;s a lovely product....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been this product for a couple of weeks and I noticed some improvements to my skin already! My skin feels and looks smoother. My large pores appear smaller too. But what I really love is my ugly brown spot are lightening up. Even the darker brown spot on my nose! I highly recommend this serum to anyone who wants to fight the aging process!</li>
            <li> the best ever amazing better than the others  and less money and the size is  wonderful i wish i had discovered poppy austin thousands of dollars earlier  id be richer and beautiful  ive ordered all the other products so will update  melchor</li>
            <li> I can not feel the change</li>
            <li> I will be happy to give you feed back as it has not had enough time for me to see a difference . I need a little more time. No problem so far . I can see somewhat a change ,but like i said need more time.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for asking</li>
            <li> Love this serum! Penetrates quickly and makes a difference in the appearance of skin. Moisturizing without any oil and perfect under day cream . Would definitely reorder.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this Vitamin C Serum !</li>
            <li> I just love it non greasy soaks into my skin.  Helps with overall looks of my complexion, the lines under my eyes are hardly visable and the bags are gone. I use fig oil afterwards as a moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;before I apply makeup. Just WONDERFUL !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Lipsticks you can use and review the same day. I would even go as far as to say the same hour but what about items that need a little more attention? Like skin care for example. Well I have a new item to review and in order to fully engulf myself in this product I stopped using another all together in order to see this product solely in action. Here are my findings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received May 22, 2014 I received my Vitamin C Serum from Poppy Austin¬Æ with Hyaluronic Acid Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Vitamin C Serum from Poppy Austin¬Æ with Hyaluronic Acid Serum is a pure quality Vitamin C Serum and can be easily found on Amazon. This serum has organic ingredients like Jojoba Oil for moisture, and vegan Hyaluronic Acid to fight wrinkles, age spots, and even dark circles. Produced in the US freshly in small batches. Perfect for those who believe business quality and production matters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this Vitamin C Serum from Poppy Austin¬Æ religiously day and night because it is so gentle. I had no irritation. Something that is really important to me because I have sensitive skin. It instantly gives your skin a drink of intense hydration while directly tackling those stubborn fine lines, age spots, and wrinkles. It is truly naturally healing your skin and leaves behind a firm, smooth, and radiant tone to your skin. Free radicals be gone. I just loved this non-scented, smooth, and instant treatment for my skin. A product I am sure I will continue in my skin care regiment for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend you make this part of your skin care regiment too. Cleanse your face, pat dry, use just nickel size amount of the Vitamin C Serum from Poppy Austin¬Æ on your face and neck, let it absorb for a couple minutes, and then moisturize and soon you will start seeing your skin texture transform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was truly impressed and I believe you will too. Try one for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until next time... its beautiful to shop smart. Find amazing deals on Amazon today.</li>
            <li> i was pleased to find this wonderful product with such quality ingredients. the size is double from what i was using before and the price makes me smile. i&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and i can feel the difference!! time will tell if i&#x27;ll be able to see the difference .. but i believe i will. i most certainly will buy this again!! cir</li>
            <li> I used the Vitamin C Serum twice daily for two weeks and felt that it did actually help with fine lines and wrinkles, while firming and smoothing my skin. I was impressed with how just a couple of small drops of the serum provided complete coverage on my face. Therefore, since a little goes a long way and I feel that you definitely get your money&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used other skin care products that were really good, yet harsh and very drying. The effect of these particular products may produce quicker results, however these are also products that I can not use every day. I found the Vitamin C Serum to be very gentle and my skin seemed to love it and would &#x60;drink&#x27; it in. I never felt greasy and if my skin started to feel a little dry, I simply applied a good moisturizing cream to alleviate the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I truly feel that this is a quality skin care product that is worth the money. I love that it doesn&#x27;t contain harmful ingredients and fillers and that they do not test on animals. I think that if you try this product you will like it. I feel that if this product were used as directed, over time you would see very nice results.</li>
            <li> This was my very first experience with a Vitamin C Serum and I am very happy that it was with a Poppy Austin product! I was not disappointed one bit. I noticed a difference the very first time I used this serum and would recommend to women of all ages! Using this serum makes me want to try their other products, I am hooked! Give it a try and you will be too! You can see my full review here:[...]</li>
            <li> I tried this without moisturizer but my skin felt a little tight. It did significantly reduce my pore size to my delight. I noticed an improvement in small blemishes. This followed up with my regular moisturizer was great. My make up looked fantastic over this combo and I got compliments right away. Product was delivered promptly and questions answered quickly. I only gave this a 3 however because my fine lines look no better then they did. I tried adding the barbary fig oil and I like it but no improvement in my fine lines. Finally got now brand argan oil at the store and used that over the c serum and saw an immediate improvement in my fine lies around my eyes. I was going to order poppy austins argan oil but a chemical peel burn required immediate relief. Barbary fig oil didn&#x27;t help so I went to the health store for the argan oil and paid half fhe price. I&#x27;m not sure if I will repurchase or reccomend the c serum yet. I need to use it longer. I also need to find out what kind of vitamin c is in it as some are better then others. This may be better for younger women who want to prevent rather then correct fine lines. I&#x27;m 44.</li>
            <li> so far i am pleased with the product, only time will tell.thank you</li>
            <li> I was amazed and delighted at the almost immediate result of the serum.  Using it for the first few days I saw a pronounced softness and smoothness in my skin.  Love it and I did order again.</li>
            <li> Have been using for awhile and am pleased with the subtle changes this serum makes on my face.  The size of the bottle is larger than most other brands, making your purchase last longer.</li>
            <li> Nice on the face, quick absorb and not stings my skin.  It&#x27;s thinner than most facial serum, makes it a bit hard when you drop it on finger&#x27;s tip before apply on your face.</li>
            <li> what a wonderful product!&lt;br /&gt; I am so happy with  the  organic ingredients. And i am thrilled with the results i am seeing on my face and neck. Thank you for amazing product and the history in the production of it.</li>
            <li> I have used the Vitamin C Serum for the last two weeks and have noticed fading of dark spots. Thank you Poppy Austin. Certainly look forward to added benefits from the serum.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised when it only took 2 day to get my package of Poppy Austin vitamin C, that started me off with a very good opinion of the company. the bottle cam wrapped in bubble wrap to help protect the glass bottle the product is in. The bottle and the good sized dropper are both glass the bottle is of a dark brown/amber color to help protect from sun light and damage the dropper is a clear glass dropper that works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product absorbs very quickly into the skin, I did notice however that for the few seconds it takes to absorb there is a slight tacky feeling but the serum absorbs so quickly that it is hardly noticeable. After absorption the skin feels soft and you can notice a brightness about the skin more so the before the application of the serum.&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed after just 4 days use of this product that the dark cercal under my eyes have started to lessen. This however is the only differences to my face I have noticed. I have been blessed with pretty good skin and am only now starting to develop a few fine lines in my forehead and around my mouth  and have not been able to see a difference in them wile using this serum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The interesting results how ever have come from the fact that my hands over the years have suffered some damage so I decided to test this product out on them.&lt;br /&gt;I deposit about half a droppers worth of product into the palm of one hand and rub my hands together slightly then with my fingers I apply to my face the rest left on my hands I rub into them like you would lotion and this is were I have notice a difference some of the scares on my hands have already started to fade in color and the backs of my hands look and feel younger already&lt;br /&gt;the color has improved the lines are diminishing the feel of the skin has improve and my hands are looking younger and more cared for every day.&lt;br /&gt;I am thinking there may be other places on my body that I may see if some improvement can be found from Poppy Austin Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> Did not find any difference on my skin and pegmentaion üò†</li>
            <li> Excellent product and value. Really does what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my skin soft but firm at the same time. It hydrates the skin without making it oily. Great product.</li>
            <li> Awesome product must buy</li>
            <li> I used it on my face after getting out of the shower, let it dry, followed it up&lt;br /&gt;with my older supply of Argan oil, let that dry, then used the Barbary fig oil,&lt;br /&gt;worked for 12 hours with my skin feeling so soft, supple, and feeling great!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s almost hard to believe the amount of serum you&#x27;re getting, thank you Poppy&lt;br /&gt;Austin for making these products affordable for us!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item on Amazon based on reviews of others.It had lots of positive reviews. I don&#x27;t know what is going on with the positive reviews, but this didn&#x27;t work at all for me. When I used it, I felt drier with my face than Mychelle I used. It was like useing water.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Great value.  Smells nice and not sticky.  So far love the appearance of my skin</li>
            <li> I just received the vitamin c serum and I have used it two times so , I haven&#x27;t noticed any results yet. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have been using Poppy Austin vitamin C serum for about one week. I have noticed some differences on my skin. I will see the result after I completed using a whole bottle.</li>
            <li> This serum is odorless. It is a good value for the money.</li>
            <li> Now THIS Vitamin C Serum doesn&#x27;t run off my face (like others I&#x27;ve tried) and you can just feel it being absorbed into your skin. Leaving it feeling vibrant with a healthy glow! My new regiment - Poppy Austin Products. SUPERB!</li>
            <li> i have used lot of other vit c serums from popular brands, they all helped my skin and no more acne like before. And this brand helping my skin too, my skin looks more smoother and even toned and baby like too :). Vit C and other skin brightening and whitening products makes your skin more prone to sun tan , so you should always use sun screen in your regimen, thats going to give you better results. Overall im happy with this product and plus bonus is that its a double supply for the good price .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a much more expensive vitamin C serum and I&#x27;m just thrilled with Poppy Austin&#x27;s product.  It is the same strength but twice the size for less.  Can&#x27;t get much better than that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as I can tell it is identical to the other brand that I used (quickly absorbed and unscented).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I like the consistency and feel of this product on my skin, and have incorporated it once a day into my skin care routine. This summer I discovered that it fades freckles or brown spots, so if I&#x27;ve been outside, I often apply it to those spots twice a day and they practically disappear.</li>
            <li> I really like this...it does what they say and at a very good price.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m into my 30s I am trying to fight my skin&#x27;s ageing as much as possible &amp; have started to try new products &amp; incorporate more into my somewhat simple skin care routine.  I have some dark patches on my cheeks from birth control &amp; sun exposure that are my only real pet-peeve.  I first tried another C serum I purchased off amazon for a few months &amp; was overall happy with the results, but the constancy seemed a little watery &amp; the bottle ran out pretty fast since I like to use it on my face, neck &amp; chest.  It was my first time ever trying a C serum &amp; I noticed results after a few weeks.  When I ran out of that brand, I decided to try the Poppy Austin serum due to the larger size &amp; the good reviews.  After a week of use I had 2 strangers think I was almost 10 years younger than I am.  I was actually carded at a store &amp; the clerk (who was WAY younger than me) was surprised at my age.  His exact words were &amp;#34;No way&amp;#34;... &amp; I take that as a compliment.  I don&#x27;t think the Poppy Austin C serum is completely the reason (because I am religious about my sunblock &amp; other aspects of my health), but it&#x27;s definitely made my skin brighter, smoother &amp; is evening out the tone already.  My dark patches are still there, but slightly less noticeable.  I use it twice a day, morning &amp; night under my regular moisturizer, sunblock &amp; powder make-up with no issues.  I will continue to purchase this serum in the future &amp; plan on buying my mother some to try for Christmas this year.  Great product!</li>
            <li> pleased with the value of this product. I like the way it feels when applied ,no stickiness, and it is absorbed quickly into skin. I will evaluate the effectiveness of this product as it is too soon to give an opinion of it.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this particular Vitamin C serum.  Just feels like a slimy layer sitting on top of your skin.  Didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  I really liked the results I got from InstaNatural Vitamin C.  Switching back.</li>
            <li> It feels nice on my skin. I&#x27;m waiting to see results--not using it long enough to give a fair evaluation.</li>
            <li> Although I have only used this product for a short time, I love that it feels so &#x27;right.&#x27;  I have used another brand of Vit C serum in the past that felt different and from which I saw no visible results. So far, I feel that this brand is superior in every way and priced fairly. I will reorder.</li>
            <li> I am an esthetician and love to try new product lines to stay up to date and compare product lines.&lt;br /&gt;I was sucked in by the marketing and videos so I ordered a bottle. I have been using it since the day I received it several weeks ago.&lt;br /&gt; Instead of hydrating, my skin feels a little dry after using this product and I see no other results.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic. I can&#x27;t believe how it has lessened those annoying lines near my eyes and the ones appearing across my forehead.</li>
            <li> The value is great with this product.  Twice as much as most.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Great product - I saw results the first day using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only use this product a few days and not happy with the results!  I have broken out all over my face.  Will never order this again.  Much too harsh for my skin!</li>
            <li> Arrived timely. Good price. Have used for a month with Joba oil. Product feels light and my skin seems improved.</li>
            <li> Do you hate having  acne or age spots? Who does?  So I thought this would be a great product to try. I was not disappointed at all. I have been using it for almost a week now - I rub it on my face, forehead and neck and since I have started doing this my skin has not only cleared up quite a bit but also FEELS better. My skin tone is much more even and smooth looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle was quite a bit larger than I expected.  It has a fresh scent and it feels wonderful when it is put on your skin :) No pain or burning during application occurred. The serum itself is a milky white smooth and silky liquid. You just pull out the applicator, drip some of your finger and rub it into your face! Couldn&#x27;t be easier to apply and takes less than a minute to do. I always did it after I would get out of the shower because my face was nice and scrubbed and prepped for the application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a LOT of ways to reduce lines and dark spots on my face but nothing worked. I also have extremely sensitive skin and this had no ill effects on my skin at all!  The softness of my skin has been a great change! I have also heard a lot of good things about Hyaluronic Acid but this was my first chance to try it, and I can see why people are raving about it :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I would definitely give this product a HUGE thumbs up! Give it a shot, it&#x27;s not super-expensive and you have nothing to lose! Except maybe some acne or age spots!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product now for a month and I&#x27;m really happy with it. It takes away some of the redness I have from a permanent sunburn. It&#x27;s easy to apply and hasn&#x27;t made me break out like other products I used.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been buying any facial product besides&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t bought any facial product beside CA Botana products.  This time i give myself a trial on Vitamin C serum from Poppy Austin and I&#x27;m glad I did.  The skin is glowing, soft and silky.  Poppy Austin creates my confidence. I will try some other too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used almost half of my 2 oz. bottle of Poppy Austin Vit. C Serum. I can&#x27;t see any improvement in my complexion. When I&#x27;ve used my Retin-A Micro products (Rx) regularly in the past, the improvement is relatively dramatic. This serum has little to no effect that I can see. I use it on my face, neck, upper chest, where I have sun damage. I concentrate on the sides of my face in particular, where I have brown sun spots. No change. The serum has started getting cloudy, whereas it was clear when I opened the bottle. I decanted an ounce into a small dropper bottle I have, where it&#x27;s stored in my medicine cabinet. I left the other ounce in the original bottle in my fridge to retard spoilage. I notice it is very slightly cloudy, not bad at all. I think I&#x27;ll start keeping all bottles in the fridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll use the balance of this serum and report back if I see improvement. I did take photos of my face before I started use of the PA C serum, and will make a comparison when I&#x27;ve used up the entire 2 oz. If the change is extremely subtle over time, I&#x27;d appreciate knowing that, and I&#x27;d be pleased to even note subtle improvement in brown spots and pores. The photo comparison will help me determine any improvement. But after 1 oz, no joy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As background, I am a medium-fair caucasian female, age 55. I burn and tan easily and am prone to some freckling. I hope this helps others.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service thank you</li>
            <li> I love Vitamin C Serum. I will repeat this over and over until everyone knows! :)&lt;br /&gt;This particular product comes in a big brown glass bottle. I&#x27;m guessing the brown glass to help protect the oil inside from too much exposure to light. Smart idea.&lt;br /&gt;I love that it is made with natural ingredients and free from fillers, alcohol, artificial fragrances, and artificial colors. I also can&#x27;t help but love the fact that this company states that they test their products on themselves and not on animals. Awesome.&lt;br /&gt;As you can see from the first picture above, this Vitamin C Serum is slightly different as far as its appearance. This one is a very pale whitish color, whilst most other ones that I have tried have been a clear liquid. No artificial fragrance--no scent at all.&lt;br /&gt;The top is a dropper top which always works well for dispensing a small amount onto your fingertips. I apply it on my clean face and my skin absorbs it right away. No irritation, no feeling, nothing. It works as well as the others that I have tried. My skin looks brighter, clearer, more youthful, and just all around better.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with and so glad that I was sent such a big bottle so it will last for a long time!&lt;br /&gt;Do I recommend?? Of course! Once you try Vitamin C Serum, you&#x27;ll probably wonder why you didn&#x27;t start using it sooner...or at least that&#x27;s the case for me...&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love it. Vitamin C Serum has become a must have for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent a complimentary bottle, as I am a product reviewer, in exchange for my honest review. All of the opinions expressed here are solely my own and in no way influenced.</li>

It has made my skin so soft, I love the scent!!!&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using &amp;#60;a href&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;BOTTOM87bf97f8fd8489c0327c634f82ea5ab5&amp;#34; rel&#x3D;&amp;#34;nofollow&amp;#34;&amp;#62;Tomoson.com&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> Great product. It leaves the skin so soft and together with the retinol serum, I have noticed the fine lines disappearing as well.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it can be put on any part of my face and doesn&#x27;t sting, it&#x27;s texture isn&#x27;t oily or creamy, and it&#x27;s kind to my skin. I just finished my first bottle and purchased another bottle. I think it&#x27;s made a difference.</li>
            <li> Wonderful Vitamin c serum - plays nicely with all my other skin care and my skin is definitely brighter and clearer - will absolutely repurchase this.</li>
            <li> Love this vitamin C serum and use it nightly.  It is a great price for a quality product.  I have noticed a huge difference in my skin condition!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I use it after showering at night, before I put on my Retrieve cream. Love the huge bottle as I go through gallons of Vitamin C serum. It&#x27;s a bit thinner than what I&#x27;m used to, but half a syringe does my face, neck, d√©colletage and hands. My skin is smoother and brighter, and because the bottle is twice the size of the average Vitamin C serum, I&#x27;m not racing to buy more every few months. I bought two bottles, which should see me through to this time next year.</li>
            <li> The bottle is huge!  Twice the size that I was expecting. It&#x27;s a very high-quality product. I have extremely sensitive skin - just about anything makes me break out - but not this product. I&#x27;ve been using in nightly for about two weeks and I could not be happier.  I&#x27;ll definitely be reordering this one.</li>
            <li> I used a competitor for months but when the price went up, I was forced to find something more reasonably priced. Poppy Austin was something I came across and I am glad I did. It doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel tight, greasy, or make me break out, which is great. Great product and good size at a decent price!  I will definitely be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> Poppy Austin is the brand to trust! I have purchased many items from Poppy Austin - all live up to expectations and then some! As someone who has tried darn near every product - rest assured - you&#x27;ve fond what you need with Poppy Austin!</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product made of the finest quality, pure ingredients.  The entire Poppy Austin line is the best skin care line available.  Their all natural products rejuvenate your skin naturally &amp; show visible results for an extremely reasonable price.  Furthermore, the company donates a portion of the proceeds of EVERY bottle sold to a women&#x27;s charity in Morocco.  (Read all about it on the Poppy Austin website.)  You will love this product as well as their rose water toner, barbary fig oil and argan oil.  So glad I found these amazing products.  I will never switch skin care products again.  Use Vitamin C serum after cleansing your skin with rose water toner, then apply argan oil or barbary fig oil as a natural moisturizer.  I recommend argan during the day and barbary fig before bed (as it tends to make skin a bit shiny).</li>
            <li> Used this for the first time today and hoping it does the job! So far it feels great on my face. It&#x27;s a serum that gets absorbed quickly without leaving your face dry. My face feels smooth and fresh!</li>
            <li> A wonderful and affordable beauty product. I have also used the rose water, again just marvelous!  Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I was recommended this by my girl. I am trying to keep up with her. ;)&lt;br /&gt;So far so good.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product. My skin began showing an amazing positive difference after the first few days. I will order this again!!!</li>
            <li> Love the product and love the size!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this serum for one week and can already see my smiles lines fading.  My face feels healthier and it seems to glow!  I love this product and will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> Very good product and less expensive than others similar.  At this time I can not afford to use it but would buy it if I could afford it. Looking for less expensive skin tightners.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any changes on my skin yet, but probably I didn&#x27;t use it enough. Hope it works ;)</li>
            <li> I was really excited about receiving this product after reading all the great reviews but I was extremely disappointed. I&#x27;ve used Vit C serums before and as soon as you put them on your face it was instantly softer. I&#x27;ve used this product numerous times since receiving it and it completely dries up my face immediately. I do NOT recommend this product at all.</li>
            <li> I used to have bad acne that resulted in terrible scarring.  For a while I was using a different vitamin C serum and recently I decided to switch over to this one because it was a better value for the price.  I am pleasantly surprised and I do not regret my purchase! The serum is smooth and has the consistency of water and almost no scent to it.  I have been using it once daily and occasionally twice and I have noticed the same skin brightening effect and lightening of scars.  It reduces redness and any blotchiness of the skin.  This is a really high quality product with fantastic ingredients and I can tell that my skin loves it.</li>
            <li> Very liquidy, or more than I thought. Absorbs nicely. Great for oily skin types, but I love Estee Lauder&#x27;s Night Serum and I&#x27;m not sure if this one measures up.</li>
            <li> Love Poppy Austin&#x27;s product - this was recommended to me by my daughter</li>
            <li> The difference in my skin was visibly noticeable within a week . Great product</li>
            <li> Love this product, so easy to appy, doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, can apply moisturizer or makeup immediately. I use morning and night. Will re-order</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for two weeks, but I can already tell a difference</li>
            <li> Received Vitamin C Serum and Argan Oil by Poppy Austin last week. I was super excited to try it out...&lt;br /&gt;The Vitamin C Serum has a nice texture and no smell.&lt;br /&gt;And I must say, it really lives up to the hype! My skin is soft and glowing! After applying the Vitamin C Serum, I also pad some drops of Argan oil all over my face. I usually have oily combination skin, that&#x27;s prone to breakouts and since using these two products I haven&#x27;t had a single blemish. My skin is soft and hydrated without a greasy feel. I love this product and think it is the best beauty product I have bought in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I am a long time Clinique customer and have to honestly say, that none of their products have ever made my skin feel so beautiful. Thanks to Poppy Austin my skin feels lovely and it&#x27;s all natural without the harsh chemicals, that other companies use. I would definitely recommend this to a friend...&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;I love the Poppy Austin Vitamin C Serum so much, that I had to order it a second time...</li>
            <li> A good product and my face loves it.</li>
            <li> The serum lives up to its description.  It is double the size of other bottles or containers I have purchased for the same money.  My goal was to deliver 100% vit.C. to my face after cleansing in a.m. Then  in the p.m. use a Retinol Lotion. I read that this combination is very effective. I have only been doing this for over two weeks, but can notably tell the difference in fine lines around eyes and mouth and overall, my skin is smoother and &amp;#34;clearer&amp;#34;. (For some, doing C at night and lotion in morning works better. Make sure face is not warm when applying Vit. C serum) I will continue to do this combination, as I believe I am getting good results from this!</li>
            <li> I do not know if vitamin C really helps skin stay younger looking but I use it every day and my 79 year old skin is not tough looking as many others who live in FL. A dermatologist once told me I had great skin for my age.</li>
            <li> I love this product.Definitely will improve your skin giving you a more youthful appearance.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! I just love the way it makes my skin glow! When I combine it with the Poppy Austin Argan Oil it is a match made in Heaven!</li>
            <li> Waiting for the results!&lt;br /&gt;Great all</li>
            <li> Good product but the only results I noticed was that my skin was lightened. It did not help to fade my age spots and took a while to dry before I could apply my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love this serum... it makes my skin look and feel so wonderful and smooth!!!</li>
            <li> I liked the serum. It&#x27;s best suited for warmer months.</li>
            <li> Nice stuff. I have not had it long enough to see its full benefit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for a week and already see improvement in skin texture.  What I love best is how the skin immediately &#x27;drinks&#x27; it in, leaving no residue on the face.  The size of the bottle, larger than other serums, is also a plus.</li>
            <li> Love it, already see an improvement in my &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; skin&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this again</li>
            <li> In less than 2 weeks, I feel that I can see a difference in the overall feel and look of my skin.</li>
            <li> I know I will have a positive result , for I have used vitamin C before , and am poking forward to the benefits of the Hyaluronic acid , have kept my skin doing well using the products I know work .</li>
            <li> This is the best Vitamin C serum I have tried. Really diminishes the smaller wrinkles and leaves my skin very smooth. Great value as well. I will be trying other Poppy Austin products soon.</li>
