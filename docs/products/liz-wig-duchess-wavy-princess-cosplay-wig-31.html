            <li>LOVE THE COLOR OF THE WIG...</li>
            <li>Its really soft and bouncy looks just like the picture the bangs are longer which I liked because I can cut them into my own style!</li>
            <li>I loved this wig at first, but after a week it was tangled.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the way it looks, and it shipped on time :)</li>
            <li>Very well made and looks good.</li>
            <li>Delivered to me extremely quick and looks exactly like the picture to the T. Color and style is so rich and gorgeous.  </li>

            <li>It looks great, its the same as the picture!!</li>
            <li>I was very impressed with the rich, vibrant, wine red color.</li>
            <li>AND THAT I PUT IN A NICE BEAUTIFUL THICK SILKY EXTENSIONS</li>
            <li>Super long, bouncy and Color is beautiful.</li>
            <li>love the way it looks real, and how rich the color is in the sun.</li>

            <li>HOW REALISTIC THE TOP IS.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful quality in comparison to my more expensive wig.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>And it arrived so quickly.</li>
            <li>; ) HOPE THIS HELPED LADIES!</li>
            <li>MANY COMPLIMENTS QAS TOLD MY HAIR LOOKS SO FULL AND BEAUTIFUL DARK RED COLOURS!</li>
            <li>Just a warning, if you do wash/soak it, the color bleeds a little as I think it is dyed, but still a great color and curls.</li>
            <li>Very breathable, which is important on stage!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it completely.</li>
            <li>I got them today and this one is by far my favorite of the three.</li>
            <li>and I think you would have to really try to have the wig cap show through and the red color is just gorgeous.</li>
            <li>It was a nice darker red, which I wanted.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful deep red as shown in the photo.</li>
            <li>Great color but fits small.</li>
            <li>Thick and beautiful.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this wig!!</li>
            <li>Once I did that it basically looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>I am going to order several more wigs from this seller this week.</li>
            <li>This is my first wig</li>
            <li>Soft and light.</li>
            <li>Thanks for taking the time to read my review!</li>
            <li>I will be buying more in different colors.</li>
            <li>Loved this wig, I would wear it everyday if I could get away with it.</li>
            <li>but that is nothing major and easily remedied.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was under no obligation to post a review or give positive feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>bought this when they displayed different pictures, and while I like that they are now using more accurate pictures for the wig, I feel the current pictures don&#x27;t do it justice at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>while I know you can easily find it online, each wig manufacture is different and you don&#x27;t know if the advise you get online will work.</li>
            <li>i just put some some powder on it to make it a little less shinny,other than that it is great!</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m very picky and scared</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li>i never expect much when i order wigs off line because i am ordering them for 1 time use but this is a wig you can wear</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Even though this is synthetic hair, it feels and styles like real.</li>
            <li>It arrived really protected.</li>
            <li>The lace that holds the wefts together seems to be of good quality and the hair is REALLY THICK.</li>
            <li>Wow!!!</li>
            <li>Came in a very timely manner and does not melt under high heat.</li>
            <li>The only reason i gave it 2 stars is it is true to color and length</li>
            <li>I LIVE IN CALIFORNIA, GOT IT IN 3-4 DAYS !</li>
            <li>i go out already did up without trying to bond in new extensions and damaging my real hair keeping it from growing.</li>
            <li>so it looks realistic.</li>
            <li>The color is a lovely deep wine red.</li>
            <li>The skin top makes it look fairly natural, there&#x27;s not much shine to it</li>
            <li>Recommend highly.</li>
            <li>VERY EARLY</li>
            <li>THE LAYERS ARE CUT PROFESSIONALLY!</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t as full as it looks in the picture, but otherwise it was well made, and I didn&#x27;t shed as much as other wigs.</li>
            <li>I try to provide you with simple reviews that get straight to the point without a lot of jargon or repeating the product description.</li>
            <li>I flat ironed it and gave it a little trim to better suit my character...</li>
            <li>This is a very affordable wig and it looks more expensive than it is.</li>
            <li>I needed to look a little older and very done-up.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve had a lot more trouble with other wigs.</li>
            <li>when or where ever it looks natural the red isnt too red and it fits well.</li>

            <li> when or where ever it looks natural the red isnt too red and it fits well.</li>
            <li> The bangs are a little funky &amp; I had to trim them but other than that the hair was soft &amp; looked real.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pregnant and tired all the time</li>
            <li> The hair comes in ringlets that are clearly designed to be finger or wide tooth combed down to personal preference.</li>
            <li> i figured i might as well buy a wig that wasnt expensive and not to cheap.</li>
            <li> Had to trim the bangs because they were too long</li>
            <li> The hair came earlier then expected !</li>
            <li> THE ONLY THING IS ITS SLIGHTLY SHINY .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little coarse and seems to tangle but for every day wear</li>
            <li> a a little too long</li>
            <li> i was going to buy a product thAt was just a waste of money and looked fmvery fake poor quality and wasnt able to use daily...</li>
            <li> I ordered three wigs off amazon the other day.</li>

            <li> Okay so ive been using extensions for over 6 yrs and I&#x27;m now going to turn 25 in two weeks. I&#x27;m pregnant and tired all the time so i needed something i can throw on Everytime i go out already did up without trying to bond in new extensions and damaging my real hair keeping it from growing. Since december ive been thinking and looking at all these hair products.trust me, I&#x27;m very picky and scared i was going to buy a product thAt was just a waste of money and looked fmvery fake poor quality and wasnt able to use daily... i figured i might as well buy a wig that wasnt expensive and not to cheap. THIS WIG IS PERFECT! I RECIEVED IT VERY EARLY I LIVE IN CALIFORNIA, GOT IT IN 3-4 DAYS ! I WORE IT OUT THIS MORNING TO MY DOCTORS APPOINTMENT AND GOT WAY TO MANY COMPLIMENTS QAS TOLD MY HAIR LOOKS SO FULL AND BEAUTIFUL DARK RED COLOURS! EVERYONE THOUGHT THIS WASNT A WIG AND THAT I PUT IN A NICE BEAUTIFUL THICK SILKY EXTENSIONS THATS HOW REALISTIC THE TOP IS. I CAN PUT MY BANGS IN EITHER DIRECTION. THE LAYERS ARE CUT PROFESSIONALLY! IT MADE ME FEEL SO BEAUTIFUL! THANK YOU. PLUS THIS WAS PACKAGED PERFECTLY. THE CAP OF THE WIG IS SO COMFORTABLE AND YOU CAN ADJUST IT!I HAVE SO MANY GOOD THINGS TO SAY! IM GLAD MY FIRST WIG WAS A SUCCESSFUL CHOICE! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND! THE ONLY THING IS ITS SLIGHTLY SHINY . JUST A TAD BIT BUT NOT A BIG DEAL WHATSOEVER! THIS WIG IS JUST SO FULL AND STAYS ON PERFECTLY WHERE I CAN PIN IT UP IF I WANT AND OR WEAR IT TO THE SIDE AND ITS JUST AS BEAUTIFUL! I WANT ANOTHER WIG FRON THIS COMPANY SO BAD NOW! IM SO HAPPY AND WILL BE POSTING PICS IN A COUPLE DAYS ; ) HOPE THIS HELPED LADIES!</li>
            <li> Absolutely Awesome wig. Delivered to me extremely quick and looks exactly like the picture to the T. Color and style is so rich and gorgeous.  I&#x27;m in love lol I definitely will purchase again!!!!</li>
            <li> Love it!! Wigs perfect</li>
            <li> beautiful color!! N looks great with my complexion!! Highly recommend this wig!!</li>
            <li> The worst wig ever!!!!!! I hate it</li>
            <li> Its beautiful.  I love itðŸ’–</li>
            <li> I love it completely. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the one clip in the back broke but I was able to keep it still with bobby pins. Even my boyfriend loves it :)</li>
            <li> Great color but fits small.</li>
            <li> I got it today and omg it&#x27;s beautiful real looking just what I was looking for !!! Thank you!!! 10 stars if I could!</li>
            <li> Words cannot express how much I love this wig! It styles easily with low heat and fits great. It tangles after wearing it for a while so it looks realistic. Had to trim the bangs because they were too long but otherwise this is a fabulous wig for the price! The color is a lovely deep wine red.</li>
            <li> I wore this wig everyday for about 6 months. Fannncccyyy! I loved it. Thick and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Pretty color and a great grade of synthetic wig.  You get more bang for your buck with this wig. Perfect.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as full as it looks in the picture, but otherwise it was well made, and I didn&#x27;t shed as much as other wigs. I have a lot of hair and I managed to put it on correctly after a few tries, I&#x27;ve had a lot more trouble with other wigs.</li>
            <li> Stunning! the color is perfect! It&#x27;s a beautiful deep red as shown in the photo. It is long and thick. It tangles easily, but is wonderful for photo shoots. I recommend this 100%!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this as one of the better wigs on Amazon. Just a warning, if you do wash/soak it, the color bleeds a little as I think it is dyed, but still a great color and curls.</li>
            <li> The hair came earlier then expected ! Its really soft and bouncy looks just like the picture the bangs are longer which I liked because I can cut them into my own style! Great product will order from you again</li>
            <li> i never expect much when i order wigs off line because i am ordering them for 1 time use but this is a wig you can wear when or where ever it looks natural the red isnt too red and it fits well. i got it to take selfies with and i got a lot of likes with this wig and so did my friend lol!</li>
            <li> I ordered three wigs off amazon the other day. I got them today and this one is by far my favorite of the three. The hair comes in ringlets that are clearly designed to be finger or wide tooth combed down to personal preference. Once I did that it basically looks exactly like the picture. No games with Liz Mall. These guys know their stuff. The lace that holds the wefts together seems to be of good quality and the hair is REALLY THICK. I bought it for everyday wearing purposes as my hair is in the awkward in between stage from a pixie cut I got a couple years back and I want to not want to cut my hair. This wig is going to help me with that loads. The skin top makes it look fairly natural, there&#x27;s not much shine to it and I think you would have to really try to have the wig cap show through and the red color is just gorgeous. I am going to order several more wigs from this seller this week. I can&#x27;t wait to wear this out tomorrow. It makes me feel like a princess! I LOVE THIS WIG. It&#x27;s a little coarse and seems to tangle but for every day wear that&#x27;s a good thing because no one&#x27;s hair is super perfect. Recommend highly.</li>
            <li> Love it!  I wore this to a Halloween party and everyone kept asking me if I colored my hair.  I flat ironed it and gave it a little trim to better suit my character...it turned out awesome!  Great price, excellent quality.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Great value and my daughter loved it for her costume.</li>
            <li> Never thought ill wear a wig but i love this product. #Flawless</li>
            <li> Came in a very timely manner and does not melt under high heat. Lovelovelove!</li>
            <li> Good quality, but not what I was hoping for. I won&#x27;t be wearing this out anytime soon. Won&#x27;t be ordering again</li>
            <li> This is my first wig so I have nothing to compare it to, my hair is very short, cut like a guys and this makes me feels feminine again ^-^ I really enjoy the way it looks, and it shipped on time :) I say buy it.</li>
            <li> Loved this wig, I would wear it everyday if I could get away with it.</li>
            <li> This is a very affordable wig and it looks more expensive than it is. Very well made and looks good.</li>
            <li> It looks great, its the same as the picture!! Soft and light. Can&#x27;t wait to wear it.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful wig, I love the way it feels. It&#x27;s wonderful quality in comparison to my more expensive wig.&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have with it are the bangs a a little too long but that is nothing major and easily remedied.&lt;br /&gt;I love the way it looks real, and how rich the color is in the sun. The curls are nice and the wig doesn&#x27;t seem to shed too much which is great. I can&#x27;t wait to do my cosplay.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this when they displayed different pictures, and while I like that they are now using more accurate pictures for the wig, I feel the current pictures don&#x27;t do it justice at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*EDIT*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also while I know you can easily find it online, each wig manufacture is different and you don&#x27;t know if the advise you get online will work. But I would have liked if it came with care instructions like how to brush it and what not. But this is just a personal preference.</li>
            <li> I just received this wig in the mail all the way from China. I LOVE the color! It does feel a little synthetic just needs some wigs spray before wear to soften. I wear wigs all the time, so I would say I&#x27;m an expert. Super long, bouncy and Color is beautiful.</li>
            <li> I picked up this wig for my last show, it was awesome. I loved the color and it was so easy to style. I needed to look a little older and very done-up. Even though this is synthetic hair, it feels and styles like real. Very breathable, which is important on stage!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure - I received this product in exchange for an honest review. All thoughts, opinions and ratings are my own.

            <li> Great wig! I love it! i just put some some powder on it to make it a little less shinny,other than that it is great!</li>
            <li> Great wig, minimal styling needed. Is my go to wig for now until I can afford better.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE CUSTOMER SERVICES... LOVE THE COLOR OF THE WIG... ITS FITS PERFECT.. I GONNA GIVE YOU A 5 STAR</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with the rich, vibrant, wine red color. It was a nice darker red, which I wanted. The bangs are a little funky &amp; I had to trim them but other than that the hair was soft &amp; looked real. It&#x27;s not shiny, which I thought it might be sice its synthetic.</li>
            <li> I loved this wig at first, but after a week it was tangled. When I tried to brush it, all it did was make the hair come out and damage it. It made it frizzy and damaged looking. I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Wow!!! This is just like the picture. It arrived really protected. No knots, tangles or anything. I love it! And it arrived so quickly. Same day!</li>
            <li> I love this wig! It fit perfectly and the color is just as stunning in person. I will be buying more in different colors.</li>
            <li> very cheesy looking. dont like it at all.  The only reason i gave it 2 stars is it is true to color and length</li>
