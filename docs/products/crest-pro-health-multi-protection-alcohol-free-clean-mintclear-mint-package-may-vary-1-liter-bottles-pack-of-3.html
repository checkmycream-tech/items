            <li>The taste is great</li>
            <li>Great concept, great idea but misses the mark with the staining issue.</li>

            <li>It works great and does the cleaning without all the alcohol burn and aftertaste.</li>
            <li>So for me, mouthwash has always been nice in the aspect that it freshens breath, but it has been a pain because it does not feel the greatest to use.</li>
            <li>and i think the price is great for this one.</li>

            <li>Still has the great Mint flavor, not overpowering.</li>

            <li>The crest brand has some good products...</li>
            <li>I do everthing I can to keep my teeth in good condition.  </li>
            <li>I am in good health otherwise.</li>
            <li>The taste is really good and it makes my teeth feel alot cleaner than just brushing them alone.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a good mouthwash</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this wonderful product.  </li>
            <li>So, the flavor is good.</li>
            <li>Used this to help my gums so I could look good for the dentist again.</li>
            <li>It had a good taste.</li>
            <li>It also makes me feel good to know that it is protecting my teeth.</li>
            <li>Providing the protection i needed and the best part is it is alcohol free</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really good about brushing/flossing</li>
            <li>but it wouldn&#x27;t be fair to do that</li>

            <li>The price is fair.  </li>
            <li>Really good mouth wash.</li>
            <li>But it good.</li>
            <li>IF CREST WAS GOOD FOR MY TEETH</li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>I received my free sample of Crest Pro-Health and it is the best I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>My husband has used it and loved it.</li>
            <li>The Clean Mint flavor is the best I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not being paid to write a review, when I tried this mouthwash I was very happy with the taste and how clean my mouth felt.</li>
            <li>Woke up this morning with a strong metallic taste in my mouth, and despite brushing my teeth twice today (soon after i woke up, and after lunch), i still can&#x27;t taste any of my food, and not just any food, but spicy Thai food and chocolate ice cream!!</li>
            <li>When I use this in the mornings I honestly don&#x27;t have to worry about it - it keeps my breath smelling nice!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad product, although, I won&#x27;t say it is the best either.</li>
            <li>but it DOES make breath smell nice for some time and has a pleasant (gentle/non-harsh) feel while using.</li>
            <li>I also love being able to use a great tasting mouthwash without feeling the tear inducing burn!</li>
            <li>The best part is that it kept my teeth feeling nice and clean all day even after eating sweets.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s healthy for you and it feels great doing it by the comfort of ones home.</li>
            <li>My very favorite thing is that it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; my mouth when I use it.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for quite some time and am very pleased with the feeling I get after using it.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my breath fresh, and even greatly decreases the ever-dreaded morning breath!</li>
            <li>It leaves my mouth feeling fresh and tastes great!</li>
            <li>My daughter even uses this product, I would rec this to anyone looking for a great mouthwash and not to mention its alcohol free too!</li>
            <li>It doesnt burn my mouth which I LOVE and doesnt taste putrid.. just a great mint flavor.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very refreshing.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the flavor!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am very pleased with the toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I have been using the mouth wash and am very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>Minty fresh breath is the best and this will do the job.</li>
            <li>I received this Crest Pro - Health Multi -Protection Alcohol  as a sample and was very pleased .</li>
            <li>It makes me feel so fresh and my breath smells great.!</li>
            <li>I liked the minty taste and loved the fact that I didn&#x27;t feel like I was swishing rubbing alcohol around in my mouth.</li>
            <li>so I realized the best time to use is right before going to bed.</li>
            <li>so there is no burn, but I get a great clean feel!</li>
            <li>Buy it, try it -YOU&#x27;LL LOVE IT!</li>

            <li>I have 2 unopened bottles of this junk sitting upstairs and can&#x27;t even give it away free to someone with good conscience.</li>
            <li>If this was a completely natural product then I would have found my perfect match!</li>
            <li>but so far, I have had nothing but perfect results with this mouthwash.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone my teeth feel great and my breath is always fresh.  </li>
            <li>An amazing free offer as a BzzAgent!</li>
            <li>If not, then the product could be a good fit for you.</li>
            <li>The kind of stains that no whitening strip or brushing has been able to help remove.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to use my electric toothbrush while it healed and had to use a manual one; not as effective at cleaning.</li>
            <li>o)I have tried a lot of mouthwashes in my day and this is by far one of the best!</li>
            <li>I also like the fact that it helps keep my mouth feeling fresh all day, and my breath smells great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s alcohol free and makes for a much more pleasant rinsing experience.</li>
            <li>super happy it is alcohol free!</li>
            <li>This mouthwash is great, the flavor is good not burning like alot of other mouthwashes out there,#crest-pro-health is welcome at my home</li>
            <li>It is the most refreshing, clean feeling I&#x27;ve ever experienced from a mouthwash that lasts for hours.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample from Smiley360 and my opinions are my own, but I love the product!  </li>
            <li>I strongly advise you NOT to use this mouthwash!</li>
            <li>No stinging just a refreshed feeling with a good clean taste</li>
            <li>Second, the mouthwash tastes great and smells great as well.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t get a good, clean feeling using this.</li>
            <li>Absolutly love crest pro health it leaves my mouth feeling fresh and breath smelling great</li>
            <li>It just leaves a good, clean taste and feeling.</li>
            <li>i was quiet impressed with the nice mint taste and it doesnt have the alcohol in it.</li>
            <li>I loved the taste of the clean mint.  </li>
            <li>The taste is good and it keeps my mouth clean.</li>
            <li>although I generally don&#x27;t use the Crest line up, I received a bottle of crest pro health mouth wash through BzzAgent and am very impressed.</li>
            <li>I was very happy to see an alcohol free mouth wash that is safe for the whole family to use.</li>
            <li>I received a free bottle of Crest Pro Health mouth wash from Smiley360 and am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>I received a free bottle of Crest Pro Health mouth wash from Smiley360 and am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>The first night I used it, I thought it was great.  </li>
            <li>First of all, my sympathies for those who have experienced problems with this product.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t been able to find one I liked for so many years, and then when this came out - it&#x27;s not my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with my results and I will be purchasing Crest Pro Health when my free bottle runs out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a sweet mint flavor and it keeps my mouth tasting good for awhile after I use it.</li>
            <li>so that is great although I think that the ment taste is a bit to strong for my liking by love the product I got my full sized bottle for bzzagent</li>
            <li>Most of them were too strong for me; they would make my mouth burn and my eyes water!</li>
            <li>Oral Health is something I find very important.</li>
            <li>I also think it is very important that it kills germs, prevents gingivitis, keeps teeth cleaner, and reduces plaque buildup.</li>
            <li>I really liked that it was not to strong</li>
            <li>As a smoker sometimes i need a quick fix to get rid of the smells of cigarettes breathe , and crest did a good job of doing that in one rinse.</li>
            <li>Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34; Crest Pro-Health has a pleasant minty taste and leaves my mouth feeling fresh for hours without the burn of alcohol.</li>
            <li>I received a free bottle of this through Bzz agent and I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I received a free sample from Crest and Bzz agent to try and I have to say I love it!</li>
            <li>The feeling that i have while i feel the mouthwash working on my teeth and gums is very refreshing and powerful!</li>
            <li>This mouthwash is really great- not too strong of an alcohol taste and leaves your mouth fresh until lunch.</li>
            <li>, That most importantly is alcohol free!!</li>
            <li>So fresh and so clean !!!</li>
            <li>It has a very nice, clean, unique flavor that doesn&#x27;t burn my mouth.</li>
            <li>I certainly haven&#x27;t experienced any staining, and I&#x27;ve used this product for about a month.</li>
            <li>I loved the tingly feeling and that it is alcohol free is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>It is not an overload like most mouthwashes are.  </li>
            <li>like with most mouthwashes.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Listerine would be a better choice if you have gum problems.</li>
            <li>Please don&#x27;t change it - my healthy mouth</li>
            <li>My husband and I LOVE this mouthwash.</li>

            <li>My best friend is in his final year as a dental student.  </li>
            <li>Use the Act mouthwash in the morning because it has a really potent amount of fluoride in it</li>
            <li>but my friend convinced me that the Oral-B Triumph cleans better and it does if you do the research.  </li>
            <li>I would trust any bottle with the seal in tact that you purchased from a reputable store.</li>
            <li>but he won&#x27;t do it for free!  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;d leave stains and burn off taste buds just like Crest, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;d be cheaper.</li>

            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and I always use a fluoride rinse after brushing to help keep my teeth healthy for the duration.</li>
            <li>My dentist was able to remove almost all of the stain with a Prophy jet appliance (like getting your teeth sandblasted)</li>
            <li>My kids (9 &amp; 7) love the minty flavor.</li>
            <li>and i honestly love this product.</li>

            <li>But the thing I&#x27;m most pleased with is that this does not hurt my teeth.</li>
            <li>Even so, that side effect should be listed much more prominantly.  </li>
            <li>Does it ever get better?</li>
            <li>Mouthwash is my favorite.</li>
            <li>and now that I see it has caused this for so many people I am going to discontinue use</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love that it contains no burning alcohol.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t impressed and found that I needed to brush my teeth more regularly to prevent any stains that might appear.</li>

            <li>Received this product free from Smiley360 and love it.  </li>
            <li>Maybe they&#x27;ve changed the formula or there was some sort of smear campaign because I received a full size free bottle to try and give my HONEST opinion</li>
            <li>I liked the flavor (fresh mint)</li>
            <li>This mouthwash really does taste good and it does not burn, probably because it is alcohol-free,  </li>
            <li>I loved this flavor just as much as the \\&quot;tartar protection\\</li>

            <li>I will be switching to the full line of Pro-Health products way to go Crest!  </li>
            <li>I used an Oral B rinse for about six months with excellent results but it was recalled due to manufacturing problems.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when BzzAgent sent me Crest Pro-Health mouthwash to try for free!</li>
            <li>So I received a full size, bottle of this mouthwash from BzzAgent a couple weeks ago!</li>
            <li>But no worries, my breath is still cool!</li>
            <li>and it doesnt burn my mouth and no bad breath!</li>
            <li>the taste is refreshing and clean, doesn&#x27;t burn.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are clean and gums healthy.  </li>
            <li>so my 3 year old can use it now, and learn how important having great oral hygiene is.</li>
            <li>The taste is actually very mild.</li>
            <li>This mouthwash helps a lot in getting cleansing easily done, so I do not have to brush my teeth all the time.</li>
            <li>Also when you analyze the bottle you can see a 24HR protection symbol which I really trust for Crest being an exceptional brand but</li>
            <li>I received Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Refreshing Clean Mint Rinse as a part of a BzzCampaign.</li>
            <li>There is a mark on the inside of the cap for easy measuring with no guessing.</li>
            <li>My mouth felt more clean then ever before.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t any bitterness or acidity and it feels very mild on my mouth while still freshening.</li>
            <li>Health Rinse leaves a film on the teeth that is easily stained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the bottle design and the easy to use cap.</li>
            <li>your products are supposed to clean teeth, not make more work for the dentist.  </li>

            <li>I absolutely love the taste and clean feeling</li>
            <li>feeling which is a plus if you don&#x27;t like strong mouthwash.</li>
            <li>But I give it four stars because the taste is too strong for me to rinse for over 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Crest rinse doesn&#x27;t have a strong after taste or burn when rinsing.</li>
            <li>NOT TO STRONG</li>
            <li>It does not have a strong burning taste like</li>
            <li>The taste isn&#x27;t too strong, yet it works wonders.  </li>
            <li>The mint flavor is not too strong.</li>
            <li>She strongly suggested switching to Listerine Zero.</li>
            <li>I love the taste and the way it makes my whole mouth feel very clean!</li>
            <li>It has a very pleasant flavor and absolutely no alcohol &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>The first time feeling was so amazing....</li>
            <li>My semi-annual cleanings are stellar -- almost no plaque, three cavities in my life, and all my own teeth.</li>
            <li>We love the alcohol free, fresh taste!</li>
            <li>I received a full bottle to test and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>The feel that I have after rinsing an leaving my teeth feel fresh and clean is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Through my Smiley360 membership, I was given a free sample of Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Rinse â\\&quot; Refreshing Clean Mint to try and review.</li>
            <li>Love the clean feeling I have throughout the day after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li>For best results, use it with REACH floss handles to get in between the teeth and down the gum line.</li>
            <li>They should put a large font WARNING sign on the Front of the bottle \\&quot;IN MOST CASES, WILL CAUSE BROWN TEETH\\&quot;!  </li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t have the burn of alcohol, and my mouth still feels fresh and clean!</li>
            <li>Crest Pro-health is a great tasting mouthwash that makes my teeth feel extra clean!  </li>
            <li>It worked great and left my mouth feeling clean without the burn!</li>
            <li>did a campaign on this FINE product as a bzz</li>
            <li>I believe it&#x27;s just another fine quality product from Crest!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then I read the fine print on the bottle</li>
            <li>My experience with Crest Pro Health has been nothing less that Great!</li>
            <li>I love the refreshing taste that leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>At first, I really enjoyed this mouthwash, because it seemed so potent.</li>
            <li>It started out fine.</li>
            <li>Once a day is fine.  </li>
            <li>then you will be fine with this product.</li>
            <li>and then sand-blasted with a sodium bicarbonate fine powder.</li>
            <li>Fortunately I&#x27;ve heard these stains can be easily removed at the dentist.</li>
            <li>Strong oral hygiene is so important and can prevent heart disease.</li>
            <li>Besides the staining, she also said I had a ton of plaque and tartar buildup, so the mouthwash doesn&#x27;t even do an adequate cleaning job!</li>
            <li>and they enjoy the flavor saying its not too strong like others</li>
            <li>Crest now has a loyal customer for life!</li>
            <li>It still does the job with the great freshness and no long term staining.</li>
            <li>and if ya brush well before using it won&#x27;t burn so much like most say it those trust me!</li>
            <li>It definitely doesn&#x27;t burn, which is a good thing for me, and tastes pretty good.  </li>
            <li>And now that I am pregnant, my dental care is even more important.  </li>
            <li>my smile is very important to me</li>
            <li>All that being said, it&#x27;s effective, lasts a good while and tastes less medicinal than most mouthwash.</li>
            <li>love that its alcohol free leaves me feeling fresh and clean without the burn of most mouthwashes i highly recommend thank you bzzagent for sending this to me for free to try this is my honest opinion</li>

            <li>I feel that a once a day use is doing so many positive things for my teeth and mouth.  </li>
            <li>I began using Crest for two reasons, first my son&#x27;s dentist recommended it because his teeth do not have a good coating of enamel and second because I wanted a product that would keep my teeth healthy.  </li>

            <li>Crest Pro-Health Alcohol Free u get the clean of Creating without the burn of the alcohol it leaves your mouth refreshingly clean and breath amazingly fresh</li>
            <li>So perhaps this crest one isn&#x27;t as effective (due to being alcohol-free) but it does freshen my mouth/breath and is a nice flavor.</li>

            <li>Love this mouthwash really gets your teeth clean w.o the burn.</li>
            <li>Even though I received my bottle from Smiley360 for free, I have checked the price out and it is priced decently well for the top quality product I have found it to be.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used this for about 5 days now and my breath has been good all day, even the next morning, and my teeth FEEL clean after I brush.</li>
            <li>The blue Clean Mint is effective but doesn&#x27;t take nearly as good as the Clear Mint.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels so clean aftwr swishing and its a great flavor and ny breath smells fresh for so long!</li>
            <li>Thanks to Crest, I got to try this product full size for FREE!</li>
            <li>I was curious to know if anyone else experienced this</li>
            <li>It has a taste of mint and it didn&#x27;t burn at all, my mouth felt fresh all day and my breath smelled fantastic.</li>
            <li>I noticed my mouth feels fresher longer, the taste is better than most available mouthwashes on the market, and my entire mouth feels cleaner after using.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s pretty harsh for most people, but I&#x27;ve always kind of liked it.  </li>
            <li>However, this time around I figured maybe that burning sensation wouldn&#x27;t be such a good idea on tender gums, so I tried this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Crest Pro-Health Whitening Toothpaste, 4.2-Ounce Carton (Pack of 6),   2.  ACT Restoring Mouthwash, Cool Splash Mint, 18-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 4)   3.  </li>
            <li>Cool.  </li>
            <li>When there are most days where i don&#x27;t want feel the intense burn from Listerine</li>
            <li>are cool,</li>
            <li>I received a full size sample of Crest Pro-health from BZZAgent as a promotion.</li>
            <li>I recently tried this product and loved it.</li>
            <li>It also gave me a good report from the last dentist appt.  </li>
            <li>Crest pro health has made my teeth look really white and my breath smell good.</li>
            <li>Better still, stay away from this product and keep a close eye on Crest and Proctor and Gamble products for those tiny warning labels that may contain the most important information of all.</li>
            <li>i recieved this full size product for review by Bzzagent.</li>
            <li>I feel like this is a way to con customers into purchasing their whitening products once they&#x27;ve ruined your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll never use any crest product ever again - there is a market full of competitors</li>
            <li>I received the full size sample as a bzzagent</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn my mouth and it is a lot easier to rinse for the full recommended 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>I got to test Crest Pro-Health Multi -Protection Alcohol free Mouthwash,  through Buzzagent, its fresh and minty without the burn.</li>
            <li>After more than 48 hours the symptoms have not decreased at all.</li>
            <li>I stopped using it and after a full day my symptoms went away.  </li>
            <li>I take good care of my teeth by brushing, flossing and regularly using a Sulca Brush.</li>
            <li>The cool minty taste leaves</li>
            <li>I received a full size bottle through bzzagent.</li>
            <li>I had been using this since around June 2014 after I got my wisdom teeth out and was looking for a more gentle wash while my mouth recovered.  </li>
            <li>however I received it FREE to try for myself from Smile 360.  </li>
            <li>to recently, I was using another brand of mouthwash which produced moderately good results.</li>
            <li>This product is outstanding for the whole family.</li>
            <li>a cap full for the full water pick load works well.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Crest for sending me a free sample!</li>
            <li>Using windex would be just as good as using this blue devil&#x27;s liquid</li>
            <li>Crest pro health has made my teeth look really white and my breath smell good.</li>
            <li>and my mouth/teeth felt super clean</li>
            <li>They sent me a full size product.</li>
            <li>Overall it is a good mouthwash.</li>
            <li>I was able to sample this product thanks to bzzagent and crest.</li>
            <li>and I have had no problems not bad burning with this products.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no bad aftertaste.  </li>
            <li>I will have to say the taste was not bad</li>
            <li>It leaves your breath refreshed and it has no bad after taste.  </li>
            <li>I like the minty taste and for a rinse its not bad.</li>
            <li>but right now I&#x27;m pretty safe from the brown teeth scare.</li>
            <li>I know my dentist is going to love me on my next visit because my mouth is in such good shape!</li>
            <li>i mean not the greatest</li>
            <li>My co-workers and friends have noticed a huge difference in my self esteem and how I am much more open to trying new things, all because my mouth feels clean and healthy!</li>
            <li>There is no alcohol burn like you get from other mouthwashes so my kids happily used it as well.</li>
            <li>Their wording, like that of their response to customers, might be technically true but, in my opinion, doesn&#x27;t leave the average reader with an accurate perception of the risks and of the prospects for successful treatment.    </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced the brown spots other reviewers have mentioned, but it does make me concerned and unsure if I will continue using it.  </li>
            <li>Now given that I paid a lot of money for my smile (braces), I like to take care of that smile, too!</li>

            <li>It is extraordinary.</li>
            <li>I needed a mouthwash to help with mild gingivitis</li>
            <li>It DOES say on the bottle that any antimicrobial product may cause stains, that the stains are not harmful or permanent, and adequate brushing or a visit to the dentist will remove them.  </li>
            <li>It acknowledges that the product can stain teeth, but with \\&quot;adequate brushing\\&quot; it \\&quot;may be prevented.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>, feel that feeling of cleanliness in my mouth and that I don&#x27;t feel that i am burning my lips is extraordinary,</li>
            <li>After reading about the brown teeth, I examined my own teeth and realized that my teeth were indeed tinged a light brown on the sides - after only one use!</li>
            <li>Since the company that sells this product doesn&#x27;t have the decency to adequately warn consumers, I advise people to avoid buying this bottle of acid altogether.</li>
            <li>These were delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>:) I even got to try it as a promotion although I&#x27;ll be for sure buying some in the future!</li>
            <li>do to I received a free bottle of it through bazzagent.com campaign #GotItFree to help promote this product and my own personal experience.</li>
            <li>Loved using it before bed and waking up the next morning with a fresh minty taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s embarrassing and I researched to find out what could have caused this so quickly with no diet changes.</li>
            <li>I actually like this one more than most.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s super affordable.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly like not being able to taste chocolate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The taste would make me want to throw up, even before I was pregnant.  </li>
            <li>I think as you use it regularly, the effects become better and better.  </li>
            <li>In that time, I&#x27;ve had unsightly brown staining between teeth that accumulated quickly between dental cleanings.</li>
            <li>I Can deal with a mild burn for 10 seconds since I</li>
            <li>Luckily I didn&#x27;t have to pay for this.</li>
            <li>My dental hygienist told me today what caused it and (thank goodness) took an extra 20 minutes to clean my teeth and make sure it was all taken off!  </li>
            <li>i enjoy that one very much.</li>
            <li>It really does get your mouth clean!</li>

            <li>I really liked this mouth rinse better than some other mouth washes I have tried.</li>
            <li>Got this mouthwash free from BzzAgent.com thanks to CREST for providing it!  </li>
            <li>but I know that it could be better since I have use other products from Crest that leave and amazing after taste like the Crest Be toothpastes.</li>
            <li>Initially, I was very pleased with this--it didn&#x27;t sting like those based on alcohol.  </li>
            <li>I noticed after the very first time of using this that I lost my sense of taste for 12+ hours.</li>
            <li>I am trying this product free thanks to Crest and BzzAgent!</li>
            <li>I have been using it twice a day and am very satisfied with the overall results.  </li>
            <li>Overall this is 1 of my very favorite mouth washes period on the market at this time.</li>
            <li>was pleased to have the opportunity to use the Pro-Health Multi-Protection Rinse in conjunction with my normal Pro-Health Whitening Toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>as some other reviews stated and it works great leaving your mouth feeling fresh without any burn.</li>
            <li>Overall i&#x27;m very satisfied and will continue using the product.</li>
            <li>leaves cool ,fresh feeling after each rinse.</li>
            <li>The taste keeps you breath smelling good for 24 hours as long as you use it</li>
            <li>I have long since loved using Crest products, and this mouth wash did not disappoint.</li>
            <li>The moss weakens the rock because of the roots but take the rock out of the water and in to the sun and the moss dies and turns dark but then can be easily scraped off leaving a more healthy rock or in this case</li>
            <li>(doesn&#x27;t seem to be from the volume of complaints that I find online--there are surely many more who have not complained online) and even that this is a good sign of dead bacteria!  </li>
            <li>I used to use Crest toothpaste (until now), and as for mouthwash, had tried Listerine before this (which I found fairly strong, a little too strong for my taste), and Closys (which I really liked as it did not contain alcohol</li>
            <li>I have noticed fresher breath, no nasty film on my teeth, definitely my mouth feels CLEAN!</li>
            <li>and now I have a new favorite.</li>
            <li>This year, II made it my New Year&#x27;s resolution to get on top of my dental routine, and a couple months ago I added Crest Pro-Health mouthwash to my routine.</li>
            <li>I would gladly try any new product they offer.</li>

            <li>/&gt;Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li>Now it will cost me more to remove the brown stains that have developed atop and between my bottom front teeth!  </li>
            <li>and I love it so far!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>Most people are rising with a whole cap full, which is too much and magnifying the side effects.</li>
            <li>According to our doctor, this product caused her to loose all the good bacteria in her mouth and encouraged yeast/thrush.</li>
            <li>my teeth are strong and only needed two fillings :)</li>
            <li>Not too strong but not weak at all.</li>
            <li>I have always been a fan of how clean and pretty Crest products have helped my teeth stay; however, I did not like the aftertaste that this mouthwash leaves.</li>
            <li>Helps keep my breathe extra fresh and teeth are healthy and strong</li>
            <li>A clean mouth can absolutely change your life!</li>
            <li>My mouth did feel extremely clean from the first use.</li>
            <li>For starters the taste is similar to medicine, so it may not be that enjoyable for some people; for us it was fine.</li>

            <li>I received the Crest Pro-Health multi protection mouthwash complimentary from Crest through a BzzAgent campaign.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good mouthwash and if you&#x27;re really concerned with staining then use a different brand.  </li>
            <li>The Crest website claims that this is rare</li>
            <li>Makes my mouth feel fresh</li>
            <li>And I was pleasantly surprised to see how great it actually is.</li>

            <li>No burn and makes your mouth feel fresh.</li>
            <li>It was a bit powerful mint-wise but over all it was something we would use again.</li>

            <li>Now, we get results with fresh mint instead of alcohol.  </li>
            <li>It leaves a fresh feeling in your mouth without the stinging.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not harsh when your gurgling. :)</li>

            <li>I like this mouthwash much better than many other types because it does not burn my mouth.</li>
            <li>Now, we are a family more confident talking to each other and friends/family with fresher breath.  </li>
            <li>assumed the first time it was just cleaning super well</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s super intense!</li>
            <li>I love the flavor of the product and the feeling more than other products on the market right now</li>
            <li>It worked very well on keeping my mouth feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>And I LOVE how clean my teeth feel for the ENTIRE day!</li>
            <li>I leaves a fresh and clean feeling in your mouth that really lasts.</li>
            <li>It leaves my whole mouth feeling fresh and clean which makes sense because the majority of the surface area in your mouth consists of your tongue, cheeks, gums and throat.</li>
            <li>Not only have I noticed fresher breath and a more cleanly all around feeling</li>
            <li>far as this mouthwash goes, it&#x27;s a great toilet cleaning product.</li>
            <li>However, the longer I&#x27;ve been using it, the more I notice the clean feeling lasting throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>I have used many different mouthwashes as i have a fairly sensitive mouth and this one is one of the most mild that I have used.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the whole Crest ProHealth line of products as a sure defense for your teeth and mouth needs.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the whole Crest ProHealth line of products as a sure defense for your teeth and mouth needs.</li>
            <li>It left my mouth feeling clean!!</li>
            <li>I said right off I</li>
            <li>right?  </li>
            <li>It says it might do that right on the bottle</li>
            <li>and it said right there may cause staining of teeth,</li>
            <li>Used it (because it was under the sink) and right after had a burning sensation on tongue that would not go away.</li>
            <li>is just right for me.  </li>
            <li>RIGHT AWAY</li>
            <li>The flavor is just right.</li>
            <li>Right off the bat</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it right before you plan on eating.</li>
            <li>right from the start  </li>
            <li>A business that operates in this market segment needs to get it right, or make it right.</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>I use it right after brushing in the morning and again after my nighttime brushing right before bed.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s right on the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been wondering why my teeth keep staining right after my dental visits.</li>
            <li>First, I really like the fact that this product is alcohol free.</li>
            <li>I honestly haven&#x27;t been able to taste anything for the past two days.</li>
            <li>It seems to clean my teeth very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong enough to make your mouth feel super clean but it doesnt burn (because it does not contain alcohol).</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s actually the first kind that we have kept up with using.  </li>
            <li>My problem with this mouthwash is that I just didn&#x27;t really feel like my mouth was that clean after I used it.</li>
            <li>It leaves my mouth feeling clean and refreshed the whole day.  </li>
            <li>I would only recommend to make the after taste better because it is not bad</li>
            <li>It has a nice fresh taste that lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, there is NO other OTC mouthwash better than this.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn like the Listerine I used previously (although I just noticed that Listerine has its own version of alcohol free mouthwash; will need to try that out at some point) .</li>
            <li>But there was still a nagging suspicion that the mouthwash was to blame, and sure enough, after a quick online search I discovered there are a TON of people who&#x27;ve had adverse reactions to the stuff.  </li>
            <li>: do a quick search on Cetylpyridinium chloride, the key antibacterial agent in Crest Pro Care Mouthwash, and you will find some interesting information from a variety of sources.</li>
            <li>and I am a new loyal consumer for Crest Pro Health!</li>
            <li>I am currently trying this product free (thanks to Crest) and I truly love this product.</li>
            <li>I was fairly pleased by this mouthwash, Ive only used it a handful of times but so far I love it.</li>
            <li>so your mouth feels amazing all day long even after your sugary indulgence.</li>
            <li>Tried this product free from BzzAgent and let me tell you I fell a difference in what I normally use and this product.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to bzzagent for providing me with a full size sample</li>
            <li>I have been a long time user of the crest line and thought this was a nice addition to the product line.</li>
            <li>I love that feeling especially when coming back from the dentist, clean refreshing feeling in your mouth.</li>
            <li>; I use this multiple times a day and was SO EXCITED TO TRY IT FOR FREE THANKS TO CREST!!</li>
            <li>I surprisingly love the taste and not in a rush to spit it out because it doesn&#x27;t have that strong burning like other brands have.</li>
            <li>I lost all my taste buds right after the first use.</li>
            <li>I think one of the reason we all brush our teeth, floss and rinse is to have a healthy White smile.</li>
            <li>Great product overall and definitely lives up to its expectation being set forth.</li>
            <li>I notice the pain started to reduce more and more everyday.</li>
            <li>It really does protect from cavities and make your mouth feel super clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My teeth stay squeaky clean, my teeth tend to build up plaque easily and since using this mouthwash it definitely hasn&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only had to use this product one time to experience the adverse side effects that the vast majority of the reviewers for this product have experienced.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone back to good old listerine.  </li>
            <li>I love how fresh and simple the flavor is.</li>
            <li>Then I read that this product I started using is not only NOT making my smile better, but it is the reason for the staining.</li>
            <li>This is the no alcohol version so there isn&#x27;t much of a burn, which is also better for Teens and people who are sensitive to the burning feeling.</li>
            <li>For starters, I have never been a huge fan of mouthwash because my mouth is so darn sensitive!</li>
            <li>At first I thought I just had a defective product, after exchanging for a different one I experienced the same gooey substances after rinsing.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using it at night right before bed as well as my three-year old daughter.</li>
            <li>It has a mild and minty taste which is very refreshing compared to Listerine brand harsh tastes.</li>
            <li>my kids like very much</li>
            <li>I recently received this for free from Crest through buzzagent, i was so excited to give this product a try.</li>
            <li>Cool Mint is the classic crest pro health  flavor that everyone is used to.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this based on the performance, saying that if you are lucky enough not to have the dreaded aftertaste, Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Rinse is indeed very effective at leaving your mouth feeling clean without any sort of sting or burn from harsh alcohols or menthols.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>I had never tried it before and was excited to try something new.</li>
            <li>It left my mouth feeling clean and germ free.</li>
            <li>I really had high hopes for this as I usually enjoy Crest products.</li>
            <li>With @Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Mouthwash in with my daily teeth cleaning, my mouth feels fresh and clean!</li>
            <li>It was refreshing and the mint taste did last for awhile.</li>
            <li>though it was a pretty neat mouthwash since it didn&#x27;t have the alcohol burn.  </li>
            <li>After the first use, I noted some loss in taste and thought that I had eaten too soon after using the rinse.</li>
            <li>Also no weird filmy taste after</li>
            <li>It has a refreshing and lasting taste.</li>
            <li>But Crest Pro Health mouth d wash Is my first choice from now on.</li>
            <li>my mouth is well protected ;)</li>
            <li>and I am hooked, I felt the difference after the first day.</li>
            <li>dentist recommended that I use a mouthwash, so I first bought a bottle of Listerine and used it up with no ill effects whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>and I put a ton of effort to keep it pretty.</li>
            <li>Overall though I was satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>thought that brushing was enough until i used this product i am more then please, it has giving me a refreshing feeling after brushing with crest total care.</li>
            <li>It made my mouth feel cleaner after the first use.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it&#x27;s designed not to do.</li>
            <li>And even when not eating, my tongue and mouth just feel funny - kinda soapy and numb.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My entire family has used this product for over a year at the suggestion of our dentist, and we love it.  </li>
            <li>The product was free and was shipped directly to my home.</li>
            <li>a healthy tooth.&lt;br /&gt;Another such product is MMS or sodium chlorite.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, my mouth didn&#x27;t feel any cleaner with this product than the one I currently use.</li>
            <li>He said if it were bacterial I would be getting better with the current antibiotic.</li>
            <li>I really happen to like this!</li>
            <li>No matter what oral health benefits this product may provide, side effects as drastic as the ones most of us have experienced should be prominently featured on the back of the bottle in at least a similarly-sized font asthe rest of the information on the bottle; not in tiny print!</li>
            <li>I like the regular Crest Pro mouthwash better  than the alcoholfree one, but it was worth a try, thanks Buzzagent and Crest</li>
            <li>That is exactly when the stains started appearing.  </li>
            <li>Apparently, many people have the same problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love Crest Pro Health, My kids actually like using it too.</li>
            <li>, the enamel on my teeth is actually getting stronger than it was and MY dentist was amazed at how much better</li>
            <li>I did not at first suspect the mouthwash</li>
            <li>really ticks me off!.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I have EVER used mouthwash that DIDN&#x27;T burn my mouth.</li>
            <li>Haha!)</li>
            <li>(I thought they were cavities at first)</li>
            <li>After the first time using it</li>
            <li>First thing Crest Pro-Heath is my number one mouthwash .</li>
            <li>From the first time you use Crest  mouthwash</li>
            <li>and my tastebuds were funny for about 2 hours after I used it.</li>
            <li>Feels fresh and do not worry as much about my breath.</li>
            <li>Definitely keeping on top shelf 😆</li>
            <li>I have actually used Crest products, most recently this one, for many years.  </li>
            <li>I really wished I read these reviews beforehand!</li>
            <li>At my dental check today, the dentist told me many of her patients using Crest Pro Health mouthwash have had the same problem with staining/discoloring of teeth.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product not on Amazon but should have read the reviews first.</li>
            <li>and this is the first time I tried the mouthwash and</li>
            <li>More predinsone and benedryl with a recheck next week.</li>
            <li>Still have jaw and tongue swelling and more medical bills.</li>
            <li>At first I was like it is just a mouth wash.</li>
            <li>Research your products better before releasing them to the public.   </li>
            <li>I usually use Listerine and have successfully for years.  </li>
            <li>My biggest problem was my breath - no matter how many times I brushed or what mouthwash</li>
            <li>a definite plus :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The taste is soft ,does not burn you mouth because this mouthwash is alochol free.</li>
            <li>( MORNING BREATH BE DAMNED)Avoid the burn of alcohol; 12-hour protection against plaque and gingivitis by using in your daily oral care routine; Prevent and reduce gingivitis for healthy gums; Keep teeth cleaner longer, versus brushing alone.  </li>
            <li>Well I have to say that I am extremely glad to be back using Crest Pro-Health again!</li>
            <li>At first I thought I had food stuck in them</li>
            <li>I really like that the fresh breath stays for some time after rinsing.</li>
            <li>and It&#x27;s okay not something I could afford or want to buy on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>,my teeth are brown enough I dont need to look like im smoking now on top of it.</li>
            <li>However, after consistent use I started to notice the brown stains.</li>
            <li>but it tasted funny</li>
            <li>This is my first sample product</li>
            <li>Sigh, I cannot believe I have to go back to the dentist again and pay the costly treatments over a cheap $8 bottle!</li>
            <li>I do not understand why P&amp;G have not taken Crest Pro Health off the shelves since first complaints reported five years ago in 2008?</li>
            <li>I went in the bathroom and, sure enough, I started using this mouthwash a couple of months ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Before, they were more red and bled sometimes.</li>
            <li>the first chance I get and will update this review with a link when I find one.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how it works exactly, but when you spit, you can see</li>
            <li>&quot; I am seriously interested in getting together some sort of class suit against this company.  </li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t burn and it leaves your mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>I would most definitely buy this product.</li>
            <li>I am no longer worried if my breath is fresh enough or making sure I have a piece of gum at the ready.</li>
            <li>Overall, I like the product better than others I have tried.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that it does multiple things without alcohol in it</li>
            <li>We have all been using it and all really like it!</li>
            <li>and I really like it!</li>
            <li>because that exactly what it feels like.</li>
            <li>First we received it as a product to test for bzz agent.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t burn as much, and it leaves a fresh feeling for hours afterward.</li>
            <li>I really like this mouthwash!</li>
            <li>I used it only one more time, and I can confirm the taste side effects.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for 2 weeks now and out of nowhere have these pretty brown stains between my teeth that were never there before.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Crest!</li>
            <li>There are pros and cons with this mouthwash, so I can&#x27;t give it any higher than 3 stars.    </li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li>first day I tried it I lost the ability to taste food.</li>
            <li>sure enough, it was indeed the mouthwash.</li>
            <li>First time I thought the product was alright</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed my breath has stayed fresh for much longer after using this product.</li>
            <li>No ill effects to taste buds or anything ever.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;However, if I use it in the evening, my breath is noticeably fresher when I wake up, even with the funny aftertaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this mouthwash to people who are looking to get better check ups at the dentist.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Crest Pro-Health Mouth Rinse for a couple months, and have recently noticed browning of in between and top of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>At first, I thought it is the food.</li>
            <li>Wish I&#x27;d read the reviews first.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products over the years and never have I seen such a productive product.   </li>
            <li>My dentist actually recommended that I use this, and I&#x27;m so glad he did.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not harsh and alcohol free.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t taste anything for the whole day when I used this mouthwash!  </li>
            <li>It has a good taste and no burning until after I spit it out and my mouth kinda burned for a few seconds and it went away.</li>
            <li>It left my mouth feeling clean and minty fresh!</li>
            <li>But if you do use this product, be sure to have your mouth fairly clean before using it, and rinse extremely well after using it.</li>
            <li>Right After finishing the whole entire bottle I noticed my bottom and top front teeth with some brownish stains.</li>
            <li>I love this product, my mouth felt so fresh for a long time!</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive teeth and wasn&#x27;t sure about trying something new on them.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to receive a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li>There is a clean &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; that goes along with this mouthwash, but I like it, and gives me the feeling of that deep clean.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to try this for free from crest.</li>
            <li>The taste isn&#x27;t that alcohol burn like some other brands but more of a cool minty burst in my opinion.</li>
            <li>First came the wonderful bruning sensation, followed by the usual taste lost, eventually I couldn&#x27;t drink fluid at one point because it hurt too much.</li>
            <li>I have seen amazing results compared to any other mouth wash I have used.</li>
            <li>It has a nice taste and it doesn&#x27;t burn like other mouthwashes.  </li>
            <li>I also liked that there was no burn caused by alcohol in other mouthwashes, which&lt;br /&gt;I found pleasing.  </li>
            <li>My family also really liked the fact that it didn&#x27;t burn their mouths like the other brands do.  </li>
            <li>This mouthwash left my whole mouth feeling clean, refreshed and my breath smelling minty fresh!</li>
            <li>And while the minty-freshness had serious longevity, it also greatly diminished the flavor of food.</li>
            <li>After the first couple days of use, actually after the first day, using Crest I noticed a strong metallic taste in my mouth and on my breath that lasted all day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe since it&#x27;s only been one day, i&#x27;ve not seen very noticeable staining yet, but i&#x27;ve heard from so many others about how their teeth stained sometimes irreversibly, from as soon as one use, and also from extended use.</li>
            <li>Second, I love the fact that the promised results really happen.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also good to alternate and not use the same mouthwash forever, then you can minimize side effects of each product.</li>
            <li>I read the back of the bottle and it does warn of possible staining, but says good brushing should take care of it.</li>
            <li>With Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Alcohol free, there&#x27;s not after taste lingering in my mouth only fresh breath, along with no throat irritation.</li>
            <li>It is very crisp and cleansing without the burn that comes with so many other products.</li>
            <li>and although I still find that I am not crazy about the taste when I very first use it, I love the fresh, clean feeling that it leaves behind.</li>
            <li>Crest Pro-Health rinse left my teeth with a clean and refreshed mouth!</li>
            <li>No burn when rinsing and left my mouth feeling clean!</li>
            <li>I have had great success in using this product with Crest Pro Health toothpaste, at my last dental cleaning my dentist was amazed at how little tartar I had after he realized I hadn&#x27;t had my teeth cleaned in close to five years.</li>
            <li>First of all, the cap was easy to open!</li>
            <li>I like this because it does not burn your mouth like the other mouth washes does and it makes my mouth feel clean  and leaves my breath smelling fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>I was really amazed that this mouth was alcohol free and leaves such a tingling, fresh feeling in my mouth after rinsing.  </li>
            <li>I really do use this product and it really has helped me have a healthier mouth!</li>
            <li>I am so happy to report that unlike other I haven&#x27;t had staining or any gross feeling after.</li>
            <li>Really all it did was leave a funny taste in my mouth all day.</li>
            <li>I love that there is not the alcohol taste in this product, however is does have a strange taste to it.</li>
            <li>and I have pretty much tried them all (teeth fan</li>
            <li>If you use this mouthwash be aware that it does work very well</li>
            <li>No weird flavors, no burn in your mouth, but it really makes a difference in your oral health.  </li>
            <li>The taste is good, not overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li>If that gets fixed, this gets a full 5 stars from me.  </li>
            <li>Personally I did not have any of the issues that a lot of people seem to be experiencing with teeth staining, and my mouth feels fresh and clean after using Crest.  </li>
            <li>It left my mouth so fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>It left my mouth feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>and it left my mouth feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>It left my breath fresh and my mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li>It has a fresh, minty taste that left my mouth tingling clean but without the burn of some mouthwash containing alcohol.</li>
            <li>This mouthwash left my mouth feeling fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>Leaves a nice minty taste in your mouth with NO burn like other mouthwash!</li>
            <li>I was recently given an opportunity to try this product for free, and my experience was very much satisfieing.</li>
            <li>I use it in the morning, after every meal, and before bed for a fresh new start.</li>
            <li>I experienced only a slight burning (much less than with other mouth washes) and it has a great fresh mint taste!</li>
            <li>The taste is refreshing, not overpowering, and does not burn like some mouth rinses do nor does it leave me with dry mouth.  </li>
            <li>I am currently trying this product for free thanks to Crest!</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied and would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Next, it&#x27;s important to know that continued, consistent use has lessened our plaque...</li>
            <li>The next mouthwash I bought from listerine (it was on sale) has 20% alcohol which is too strong for my taste.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong enough that I still feel that I have to rinse after use, though.</li>
            <li>It definitely didn&#x27;t have a strong flavor or burn, so if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, you might want to try it.</li>
            <li>I use it every morning, and it has no burn like the others do, it gives me a fresh, clean, healthy feeling afterwards, giving me the confidence to smile and really mean it!</li>
            <li>I was recently given an opportunity to try this product for free, thanks to Bzzagent and my experience was very much satisfieing.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive gums and they feel better using Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection vs. other brands I have used that made my gums feel even more sensitive.</li>
            <li>they are large stains as well.</li>
            <li>I will certainly be buying this product.</li>
            <li>I can say for certain that my teeth feel smoother for way longer between brushings...</li>
            <li>But smart people just stop using products that don&#x27;t work for them.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a positive experience with the mouthwash from the very beginning when I went to use the mouthwash and noticed no burning when I was using it.  </li>
            <li>It lasts much longer than expected from a mouthwash and then fresh, clean feeling isn&#x27;t really worth the mouth on</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;fresh and clean\\&quot; feeling did not last as long as I would have liked though.    </li>
            <li>Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Mouthwash is a new innovative product that must be added to anyones personal care.</li>

            <li>Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Mouthwash is a new innovative product that must be added to anyones personal care.</li>
            <li>About 2 months ago I decided to change my regular mouthwash in order to try something new, just to figure out if I can get better results.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that lately I haven&#x27;t been able to find the clear kind, but the blue kind is just about as good.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice clean taste, and doesn&#x27;t burn your tongue like other mouthwash which is a big plus.</li>
            <li>I thought my brushing habits were causing it, but then I remembered the fine print on the back of the label.</li>
            <li>But overall, I like the rinse and feel that it does a decent job in keeping my mouth clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>I think it is pretty decent mouthwash.  </li>
            <li>This is the brand of toothpaste I grew up on and thus, a certain amount of brand loyalty (call it trust, really) was built into my decision to purchase this product.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels fresh and clean all day long and the appearance of my teeth are visibly improving gradually.</li>
            <li>that a mouthwash designed to clean your teeth does the exact opposite?</li>
            <li>I actually now enjoy using mouthwash, it no longer is pure torture.</li>
            <li>The damage to the Crest brand might be hard to quantify, but if they keep selling garbage like this, it could be fairly impactful.</li>
            <li>No burning after finished, just the right  amount of clean tingle that lasts long after rinsing.</li>
            <li>It is sheer luck that I read these reviews because it solved a huge mystery for me...</li>
            <li>I really like the product and even though I got it free through a promotion, I will definitely buy it when I run out.  </li>
            <li>I really like the product and even though I got it free through a promotion, I will definitely buy it when I run out.</li>
            <li>My dentist and hygienist have noticed a huge difference since I started using mouthwash regularly as well ...</li>
            <li>I would definitely buy it after I finish the free sample I received thanks to Crest.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really taste a difference between them all, and they all seem to work well.</li>
            <li>We both really like this mouth wash and never had any issues with it.</li>
            <li>I am really please with my purchase, and will continue to buy. </li>
            <li>I am really please with my purchase, and will continue to buy. </li>
            <li>they feel so much cleaner</li>
            <li>I really like this brand of mouth wash.</li>
            <li>any advice will be greatly appreciated  please please stay away from Crest Pro health</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend skipping this at all costs, and picking a different alcohol free mouthwash.</li>
            <li>Thanks Crest.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m feeling so much cleaner and fresher.</li>
            <li>We were given a free same via Bzzagent and were eager to try it!</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Mouthwash for two weeks now #gotitfree thanks to #Bzzagent.</li>
            <li>This, not so much.</li>
            <li>the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li>REALLY</li>
            <li>I really like Crest Pro-health a lot.  </li>
            <li>I did notice a film in my mouth but have not seen any stains or anything else unusual.</li>
            <li>I really like that.</li>
            <li>I tried straight salt, and it was also flavorless.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really does work.</li>
            <li>I know Crest mouthwash really does</li>
            <li>want to also state that it really does help with bleeding gums.</li>
            <li>I am on a mission from Smiley 360, so I got a free full-size sample (blue bottle) to buy.  </li>
            <li>I tried a few more times and sure enough - this is the cause.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really eat anything and it even hurts to touch the roof of my mouth or teeth.</li>
            <li>and it really does help freshen my breath.</li>
            <li>and I really do think it improved the condition of my gums.</li>
            <li>The hygienist noticed the unusual staining too...and asked me (initiated the question-)</li>
            <li>No one wants mouthwash that burns.</li>
            <li>That is so untrue because this works really well.</li>
            <li>Thanks BzzAgent and Crest for giving me the opportunity to try this mouthwash.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>This really feels and tastes likes it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li>Thanks to Crest</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast with Amazon.</li>
            <li>She was very embarrassed and I was very scared for her.</li>
            <li>It really does.</li>
            <li>That may not seem like much but, for someone with wrist pains</li>
            <li>It was almost like we were challenging each other to see who could last the longest because frankly, most mouth washes burn your mouth and make you want to spit them out early!</li>
            <li>I am very upset.</li>
            <li>Who wants staining and if it happens who wants to wait until you go to the dentist.  </li>
            <li>I really like this mouthwash and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Thanks to crest</li>
            <li>Very disappointing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If that doesn&#x27;t work I really hope my dentist will get them out.</li>
            <li>I feel that my mouth is much cleaner and feels healthier.</li>
            <li>It hurt so much</li>
            <li>This mouthwash has really freshened my breath.</li>
            <li>I really wish I had researched this product before I used it, but who creates a mouthwash that will stain your teeth?</li>
            <li>I really like it and think it&#x27;s held up my teeth and gums well.</li>
            <li>Really like the fact of no alcohol and no burning.</li>
            <li>I have been struggling with my dental care and this product really makes me upset now that i had to get my teeth cleaned at the dentist.</li>
            <li>But the alcohol-free formula really made a difference.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying this mouth wash!</li>
            <li>I can really feel it working on my gums and teeth.</li>
            <li>thus far it leaves my breath fresh and minty.  </li>
            <li>and my mouth is much cleaner now than before using it</li>
            <li>I have seen over 500 consumer complaints on the internet about this very thing since then.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants to get a healthier mouth and whiter teeth.</li>
            <li>(caffeine now makes my heart rate elevate too much).  </li>
            <li>Crest sent this to me for free and i would definitly buy this in the future!!</li>
            <li>- I have never been very diligent with any routine orally besides brushing my teeth</li>
            <li>and we both really like it.</li>
            <li>I recently received a free bottle via Smiley 360 to review.</li>
            <li>and I really like the benefits for my gums and teeth.</li>
            <li>The part I really like is that it does not burn.  </li>
            <li>Maybe they just put too much flavoring in it (in my opinion, P&amp;G really overdoes the flavoring in its toothpastes).</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>This really feels and tastes likes it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li>I have to say I really do like this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been much of a mouthwash user, I can&#x27;t stand the alcohol taste</li>
            <li>My husband is very picky when it comes to toothpaste and mouthwash and this product won him over as well.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for letting try this.</li>
            <li>I really like the taste</li>
            <li>As sensitive as my teeth are, that&#x27;s a rare thing to find.</li>
            <li>, it has been a fantastic experience adding this to my daily brushing.</li>
            <li>so the whole family can use it too.</li>
            <li>I received a big bottle as a free sample from Bzzagent.com</li>
            <li>Thanks for the sample.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have any complaints.</li>
            <li>I really like the noticeable difference that this mouthwash had on the plaque build up on my teeth.</li>
            <li>and I can tell that my breath stays fresher much longer.  </li>
            <li>I can definitely tell in my front teeth, that it looks like they are somewhat cleaner and feel really smooth when I run my tongue across my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>&gt; #gotitfree from BzzAgent and Crest, a big shot out for giving me this product free to try out</li>
            <li>until it really happens.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of the product from Crest and now I am a definitely going to be a returning customer.</li>
            <li>I really like this mouthwash.</li>
            <li>This product as well as using the crest pro-health toothpaste have really improved the looks of my teeth.</li>
            <li>There were days my tongue hurt so much that it felt</li>
            <li>This product really does not have any positives.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in the health of my mouth and it didn&#x27;t leave my breath smelling much fresher than brushing.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like that feeling.</li>
            <li>And the rest of my family seems to really like this one.</li>
            <li>I received this mouthwash, thanks to Crest and Bzzagent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed how much whiter everyone in my family&#x27;s teeth are.</li>
            <li>I have found this rinse to be gentle and without the burn.  </li>
            <li>Thanks smiley360 and crest for putting me on this mission</li>
            <li>and it really does make your mouth feel fresher longer.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Amazon, we really should consider to support zero-star reviews.</li>
            <li>Thanks crest 😊</li>
            <li>It was smooth to gargle and had multiple benefits.</li>
            <li>hope I will be able to taste food again in a few days, but most likely not.</li>
            <li>I really like how it feels in my mouth before and after</li>
            <li>, I REALLY HOPE THIS IS NOT PERMANENT.</li>
            <li>my whole set 2x a day...</li>
            <li>I could do the whole swish without having the sting of alcohol.  </li>
            <li>Thanks crest...</li>
            <li>I am a fan of the whole Crest Pro Health lineup; from mouthwash and toothpaste to their floss.</li>
            <li>This product definitely promotes alcohol free line.  </li>
            <li>Thanks BzzAgent for sending me this product to test and review.</li>
            <li>I would really discourage anyone from purchasing this product.</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s dentist stated that even this lightly colored blue mouthwash is staining her teeth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really very</li>
            <li>This seems to work really well on any type of gum pain or a bit tongue our mouth.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know really if it helps in the areas that it says.  </li>
            <li>It really works very well</li>
            <li>Thanks Crest.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>My kids and husband eat lots of very spicy foods.  </li>
            <li>This product should be pulled from the market in my opinion since the stains really destroys the purpose of cleaning.</li>
            <li>but overall I&#x27;m satisfied so far.</li>
            <li>The Crest Pro-Health is nicely minty without being harsh.  </li>
            <li>Personally, this product did not stain my teeth - I found that it did a fairly good job of cleaning, and there was absolutely no alcohol burn.  </li>
            <li>Only thing I wish is that it still had a childproof top, as I have a soon to be 2 year old that loves to drink and eat anything she gets her hands on.</li>
            <li>m having such positive results such as: fresh breath all day, my teeth feel clean no matter what I eat and my teeth ever look brighter!</li>
            <li>It leaves your breath fresh and feeling clean for a very long time!  </li>
            <li>i got crest prohealth free to try from bzzagent ,i like this product leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean,and it dont have that burning feeling like other mouthwash.</li>
            <li>I also love that it&#x27;s gentle on my mouth and doesn&#x27;t make my gums peel like other washes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Normally when I use any mouthwash I can&#x27;t stand the minty taste and the BURN!</li>
            <li>This mouth wash leaves a not so fresh after taste that last all day and makes whatever I eat or drink taste funny the whole day.....</li>
            <li>I am excited to see what the dentist will say when I go and see him next month!</li>
            <li>There is a teeny tiny warning on the label about the possibility of staining but suggests that it proves the product is working!</li>
            <li>This leaves such a fresh flavor in my mouth and lasts for hours!</li>
            <li>My parents tried it also and agreed that this was better then the other mouthwash they have used before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see who the product worked during a regularly scheduled dental check</li>
            <li>Just like many of the other reviewers here, this product also stained my teeth.</li>
            <li>After using Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Rinse for a solid week, I am hooked and will be turning to the brand to take care of my smile from now on!</li>
            <li>I am excited about my next dental check up since using Crest Pro-Health because I know my mouth is healthier since using Crest.  </li>
            <li>I read some of the other reviews and read that many people are complaining of brown staining on their teeth.</li>
            <li>Personally, I think it is worth every penny, and i am now squeezing this mouth wash into my budget!</li>
            <li>It also tastes so much better than other mouthwashes.</li>
            <li>I must say I think crest pro-health mouth rinse is so much better than other brands I have tried</li>
            <li>I am used to with many other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li>I like the taste of this one better than all other alcohol-free mouthwashes I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give that burn that some other mouth washes do, probably because it is alcohol free!</li>
            <li>The non-alcohol burn makes it friendly for not only kids, but adults with sensitivity.</li>
            <li>and I love how it feels plus that it does not burn unlike other mouth washes.  </li>
            <li>last time I checked mouthwash was supposed to clean your teeth.</li>
            <li>Leaves my mouth feeling clean and refreshed...will definately buy in the future</li>
            <li>I miss the standard mouthwash burn and my teeth don&#x27;t feel as clean after using this.</li>
            <li>I had clean white teeth.</li>
            <li>4 weeks ago my teeth were white and clean.  </li>
            <li>I received a free full size bottle of Creest Pro-health from BzzAgent to try a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li>If anything, my mouth felt more fresh than usual.</li>
            <li>and i forgot how Crest Pro Health makes my teeth feel extra clean.</li>
            <li>It left my mouth feeling clean and minty each time I used it, with no irritation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It appears that at the moment there is no silver bullet for clean and white teeth.</li>
            <li>I guess this must come as a shock to crest, but we actually were using their product to CLEAN our teeth.</li>
            <li>It kept my toilet shining and ordor free.</li>
            <li>The clean feeling was definitely there.  </li>
            <li>Crest Pro-health mult-protection mouthwash kept my breath fresh and clean longer than the other mouthwashes.</li>
            <li>It did leave my mouth feeling clean and refreshed and gives me fresh breath, but I use it every other day to every two days because of the fear of staining.  </li>
            <li>and I definitely will print the free coupons from  www.coupons.com search word crest in brands (http://www.coupons.com/brands/crest-coupons/?PLID&#x3D;MEDIAADS&amp;CRID&#x3D;CRESTRINSE102414BZZAGENT_EXT&amp;CID&#x3D;18490031~18490033~18379389~18379119) direct link to coupons and take advantage of having fantastic trips to the dentist in the future.</li>
            <li>To be honest i don&#x27;t brush my teeth as often as i should on some days, but i always usually mouthwash with this product and at my last 6 month checkup i got a clean bill of health and</li>
            <li>specially after brushing which I do 3 to 4 times daily</li>
            <li>I started using this because of being sensitivity to the high alcohol content in many other brands.</li>
            <li>I received a free bottle of Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection from Crest.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Crest, I have been using the Crest ProHealth Mouthwash for a little over a week, also I am brushing my teeth twice a day, it really does prevent and reduce plaque buildup, I am rarely having to floss.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product which doesn&#x27;t leave a strong or bad taste in your mouth afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I switched to crest, my mouth feels so much healthier, and less abused.</li>
            <li>It does the job of an average mouthwash, but I still has a pretty strong burning sensation on my tongue and inside of my mouth.</li>
            <li>However, since the product seems to be staining people&#x27;s teeth brown, which is a far more noticable and less desireable stain, Crest really should make consumers aware of the side effects.</li>
            <li>My hygienist confirmed that she was aware of crest pro health mouth washes creating stains and advised I use other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The blue bottle does not burn either, like Listerine, and by the way, the white bottle rinse does not burn either, though the white bottle rinse does not taste particularly good.</li>
            <li>The mouth is full of bacteria (hundreds of species were found in a recent study of the salivary microbiome)</li>
            <li>dark* stains develop in between most of my teeth.</li>
            <li>Short and sweet</li>
            <li>After the second day I realized I couldn&#x27;t taste anything except spicy, salty and sweet flavors.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s alcohol FREE, but still leaves that fresh feeling behind!</li>
            <li>This is hands down my favorite mouthwash.  </li>
            <li>They also love that it doesn&#x27;t burn like other mouthwashes!  </li>
            <li>Better than other mouthwashes!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new fave!</li>
            <li>My husband &amp; I have already purchased a new bottle &amp; will continue using Crest!</li>
            <li>The Crest Pro-Health Mouthwash is my new fave!</li>
            <li>Since using Crest Pro-Health, like many other reviewers on Amazon, I developed very noticable brown stains on my teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m was very hesitant to switch to a new mouthwash.</li>
            <li>bad because you don&#x27;t have a good aftertaste or refreshing feeling after using it.      </li>
            <li>It does still have a bit of an odd after taste but, its nothing compared to most mouthwashes.</li>
            <li>I have tried several different mouthwashes and like the way this one leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean without the alcohol burn.</li>
            <li>staining  is not permanent or harmful , and may be prevented by adequate brushing or removed at your next dental visit\\</li>
            <li>The thing I like most about this mouthwash is that I actually feel like it leaves a protective barrier on my gums that will last for hours.</li>
            <li>On my recent dental checkup, I was once again reminded that I should use a mouthwash (the dentist recommended alcohol-free Listerine), so I decided to try this again since I still had most of the two bottles left and figured maybe it wouldn&#x27;t be</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t have the classic mouthwash burn.</li>
            <li>The bottle, in a place I didn&#x27;t notice, says, misleadingly in my view, that the staining \\&quot;may be prevented by adequate brushing or removed at your next dental visit\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It requires more than a simple rinse of your sink after use as the blue particles stick to the basin of the sink.</li>
            <li>I could scrap it off only to have it quickly return.</li>
            <li>It mostly came off with a cleaning at the dentist, but I will have to go back a 2nd time to get it all off.  </li>
            <li>I used the rinse twice daily and was not immediately aware of a loss of taste sensation, but within 2 weeks had lost my sensation of sweetness for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li>The only reason I downgraded it to four stars instead of five is that Crest uses CPC (Cetylpyridinium Chloride) as the main ingredient while Listerine&#x27;s formula is composed of four essential oils (eucalyptol, menthol, methyl salicylate, and thymol) which have been shown in comparative studies to yield better results as part of a homecare oral hygiene routine.</li>
            <li>After a few weeks of using this mouthwash, though, I can definitely say it was a good decision.</li>
            <li>I still use the Crest toothpaste and will never change since it has improved over the years with more flavors and different needs for brushing, since we do not all have the same needs for our teeth.  </li>
            <li>I went to my dentist recently and found out I had multiple cavities, so I thought, \\&quot;welp, time to start taking better care of my teeth!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I came on here wondering if anyone had the same problems and sure enough.</li>
            <li>It lacks the minty flavor and whitening that I love from the 3D white mouthwash, but it does feel like it leaves my mouth healthier overall.</li>
            <li>I would spit out a few mouthfuls of bright red blood.  </li>
            <li>my wife and I did a quick google research finding out this product with lot of others complains about the same out come and situation.</li>
            <li>This one does not burn my mouth, and it leaves a nice, fresh breath behind.</li>
            <li>but so far i have had a positive experience.</li>
            <li>It leaves my mouth feelin really clean, it does a pretty good job at keeping bad breathe at bay, but I haven&#x27;t really seen any noticeable changes in my tooth appearance.</li>
            <li>and I must admit that I was skeptical at first bcuz I was partial to another brand/type of mouthwash, but this mouthwash is AMAZING!!!!</li>
            <li>And makes my mouth feel alot more fresh than usual!</li>
            <li>and i like it so much than my old mouth wash!</li>
            <li>I did not want to write a review right away because I wanted to experience the product first over a long period of time.</li>
            <li>es.. highly recommended</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I use the tooth paste with the electric toothbrush on high and have had no problems whatever.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This product is not for everyone I myself had a high fever as a child</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend crest pro health mouth wash to every one.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this mouthwash to others.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend others give crest pro health a try.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to everyone who uses mouthwash.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to everyone</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Only reason I&#x27;m giving two stars is because it never caused any discomfort for my sensitive teeth/gums unlike the original Listerine.</li>
            <li>Like so many other people, my teeth developed grey-brown stains.</li>
            <li>As far as the other claims, I&#x27;m sure it works as well as others in removing food debri and biofilm.</li>
            <li>I thought it burned a little more than it should,</li>
            <li>The pain in my gums got a little better but the rash or burn or whatever around my mouth persisted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>This mouth wash is missing that fresh tingle clean feeling that I want/expect from a mouthwash.</li>
            <li>While I enjoy using it at night (I feel like I wake up without the horrid &amp;#34;morning breath&amp;#34;) using it in the morning ruins my coffee for me!</li>
            <li>Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection left a fresh clean taste for a long time after using it.</li>
            <li>Other mouthwashes make my eyes water because they&#x27;re just too strong.</li>
            <li>totally recommend for anyone that just wants to have less plaque buildup and clean smelling breath to give Crest Pro-Health Multi Protection mouthwash, clean mint flavor a try.  </li>
            <li>What I truly admired of this mouthwash is all the effective things it does without burning our mouth, this make it perfect for all the people out there that feel annoyed by other mouthwashes that contain alcohol and do the same our less protection than Crest Pro-Health.</li>
            <li>We like Crest Pro-Health mouthwash so much that we purchased the Pro-Health Complete with flouride for our children to use.</li>
            <li>Fortunately the stains do come off, but it requires the hygienist to work a bit harder.  </li>
            <li>This is a great mouthwash and recommended it to everyone who does not experience any ill effects from the product.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel much cleaner and look far whiter than before using Crest Pro Health.</li>
            <li>The best part is that with Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Mouthwash I get that 12 hour protection without that painful burning sensation.</li>
            <li>so far I really like it.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn near as much, though there is some burning.</li>
            <li>My 4 year old niece absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>My family feels the same and my spouse has mentioned how one&#x27;s breath feels continually fresh between brushings.</li>
            <li>It left my breath feeling fresh all day.</li>
            <li>Before the sample i was experiencing soreness in one my my teeth but after using it for a few days my tooth some how feels better.</li>
            <li>I do also have to say that in the past I have had some issues with my gums and during my last appointment all signs were good.  </li>
            <li>She then said 99.9% of customers have not complained.</li>
            <li>I have compared this to my normal mouth rinse</li>
            <li>Also, it leaves a fresh feeling in your mouth and last for quite some times.</li>
            <li>I dont normally like any mouthwash because i stings my mouth</li>
            <li>I am normally a Listerine user</li>
            <li>The fresh sensation last for hours.  </li>
            <li>After using it for just a few days, along with the toothpaste, my teeth feel a lot better</li>
            <li>Will stop using immediately and hope normal taste will resume soon</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit i never really liked using mouthwash before, it burns and I&#x27;m kind of a wimp.</li>
            <li>I dont get the burning I normally get when using a mouthwash</li>
            <li>so glad i read reviews today and didnt use it long enough for my teeth to turn brown</li>
            <li>I then saw my dentist for a normal check up and even she comment how stained my teeth seemed.</li>
            <li>it leaves my breath feeling fresh, I&#x27;m a big fan of mint.</li>
            <li>I do wish it would give me fresh breath for a longer period of time which is why I only give it 3 stars.</li>
            <li>Hoping they will develop an effective mouthwash that does not have negative side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works and all mouthwashes are pretty much the same anyway.</li>
            <li>It makes my mouth feel fresh and definitely doesn&#x27;t cause any burning.</li>
            <li>Normally, the mouthwash I use is mediciny.</li>
            <li>Its just a normal feeling lile</li>
            <li>I used before but one thing I noticed is that, the fresh feeling though last for hours it does makes the food taste</li>
            <li>I love that this mouthwash Isn&#x27;t too harsh and yet still protects my mouth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this daily, and it has helped keep my breath fresh.</li>
            <li>Most are harsh and burn my gums.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve stopped using the mouthwash and hope that my taste buds return to normal.  </li>
            <li>(That is what normally happens when I use mouthwash)</li>
            <li>left my breath fresh longer also.....</li>
            <li>After reading all of the negative feedback I was kind of scared to try it.  </li>
            <li>The only down side I&#x27;ve found is that it leaves a kind of film in your mouth</li>
            <li>I have tried many different types of mouth rinse including rinse for dry mouth</li>
            <li>At my last dental cleaning the hygienist complemented me on how well i had been doing since my last visit and thanked me for making her job easy.  </li>
            <li>One thing I would like to point out to friends and family, is that this is something you can do right after brushing your teeth that takes less than a few minutes to promote a life time of healthy gums and fresh breath!&lt;br /</li>
            <li>and you do have to use a sawing left to right motion to get it between some close teeth.  </li>
            <li>I use the mouthwash after I brush the second time right before I leave the house.</li>
            <li>I noticed fresher breath right away and my teeth feel cleaner overall.</li>
            <li>I used this once, and I lost my ability to taste anything right until the next day.</li>
            <li>Ive been using it everyday for several weeks, and I love Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Mouthwash!</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the fresh taste and the clean feeling that it left in my mouth, however, the sensation didn&#x27;t last as long as other mouthwashes.</li>
            <li>It also has a pretty good taste to it, but overall it is no better then my regular brand!</li>
            <li>I am in need of a mouthwash that has fluoride so this isn&#x27;t my first pick, but it does a decent job for commercial mouth washes</li>
            <li>Left my mouth feeling cool, clean and even fresh breath first thing in the morning without that annoying burn that comes with most mouthwashes.</li>
            <li>When receiving the Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection free from Crest, I was scheptical due to the fact mouthwash can stain teeth, and also burns even without alcohol.</li>
            <li>it is alcohol free and it doesn&#x27;t burn like some other brands.</li>
            <li>other reviewers have mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li>Combining the ProHealth line of toothpaste and mouthwash make for a fresh long lasting effect with fresh breath as well.</li>
            <li>Combining the ProHealth line of toothpaste and mouthwash make for a fresh long lasting effect with fresh breathe as well.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t advise ordering something like this online, but I pick up a new bottle at target every couple months.</li>
            <li>and I will continue using it and keep evolving with the brand each time they launch a new one.</li>
            <li>Take the challenge to try something new you may be surprised.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I made mention of these new stains when I saw my dental hygienist.  </li>
            <li>Thankfully my new dentist asked me what mouth wash</li>
            <li>I thought it was my new toothpaste, but it turns out</li>
            <li>After the first use you will be left with an odd feeling in your mouth since it feels extremely clean!</li>

            <li>After the first use you will be left with an odd feeling in your mouth since it feels extremely clean!</li>
            <li>Alcohol free is good and bad...</li>
            <li>Because my teeth were much more stained than what would naturally happen in a few months</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, several times after using this product, I have noticed my teeth turning a light yellow color.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s kind of gross) of dead bacteria</li>
            <li>So I decided that I would try it out thinking that it would help and got it because it says alcohol free but the second that I used it it burned my entire mouth.</li>
            <li>I was perplexed as to the cause -- for over 30 years before starting use of this product I had never had brown staining, and I couldn&#x27;t identify any big changes to my diet or dental routine.</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended this for me because I need the fluoride for my very sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I have to have something that doesn&#x27;t hurt or burn my very sensitive teeth..</li>
            <li>If you have young children that wont use mouthwash because of the burn, I highly suggest trying this product.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this mouthwash highly based on my personal experiences with it, which have been nothing but positive.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I was lucky enough to be blessed with great dental health my entire life.</li>
            <li>I cannot use dyed products, so to have something listed as Clear and get a huge BIG bottle of BLUE</li>
            <li>Steer clear of Crest pro health mouthwash!</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to my friends and family (in fact I already have ;-) )</li>
            <li>First and last time</li>
            <li>I would have a long fresh mouth for hours.  </li>
            <li>Wow, hysteria on Amazon!</li>
            <li>When I first started rinsing with that it left my teeth brown!</li>
            <li>Let me tell you, WOW!</li>
            <li>I am an avid mouthwash user and I regularly find myself struggling to find a balance between the stinging feeling and feeling refreshed for extended time.</li>
            <li>what the eff, that&#x27;s the exact opposite result I want in a mouthwash.  </li>
            <li>The exact same thing was happening to me</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t EVER use this product, unless you want stained, sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I was thinking it was the invisalign to blame since I had pretty white teeth</li>
            <li>I have used this product in the past and find it to be one of my favorite mouthwashes.</li>
            <li>I like the very minty feeling after one use and keeps my breath fresh for a longer period of time than any other mouthwash I&#x27;d used.</li>
            <li>had some juice tasted a bit funny but didnt felt concerned until later on in the day when i had lunch and still could not taste anything its been almost twelve hrs</li>
            <li>When I went to my dentist for my regular cleaning the first thing she asked was if I was using this product.</li>
            <li>It does not have the regular burn that so many of the other mouthwashes do.  </li>
            <li>I want minty fresh breath just as much as the next person, but I can&#x27;t stand the burn from the alcohol in mouthwashes such as Listerine.</li>
            <li>I am well aware of the potential for brown staining</li>
            <li>Sure enough on the back of the label it warns that it might stain teeth, and that proper brushing prevents it.</li>
            <li>I have used this product but instead of turning my teeth brown like most other&#x27;s, my teeth turned a yellow-orange color, especially close to the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>only con to this product would be that a while after rinsing I would have a funny taste in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>The stuff burnt my tongue at first use, 3 days later I still can&#x27;t taste the food.</li>
            <li>I used this last night for the first time after brushing and flossing my teeth.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I noticed blue specks in my sink.</li>
            <li>using it for a while now and it over long time fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>Upon first rinse I could instantly tell this mouthwash was doing the job without the burn.</li>
            <li>Used this for the first time last night, hoping it would help with some of my tonsil and gum issues.</li>
            <li>The Crest Pro-Health line of dental care are some pretty solid products.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel cleaner and my mouth feels fresh long after I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li>After the first couple of uses it is definitely a go to item in my house!</li>
            <li>My entire family prefers it to our other mouthwash and love the taste and way</li>
            <li>It kept my mouth fresh all day long.</li>
            <li>Not a whole cap full.</li>
            <li>It makes my breath fresh for a very long time.</li>
            <li>My family has been using this mouthwash for the past couple weeks all thanks to the free sample we received from Crest.</li>
            <li>Though it says alcohol free, I did get a slight burning sensation when I used it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually pretty confused as to why people are reporting brown stains on their teeth as a result of using this product-- Crest sent me a bottle of this product to try and review, and I actually love it.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is that it does seem to stain your teeth a little but as long as you have a good brushing routine, it won&#x27;t effect you.</li>
            <li>So my dentist cleaned it off my teeth with a little scrapey tool and my teeth were fine.</li>
            <li>Very smooth flavor, hard to explain unless you try it yourself.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this mouthwash for several months, and my experience has been positive.</li>
            <li>crest pro health has such a long lasting refreshing taste.</li>
            <li>Potential to leave brown stains (though I have not been using it long enough to say for sure)</li>
            <li>In the last week though my mouth feels much cleaner, especially when I first wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t taste anything sour or any type of unique flavors.  </li>
            <li>Unlike some other products, it had no bad aftertaste</li>
            <li>I especially like that it is alcohol free because alcohol can lead to dry mouth where bacteria can thrive.</li>
            <li>and there is only a slight tingle while using it :).</li>
            <li>Luckily, I didn&#x27;t experience the tooth staining, but losing my sense of taste for several days was quite enough.  </li>
            <li>I got a free bottle from Bzzagent and unfortunately it was just too strong for me.</li>
            <li>I feel like my mouth is actually clean compared to other ones that feel less than clean before i even exit my bathroom.</li>
            <li>I hate that alcohol burn from mouth wash, so luckily this one was pretty smooth, but makes your mouth feel and smell minty clean.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t honestly think of a single thing that either of us disliked about this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy on the mouth &amp; not strong to the point where it burns.</li>
            <li>Tried some lemon juice to see the opposite and it tasted like pure battery acid.</li>
            <li>It makes my mouth feel clean as well as protects my teeth and cuts down on the plaque,it also kills germs and helps prevent gingivitis</li>
            <li>When you spit, any pieces of food or plaque come out as darker clumps of blue so older kids and teens like to use it because they can visually see how much they are cleaning out of their mouth my using it!</li>
            <li>Since it is alcohol free, it does not dry out my mouth like other mouthwashes.</li>
            <li>I have tried numerous other brands and I find them to be too strong and burn during use.  </li>
            <li>The clear has been discontinued and amazon is sneaky in the footnotes that they may alter which one they send you.  </li>
            <li>Clearly the ADA is not a source for information in regards to health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping it will go away completely in the next day or so as I would really like to taste the food I eat again.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels as clean if not cleaner than going to the the dentist and a lot less invasive.</li>
            <li>I would buy it here if i knew it was the clear one</li>
            <li>and I need to buy the clear mint.</li>
            <li>I would get the Clear Mint.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels as clean if not cleaner than going to the the dentist and a lot less invasive.</li>
            <li>I use this product constantly and it really works.</li>
            <li>and  I don&#x27;t have any complaints so far, except that i read the labels and it said it could</li>
            <li>Oral-B Triumph Professional Care Electric Toothbrush.   </li>
            <li>Please inform me if a class action lawsuit happens.</li>
            <li>I have to say that i love this product despite all the negative comments about the mouthwash.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this mouthwash to use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>I like the taste and lack of burn that this product offers, but I am not thoroughly convinced it does anything.</li>
            <li>Wow i disagree with all the reviews and don&#x27;t understand.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get why this product has so many negative ratings.</li>
            <li>I stopped using it before I had to get my teeth professionally cleaned.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of its sweetness that early in the AM.</li>
            <li>So far I like it</li>
            <li>My hygienist recommended this product because alcohol-based mouthwash makes my teeth sensitive.  </li>
            <li>My 6 year old also likes using it bc</li>
            <li>If you absolutely must use this product for some strange reason, monitor your teeth for stains daily and stop at the first sign of streaks and darkening at the gums.  </li>
            <li>Wow...</li>
            <li>There should be a class action lawsuit against these P&amp;G hacks.</li>
            <li>Just imagine my frustration when I finally make a real effort to increase my dental hygiene by adding flossing and crest pro health mouthwash twice a day to my routine-- which already includes using a sonicare</li>
            <li>I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand and after a month of using it I would recommend this product because my mouth feels cleaner and my breath fresher; however if you have a sensitive mouth you will experience burning sensation for one or two minutes.</li>
            <li>I just wish they would make this in an all natural format.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But overall I really like the mouthwash and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would have to get a professional cleaning to have them cleaned anymore thoroughly than they already are.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive teeth, RUN, don&#x27;t walk away from this product.</li>
            <li>If you use a sensitive toothpaste, it will quite literally STRIP the sensitive toothpaste protection from your teeth and you will be in unbearable agony.</li>
            <li>&quot; many have complained about.  </li>
            <li>This mouthwash is my least favorite of all time.  </li>
            <li>This product legally should be removed from all stores until further notice.</li>
            <li>initially received this as a sample in the mail for free, but I definitely plan on buying this from now on in the future.</li>
            <li>so far have been using it for about a week and haven&#x27;t noticed any &amp;#34;stains&amp;#34; or anything like that&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>this product is complete garbage.</li>
            <li>Before trying the rinse I assumed it would leave a burning effect in my mouth, however, I was pleasantly surprised with its mildness.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this mouthwash to anyone that wants a healthier mouth.</li>
            <li>If a 3 year old likes it</li>
            <li>I use it in conjunction with a professional ultrasonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I used Crest for many years, but this has soured me.  </li>
            <li>Why is Crest still selling a product that completely kills your sense of taste?  </li>
            <li>and so far I like it.</li>
            <li>It does not burn at all (even my 6 year old likes it).  </li>
            <li>I have no trouble getting my 4 kids to use the mouthwash, but beware that it CAN cause staining.</li>
            <li>but, I was pleasantly surprised by this one.</li>
            <li>After using for several weeks straight, I don&#x27;t see any whitening changes, but there are lesser plague and my gum doesn&#x27;t bleed as much as I used to.</li>
            <li>Thankfully I was able to see this seems to be common with this product.  </li>
            <li>and I am absolutely going to fight to get my money back.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the taste.</li>
            <li>I am going to be looking to join a class action suit</li>
            <li>If anyone out there wants to join I suggest you do the same!</li>
            <li>If anyone out there wants to join I suggest you do the same!</li>
            <li>Now she&#x27;s completely lost her sense of taste and there&#x27;re white/dry spots all over in her mouth.</li>
            <li>I have had no trouble</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>My 10 year old was here when it arrived</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 52 years old and just thought it was an age thing.</li>
            <li>As far as browning teeth goes, I don&#x27;t want to stay and find out.</li>
            <li>My seven year old son even uses it and doesn&#x27;t complain about it burning his mouth.  </li>
            <li>There are even a couple of spots lower near my chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I hope Crest sees a class action lawsuit over this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve marked this product one star because of Amazon&#x27;s decision to drop it from Subscribe and Save, in order to get their attention.  </li>
            <li>I can say so far</li>
            <li>i gotta say its by far my fav mouthwash.</li>
            <li>If this product continues to cause harm to people, the makers of this product may have a product liability class action on their hands.  </li>
            <li>There is one for tarter control, sensitive teeth and multi-protection.  </li>
            <li>My opinions are completely my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, her lymph nodes also became inflamed and sensitive to the touch.</li>
            <li>But in case you do, hopefully you research and come across this information early to forgo the pain caused to others by this mouthwash.</li>
            <li>My dental hygentist recommended I use flouride rinse cause of my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>so my teeth won&#x27;t be so sensitive.  </li>
            <li>My 6 year old son and</li>
            <li>Turns out the WOW factor is alcohol, which I can do without.</li>
            <li>And why hasn&#x27;t our litigious society fixed it?</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>After 2 years of preparation to have straight and white teeth, I have brown stains in between and surrounding the bracket.</li>
            <li>Negative 5 stars for sure.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can gamble to see if it will affect you or not, but it took a professional cleaning to get rid of the stains for me.</li>
            <li>I absolutely anti-recommend this product, and don&#x27;t understand why in its current formulation it remains on the market.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>After using for a week I really didn&#x27;t notice a big difference.  </li>
            <li>We frequently purchase store brand products in order to save.</li>
            <li>My mouth was definitely feeling fresh for several hours.  </li>
            <li>Well, it only works if you want to go from a Vanna White smile to looking like</li>
            <li>She called the local distributor and asked about having the item pulled from the shelves, or at least have some kind of warning put on the label, but Crest hasn&#x27;t done so.  </li>
            <li>it left my teeth white and my it made my breathe feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see so many negative reviews.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for a product that would provide fresh breath and that would actually taste like something I would not want to give up using and Crest Pro-Health Multi Protection mouthwash, does actually that for me.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this as the entire product line really is worth it.</li>
            <li>After using it twice a day for a few weeks I&#x27;ve noticed a much brighter smile.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t experienced any of the negative side effects (such as discoloration or tongue problems) that other reviewers have mentioned.</li>
            <li>I am still going back to Crest after using my listerine, although maybe looking at my other options in the crest brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it&#x27;s alcohol free, which is not the same with other mouthwash brands.</li>
            <li>Other brands that I have used prior to this product would usually leave strong burn in my mouth(even alcohol free).</li>
            <li>Waited an hour and a half, had some salami and wondered why it was so sickly sweet.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample from #BzzAgent and have been using it off and on for the past few weeks, I like the way it keeps my mouth feeling fresh for almost the whole day after I swish.</li>
            <li>Other than that it has been kept my breath smelling fresh for hours.</li>
            <li>Other than that I noticed it leaves my breath just as fresh as Scope</li>
            <li>I found the it didn&#x27;t keep my breath as fresh as some other mouth washes.</li>
            <li>I rotate this with my whitening mouthwash and have noticed a difference in how fresh my mouth remains longer than the other.</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t have that fresh feeling like I get from other mouthwashes.  </li>
            <li>I am definitely converted over to this product as my new go to mouthwash!</li>
            <li>The only downside is that the nice minty taste does not last as long after rinsing as some other mouthwashes do.</li>
            <li>Like so many other reviewers, I suddenly noticed (as did those around me) brown stains in between my bottom teeth a few weeks after first using this product.</li>
            <li>I am a heavy coffee drinker and this product still leaves my mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li>Also love the subtle minty flavor.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not too harsh and it leaves my mouth feeling refreshed and clean longer than just brushing.</li>
            <li>Perhaps only a small peercentage of users experience this problem, but I sure did.</li>
            <li>like but fresh minty long lasting</li>
            <li>quick Google search online brings up countless complaints against this mouthwash, listing the same symptoms, so we are obviously not alone.</li>
            <li>Sometimes, I&#x27;ll go back and floss again and rinse again after eating a particularly crumbly item that gets in your teeth (like roasted almonds), and it lets you know when all the food particles that cause plaque are gone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Unlike many reviewers, my teeth haven&#x27;t turned brown, but I&#x27;ve only used this twice in the past two days.</li>
            <li>This product left the strong bitter taste in my mouth  making everything I eat or drank just taste bad… I&#x27;m going back to Act.</li>
            <li>After several more weeks had passed of avoiding dark foods the stains intensified enough to make me investigate the mouthwash since it was the only new part of our routine.</li>
            <li>Anyways, I think this Crest mouthwash it decent for it&#x27;s price and works as much as any other mouthwash does.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend a second look</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for someone who is looking for something different than the norm.</li>
            <li>It does what it says, and has a pleasant taste, but it seems expensive for something that is so basic.  </li>
            <li>The only real complaint is I wasn&#x27;t in love with the flavor because I like a little more WOW factor with my mouthwash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if the teeth staining is accurate</li>
            <li>Just got this product for free from Buzzagent and for the past 2 weeks</li>
            <li>It really works,just has a strange after taste and foam</li>
            <li>and I doubt they care much about their customers as long as stuff still</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d noticed them recently and couldn&#x27;t understand where they had come from as nothing in my normal routine had changed.  </li>
            <li>With so many time tested alternatives on the market, its simply not worth even trying in my opinion due to the risk of adverse reactions, and loss of time in trying to recoup your costs from the company if it doesn&#x27;t work out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted P&amp;G, only to be told that all of these things are normal.</li>
            <li>But recently Crest apparently has decided to use a new formula and now I can&#x27;t use it!</li>
            <li>Like many other people I had a loss of taste but also had extreme pain, swollen glans!</li>
            <li>buy this; it isn&#x27;t worth pouring down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also found that my breath stayed fresh longer than with other brands, and that equates cleaner to me!</li>
            <li>Luckily, my hygienist mentioned she&#x27;d seen staining on teeth from other who used this product once I explained that this was the only change I&#x27;d made.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the fault that I&#x27;ve found with this product is that when I spit it out, it clumps together in bright blue, fiber-like strands that stick to your sink and have to be SCRUBBED off - even if you spit while the water is running!.  </li>
            <li>I noticed fresher breath, longer lasting clean feeling, and less sensitivity within 2 weeks of using Crest-Pro Health rinse every day.</li>
            <li>, this is AMAZING!&amp;#34; As if that wasn&#x27;t a big enough plus to keep using the mouthwash I notice every time I use the mouthwash I notice it cleans my teeth very well</li>
            <li>I received a bottle of Crest Pro-Health for free to try out and review, it&#x27;s been a few weeks since I starting using it</li>
            <li>it never provided me with the fresh breath feeling that i expect from mouthwashes, and the various reviews that vouch for this product causing stained teeth are alarming.</li>
            <li>It was an issue big enough to make me permanently switch to Crest Pro-Health and highly recommend it to others!  </li>
            <li>I am using less gum because my mouth is staying fresh longer</li>
            <li>I used it only twice and developed severe pain in my molars (sensitivity to touch and pressure), a sore throat, swollen sores on my tongue, stains near my gum line, and I lost my sense of taste for 12 hours.</li>
            <li>I hate how so many alcohol containing mouth rinses burn, but most of the non alcohol rinses taste like mint water.</li>
            <li>I hate how so many alcohol containing mouth rinses burn, but most of the non alcohol rinses taste like mint water.</li>
            <li>Usually I have sore gums throughout the day and after using this mouthwash I have seen a significant change in the way my gums have felt.</li>
            <li>I know this has been reported in MANY other reviews, but I thought adding my story will send a stronger message to the manufacturer that this is not a rare occurrence, and BUYER BEWARE!</li>
            <li>but I make sure I use this product at least once a day!</li>
            <li>A major U.S. to this product is that it didn&#x27;t burn my mouth at all.</li>
            <li>All the benefits in one place can only have me saying WOW!</li>
            <li>I tried the Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection mouth wash and haven&#x27;t had any major issues with it.</li>
            <li>When I say easy to follow, I mean the mouthwash doesn&#x27;t burn.  </li>
            <li>I floss and use soft picks daily and very rarely have issues with soreness or bleeding, but after three uses of this mouthwash, my gums became visibly swollen and so tender that flossing was very painful and resulted in a fair amount of bleeding, to the point where I had to stop flossing.</li>
            <li>It makes my mouth feel so healthy and clean without the painful alcohol burn.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After only a few days of switching to the Crest rinse, I was amazed with how clean and plaque-free my teeth were.</li>
            <li>To me my main concern is using it at night since there is more chance of getting cavities or anything wrong with your mouth when you sleep.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After five weeks of using Crest Pro Health once a day in the morning with no other changes in my routine, I was growing concerned at the brown stainings that were appearing in between my teeth and near the gum lines and becoming worse.</li>
            <li>However, since it was mouthwash and mouthwash generally has that effect (</li>
            <li>I use this mouthwash multiple times daily and I feel clean and refreshed with a slight tingle.</li>
            <li>I have noticed also that my breath stays freshened clear up to around mid afternoon</li>
            <li>I thought I ordered the clear liquid, not the blue.  </li>
            <li>I usually use Crest&#x27;s 3D white mouthwash, but Crest sent me a free bottle of this Pro-health mouthwash to try.</li>
            <li>This is by far the only mouthwash I will ever use.</li>
            <li>From my personal experience, I would recommend Listerine, which gave me no trouble, or basically anything that isn&#x27;t Crest.rouble, or basically anything that isn&#x27;t Crest.</li>
            <li>No burn I definitely recommend it to anyone who has sensitive gums/teeth</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive teeth it will take over a week away from this product to begin to build your resistance back up.</li>
            <li>I use it regularly especially because there is no harsh alcohol taste.</li>
            <li>My teeth are naturally quite white.</li>
            <li>I also brush with the Crest Complete, Extra Whitening + scope tooth paste.  </li>
            <li>In the morning I brush with sensitive toothpaste, followed by flossing, followed by waterpik, and lastly mouthwash.</li>
            <li>Crest apparently changed the formula and people are complaining everywhere</li>
            <li>I really do not like &amp;#34;hating&amp;#34; anything, however this product is absolutely trash and should be avoided by consumers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had no cavities on my last visit and the dental hygienist was amazed that I had not had a professional cleaning in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My cheeks then started to swell, and not only burned, but were extremely sensitive to the touch.</li>
            <li>But it is the CPC in Pro-health that provides the anti-gingivitis protection that is CRUCIAL if you want to keep your teeth into old age.  </li>
            <li>The CPC is apparently what causes the browning in SOME people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had no browning or tastebud issues whatsoever after years of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only thing that I have done differently from normal is to use Crest Pro Health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it has only been a short time and am still waiting for my taste to return to normal.</li>
            <li>But after trying the product twice a day for a few weeks now, I&#x27;m really not crazy about it.</li>
            <li>Many products on Amazon receive what I consider to be fraudulent reviews in favor of poor products but now I see it goes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m tired of his lectures to brush and floss and rinse more.</li>
            <li>I feel like it doesn&#x27;t even clean my mouth and leaves nasty stains more than cleans!!</li>
            <li>Now my lips are very chapped and the corners are really dry, flaky and still red.</li>
            <li>This formula is alcohol free which mean that it is safer and easier to maintain it for 30 seconds in our mouths because it wont hurt our burn.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve using biotene mouth wash for a long time with no problem but wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li>Even after I stopped using my mouth did not feel right for a few days.</li>
            <li>After using Crest Pro-Health for about a week my mouth feels much cleaner for way longer than it has with other mouth washes.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like it at first because it left a strange after taste that would make everything I ate taste strange for about 2 hours after rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it is very pricey compared to other brands.</li>
            <li>This product works really than the other mouth washes I have tried.</li>
            <li>and it also does not burns as much like other mouth wash</li>
            <li>When I received my Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection mouthwash, I was excited to try it because I have had bad experiences with other mouthwash brands that were too strong or had too much alcohol in them.  </li>
            <li>Yes, I do drink tea but not a single drop of coffee though.</li>
            <li>I picked up this Crest Pro Health Mouth Rinse at Sam&#x27;s Club- was out of my regular mouthwash &amp; figured I&#x27;d try this (and that the flouride might be a nice addition)-- WRONG.</li>
            <li>I have since tried ACT alcohol free mouthwash and found that it is minty fresh and doesn&#x27;t cause my mouth to go numb.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;ve only used this product a few weeks after being a sent a complimentary bottle to review (I was not compensated n</li>
            <li>I have two fancy caps, like fake teeth, right in the front of my smile</li>
            <li>This product gave me very dark brown stains that gradually snuck up on me, in between my teeth, by the time the first bottle was gone.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s a big plus for me because I can never finish with the other brands it burns to much</li>
            <li>My teeth are cleaner, MY breath is fresher, and MY last checkup turned out EXTREMELY well, thanks to Crest</li>
            <li>I will probably buy this again as long as I do not experience any staining or sensitive teeth issues.</li>
            <li>My teeth did feel sore after the first few uses</li>
            <li>if you rinse before bed and don&#x27;t drink at least a full glass of water</li>
            <li>Until after a few days, we both discussed oursymptoms together for the first time and put two and two together.</li>
            <li>The first few days were tough since I am not a fan of strong minty tastes.</li>
            <li>Instead of having a fresh clean feeling, my mouth burned and my tongue was numb.</li>
            <li>This has helped keep my teeth from being super sensitive to hot and cold foods.</li>
            <li>I usually shy away from this flavor because the mint is too strong but not with this one!  </li>
            <li>My teeth have also become much more sensitive in the last two weeks, and for at least a few hours after using the product, I can&#x27;t taste a thing.</li>
            <li>We brush and especially floss religiously every single day, we even use two mouthwashes afterwards as part of our normal routine.</li>
            <li>I have to say the 1 star reviews for this product are accurate; a family member of mine experienced all the terrible things mentioned in other reviews.</li>
            <li>I mean it does have a cool mint taste</li>
            <li>The reason is the Glide \\&quot;glides\\&quot; right past the plaque and food build up leaving the teeth unclean.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it for very long but so far, I like it.</li>
            <li>and she too has said how much she enjoys it compared to our previous brand.</li>
            <li>I do still feel a slight burning sensation but its very tolerable.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference in there being less &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; when I brush and floss or in the color of my teeth or gums.</li>
            <li>Come to find out there is a whole forum on the subject.</li>
            <li>It seems to last a long time as far as freshness of breath goes to which is always a plus.</li>
            <li>I tried Crest Pro -health for the first time few days ago and instantly became a fan!</li>
            <li>First of all, I&#x27;m really surprised to see all these negative reviews.</li>
            <li>None of the foods I tried had much flavor, but salty and sour things were especially flavorless.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely a strong mouth wash, but we have not experienced any burning.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought this product is fine, the only problem is that the taste is a little too strong, well, I could still handle it if this was the only annoying aspect.</li>
            <li>I received this for free from BzzAgent, I had high expectations for this product, but have to say I was pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li>Kinda odd to see so many negative reviews.</li>
            <li>First off this stuff made my tongue feel raw which lasted for hours</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is serious about the health of their mouth because it really does as it claims.</li>
            <li>I guess I thought since it was alcohol free it would be really mild, but, while it didn&#x27;t burn as bad as the ones with alcohol, I definitely felt it</li>
            <li>No over-powering alcohol taste, just a subtle, sweet flavor.</li>
            <li>(I asked my husband who can at times speak his mind a little bit too much.</li>
            <li>only does it do the job, if not a better job, than the bitter mouthwash that is now in the trash, but Crest Pro-health makes my breath minty and fresh!</li>
            <li>You definitely feel clean right after use, but at first I didn&#x27;t think it lasted very long and was doubtful about the \\&quot;24 hour</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t clean your sink daily while using this product, you&#x27;re more than likely going to end up wit awful, vibrant blue chunks stuck all over it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pointless to use an alcohol free mw if the active ingredient actually makes your teeth hurt (it does to me).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to lie to you and say that this mouthwash has fixed every little problem in my mouth, say that it has made my teeth pearly white, or go as far to say that it has replaced my routine dental exams because</li>
            <li>gum turned very sensitive and even bleed often due to pregnancy, and my wisdom teeth ache too.</li>
            <li>It does a good job at keeping your mouth feeling fresh for awhile but it leaves a bad after taste thats hard to get out of tour mouth</li>
            <li>After a cleaning that took 1 hour longer than normal and unpleasant blasting of my teeth, the stains were able to be removed, so they were not permanent.</li>

            <li> Works great and tastes great too!</li>
            <li> But do not taste that great or do not smell the greatest either.</li>
            <li> The taste was great, no burning like the brands containing alcohol have and it worked great for me!  </li>

            <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;Bottom</li>
            <li> This product works really great</li>
            <li> For me in my opinion this is a GREAT mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> Taste great and freshens breath.</li>
            <li> The taste is great</li>
            <li> Great concept, great idea but misses the mark with the staining issue.</li>
            <li> I used to use Colgate, which I will be happy to do the switch since now</li>
            <li> Has a great taste and makes your mouth feel refreshed</li>

            <li> It works great and does the cleaning without all the alcohol burn and aftertaste.</li>
            <li> So for me, mouthwash has always been nice in the aspect that it freshens breath, but it has been a pain because it does not feel the greatest to use.</li>
            <li> and i think the price is great for this one.</li>
            <li> I am happy that this product does not whiten, rather, it makes my teeth stronger and healthier from within.</li>

            <li> It has a great minty taste and isn&#x27;t too overpowering.  </li>

            <li> , my mouth felt great after using it as well as my teeth, i will use this from now on.</li>
            <li> It does a great job</li>

            <li> I am happy it doesn&#x27;t have alcohol in it so my children have been using it now too</li>
            <li> Great price until I was using it.</li>
            <li> It worked great but the side effects of the antiseptic caused brown staining.</li>
            <li> lol)  </li>

            <li> Still has the great Mint flavor, not overpowering.</li>

            <li> I am in good health otherwise.</li>
            <li> The taste is really good and it makes my teeth feel alot cleaner than just brushing them alone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a good mouthwash</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this wonderful product.  </li>
            <li> So, the flavor is good.</li>
            <li> Used this to help my gums so I could look good for the dentist again.</li>
            <li> It had a good taste.</li>
            <li> It also makes me feel good to know that it is protecting my teeth.</li>
            <li> Providing the protection i needed and the best part is it is alcohol free</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really good about brushing/flossing</li>
            <li> but it wouldn&#x27;t be fair to do that</li>

            <li> my opinion is that it works really good</li>
            <li> (1) crest is not alone, every mouthrinse does that; (2) it is consumer&#x27;s fault; (3) discoloration is actually good sign.</li>
            <li> I loved how this mouth wash tasted and that it didn&#x27;t burn my mouth.</li>
            <li> If you want a good mouthwash this is the one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always on the lookout for products that promote good oral health,  as I suffer from periodontal disease.  </li>
            <li> The price is fair.  </li>
            <li> Really good mouth wash.</li>
            <li> But it good.</li>
            <li> IF CREST WAS GOOD FOR MY TEETH</li>
            <li> Good luck.</li>
            <li> I received my free sample of Crest Pro-Health and it is the best I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> My husband has used it and loved it.</li>
            <li> The Clean Mint flavor is the best I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not being paid to write a review, when I tried this mouthwash I was very happy with the taste and how clean my mouth felt.</li>
            <li> Woke up this morning with a strong metallic taste in my mouth, and despite brushing my teeth twice today (soon after i woke up, and after lunch), i still can&#x27;t taste any of my food, and not just any food, but spicy Thai food and chocolate ice cream!!</li>
            <li> When I use this in the mornings I honestly don&#x27;t have to worry about it - it keeps my breath smelling nice!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad product, although, I won&#x27;t say it is the best either.</li>
            <li> but it DOES make breath smell nice for some time and has a pleasant (gentle/non-harsh) feel while using.</li>
            <li> I also love being able to use a great tasting mouthwash without feeling the tear inducing burn!</li>
            <li> The best part is that it kept my teeth feeling nice and clean all day even after eating sweets.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s healthy for you and it feels great doing it by the comfort of ones home.</li>
            <li> My very favorite thing is that it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; my mouth when I use it.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for quite some time and am very pleased with the feeling I get after using it.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my breath fresh, and even greatly decreases the ever-dreaded morning breath!</li>
            <li> It leaves my mouth feeling fresh and tastes great!</li>
            <li> My daughter even uses this product, I would rec this to anyone looking for a great mouthwash and not to mention its alcohol free too!</li>
            <li> It doesnt burn my mouth which I LOVE and doesnt taste putrid.. just a great mint flavor.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very refreshing.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the flavor!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I am very pleased with the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I have been using the mouth wash and am very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> Minty fresh breath is the best and this will do the job.</li>
            <li> I received this Crest Pro - Health Multi -Protection Alcohol  as a sample and was very pleased .</li>
            <li> It makes me feel so fresh and my breath smells great.!</li>
            <li> I liked the minty taste and loved the fact that I didn&#x27;t feel like I was swishing rubbing alcohol around in my mouth.</li>
            <li> so I realized the best time to use is right before going to bed.</li>
            <li> so there is no burn, but I get a great clean feel!</li>
            <li> Buy it, try it -YOU&#x27;LL LOVE IT!</li>

            <li> I love that the size of the bottle is very easy to hold and fits perfectly on my sink shelf without taking up too much room.</li>
            <li> I thought that while rinsing  my mouth, it was very strong and tingling in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s very easy not to.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to do both.</li>
            <li> I have been very happy with the result so far!</li>
            <li> but our teeth are also becoming whiter and feel cleaner!</li>
            <li> I always feel like my mouth is clean and teeth are nice and bright.</li>
            <li> It leaves my mouth with a fresh, clean feeling all day and my breath smells great!</li>

            <li> If not, then the product could be a good fit for you.</li>
            <li> The kind of stains that no whitening strip or brushing has been able to help remove.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to use my electric toothbrush while it healed and had to use a manual one; not as effective at cleaning.</li>
            <li> o)I have tried a lot of mouthwashes in my day and this is by far one of the best!</li>

            <li> This mouthwash is great, the flavor is good not burning like alot of other mouthwashes out there,#crest-pro-health is welcome at my home</li>
            <li> It is the most refreshing, clean feeling I&#x27;ve ever experienced from a mouthwash that lasts for hours.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample from Smiley360 and my opinions are my own, but I love the product!  </li>
            <li> I strongly advise you NOT to use this mouthwash!</li>
            <li> No stinging just a refreshed feeling with a good clean taste</li>
            <li> Second, the mouthwash tastes great and smells great as well.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t get a good, clean feeling using this.</li>
            <li> Absolutly love crest pro health it leaves my mouth feeling fresh and breath smelling great</li>

            <li> I was very happy to see an alcohol free mouth wash that is safe for the whole family to use.</li>
            <li> I received a free bottle of Crest Pro Health mouth wash from Smiley360 and am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I received a free bottle of Crest Pro Health mouth wash from Smiley360 and am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> The first night I used it, I thought it was great.  </li>
            <li> First of all, my sympathies for those who have experienced problems with this product.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t been able to find one I liked for so many years, and then when this came out - it&#x27;s not my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with my results and I will be purchasing Crest Pro Health when my free bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a sweet mint flavor and it keeps my mouth tasting good for awhile after I use it.</li>
            <li> so that is great although I think that the ment taste is a bit to strong for my liking by love the product I got my full sized bottle for bzzagent</li>
            <li> Most of them were too strong for me; they would make my mouth burn and my eyes water!</li>
            <li> Oral Health is something I find very important.</li>
            <li> I also think it is very important that it kills germs, prevents gingivitis, keeps teeth cleaner, and reduces plaque buildup.</li>
            <li> I really liked that it was not to strong</li>
            <li> As a smoker sometimes i need a quick fix to get rid of the smells of cigarettes breathe , and crest did a good job of doing that in one rinse.</li>
            <li> Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34; Crest Pro-Health has a pleasant minty taste and leaves my mouth feeling fresh for hours without the burn of alcohol.</li>
            <li> I received a free bottle of this through Bzz agent and I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I received a free sample from Crest and Bzz agent to try and I have to say I love it!</li>
            <li> The feeling that i have while i feel the mouthwash working on my teeth and gums is very refreshing and powerful!</li>
            <li> This mouthwash is really great- not too strong of an alcohol taste and leaves your mouth fresh until lunch.</li>
            <li> , That most importantly is alcohol free!!</li>
            <li> So fresh and so clean !!!</li>
            <li> It has a very nice, clean, unique flavor that doesn&#x27;t burn my mouth.</li>
            <li> I certainly haven&#x27;t experienced any staining, and I&#x27;ve used this product for about a month.</li>
            <li> I loved the tingly feeling and that it is alcohol free is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> It is not an overload like most mouthwashes are.  </li>
            <li> like with most mouthwashes.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Listerine would be a better choice if you have gum problems.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t change it - my healthy mouth</li>
            <li> My husband and I LOVE this mouthwash.</li>

            <li> Use the Act mouthwash in the morning because it has a really potent amount of fluoride in it</li>
            <li> but my friend convinced me that the Oral-B Triumph cleans better and it does if you do the research.  </li>
            <li> I would trust any bottle with the seal in tact that you purchased from a reputable store.</li>
            <li> but he won&#x27;t do it for free!  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;d leave stains and burn off taste buds just like Crest, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;d be cheaper.</li>

            <li> I like that it does not burn my mouth and love the taste and after taste.</li>
            <li> Great mouth wash, isn&#x27;t overly minty for those who don&#x27;t like mint, and my favorite part is that it really doesn&#x27;t burn when you use it, since it is alcohol-free.  </li>
            <li> and i do love there toothpaste</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll preface by saying that I&#x27;m in my 20s, don&#x27;t drink more than a couple cups of coffee/tea a week</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m at a healthy weight that I maintain mostly by food choices, and I&#x27;ve always been a bit lax in the flossing department, but I brush every day.</li>
            <li> Through BzzAgent I was able to try this product.</li>
            <li> Depending on the packaging, some bottles may be more child safe than others.</li>

            <li> In today&#x27;s economy, I need to make sure that every choice I make is financially sound.</li>
            <li> Received this product free from Smiley360 and love it.  </li>
            <li> Maybe they&#x27;ve changed the formula or there was some sort of smear campaign because I received a full size free bottle to try and give my HONEST opinion</li>
            <li> I liked the flavor (fresh mint)</li>
            <li> This mouthwash really does taste good and it does not burn, probably because it is alcohol-free,  </li>
            <li> I loved this flavor just as much as the \\&quot;tartar protection\\</li>

            <li> I will be switching to the full line of Pro-Health products way to go Crest!  </li>
            <li> I used an Oral B rinse for about six months with excellent results but it was recalled due to manufacturing problems.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when BzzAgent sent me Crest Pro-Health mouthwash to try for free!</li>
            <li> So I received a full size, bottle of this mouthwash from BzzAgent a couple weeks ago!</li>
            <li> But no worries, my breath is still cool!</li>
            <li> and it doesnt burn my mouth and no bad breath!</li>
            <li> the taste is refreshing and clean, doesn&#x27;t burn.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are clean and gums healthy.  </li>
            <li> so my 3 year old can use it now, and learn how important having great oral hygiene is.</li>
            <li> The taste is actually very mild.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash helps a lot in getting cleansing easily done, so I do not have to brush my teeth all the time.</li>
            <li> Also when you analyze the bottle you can see a 24HR protection symbol which I really trust for Crest being an exceptional brand but</li>
            <li> I received Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Refreshing Clean Mint Rinse as a part of a BzzCampaign.</li>
            <li> There is a mark on the inside of the cap for easy measuring with no guessing.</li>
            <li> My mouth felt more clean then ever before.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t any bitterness or acidity and it feels very mild on my mouth while still freshening.</li>
            <li> Health Rinse leaves a film on the teeth that is easily stained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the bottle design and the easy to use cap.</li>
            <li> your products are supposed to clean teeth, not make more work for the dentist.  </li>

            <li> But I give it four stars because the taste is too strong for me to rinse for over 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> Crest rinse doesn&#x27;t have a strong after taste or burn when rinsing.</li>
            <li> NOT TO STRONG</li>
            <li> It does not have a strong burning taste like</li>
            <li> The taste isn&#x27;t too strong, yet it works wonders.  </li>
            <li> The mint flavor is not too strong.</li>
            <li> She strongly suggested switching to Listerine Zero.</li>
            <li> I love the taste and the way it makes my whole mouth feel very clean!</li>
            <li> It has a very pleasant flavor and absolutely no alcohol &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The first time feeling was so amazing....</li>
            <li> My semi-annual cleanings are stellar -- almost no plaque, three cavities in my life, and all my own teeth.</li>
            <li> We love the alcohol free, fresh taste!</li>
            <li> I received a full bottle to test and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> The feel that I have after rinsing an leaving my teeth feel fresh and clean is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Through my Smiley360 membership, I was given a free sample of Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Rinse â\\&quot; Refreshing Clean Mint to try and review.</li>
            <li> Love the clean feeling I have throughout the day after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li> For best results, use it with REACH floss handles to get in between the teeth and down the gum line.</li>
            <li> They should put a large font WARNING sign on the Front of the bottle \\&quot;IN MOST CASES, WILL CAUSE BROWN TEETH\\&quot;!  </li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t have the burn of alcohol, and my mouth still feels fresh and clean!</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-health is a great tasting mouthwash that makes my teeth feel extra clean!  </li>
            <li> It worked great and left my mouth feeling clean without the burn!</li>
            <li> did a campaign on this FINE product as a bzz</li>
            <li> I believe it&#x27;s just another fine quality product from Crest!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then I read the fine print on the bottle</li>
            <li> My experience with Crest Pro Health has been nothing less that Great!</li>
            <li> I love the refreshing taste that leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> At first, I really enjoyed this mouthwash, because it seemed so potent.</li>
            <li> It started out fine.</li>
            <li> Once a day is fine.  </li>
            <li> then you will be fine with this product.</li>
            <li> and then sand-blasted with a sodium bicarbonate fine powder.</li>
            <li> Fortunately I&#x27;ve heard these stains can be easily removed at the dentist.</li>
            <li> Strong oral hygiene is so important and can prevent heart disease.</li>
            <li> Besides the staining, she also said I had a ton of plaque and tartar buildup, so the mouthwash doesn&#x27;t even do an adequate cleaning job!</li>
            <li> and they enjoy the flavor saying its not too strong like others</li>
            <li> Crest now has a loyal customer for life!</li>
            <li> It still does the job with the great freshness and no long term staining.</li>
            <li> and if ya brush well before using it won&#x27;t burn so much like most say it those trust me!</li>
            <li> It definitely doesn&#x27;t burn, which is a good thing for me, and tastes pretty good.  </li>
            <li> And now that I am pregnant, my dental care is even more important.  </li>
            <li> my smile is very important to me</li>
            <li> All that being said, it&#x27;s effective, lasts a good while and tastes less medicinal than most mouthwash.</li>
            <li> love that its alcohol free leaves me feeling fresh and clean without the burn of most mouthwashes i highly recommend thank you bzzagent for sending this to me for free to try this is my honest opinion</li>

            <li> Crest Pro-Health Alcohol Free u get the clean of Creating without the burn of the alcohol it leaves your mouth refreshingly clean and breath amazingly fresh</li>
            <li> So perhaps this crest one isn&#x27;t as effective (due to being alcohol-free) but it does freshen my mouth/breath and is a nice flavor.</li>
            <li> Although I would consider it mild, it still produces a optimally clean and fresh effect that lasts!</li>
            <li> and it leaves my mouth feeling super clean and fresh!</li>
            <li> Come on P&amp;G, do the right thing and get rid of it already!</li>
            <li> Love this mouthwash really gets your teeth clean w.o the burn.</li>
            <li> Even though I received my bottle from Smiley360 for free, I have checked the price out and it is priced decently well for the top quality product I have found it to be.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this for about 5 days now and my breath has been good all day, even the next morning, and my teeth FEEL clean after I brush.</li>
            <li> The blue Clean Mint is effective but doesn&#x27;t take nearly as good as the Clear Mint.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels so clean aftwr swishing and its a great flavor and ny breath smells fresh for so long!</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest, I got to try this product full size for FREE!</li>
            <li> I was curious to know if anyone else experienced this</li>
            <li> It has a taste of mint and it didn&#x27;t burn at all, my mouth felt fresh all day and my breath smelled fantastic.</li>
            <li> I noticed my mouth feels fresher longer, the taste is better than most available mouthwashes on the market, and my entire mouth feels cleaner after using.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s pretty harsh for most people, but I&#x27;ve always kind of liked it.  </li>
            <li> However, this time around I figured maybe that burning sensation wouldn&#x27;t be such a good idea on tender gums, so I tried this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health Whitening Toothpaste, 4.2-Ounce Carton (Pack of 6),   2.  ACT Restoring Mouthwash, Cool Splash Mint, 18-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 4)   3.  </li>
            <li> Cool.  </li>
            <li> When there are most days where i don&#x27;t want feel the intense burn from Listerine</li>
            <li> are cool,</li>
            <li> I received a full size sample of Crest Pro-health from BZZAgent as a promotion.</li>
            <li> I recently tried this product and loved it.</li>
            <li> It also gave me a good report from the last dentist appt.  </li>
            <li> Crest pro health has made my teeth look really white and my breath smell good.</li>
            <li> Better still, stay away from this product and keep a close eye on Crest and Proctor and Gamble products for those tiny warning labels that may contain the most important information of all.</li>
            <li> i recieved this full size product for review by Bzzagent.</li>
            <li> I feel like this is a way to con customers into purchasing their whitening products once they&#x27;ve ruined your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll never use any crest product ever again - there is a market full of competitors</li>
            <li> I received the full size sample as a bzzagent</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn my mouth and it is a lot easier to rinse for the full recommended 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> I got to test Crest Pro-Health Multi -Protection Alcohol free Mouthwash,  through Buzzagent, its fresh and minty without the burn.</li>
            <li> After more than 48 hours the symptoms have not decreased at all.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it and after a full day my symptoms went away.  </li>
            <li> I take good care of my teeth by brushing, flossing and regularly using a Sulca Brush.</li>
            <li> The cool minty taste leaves</li>
            <li> I received a full size bottle through bzzagent.</li>
            <li> I had been using this since around June 2014 after I got my wisdom teeth out and was looking for a more gentle wash while my mouth recovered.  </li>
            <li> however I received it FREE to try for myself from Smile 360.  </li>
            <li> to recently, I was using another brand of mouthwash which produced moderately good results.</li>
            <li> This product is outstanding for the whole family.</li>
            <li> a cap full for the full water pick load works well.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest for sending me a free sample!</li>
            <li> Using windex would be just as good as using this blue devil&#x27;s liquid</li>
            <li> Crest pro health has made my teeth look really white and my breath smell good.</li>
            <li> and my mouth/teeth felt super clean</li>
            <li> They sent me a full size product.</li>
            <li> Overall it is a good mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I was able to sample this product thanks to bzzagent and crest.</li>
            <li> and I have had no problems not bad burning with this products.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no bad aftertaste.  </li>
            <li> I will have to say the taste was not bad</li>
            <li> It leaves your breath refreshed and it has no bad after taste.  </li>
            <li> I like the minty taste and for a rinse its not bad.</li>
            <li> but right now I&#x27;m pretty safe from the brown teeth scare.</li>
            <li> I know my dentist is going to love me on my next visit because my mouth is in such good shape!</li>
            <li> i mean not the greatest</li>
            <li> My co-workers and friends have noticed a huge difference in my self esteem and how I am much more open to trying new things, all because my mouth feels clean and healthy!</li>
            <li> There is no alcohol burn like you get from other mouthwashes so my kids happily used it as well.</li>
            <li> Their wording, like that of their response to customers, might be technically true but, in my opinion, doesn&#x27;t leave the average reader with an accurate perception of the risks and of the prospects for successful treatment.    </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced the brown spots other reviewers have mentioned, but it does make me concerned and unsure if I will continue using it.  </li>
            <li> Now given that I paid a lot of money for my smile (braces), I like to take care of that smile, too!</li>

            <li> It is extraordinary.</li>
            <li> I needed a mouthwash to help with mild gingivitis</li>
            <li> It DOES say on the bottle that any antimicrobial product may cause stains, that the stains are not harmful or permanent, and adequate brushing or a visit to the dentist will remove them.  </li>
            <li> It acknowledges that the product can stain teeth, but with \\&quot;adequate brushing\\&quot; it \\&quot;may be prevented.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> , feel that feeling of cleanliness in my mouth and that I don&#x27;t feel that i am burning my lips is extraordinary,</li>
            <li> After reading about the brown teeth, I examined my own teeth and realized that my teeth were indeed tinged a light brown on the sides - after only one use!</li>
            <li> Since the company that sells this product doesn&#x27;t have the decency to adequately warn consumers, I advise people to avoid buying this bottle of acid altogether.</li>
            <li> These were delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> :) I even got to try it as a promotion although I&#x27;ll be for sure buying some in the future!</li>
            <li> do to I received a free bottle of it through bazzagent.com campaign #GotItFree to help promote this product and my own personal experience.</li>
            <li> Loved using it before bed and waking up the next morning with a fresh minty taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s embarrassing and I researched to find out what could have caused this so quickly with no diet changes.</li>
            <li> I actually like this one more than most.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s super affordable.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly like not being able to taste chocolate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The taste would make me want to throw up, even before I was pregnant.  </li>
            <li> I think as you use it regularly, the effects become better and better.  </li>
            <li> In that time, I&#x27;ve had unsightly brown staining between teeth that accumulated quickly between dental cleanings.</li>
            <li> I Can deal with a mild burn for 10 seconds since I</li>
            <li> Luckily I didn&#x27;t have to pay for this.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist told me today what caused it and (thank goodness) took an extra 20 minutes to clean my teeth and make sure it was all taken off!  </li>
            <li> i enjoy that one very much.</li>
            <li> It really does get your mouth clean!</li>

            <li> I really liked this mouth rinse better than some other mouth washes I have tried.</li>
            <li> Got this mouthwash free from BzzAgent.com thanks to CREST for providing it!  </li>
            <li> but I know that it could be better since I have use other products from Crest that leave and amazing after taste like the Crest Be toothpastes.</li>
            <li> Initially, I was very pleased with this--it didn&#x27;t sting like those based on alcohol.  </li>
            <li> I noticed after the very first time of using this that I lost my sense of taste for 12+ hours.</li>
            <li> I am trying this product free thanks to Crest and BzzAgent!</li>
            <li> I have been using it twice a day and am very satisfied with the overall results.  </li>
            <li> Overall this is 1 of my very favorite mouth washes period on the market at this time.</li>
            <li> was pleased to have the opportunity to use the Pro-Health Multi-Protection Rinse in conjunction with my normal Pro-Health Whitening Toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> as some other reviews stated and it works great leaving your mouth feeling fresh without any burn.</li>
            <li> Overall i&#x27;m very satisfied and will continue using the product.</li>
            <li> leaves cool ,fresh feeling after each rinse.</li>
            <li> The taste keeps you breath smelling good for 24 hours as long as you use it</li>
            <li> I have long since loved using Crest products, and this mouth wash did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> The moss weakens the rock because of the roots but take the rock out of the water and in to the sun and the moss dies and turns dark but then can be easily scraped off leaving a more healthy rock or in this case</li>
            <li> (doesn&#x27;t seem to be from the volume of complaints that I find online--there are surely many more who have not complained online) and even that this is a good sign of dead bacteria!  </li>
            <li> I used to use Crest toothpaste (until now), and as for mouthwash, had tried Listerine before this (which I found fairly strong, a little too strong for my taste), and Closys (which I really liked as it did not contain alcohol</li>
            <li> I have noticed fresher breath, no nasty film on my teeth, definitely my mouth feels CLEAN!</li>
            <li> and now I have a new favorite.</li>
            <li> This year, II made it my New Year&#x27;s resolution to get on top of my dental routine, and a couple months ago I added Crest Pro-Health mouthwash to my routine.</li>
            <li> I would gladly try any new product they offer.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> Now it will cost me more to remove the brown stains that have developed atop and between my bottom front teeth!  </li>
            <li> and I love it so far!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> Most people are rising with a whole cap full, which is too much and magnifying the side effects.</li>
            <li> According to our doctor, this product caused her to loose all the good bacteria in her mouth and encouraged yeast/thrush.</li>
            <li> my teeth are strong and only needed two fillings :)</li>
            <li> Not too strong but not weak at all.</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of how clean and pretty Crest products have helped my teeth stay; however, I did not like the aftertaste that this mouthwash leaves.</li>

            <li> A clean mouth can absolutely change your life!</li>
            <li> My mouth did feel extremely clean from the first use.</li>
            <li> For starters the taste is similar to medicine, so it may not be that enjoyable for some people; for us it was fine.</li>

            <li> I find the rinse to work well on making my mouth feel fresh after using once per day.</li>
            <li> I received the Crest Pro-Health multi protection mouthwash complimentary from Crest through a BzzAgent campaign.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good mouthwash and if you&#x27;re really concerned with staining then use a different brand.  </li>
            <li> The Crest website claims that this is rare</li>
            <li> Makes my mouth feel fresh</li>
            <li> And I was pleasantly surprised to see how great it actually is.</li>
            <li> You can feel it working and keeps my breath fresh.</li>
            <li> I would definitely look into purchasing this on my own, and would recommend if you are struggling with your dental care.</li>
            <li> When I do floss, rarely am I getting plaque on the string.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> My mouth feels fresh afterwards</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to the &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; of most mouthwashes and Crest</li>
            <li> My breath stays fresh for hours</li>
            <li> My breath is fresh.  </li>
            <li> , it leaves my mouth really fresh.</li>
            <li> Crest was kind enough to provide me with a complimentary sample.</li>
            <li> THE FRESH MINT FLAVOR&lt;br /&gt;ALSO</li>
            <li> YOUR BREATH STAYS FRESH LONGER</li>
            <li> It hurts to smile and pucker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yet it clearly states that it is Alcohol Free!</li>
            <li> No burn and makes your mouth feel fresh.</li>
            <li> It was a bit powerful mint-wise but over all it was something we would use again.</li>
            <li> Using it along with Crest toothpaste, I see a difference in my smile, and my fiance notices a difference in my kisses.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Overall I liked Crest Pro Health and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Our language is really powerful to let people describe snow as black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , this is not the case, and the incidents seem far more than isolated.</li>
            <li> Maybe I have a more sensitive mouth.  </li>
            <li> I would want to know if it is really worth the money.  </li>
            <li> This is especially true when we really can&#x27;t justify a big/any difference in name brand versus generic.  </li>
            <li> Now, we get results with fresh mint instead of alcohol.  </li>
            <li> It leaves a fresh feeling in your mouth without the stinging.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not harsh when your gurgling. :)</li>
            <li> received from bzz to right a review leaves my mouth feeling fresh</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other mouthwash brands and I personally like this one the best.</li>
            <li> Now I have no bleeding and they&#x27;re a nice light pink color, as they should be!</li>
            <li> I like this mouthwash much better than many other types because it does not burn my mouth.</li>
            <li> Now, we are a family more confident talking to each other and friends/family with fresher breath.  </li>
            <li> assumed the first time it was just cleaning super well</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s super intense!</li>
            <li> I love the flavor of the product and the feeling more than other products on the market right now</li>
            <li> It worked very well on keeping my mouth feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> And I LOVE how clean my teeth feel for the ENTIRE day!</li>
            <li> I leaves a fresh and clean feeling in your mouth that really lasts.</li>
            <li> It leaves my whole mouth feeling fresh and clean which makes sense because the majority of the surface area in your mouth consists of your tongue, cheeks, gums and throat.</li>
            <li> Not only have I noticed fresher breath and a more cleanly all around feeling</li>
            <li> far as this mouthwash goes, it&#x27;s a great toilet cleaning product.</li>
            <li> However, the longer I&#x27;ve been using it, the more I notice the clean feeling lasting throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> I have used many different mouthwashes as i have a fairly sensitive mouth and this one is one of the most mild that I have used.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the whole Crest ProHealth line of products as a sure defense for your teeth and mouth needs.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the whole Crest ProHealth line of products as a sure defense for your teeth and mouth needs.</li>
            <li> It left my mouth feeling clean!!</li>
            <li> I said right off I</li>
            <li> right?  </li>
            <li> It says it might do that right on the bottle</li>
            <li> and it said right there may cause staining of teeth,</li>
            <li> Used it (because it was under the sink) and right after had a burning sensation on tongue that would not go away.</li>
            <li> is just right for me.  </li>
            <li> RIGHT AWAY</li>
            <li> The flavor is just right.</li>
            <li> Right off the bat</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it right before you plan on eating.</li>
            <li> right from the start  </li>
            <li> A business that operates in this market segment needs to get it right, or make it right.</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> I use it right after brushing in the morning and again after my nighttime brushing right before bed.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s right on the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been wondering why my teeth keep staining right after my dental visits.</li>
            <li> First, I really like the fact that this product is alcohol free.</li>
            <li> I honestly haven&#x27;t been able to taste anything for the past two days.</li>
            <li> It seems to clean my teeth very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong enough to make your mouth feel super clean but it doesnt burn (because it does not contain alcohol).</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s actually the first kind that we have kept up with using.  </li>
            <li> My problem with this mouthwash is that I just didn&#x27;t really feel like my mouth was that clean after I used it.</li>
            <li> It leaves my mouth feeling clean and refreshed the whole day.  </li>
            <li> I would only recommend to make the after taste better because it is not bad</li>
            <li> It has a nice fresh taste that lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, there is NO other OTC mouthwash better than this.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn like the Listerine I used previously (although I just noticed that Listerine has its own version of alcohol free mouthwash; will need to try that out at some point) .</li>
            <li> But there was still a nagging suspicion that the mouthwash was to blame, and sure enough, after a quick online search I discovered there are a TON of people who&#x27;ve had adverse reactions to the stuff.  </li>
            <li> : do a quick search on Cetylpyridinium chloride, the key antibacterial agent in Crest Pro Care Mouthwash, and you will find some interesting information from a variety of sources.</li>
            <li> and I am a new loyal consumer for Crest Pro Health!</li>
            <li> I am currently trying this product free (thanks to Crest) and I truly love this product.</li>
            <li> I was fairly pleased by this mouthwash, Ive only used it a handful of times but so far I love it.</li>
            <li> so your mouth feels amazing all day long even after your sugary indulgence.</li>
            <li> Tried this product free from BzzAgent and let me tell you I fell a difference in what I normally use and this product.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to bzzagent for providing me with a full size sample</li>
            <li> I have been a long time user of the crest line and thought this was a nice addition to the product line.</li>
            <li> I love that feeling especially when coming back from the dentist, clean refreshing feeling in your mouth.</li>
            <li> ; I use this multiple times a day and was SO EXCITED TO TRY IT FOR FREE THANKS TO CREST!!</li>
            <li> I surprisingly love the taste and not in a rush to spit it out because it doesn&#x27;t have that strong burning like other brands have.</li>
            <li> I lost all my taste buds right after the first use.</li>
            <li> I think one of the reason we all brush our teeth, floss and rinse is to have a healthy White smile.</li>
            <li> Great product overall and definitely lives up to its expectation being set forth.</li>
            <li> I notice the pain started to reduce more and more everyday.</li>
            <li> It really does protect from cavities and make your mouth feel super clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teeth stay squeaky clean, my teeth tend to build up plaque easily and since using this mouthwash it definitely hasn&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only had to use this product one time to experience the adverse side effects that the vast majority of the reviewers for this product have experienced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone back to good old listerine.  </li>
            <li> I love how fresh and simple the flavor is.</li>
            <li> Then I read that this product I started using is not only NOT making my smile better, but it is the reason for the staining.</li>
            <li> This is the no alcohol version so there isn&#x27;t much of a burn, which is also better for Teens and people who are sensitive to the burning feeling.</li>
            <li> For starters, I have never been a huge fan of mouthwash because my mouth is so darn sensitive!</li>
            <li> At first I thought I just had a defective product, after exchanging for a different one I experienced the same gooey substances after rinsing.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using it at night right before bed as well as my three-year old daughter.</li>
            <li> It has a mild and minty taste which is very refreshing compared to Listerine brand harsh tastes.</li>
            <li> my kids like very much</li>
            <li> I recently received this for free from Crest through buzzagent, i was so excited to give this product a try.</li>
            <li> Cool Mint is the classic crest pro health  flavor that everyone is used to.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this based on the performance, saying that if you are lucky enough not to have the dreaded aftertaste, Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Rinse is indeed very effective at leaving your mouth feeling clean without any sort of sting or burn from harsh alcohols or menthols.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> I had never tried it before and was excited to try something new.</li>
            <li> It left my mouth feeling clean and germ free.</li>
            <li> I really had high hopes for this as I usually enjoy Crest products.</li>
            <li> With @Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Mouthwash in with my daily teeth cleaning, my mouth feels fresh and clean!</li>
            <li> It was refreshing and the mint taste did last for awhile.</li>
            <li> though it was a pretty neat mouthwash since it didn&#x27;t have the alcohol burn.  </li>
            <li> After the first use, I noted some loss in taste and thought that I had eaten too soon after using the rinse.</li>
            <li> Also no weird filmy taste after</li>
            <li> It has a refreshing and lasting taste.</li>
            <li> But Crest Pro Health mouth d wash Is my first choice from now on.</li>
            <li> my mouth is well protected ;)</li>
            <li> and I am hooked, I felt the difference after the first day.</li>
            <li> dentist recommended that I use a mouthwash, so I first bought a bottle of Listerine and used it up with no ill effects whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> and I put a ton of effort to keep it pretty.</li>
            <li> Overall though I was satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> thought that brushing was enough until i used this product i am more then please, it has giving me a refreshing feeling after brushing with crest total care.</li>
            <li> It made my mouth feel cleaner after the first use.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it&#x27;s designed not to do.</li>
            <li> And even when not eating, my tongue and mouth just feel funny - kinda soapy and numb.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My entire family has used this product for over a year at the suggestion of our dentist, and we love it.  </li>
            <li> The product was free and was shipped directly to my home.</li>
            <li> a healthy tooth.&lt;br /&gt;Another such product is MMS or sodium chlorite.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, my mouth didn&#x27;t feel any cleaner with this product than the one I currently use.</li>
            <li> He said if it were bacterial I would be getting better with the current antibiotic.</li>
            <li> I really happen to like this!</li>
            <li> No matter what oral health benefits this product may provide, side effects as drastic as the ones most of us have experienced should be prominently featured on the back of the bottle in at least a similarly-sized font asthe rest of the information on the bottle; not in tiny print!</li>
            <li> I like the regular Crest Pro mouthwash better  than the alcoholfree one, but it was worth a try, thanks Buzzagent and Crest</li>
            <li> That is exactly when the stains started appearing.  </li>
            <li> Apparently, many people have the same problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love Crest Pro Health, My kids actually like using it too.</li>
            <li> , the enamel on my teeth is actually getting stronger than it was and MY dentist was amazed at how much better</li>
            <li> I did not at first suspect the mouthwash</li>
            <li> really ticks me off!.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I have EVER used mouthwash that DIDN&#x27;T burn my mouth.</li>
            <li> Haha!)</li>
            <li> (I thought they were cavities at first)</li>
            <li> After the first time using it</li>
            <li> First thing Crest Pro-Heath is my number one mouthwash .</li>
            <li> From the first time you use Crest  mouthwash</li>
            <li> and my tastebuds were funny for about 2 hours after I used it.</li>
            <li> Feels fresh and do not worry as much about my breath.</li>
            <li> Definitely keeping on top shelf 😆</li>
            <li> I have actually used Crest products, most recently this one, for many years.  </li>
            <li> I really wished I read these reviews beforehand!</li>
            <li> At my dental check today, the dentist told me many of her patients using Crest Pro Health mouthwash have had the same problem with staining/discoloring of teeth.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product not on Amazon but should have read the reviews first.</li>
            <li> and this is the first time I tried the mouthwash and</li>
            <li> More predinsone and benedryl with a recheck next week.</li>
            <li> Still have jaw and tongue swelling and more medical bills.</li>
            <li> At first I was like it is just a mouth wash.</li>
            <li> Research your products better before releasing them to the public.   </li>
            <li> I usually use Listerine and have successfully for years.  </li>
            <li> My biggest problem was my breath - no matter how many times I brushed or what mouthwash</li>
            <li> a definite plus :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The taste is soft ,does not burn you mouth because this mouthwash is alochol free.</li>
            <li> ( MORNING BREATH BE DAMNED)Avoid the burn of alcohol; 12-hour protection against plaque and gingivitis by using in your daily oral care routine; Prevent and reduce gingivitis for healthy gums; Keep teeth cleaner longer, versus brushing alone.  </li>
            <li> Well I have to say that I am extremely glad to be back using Crest Pro-Health again!</li>
            <li> At first I thought I had food stuck in them</li>
            <li> I really like that the fresh breath stays for some time after rinsing.</li>
            <li> and It&#x27;s okay not something I could afford or want to buy on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> ,my teeth are brown enough I dont need to look like im smoking now on top of it.</li>
            <li> However, after consistent use I started to notice the brown stains.</li>
            <li> but it tasted funny</li>
            <li> This is my first sample product</li>
            <li> Sigh, I cannot believe I have to go back to the dentist again and pay the costly treatments over a cheap $8 bottle!</li>
            <li> I do not understand why P&amp;G have not taken Crest Pro Health off the shelves since first complaints reported five years ago in 2008?</li>
            <li> I went in the bathroom and, sure enough, I started using this mouthwash a couple of months ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Before, they were more red and bled sometimes.</li>
            <li> the first chance I get and will update this review with a link when I find one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it works exactly, but when you spit, you can see</li>
            <li> &quot; I am seriously interested in getting together some sort of class suit against this company.  </li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t burn and it leaves your mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> I would most definitely buy this product.</li>
            <li> I am no longer worried if my breath is fresh enough or making sure I have a piece of gum at the ready.</li>
            <li> Overall, I like the product better than others I have tried.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it does multiple things without alcohol in it</li>
            <li> We have all been using it and all really like it!</li>
            <li> and I really like it!</li>
            <li> because that exactly what it feels like.</li>
            <li> First we received it as a product to test for bzz agent.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t burn as much, and it leaves a fresh feeling for hours afterward.</li>
            <li> I really like this mouthwash!</li>
            <li> I used it only one more time, and I can confirm the taste side effects.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 2 weeks now and out of nowhere have these pretty brown stains between my teeth that were never there before.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Crest!</li>
            <li> There are pros and cons with this mouthwash, so I can&#x27;t give it any higher than 3 stars.    </li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li> first day I tried it I lost the ability to taste food.</li>
            <li> sure enough, it was indeed the mouthwash.</li>
            <li> First time I thought the product was alright</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed my breath has stayed fresh for much longer after using this product.</li>
            <li> No ill effects to taste buds or anything ever.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;However, if I use it in the evening, my breath is noticeably fresher when I wake up, even with the funny aftertaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this mouthwash to people who are looking to get better check ups at the dentist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Crest Pro-Health Mouth Rinse for a couple months, and have recently noticed browning of in between and top of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> At first, I thought it is the food.</li>
            <li> Wish I&#x27;d read the reviews first.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products over the years and never have I seen such a productive product.   </li>
            <li> My dentist actually recommended that I use this, and I&#x27;m so glad he did.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not harsh and alcohol free.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t taste anything for the whole day when I used this mouthwash!  </li>
            <li> It has a good taste and no burning until after I spit it out and my mouth kinda burned for a few seconds and it went away.</li>
            <li> It left my mouth feeling clean and minty fresh!</li>
            <li> But if you do use this product, be sure to have your mouth fairly clean before using it, and rinse extremely well after using it.</li>
            <li> Right After finishing the whole entire bottle I noticed my bottom and top front teeth with some brownish stains.</li>
            <li> I love this product, my mouth felt so fresh for a long time!</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive teeth and wasn&#x27;t sure about trying something new on them.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li> There is a clean &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; that goes along with this mouthwash, but I like it, and gives me the feeling of that deep clean.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to try this for free from crest.</li>
            <li> The taste isn&#x27;t that alcohol burn like some other brands but more of a cool minty burst in my opinion.</li>
            <li> First came the wonderful bruning sensation, followed by the usual taste lost, eventually I couldn&#x27;t drink fluid at one point because it hurt too much.</li>
            <li> I have seen amazing results compared to any other mouth wash I have used.</li>
            <li> It has a nice taste and it doesn&#x27;t burn like other mouthwashes.  </li>
            <li> I also liked that there was no burn caused by alcohol in other mouthwashes, which&lt;br /&gt;I found pleasing.  </li>
            <li> My family also really liked the fact that it didn&#x27;t burn their mouths like the other brands do.  </li>
            <li> This mouthwash left my whole mouth feeling clean, refreshed and my breath smelling minty fresh!</li>
            <li> And while the minty-freshness had serious longevity, it also greatly diminished the flavor of food.</li>
            <li> After the first couple days of use, actually after the first day, using Crest I noticed a strong metallic taste in my mouth and on my breath that lasted all day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe since it&#x27;s only been one day, i&#x27;ve not seen very noticeable staining yet, but i&#x27;ve heard from so many others about how their teeth stained sometimes irreversibly, from as soon as one use, and also from extended use.</li>
            <li> Second, I love the fact that the promised results really happen.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also good to alternate and not use the same mouthwash forever, then you can minimize side effects of each product.</li>
            <li> I read the back of the bottle and it does warn of possible staining, but says good brushing should take care of it.</li>
            <li> With Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Alcohol free, there&#x27;s not after taste lingering in my mouth only fresh breath, along with no throat irritation.</li>
            <li> It is very crisp and cleansing without the burn that comes with so many other products.</li>
            <li> and although I still find that I am not crazy about the taste when I very first use it, I love the fresh, clean feeling that it leaves behind.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health rinse left my teeth with a clean and refreshed mouth!</li>
            <li> No burn when rinsing and left my mouth feeling clean!</li>
            <li> I have had great success in using this product with Crest Pro Health toothpaste, at my last dental cleaning my dentist was amazed at how little tartar I had after he realized I hadn&#x27;t had my teeth cleaned in close to five years.</li>
            <li> First of all, the cap was easy to open!</li>
            <li> I like this because it does not burn your mouth like the other mouth washes does and it makes my mouth feel clean  and leaves my breath smelling fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> I was really amazed that this mouth was alcohol free and leaves such a tingling, fresh feeling in my mouth after rinsing.  </li>
            <li> I really do use this product and it really has helped me have a healthier mouth!</li>
            <li> I am so happy to report that unlike other I haven&#x27;t had staining or any gross feeling after.</li>
            <li> Really all it did was leave a funny taste in my mouth all day.</li>
            <li> I love that there is not the alcohol taste in this product, however is does have a strange taste to it.</li>
            <li> and I have pretty much tried them all (teeth fan</li>
            <li> If you use this mouthwash be aware that it does work very well</li>
            <li> No weird flavors, no burn in your mouth, but it really makes a difference in your oral health.  </li>
            <li> The taste is good, not overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li> If that gets fixed, this gets a full 5 stars from me.  </li>
            <li> Personally I did not have any of the issues that a lot of people seem to be experiencing with teeth staining, and my mouth feels fresh and clean after using Crest.  </li>
            <li> It left my mouth so fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> It left my mouth feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> and it left my mouth feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> It left my breath fresh and my mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> It has a fresh, minty taste that left my mouth tingling clean but without the burn of some mouthwash containing alcohol.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash left my mouth feeling fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> Leaves a nice minty taste in your mouth with NO burn like other mouthwash!</li>
            <li> I was recently given an opportunity to try this product for free, and my experience was very much satisfieing.</li>
            <li> I use it in the morning, after every meal, and before bed for a fresh new start.</li>
            <li> I experienced only a slight burning (much less than with other mouth washes) and it has a great fresh mint taste!</li>
            <li> The taste is refreshing, not overpowering, and does not burn like some mouth rinses do nor does it leave me with dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> I am currently trying this product for free thanks to Crest!</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied and would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Next, it&#x27;s important to know that continued, consistent use has lessened our plaque...</li>
            <li> The next mouthwash I bought from listerine (it was on sale) has 20% alcohol which is too strong for my taste.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong enough that I still feel that I have to rinse after use, though.</li>
            <li> It definitely didn&#x27;t have a strong flavor or burn, so if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, you might want to try it.</li>
            <li> I use it every morning, and it has no burn like the others do, it gives me a fresh, clean, healthy feeling afterwards, giving me the confidence to smile and really mean it!</li>
            <li> I was recently given an opportunity to try this product for free, thanks to Bzzagent and my experience was very much satisfieing.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive gums and they feel better using Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection vs. other brands I have used that made my gums feel even more sensitive.</li>
            <li> they are large stains as well.</li>
            <li> I will certainly be buying this product.</li>
            <li> I can say for certain that my teeth feel smoother for way longer between brushings...</li>
            <li> But smart people just stop using products that don&#x27;t work for them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a positive experience with the mouthwash from the very beginning when I went to use the mouthwash and noticed no burning when I was using it.  </li>
            <li> It lasts much longer than expected from a mouthwash and then fresh, clean feeling isn&#x27;t really worth the mouth on</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;fresh and clean\\&quot; feeling did not last as long as I would have liked though.    </li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Mouthwash is a new innovative product that must be added to anyones personal care.</li>

            <li> Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Mouthwash is a new innovative product that must be added to anyones personal care.</li>
            <li> About 2 months ago I decided to change my regular mouthwash in order to try something new, just to figure out if I can get better results.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that lately I haven&#x27;t been able to find the clear kind, but the blue kind is just about as good.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice clean taste, and doesn&#x27;t burn your tongue like other mouthwash which is a big plus.</li>
            <li> I thought my brushing habits were causing it, but then I remembered the fine print on the back of the label.</li>
            <li> But overall, I like the rinse and feel that it does a decent job in keeping my mouth clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I think it is pretty decent mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> This is the brand of toothpaste I grew up on and thus, a certain amount of brand loyalty (call it trust, really) was built into my decision to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels fresh and clean all day long and the appearance of my teeth are visibly improving gradually.</li>
            <li> that a mouthwash designed to clean your teeth does the exact opposite?</li>
            <li> I actually now enjoy using mouthwash, it no longer is pure torture.</li>
            <li> The damage to the Crest brand might be hard to quantify, but if they keep selling garbage like this, it could be fairly impactful.</li>
            <li> No burning after finished, just the right  amount of clean tingle that lasts long after rinsing.</li>
            <li> It is sheer luck that I read these reviews because it solved a huge mystery for me...</li>
            <li> I really like the product and even though I got it free through a promotion, I will definitely buy it when I run out.  </li>
            <li> I really like the product and even though I got it free through a promotion, I will definitely buy it when I run out.</li>
            <li> My dentist and hygienist have noticed a huge difference since I started using mouthwash regularly as well ...</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy it after I finish the free sample I received thanks to Crest.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really taste a difference between them all, and they all seem to work well.</li>
            <li> We both really like this mouth wash and never had any issues with it.</li>
            <li> I am really please with my purchase, and will continue to buy. </li>
            <li> I am really please with my purchase, and will continue to buy. </li>
            <li> they feel so much cleaner</li>
            <li> I really like this brand of mouth wash.</li>
            <li> any advice will be greatly appreciated  please please stay away from Crest Pro health</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend skipping this at all costs, and picking a different alcohol free mouthwash.</li>
            <li> Thanks Crest.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m feeling so much cleaner and fresher.</li>
            <li> We were given a free same via Bzzagent and were eager to try it!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Mouthwash for two weeks now #gotitfree thanks to #Bzzagent.</li>
            <li> This, not so much.</li>
            <li> the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li> REALLY</li>
            <li> I really like Crest Pro-health a lot.  </li>
            <li> I did notice a film in my mouth but have not seen any stains or anything else unusual.</li>
            <li> I really like that.</li>
            <li> I tried straight salt, and it was also flavorless.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really does work.</li>
            <li> I know Crest mouthwash really does</li>
            <li> want to also state that it really does help with bleeding gums.</li>
            <li> I am on a mission from Smiley 360, so I got a free full-size sample (blue bottle) to buy.  </li>
            <li> I tried a few more times and sure enough - this is the cause.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really eat anything and it even hurts to touch the roof of my mouth or teeth.</li>
            <li> and it really does help freshen my breath.</li>
            <li> and I really do think it improved the condition of my gums.</li>
            <li> The hygienist noticed the unusual staining too...and asked me (initiated the question-)</li>
            <li> No one wants mouthwash that burns.</li>
            <li> That is so untrue because this works really well.</li>
            <li> Thanks BzzAgent and Crest for giving me the opportunity to try this mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> This really feels and tastes likes it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast with Amazon.</li>
            <li> She was very embarrassed and I was very scared for her.</li>
            <li> It really does.</li>
            <li> That may not seem like much but, for someone with wrist pains</li>
            <li> It was almost like we were challenging each other to see who could last the longest because frankly, most mouth washes burn your mouth and make you want to spit them out early!</li>
            <li> I am very upset.</li>
            <li> Who wants staining and if it happens who wants to wait until you go to the dentist.  </li>
            <li> I really like this mouthwash and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Thanks to crest</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If that doesn&#x27;t work I really hope my dentist will get them out.</li>
            <li> I feel that my mouth is much cleaner and feels healthier.</li>
            <li> It hurt so much</li>
            <li> This mouthwash has really freshened my breath.</li>
            <li> I really wish I had researched this product before I used it, but who creates a mouthwash that will stain your teeth?</li>
            <li> I really like it and think it&#x27;s held up my teeth and gums well.</li>
            <li> Really like the fact of no alcohol and no burning.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with my dental care and this product really makes me upset now that i had to get my teeth cleaned at the dentist.</li>
            <li> But the alcohol-free formula really made a difference.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying this mouth wash!</li>
            <li> I can really feel it working on my gums and teeth.</li>
            <li> thus far it leaves my breath fresh and minty.  </li>
            <li> and my mouth is much cleaner now than before using it</li>
            <li> I have seen over 500 consumer complaints on the internet about this very thing since then.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants to get a healthier mouth and whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> (caffeine now makes my heart rate elevate too much).  </li>
            <li> Crest sent this to me for free and i would definitly buy this in the future!!</li>
            <li> - I have never been very diligent with any routine orally besides brushing my teeth</li>
            <li> and we both really like it.</li>
            <li> I recently received a free bottle via Smiley 360 to review.</li>
            <li> and I really like the benefits for my gums and teeth.</li>
            <li> The part I really like is that it does not burn.  </li>
            <li> Maybe they just put too much flavoring in it (in my opinion, P&amp;G really overdoes the flavoring in its toothpastes).</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> This really feels and tastes likes it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li> I have to say I really do like this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been much of a mouthwash user, I can&#x27;t stand the alcohol taste</li>
            <li> My husband is very picky when it comes to toothpaste and mouthwash and this product won him over as well.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for letting try this.</li>
            <li> I really like the taste</li>
            <li> As sensitive as my teeth are, that&#x27;s a rare thing to find.</li>
            <li> , it has been a fantastic experience adding this to my daily brushing.</li>
            <li> so the whole family can use it too.</li>
            <li> I received a big bottle as a free sample from Bzzagent.com</li>
            <li> Thanks for the sample.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have any complaints.</li>
            <li> I really like the noticeable difference that this mouthwash had on the plaque build up on my teeth.</li>
            <li> and I can tell that my breath stays fresher much longer.  </li>
            <li> I can definitely tell in my front teeth, that it looks like they are somewhat cleaner and feel really smooth when I run my tongue across my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> &gt; #gotitfree from BzzAgent and Crest, a big shot out for giving me this product free to try out</li>
            <li> until it really happens.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of the product from Crest and now I am a definitely going to be a returning customer.</li>
            <li> I really like this mouthwash.</li>
            <li> This product as well as using the crest pro-health toothpaste have really improved the looks of my teeth.</li>
            <li> There were days my tongue hurt so much that it felt</li>
            <li> This product really does not have any positives.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in the health of my mouth and it didn&#x27;t leave my breath smelling much fresher than brushing.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like that feeling.</li>
            <li> And the rest of my family seems to really like this one.</li>
            <li> I received this mouthwash, thanks to Crest and Bzzagent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed how much whiter everyone in my family&#x27;s teeth are.</li>
            <li> I have found this rinse to be gentle and without the burn.  </li>
            <li> Thanks smiley360 and crest for putting me on this mission</li>
            <li> and it really does make your mouth feel fresher longer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Amazon, we really should consider to support zero-star reviews.</li>
            <li> Thanks crest 😊</li>
            <li> It was smooth to gargle and had multiple benefits.</li>
            <li> hope I will be able to taste food again in a few days, but most likely not.</li>
            <li> I really like how it feels in my mouth before and after</li>
            <li> , I REALLY HOPE THIS IS NOT PERMANENT.</li>
            <li> my whole set 2x a day...</li>
            <li> I could do the whole swish without having the sting of alcohol.  </li>
            <li> Thanks crest...</li>
            <li> I am a fan of the whole Crest Pro Health lineup; from mouthwash and toothpaste to their floss.</li>
            <li> This product definitely promotes alcohol free line.  </li>
            <li> Thanks BzzAgent for sending me this product to test and review.</li>
            <li> I would really discourage anyone from purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s dentist stated that even this lightly colored blue mouthwash is staining her teeth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really very</li>
            <li> This seems to work really well on any type of gum pain or a bit tongue our mouth.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know really if it helps in the areas that it says.  </li>
            <li> It really works very well</li>
            <li> Thanks Crest.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My kids and husband eat lots of very spicy foods.  </li>
            <li> This product should be pulled from the market in my opinion since the stains really destroys the purpose of cleaning.</li>
            <li> but overall I&#x27;m satisfied so far.</li>
            <li> The Crest Pro-Health is nicely minty without being harsh.  </li>
            <li> Personally, this product did not stain my teeth - I found that it did a fairly good job of cleaning, and there was absolutely no alcohol burn.  </li>
            <li> Only thing I wish is that it still had a childproof top, as I have a soon to be 2 year old that loves to drink and eat anything she gets her hands on.</li>
            <li> m having such positive results such as: fresh breath all day, my teeth feel clean no matter what I eat and my teeth ever look brighter!</li>
            <li> It leaves your breath fresh and feeling clean for a very long time!  </li>
            <li> i got crest prohealth free to try from bzzagent ,i like this product leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean,and it dont have that burning feeling like other mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I also love that it&#x27;s gentle on my mouth and doesn&#x27;t make my gums peel like other washes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Normally when I use any mouthwash I can&#x27;t stand the minty taste and the BURN!</li>
            <li> This mouth wash leaves a not so fresh after taste that last all day and makes whatever I eat or drink taste funny the whole day.....</li>
            <li> I am excited to see what the dentist will say when I go and see him next month!</li>
            <li> There is a teeny tiny warning on the label about the possibility of staining but suggests that it proves the product is working!</li>
            <li> This leaves such a fresh flavor in my mouth and lasts for hours!</li>
            <li> My parents tried it also and agreed that this was better then the other mouthwash they have used before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see who the product worked during a regularly scheduled dental check</li>
            <li> Just like many of the other reviewers here, this product also stained my teeth.</li>
            <li> After using Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Rinse for a solid week, I am hooked and will be turning to the brand to take care of my smile from now on!</li>
            <li> I am excited about my next dental check up since using Crest Pro-Health because I know my mouth is healthier since using Crest.  </li>
            <li> I read some of the other reviews and read that many people are complaining of brown staining on their teeth.</li>
            <li> Personally, I think it is worth every penny, and i am now squeezing this mouth wash into my budget!</li>
            <li> It also tastes so much better than other mouthwashes.</li>
            <li> I must say I think crest pro-health mouth rinse is so much better than other brands I have tried</li>
            <li> I am used to with many other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> I like the taste of this one better than all other alcohol-free mouthwashes I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give that burn that some other mouth washes do, probably because it is alcohol free!</li>
            <li> The non-alcohol burn makes it friendly for not only kids, but adults with sensitivity.</li>
            <li> and I love how it feels plus that it does not burn unlike other mouth washes.  </li>
            <li> last time I checked mouthwash was supposed to clean your teeth.</li>
            <li> Leaves my mouth feeling clean and refreshed...will definately buy in the future</li>
            <li> I miss the standard mouthwash burn and my teeth don&#x27;t feel as clean after using this.</li>
            <li> I had clean white teeth.</li>
            <li> 4 weeks ago my teeth were white and clean.  </li>
            <li> I received a free full size bottle of Creest Pro-health from BzzAgent to try a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> If anything, my mouth felt more fresh than usual.</li>
            <li> and i forgot how Crest Pro Health makes my teeth feel extra clean.</li>
            <li> It left my mouth feeling clean and minty each time I used it, with no irritation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It appears that at the moment there is no silver bullet for clean and white teeth.</li>
            <li> I guess this must come as a shock to crest, but we actually were using their product to CLEAN our teeth.</li>
            <li> It kept my toilet shining and ordor free.</li>
            <li> The clean feeling was definitely there.  </li>
            <li> Crest Pro-health mult-protection mouthwash kept my breath fresh and clean longer than the other mouthwashes.</li>
            <li> It did leave my mouth feeling clean and refreshed and gives me fresh breath, but I use it every other day to every two days because of the fear of staining.  </li>
            <li> and I definitely will print the free coupons from  www.coupons.com search word crest in brands (http://www.coupons.com/brands/crest-coupons/?PLID&#x3D;MEDIAADS&amp;CRID&#x3D;CRESTRINSE102414BZZAGENT_EXT&amp;CID&#x3D;18490031~18490033~18379389~18379119) direct link to coupons and take advantage of having fantastic trips to the dentist in the future.</li>
            <li> To be honest i don&#x27;t brush my teeth as often as i should on some days, but i always usually mouthwash with this product and at my last 6 month checkup i got a clean bill of health and</li>
            <li> specially after brushing which I do 3 to 4 times daily</li>
            <li> I started using this because of being sensitivity to the high alcohol content in many other brands.</li>
            <li> I received a free bottle of Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection from Crest.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Crest, I have been using the Crest ProHealth Mouthwash for a little over a week, also I am brushing my teeth twice a day, it really does prevent and reduce plaque buildup, I am rarely having to floss.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product which doesn&#x27;t leave a strong or bad taste in your mouth afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I switched to crest, my mouth feels so much healthier, and less abused.</li>
            <li> It does the job of an average mouthwash, but I still has a pretty strong burning sensation on my tongue and inside of my mouth.</li>
            <li> However, since the product seems to be staining people&#x27;s teeth brown, which is a far more noticable and less desireable stain, Crest really should make consumers aware of the side effects.</li>
            <li> My hygienist confirmed that she was aware of crest pro health mouth washes creating stains and advised I use other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The blue bottle does not burn either, like Listerine, and by the way, the white bottle rinse does not burn either, though the white bottle rinse does not taste particularly good.</li>
            <li> The mouth is full of bacteria (hundreds of species were found in a recent study of the salivary microbiome)</li>
            <li> dark* stains develop in between most of my teeth.</li>
            <li> Short and sweet</li>
            <li> After the second day I realized I couldn&#x27;t taste anything except spicy, salty and sweet flavors.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s alcohol FREE, but still leaves that fresh feeling behind!</li>
            <li> This is hands down my favorite mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> They also love that it doesn&#x27;t burn like other mouthwashes!  </li>
            <li> Better than other mouthwashes!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my new fave!</li>
            <li> My husband &amp; I have already purchased a new bottle &amp; will continue using Crest!</li>
            <li> The Crest Pro-Health Mouthwash is my new fave!</li>
            <li> Since using Crest Pro-Health, like many other reviewers on Amazon, I developed very noticable brown stains on my teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m was very hesitant to switch to a new mouthwash.</li>
            <li> bad because you don&#x27;t have a good aftertaste or refreshing feeling after using it.      </li>
            <li> It does still have a bit of an odd after taste but, its nothing compared to most mouthwashes.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different mouthwashes and like the way this one leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean without the alcohol burn.</li>
            <li> staining  is not permanent or harmful , and may be prevented by adequate brushing or removed at your next dental visit\\</li>
            <li> The thing I like most about this mouthwash is that I actually feel like it leaves a protective barrier on my gums that will last for hours.</li>
            <li> On my recent dental checkup, I was once again reminded that I should use a mouthwash (the dentist recommended alcohol-free Listerine), so I decided to try this again since I still had most of the two bottles left and figured maybe it wouldn&#x27;t be</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t have the classic mouthwash burn.</li>
            <li> The bottle, in a place I didn&#x27;t notice, says, misleadingly in my view, that the staining \\&quot;may be prevented by adequate brushing or removed at your next dental visit\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It requires more than a simple rinse of your sink after use as the blue particles stick to the basin of the sink.</li>
            <li> I could scrap it off only to have it quickly return.</li>
            <li> It mostly came off with a cleaning at the dentist, but I will have to go back a 2nd time to get it all off.  </li>
            <li> I used the rinse twice daily and was not immediately aware of a loss of taste sensation, but within 2 weeks had lost my sensation of sweetness for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li> The only reason I downgraded it to four stars instead of five is that Crest uses CPC (Cetylpyridinium Chloride) as the main ingredient while Listerine&#x27;s formula is composed of four essential oils (eucalyptol, menthol, methyl salicylate, and thymol) which have been shown in comparative studies to yield better results as part of a homecare oral hygiene routine.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of using this mouthwash, though, I can definitely say it was a good decision.</li>
            <li> I still use the Crest toothpaste and will never change since it has improved over the years with more flavors and different needs for brushing, since we do not all have the same needs for our teeth.  </li>
            <li> I went to my dentist recently and found out I had multiple cavities, so I thought, \\&quot;welp, time to start taking better care of my teeth!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I came on here wondering if anyone had the same problems and sure enough.</li>
            <li> It lacks the minty flavor and whitening that I love from the 3D white mouthwash, but it does feel like it leaves my mouth healthier overall.</li>
            <li> I would spit out a few mouthfuls of bright red blood.  </li>
            <li> my wife and I did a quick google research finding out this product with lot of others complains about the same out come and situation.</li>
            <li> This one does not burn my mouth, and it leaves a nice, fresh breath behind.</li>
            <li> but so far i have had a positive experience.</li>
            <li> It leaves my mouth feelin really clean, it does a pretty good job at keeping bad breathe at bay, but I haven&#x27;t really seen any noticeable changes in my tooth appearance.</li>
            <li> and I must admit that I was skeptical at first bcuz I was partial to another brand/type of mouthwash, but this mouthwash is AMAZING!!!!</li>
            <li> And makes my mouth feel alot more fresh than usual!</li>
            <li> and i like it so much than my old mouth wash!</li>
            <li> I did not want to write a review right away because I wanted to experience the product first over a long period of time.</li>
            <li> es.. highly recommended</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I use the tooth paste with the electric toothbrush on high and have had no problems whatever.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This product is not for everyone I myself had a high fever as a child</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend crest pro health mouth wash to every one.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this mouthwash to others.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend others give crest pro health a try.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to everyone who uses mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to everyone</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Only reason I&#x27;m giving two stars is because it never caused any discomfort for my sensitive teeth/gums unlike the original Listerine.</li>
            <li> Like so many other people, my teeth developed grey-brown stains.</li>
            <li> As far as the other claims, I&#x27;m sure it works as well as others in removing food debri and biofilm.</li>
            <li> I thought it burned a little more than it should,</li>
            <li> The pain in my gums got a little better but the rash or burn or whatever around my mouth persisted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> This mouth wash is missing that fresh tingle clean feeling that I want/expect from a mouthwash.</li>
            <li> While I enjoy using it at night (I feel like I wake up without the horrid &amp;#34;morning breath&amp;#34;) using it in the morning ruins my coffee for me!</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection left a fresh clean taste for a long time after using it.</li>
            <li> Other mouthwashes make my eyes water because they&#x27;re just too strong.</li>
            <li> totally recommend for anyone that just wants to have less plaque buildup and clean smelling breath to give Crest Pro-Health Multi Protection mouthwash, clean mint flavor a try.  </li>
            <li> What I truly admired of this mouthwash is all the effective things it does without burning our mouth, this make it perfect for all the people out there that feel annoyed by other mouthwashes that contain alcohol and do the same our less protection than Crest Pro-Health.</li>
            <li> We like Crest Pro-Health mouthwash so much that we purchased the Pro-Health Complete with flouride for our children to use.</li>
            <li> Fortunately the stains do come off, but it requires the hygienist to work a bit harder.  </li>
            <li> This is a great mouthwash and recommended it to everyone who does not experience any ill effects from the product.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel much cleaner and look far whiter than before using Crest Pro Health.</li>
            <li> The best part is that with Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Mouthwash I get that 12 hour protection without that painful burning sensation.</li>
            <li> so far I really like it.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn near as much, though there is some burning.</li>
            <li> My 4 year old niece absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> My family feels the same and my spouse has mentioned how one&#x27;s breath feels continually fresh between brushings.</li>
            <li> It left my breath feeling fresh all day.</li>
            <li> Before the sample i was experiencing soreness in one my my teeth but after using it for a few days my tooth some how feels better.</li>
            <li> I do also have to say that in the past I have had some issues with my gums and during my last appointment all signs were good.  </li>
            <li> She then said 99.9% of customers have not complained.</li>
            <li> I have compared this to my normal mouth rinse</li>
            <li> Also, it leaves a fresh feeling in your mouth and last for quite some times.</li>
            <li> I dont normally like any mouthwash because i stings my mouth</li>
            <li> I am normally a Listerine user</li>
            <li> The fresh sensation last for hours.  </li>
            <li> After using it for just a few days, along with the toothpaste, my teeth feel a lot better</li>
            <li> Will stop using immediately and hope normal taste will resume soon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit i never really liked using mouthwash before, it burns and I&#x27;m kind of a wimp.</li>
            <li> I dont get the burning I normally get when using a mouthwash</li>
            <li> so glad i read reviews today and didnt use it long enough for my teeth to turn brown</li>
            <li> I then saw my dentist for a normal check up and even she comment how stained my teeth seemed.</li>
            <li> it leaves my breath feeling fresh, I&#x27;m a big fan of mint.</li>
            <li> I do wish it would give me fresh breath for a longer period of time which is why I only give it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Hoping they will develop an effective mouthwash that does not have negative side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works and all mouthwashes are pretty much the same anyway.</li>
            <li> It makes my mouth feel fresh and definitely doesn&#x27;t cause any burning.</li>
            <li> Normally, the mouthwash I use is mediciny.</li>
            <li> Its just a normal feeling lile</li>
            <li> I used before but one thing I noticed is that, the fresh feeling though last for hours it does makes the food taste</li>
            <li> I love that this mouthwash Isn&#x27;t too harsh and yet still protects my mouth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this daily, and it has helped keep my breath fresh.</li>
            <li> Most are harsh and burn my gums.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve stopped using the mouthwash and hope that my taste buds return to normal.  </li>
            <li> (That is what normally happens when I use mouthwash)</li>
            <li> left my breath fresh longer also.....</li>
            <li> After reading all of the negative feedback I was kind of scared to try it.  </li>
            <li> The only down side I&#x27;ve found is that it leaves a kind of film in your mouth</li>
            <li> I have tried many different types of mouth rinse including rinse for dry mouth</li>
            <li> At my last dental cleaning the hygienist complemented me on how well i had been doing since my last visit and thanked me for making her job easy.  </li>
            <li> One thing I would like to point out to friends and family, is that this is something you can do right after brushing your teeth that takes less than a few minutes to promote a life time of healthy gums and fresh breath!&lt;br /</li>
            <li> and you do have to use a sawing left to right motion to get it between some close teeth.  </li>
            <li> I use the mouthwash after I brush the second time right before I leave the house.</li>
            <li> I noticed fresher breath right away and my teeth feel cleaner overall.</li>
            <li> I used this once, and I lost my ability to taste anything right until the next day.</li>
            <li> Ive been using it everyday for several weeks, and I love Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Mouthwash!</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the fresh taste and the clean feeling that it left in my mouth, however, the sensation didn&#x27;t last as long as other mouthwashes.</li>
            <li> It also has a pretty good taste to it, but overall it is no better then my regular brand!</li>
            <li> I am in need of a mouthwash that has fluoride so this isn&#x27;t my first pick, but it does a decent job for commercial mouth washes</li>
            <li> Left my mouth feeling cool, clean and even fresh breath first thing in the morning without that annoying burn that comes with most mouthwashes.</li>
            <li> When receiving the Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection free from Crest, I was scheptical due to the fact mouthwash can stain teeth, and also burns even without alcohol.</li>
            <li> it is alcohol free and it doesn&#x27;t burn like some other brands.</li>
            <li> other reviewers have mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li> Combining the ProHealth line of toothpaste and mouthwash make for a fresh long lasting effect with fresh breath as well.</li>
            <li> Combining the ProHealth line of toothpaste and mouthwash make for a fresh long lasting effect with fresh breathe as well.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t advise ordering something like this online, but I pick up a new bottle at target every couple months.</li>
            <li> and I will continue using it and keep evolving with the brand each time they launch a new one.</li>
            <li> Take the challenge to try something new you may be surprised.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I made mention of these new stains when I saw my dental hygienist.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully my new dentist asked me what mouth wash</li>
            <li> I thought it was my new toothpaste, but it turns out</li>
            <li> After the first use you will be left with an odd feeling in your mouth since it feels extremely clean!</li>

            <li> After the first use you will be left with an odd feeling in your mouth since it feels extremely clean!</li>
            <li> Alcohol free is good and bad...</li>
            <li> Because my teeth were much more stained than what would naturally happen in a few months</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, several times after using this product, I have noticed my teeth turning a light yellow color.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s kind of gross) of dead bacteria</li>
            <li> So I decided that I would try it out thinking that it would help and got it because it says alcohol free but the second that I used it it burned my entire mouth.</li>
            <li> I was perplexed as to the cause -- for over 30 years before starting use of this product I had never had brown staining, and I couldn&#x27;t identify any big changes to my diet or dental routine.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this for me because I need the fluoride for my very sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I have to have something that doesn&#x27;t hurt or burn my very sensitive teeth..</li>
            <li> If you have young children that wont use mouthwash because of the burn, I highly suggest trying this product.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this mouthwash highly based on my personal experiences with it, which have been nothing but positive.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was lucky enough to be blessed with great dental health my entire life.</li>
            <li> I cannot use dyed products, so to have something listed as Clear and get a huge BIG bottle of BLUE</li>
            <li> Steer clear of Crest pro health mouthwash!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to my friends and family (in fact I already have ;-) )</li>
            <li> First and last time</li>
            <li> I would have a long fresh mouth for hours.  </li>
            <li> Wow, hysteria on Amazon!</li>
            <li> When I first started rinsing with that it left my teeth brown!</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, WOW!</li>
            <li> I am an avid mouthwash user and I regularly find myself struggling to find a balance between the stinging feeling and feeling refreshed for extended time.</li>
            <li> what the eff, that&#x27;s the exact opposite result I want in a mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> The exact same thing was happening to me</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t EVER use this product, unless you want stained, sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I was thinking it was the invisalign to blame since I had pretty white teeth</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and find it to be one of my favorite mouthwashes.</li>
            <li> I like the very minty feeling after one use and keeps my breath fresh for a longer period of time than any other mouthwash I&#x27;d used.</li>
            <li> had some juice tasted a bit funny but didnt felt concerned until later on in the day when i had lunch and still could not taste anything its been almost twelve hrs</li>
            <li> When I went to my dentist for my regular cleaning the first thing she asked was if I was using this product.</li>
            <li> It does not have the regular burn that so many of the other mouthwashes do.  </li>
            <li> I want minty fresh breath just as much as the next person, but I can&#x27;t stand the burn from the alcohol in mouthwashes such as Listerine.</li>
            <li> I am well aware of the potential for brown staining</li>
            <li> Sure enough on the back of the label it warns that it might stain teeth, and that proper brushing prevents it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product but instead of turning my teeth brown like most other&#x27;s, my teeth turned a yellow-orange color, especially close to the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only con to this product would be that a while after rinsing I would have a funny taste in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> The stuff burnt my tongue at first use, 3 days later I still can&#x27;t taste the food.</li>
            <li> I used this last night for the first time after brushing and flossing my teeth.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I noticed blue specks in my sink.</li>
            <li> using it for a while now and it over long time fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> Upon first rinse I could instantly tell this mouthwash was doing the job without the burn.</li>
            <li> Used this for the first time last night, hoping it would help with some of my tonsil and gum issues.</li>
            <li> The Crest Pro-Health line of dental care are some pretty solid products.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel cleaner and my mouth feels fresh long after I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li> After the first couple of uses it is definitely a go to item in my house!</li>
            <li> My entire family prefers it to our other mouthwash and love the taste and way</li>
            <li> It kept my mouth fresh all day long.</li>
            <li> Not a whole cap full.</li>
            <li> It makes my breath fresh for a very long time.</li>
            <li> My family has been using this mouthwash for the past couple weeks all thanks to the free sample we received from Crest.</li>
            <li> Though it says alcohol free, I did get a slight burning sensation when I used it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually pretty confused as to why people are reporting brown stains on their teeth as a result of using this product-- Crest sent me a bottle of this product to try and review, and I actually love it.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that it does seem to stain your teeth a little but as long as you have a good brushing routine, it won&#x27;t effect you.</li>
            <li> So my dentist cleaned it off my teeth with a little scrapey tool and my teeth were fine.</li>
            <li> Very smooth flavor, hard to explain unless you try it yourself.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mouthwash for several months, and my experience has been positive.</li>
            <li> crest pro health has such a long lasting refreshing taste.</li>
            <li> Potential to leave brown stains (though I have not been using it long enough to say for sure)</li>
            <li> In the last week though my mouth feels much cleaner, especially when I first wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t taste anything sour or any type of unique flavors.  </li>
            <li> Unlike some other products, it had no bad aftertaste</li>
            <li> I especially like that it is alcohol free because alcohol can lead to dry mouth where bacteria can thrive.</li>
            <li> and there is only a slight tingle while using it :).</li>
            <li> Luckily, I didn&#x27;t experience the tooth staining, but losing my sense of taste for several days was quite enough.  </li>
            <li> I got a free bottle from Bzzagent and unfortunately it was just too strong for me.</li>
            <li> I feel like my mouth is actually clean compared to other ones that feel less than clean before i even exit my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I hate that alcohol burn from mouth wash, so luckily this one was pretty smooth, but makes your mouth feel and smell minty clean.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t honestly think of a single thing that either of us disliked about this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy on the mouth &amp; not strong to the point where it burns.</li>
            <li> Tried some lemon juice to see the opposite and it tasted like pure battery acid.</li>
            <li> It makes my mouth feel clean as well as protects my teeth and cuts down on the plaque,it also kills germs and helps prevent gingivitis</li>
            <li> When you spit, any pieces of food or plaque come out as darker clumps of blue so older kids and teens like to use it because they can visually see how much they are cleaning out of their mouth my using it!</li>
            <li> Since it is alcohol free, it does not dry out my mouth like other mouthwashes.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous other brands and I find them to be too strong and burn during use.  </li>
            <li> The clear has been discontinued and amazon is sneaky in the footnotes that they may alter which one they send you.  </li>
            <li> Clearly the ADA is not a source for information in regards to health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping it will go away completely in the next day or so as I would really like to taste the food I eat again.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels as clean if not cleaner than going to the the dentist and a lot less invasive.</li>
            <li> I would buy it here if i knew it was the clear one</li>
            <li> and I need to buy the clear mint.</li>
            <li> I would get the Clear Mint.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels as clean if not cleaner than going to the the dentist and a lot less invasive.</li>
            <li> I use this product constantly and it really works.</li>
            <li> and  I don&#x27;t have any complaints so far, except that i read the labels and it said it could</li>
            <li> Oral-B Triumph Professional Care Electric Toothbrush.   </li>
            <li> Please inform me if a class action lawsuit happens.</li>
            <li> I have to say that i love this product despite all the negative comments about the mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this mouthwash to use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I like the taste and lack of burn that this product offers, but I am not thoroughly convinced it does anything.</li>
            <li> Wow i disagree with all the reviews and don&#x27;t understand.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get why this product has so many negative ratings.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it before I had to get my teeth professionally cleaned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of its sweetness that early in the AM.</li>
            <li> So far I like it</li>
            <li> My hygienist recommended this product because alcohol-based mouthwash makes my teeth sensitive.  </li>
            <li> My 6 year old also likes using it bc</li>
            <li> If you absolutely must use this product for some strange reason, monitor your teeth for stains daily and stop at the first sign of streaks and darkening at the gums.  </li>
            <li> Wow...</li>
            <li> There should be a class action lawsuit against these P&amp;G hacks.</li>
            <li> Just imagine my frustration when I finally make a real effort to increase my dental hygiene by adding flossing and crest pro health mouthwash twice a day to my routine-- which already includes using a sonicare</li>
            <li> I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand and after a month of using it I would recommend this product because my mouth feels cleaner and my breath fresher; however if you have a sensitive mouth you will experience burning sensation for one or two minutes.</li>
            <li> I just wish they would make this in an all natural format.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But overall I really like the mouthwash and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would have to get a professional cleaning to have them cleaned anymore thoroughly than they already are.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth, RUN, don&#x27;t walk away from this product.</li>
            <li> If you use a sensitive toothpaste, it will quite literally STRIP the sensitive toothpaste protection from your teeth and you will be in unbearable agony.</li>
            <li> &quot; many have complained about.  </li>
            <li> This mouthwash is my least favorite of all time.  </li>
            <li> This product legally should be removed from all stores until further notice.</li>
            <li> initially received this as a sample in the mail for free, but I definitely plan on buying this from now on in the future.</li>
            <li> so far have been using it for about a week and haven&#x27;t noticed any &amp;#34;stains&amp;#34; or anything like that&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> this product is complete garbage.</li>
            <li> Before trying the rinse I assumed it would leave a burning effect in my mouth, however, I was pleasantly surprised with its mildness.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this mouthwash to anyone that wants a healthier mouth.</li>
            <li> If a 3 year old likes it</li>
            <li> I use it in conjunction with a professional ultrasonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I used Crest for many years, but this has soured me.  </li>
            <li> Why is Crest still selling a product that completely kills your sense of taste?  </li>
            <li> and so far I like it.</li>
            <li> It does not burn at all (even my 6 year old likes it).  </li>
            <li> I have no trouble getting my 4 kids to use the mouthwash, but beware that it CAN cause staining.</li>
            <li> but, I was pleasantly surprised by this one.</li>
            <li> After using for several weeks straight, I don&#x27;t see any whitening changes, but there are lesser plague and my gum doesn&#x27;t bleed as much as I used to.</li>
            <li> Thankfully I was able to see this seems to be common with this product.  </li>
            <li> and I am absolutely going to fight to get my money back.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the taste.</li>
            <li> I am going to be looking to join a class action suit</li>
            <li> If anyone out there wants to join I suggest you do the same!</li>
            <li> If anyone out there wants to join I suggest you do the same!</li>
            <li> Now she&#x27;s completely lost her sense of taste and there&#x27;re white/dry spots all over in her mouth.</li>
            <li> I have had no trouble</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> My 10 year old was here when it arrived</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 52 years old and just thought it was an age thing.</li>
            <li> As far as browning teeth goes, I don&#x27;t want to stay and find out.</li>
            <li> My seven year old son even uses it and doesn&#x27;t complain about it burning his mouth.  </li>
            <li> There are even a couple of spots lower near my chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I hope Crest sees a class action lawsuit over this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve marked this product one star because of Amazon&#x27;s decision to drop it from Subscribe and Save, in order to get their attention.  </li>
            <li> I can say so far</li>
            <li> i gotta say its by far my fav mouthwash.</li>
            <li> If this product continues to cause harm to people, the makers of this product may have a product liability class action on their hands.  </li>
            <li> There is one for tarter control, sensitive teeth and multi-protection.  </li>
            <li> My opinions are completely my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, her lymph nodes also became inflamed and sensitive to the touch.</li>
            <li> But in case you do, hopefully you research and come across this information early to forgo the pain caused to others by this mouthwash.</li>
            <li> My dental hygentist recommended I use flouride rinse cause of my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> so my teeth won&#x27;t be so sensitive.  </li>
            <li> My 6 year old son and</li>
            <li> Turns out the WOW factor is alcohol, which I can do without.</li>
            <li> And why hasn&#x27;t our litigious society fixed it?</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> After 2 years of preparation to have straight and white teeth, I have brown stains in between and surrounding the bracket.</li>
            <li> Negative 5 stars for sure.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can gamble to see if it will affect you or not, but it took a professional cleaning to get rid of the stains for me.</li>
            <li> I absolutely anti-recommend this product, and don&#x27;t understand why in its current formulation it remains on the market.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> After using for a week I really didn&#x27;t notice a big difference.  </li>
            <li> We frequently purchase store brand products in order to save.</li>
            <li> My mouth was definitely feeling fresh for several hours.  </li>
            <li> Well, it only works if you want to go from a Vanna White smile to looking like</li>
            <li> She called the local distributor and asked about having the item pulled from the shelves, or at least have some kind of warning put on the label, but Crest hasn&#x27;t done so.  </li>
            <li> it left my teeth white and my it made my breathe feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see so many negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product that would provide fresh breath and that would actually taste like something I would not want to give up using and Crest Pro-Health Multi Protection mouthwash, does actually that for me.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this as the entire product line really is worth it.</li>
            <li> After using it twice a day for a few weeks I&#x27;ve noticed a much brighter smile.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t experienced any of the negative side effects (such as discoloration or tongue problems) that other reviewers have mentioned.</li>
            <li> I am still going back to Crest after using my listerine, although maybe looking at my other options in the crest brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it&#x27;s alcohol free, which is not the same with other mouthwash brands.</li>
            <li> Other brands that I have used prior to this product would usually leave strong burn in my mouth(even alcohol free).</li>
            <li> Waited an hour and a half, had some salami and wondered why it was so sickly sweet.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample from #BzzAgent and have been using it off and on for the past few weeks, I like the way it keeps my mouth feeling fresh for almost the whole day after I swish.</li>
            <li> Other than that it has been kept my breath smelling fresh for hours.</li>
            <li> Other than that I noticed it leaves my breath just as fresh as Scope</li>
            <li> I found the it didn&#x27;t keep my breath as fresh as some other mouth washes.</li>
            <li> I rotate this with my whitening mouthwash and have noticed a difference in how fresh my mouth remains longer than the other.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t have that fresh feeling like I get from other mouthwashes.  </li>
            <li> I am definitely converted over to this product as my new go to mouthwash!</li>
            <li> The only downside is that the nice minty taste does not last as long after rinsing as some other mouthwashes do.</li>
            <li> Like so many other reviewers, I suddenly noticed (as did those around me) brown stains in between my bottom teeth a few weeks after first using this product.</li>
            <li> I am a heavy coffee drinker and this product still leaves my mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Also love the subtle minty flavor.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not too harsh and it leaves my mouth feeling refreshed and clean longer than just brushing.</li>
            <li> Perhaps only a small peercentage of users experience this problem, but I sure did.</li>
            <li> like but fresh minty long lasting</li>
            <li> quick Google search online brings up countless complaints against this mouthwash, listing the same symptoms, so we are obviously not alone.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, I&#x27;ll go back and floss again and rinse again after eating a particularly crumbly item that gets in your teeth (like roasted almonds), and it lets you know when all the food particles that cause plaque are gone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unlike many reviewers, my teeth haven&#x27;t turned brown, but I&#x27;ve only used this twice in the past two days.</li>
            <li> This product left the strong bitter taste in my mouth  making everything I eat or drank just taste bad… I&#x27;m going back to Act.</li>
            <li> After several more weeks had passed of avoiding dark foods the stains intensified enough to make me investigate the mouthwash since it was the only new part of our routine.</li>
            <li> Anyways, I think this Crest mouthwash it decent for it&#x27;s price and works as much as any other mouthwash does.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend a second look</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for someone who is looking for something different than the norm.</li>
            <li> It does what it says, and has a pleasant taste, but it seems expensive for something that is so basic.  </li>
            <li> The only real complaint is I wasn&#x27;t in love with the flavor because I like a little more WOW factor with my mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the teeth staining is accurate</li>
            <li> Just got this product for free from Buzzagent and for the past 2 weeks</li>
            <li> It really works,just has a strange after taste and foam</li>
            <li> and I doubt they care much about their customers as long as stuff still</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d noticed them recently and couldn&#x27;t understand where they had come from as nothing in my normal routine had changed.  </li>
            <li> With so many time tested alternatives on the market, its simply not worth even trying in my opinion due to the risk of adverse reactions, and loss of time in trying to recoup your costs from the company if it doesn&#x27;t work out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted P&amp;G, only to be told that all of these things are normal.</li>
            <li> But recently Crest apparently has decided to use a new formula and now I can&#x27;t use it!</li>
            <li> Like many other people I had a loss of taste but also had extreme pain, swollen glans!</li>
            <li> buy this; it isn&#x27;t worth pouring down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also found that my breath stayed fresh longer than with other brands, and that equates cleaner to me!</li>
            <li> Luckily, my hygienist mentioned she&#x27;d seen staining on teeth from other who used this product once I explained that this was the only change I&#x27;d made.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the fault that I&#x27;ve found with this product is that when I spit it out, it clumps together in bright blue, fiber-like strands that stick to your sink and have to be SCRUBBED off - even if you spit while the water is running!.  </li>
            <li> I noticed fresher breath, longer lasting clean feeling, and less sensitivity within 2 weeks of using Crest-Pro Health rinse every day.</li>
            <li> , this is AMAZING!&amp;#34; As if that wasn&#x27;t a big enough plus to keep using the mouthwash I notice every time I use the mouthwash I notice it cleans my teeth very well</li>
            <li> I received a bottle of Crest Pro-Health for free to try out and review, it&#x27;s been a few weeks since I starting using it</li>
            <li> it never provided me with the fresh breath feeling that i expect from mouthwashes, and the various reviews that vouch for this product causing stained teeth are alarming.</li>
            <li> It was an issue big enough to make me permanently switch to Crest Pro-Health and highly recommend it to others!  </li>
            <li> I am using less gum because my mouth is staying fresh longer</li>
            <li> I used it only twice and developed severe pain in my molars (sensitivity to touch and pressure), a sore throat, swollen sores on my tongue, stains near my gum line, and I lost my sense of taste for 12 hours.</li>
            <li> I hate how so many alcohol containing mouth rinses burn, but most of the non alcohol rinses taste like mint water.</li>
            <li> I hate how so many alcohol containing mouth rinses burn, but most of the non alcohol rinses taste like mint water.</li>
            <li> Usually I have sore gums throughout the day and after using this mouthwash I have seen a significant change in the way my gums have felt.</li>
            <li> I know this has been reported in MANY other reviews, but I thought adding my story will send a stronger message to the manufacturer that this is not a rare occurrence, and BUYER BEWARE!</li>
            <li> but I make sure I use this product at least once a day!</li>
            <li> A major U.S. to this product is that it didn&#x27;t burn my mouth at all.</li>
            <li> All the benefits in one place can only have me saying WOW!</li>
            <li> I tried the Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection mouth wash and haven&#x27;t had any major issues with it.</li>
            <li> When I say easy to follow, I mean the mouthwash doesn&#x27;t burn.  </li>
            <li> I floss and use soft picks daily and very rarely have issues with soreness or bleeding, but after three uses of this mouthwash, my gums became visibly swollen and so tender that flossing was very painful and resulted in a fair amount of bleeding, to the point where I had to stop flossing.</li>
            <li> It makes my mouth feel so healthy and clean without the painful alcohol burn.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After only a few days of switching to the Crest rinse, I was amazed with how clean and plaque-free my teeth were.</li>
            <li> To me my main concern is using it at night since there is more chance of getting cavities or anything wrong with your mouth when you sleep.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After five weeks of using Crest Pro Health once a day in the morning with no other changes in my routine, I was growing concerned at the brown stainings that were appearing in between my teeth and near the gum lines and becoming worse.</li>
            <li> However, since it was mouthwash and mouthwash generally has that effect (</li>
            <li> I use this mouthwash multiple times daily and I feel clean and refreshed with a slight tingle.</li>
            <li> I have noticed also that my breath stays freshened clear up to around mid afternoon</li>
            <li> I thought I ordered the clear liquid, not the blue.  </li>
            <li> I usually use Crest&#x27;s 3D white mouthwash, but Crest sent me a free bottle of this Pro-health mouthwash to try.</li>
            <li> This is by far the only mouthwash I will ever use.</li>
            <li> From my personal experience, I would recommend Listerine, which gave me no trouble, or basically anything that isn&#x27;t Crest.rouble, or basically anything that isn&#x27;t Crest.</li>
            <li> No burn I definitely recommend it to anyone who has sensitive gums/teeth</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth it will take over a week away from this product to begin to build your resistance back up.</li>
            <li> I use it regularly especially because there is no harsh alcohol taste.</li>
            <li> My teeth are naturally quite white.</li>
            <li> I also brush with the Crest Complete, Extra Whitening + scope tooth paste.  </li>
            <li> In the morning I brush with sensitive toothpaste, followed by flossing, followed by waterpik, and lastly mouthwash.</li>
            <li> Crest apparently changed the formula and people are complaining everywhere</li>
            <li> I really do not like &amp;#34;hating&amp;#34; anything, however this product is absolutely trash and should be avoided by consumers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had no cavities on my last visit and the dental hygienist was amazed that I had not had a professional cleaning in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My cheeks then started to swell, and not only burned, but were extremely sensitive to the touch.</li>
            <li> But it is the CPC in Pro-health that provides the anti-gingivitis protection that is CRUCIAL if you want to keep your teeth into old age.  </li>
            <li> The CPC is apparently what causes the browning in SOME people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had no browning or tastebud issues whatsoever after years of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing that I have done differently from normal is to use Crest Pro Health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it has only been a short time and am still waiting for my taste to return to normal.</li>
            <li> But after trying the product twice a day for a few weeks now, I&#x27;m really not crazy about it.</li>
            <li> Many products on Amazon receive what I consider to be fraudulent reviews in favor of poor products but now I see it goes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tired of his lectures to brush and floss and rinse more.</li>
            <li> I feel like it doesn&#x27;t even clean my mouth and leaves nasty stains more than cleans!!</li>
            <li> Now my lips are very chapped and the corners are really dry, flaky and still red.</li>
            <li> This formula is alcohol free which mean that it is safer and easier to maintain it for 30 seconds in our mouths because it wont hurt our burn.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve using biotene mouth wash for a long time with no problem but wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li> Even after I stopped using my mouth did not feel right for a few days.</li>
            <li> After using Crest Pro-Health for about a week my mouth feels much cleaner for way longer than it has with other mouth washes.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it at first because it left a strange after taste that would make everything I ate taste strange for about 2 hours after rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it is very pricey compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> This product works really than the other mouth washes I have tried.</li>
            <li> and it also does not burns as much like other mouth wash</li>
            <li> When I received my Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection mouthwash, I was excited to try it because I have had bad experiences with other mouthwash brands that were too strong or had too much alcohol in them.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I do drink tea but not a single drop of coffee though.</li>
            <li> I picked up this Crest Pro Health Mouth Rinse at Sam&#x27;s Club- was out of my regular mouthwash &amp; figured I&#x27;d try this (and that the flouride might be a nice addition)-- WRONG.</li>
            <li> I have since tried ACT alcohol free mouthwash and found that it is minty fresh and doesn&#x27;t cause my mouth to go numb.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ve only used this product a few weeks after being a sent a complimentary bottle to review (I was not compensated n</li>
            <li> I have two fancy caps, like fake teeth, right in the front of my smile</li>
            <li> This product gave me very dark brown stains that gradually snuck up on me, in between my teeth, by the time the first bottle was gone.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s a big plus for me because I can never finish with the other brands it burns to much</li>
            <li> My teeth are cleaner, MY breath is fresher, and MY last checkup turned out EXTREMELY well, thanks to Crest</li>
            <li> I will probably buy this again as long as I do not experience any staining or sensitive teeth issues.</li>
            <li> My teeth did feel sore after the first few uses</li>
            <li> if you rinse before bed and don&#x27;t drink at least a full glass of water</li>
            <li> Until after a few days, we both discussed oursymptoms together for the first time and put two and two together.</li>
            <li> The first few days were tough since I am not a fan of strong minty tastes.</li>
            <li> Instead of having a fresh clean feeling, my mouth burned and my tongue was numb.</li>
            <li> This has helped keep my teeth from being super sensitive to hot and cold foods.</li>
            <li> I usually shy away from this flavor because the mint is too strong but not with this one!  </li>
            <li> My teeth have also become much more sensitive in the last two weeks, and for at least a few hours after using the product, I can&#x27;t taste a thing.</li>
            <li> We brush and especially floss religiously every single day, we even use two mouthwashes afterwards as part of our normal routine.</li>
            <li> I have to say the 1 star reviews for this product are accurate; a family member of mine experienced all the terrible things mentioned in other reviews.</li>
            <li> I mean it does have a cool mint taste</li>
            <li> The reason is the Glide \\&quot;glides\\&quot; right past the plaque and food build up leaving the teeth unclean.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it for very long but so far, I like it.</li>
            <li> and she too has said how much she enjoys it compared to our previous brand.</li>
            <li> I do still feel a slight burning sensation but its very tolerable.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference in there being less &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; when I brush and floss or in the color of my teeth or gums.</li>
            <li> Come to find out there is a whole forum on the subject.</li>
            <li> It seems to last a long time as far as freshness of breath goes to which is always a plus.</li>
            <li> I tried Crest Pro -health for the first time few days ago and instantly became a fan!</li>
            <li> First of all, I&#x27;m really surprised to see all these negative reviews.</li>
            <li> None of the foods I tried had much flavor, but salty and sour things were especially flavorless.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely a strong mouth wash, but we have not experienced any burning.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought this product is fine, the only problem is that the taste is a little too strong, well, I could still handle it if this was the only annoying aspect.</li>
            <li> I received this for free from BzzAgent, I had high expectations for this product, but have to say I was pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> Kinda odd to see so many negative reviews.</li>
            <li> First off this stuff made my tongue feel raw which lasted for hours</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is serious about the health of their mouth because it really does as it claims.</li>
            <li> I guess I thought since it was alcohol free it would be really mild, but, while it didn&#x27;t burn as bad as the ones with alcohol, I definitely felt it</li>
            <li> No over-powering alcohol taste, just a subtle, sweet flavor.</li>
            <li> (I asked my husband who can at times speak his mind a little bit too much.</li>
            <li> only does it do the job, if not a better job, than the bitter mouthwash that is now in the trash, but Crest Pro-health makes my breath minty and fresh!</li>
            <li> You definitely feel clean right after use, but at first I didn&#x27;t think it lasted very long and was doubtful about the \\&quot;24 hour</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t clean your sink daily while using this product, you&#x27;re more than likely going to end up wit awful, vibrant blue chunks stuck all over it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pointless to use an alcohol free mw if the active ingredient actually makes your teeth hurt (it does to me).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie to you and say that this mouthwash has fixed every little problem in my mouth, say that it has made my teeth pearly white, or go as far to say that it has replaced my routine dental exams because</li>
            <li> gum turned very sensitive and even bleed often due to pregnancy, and my wisdom teeth ache too.</li>
            <li> It does a good job at keeping your mouth feeling fresh for awhile but it leaves a bad after taste thats hard to get out of tour mouth</li>
            <li> After a cleaning that took 1 hour longer than normal and unpleasant blasting of my teeth, the stains were able to be removed, so they were not permanent.</li>
            <li> P&amp;G is changing the clear liquid version to a different assortment and more expensive, and the color can stain plaque on the teeth, so brush carefully.</li>
            <li> I just love how my mouth feels after using, and it doesn&#x27;t leave behind a bitter taste like some I have used before.</li>
            <li> It makes my breath smell fresh and the effect actually lasts a while, whereas other mouthwashes would just work for a little while.</li>
            <li> I use this after brushing and if I am eating a messy or if I am having a not so breath friendly type of lunch, I take a little swish.  </li>
            <li> I had some buildup of brown stains over time while using this product, but the real shock was when my lower teeth became stained dark brown in a single day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ran into a dental office that afternoon because I was so freaked out.</li>
            <li> But after I realized that my mouth felt fresh and clean hours later decided that maybe this product isn&#x27;t so bad after all.</li>
            <li> have been using this product for a few weeks now, and my favorite thing about it is that there is significantly less of the typical mouthwash burning sensation.  </li>
            <li> The stains caused by this product were enough to make me extremely self conscious of smiling.</li>
            <li> Lacked a sense of strength because its got a weak taste to it, wondered if it was able to do what its supposed to with such a bland taste.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I clearly noticed the difference from other mouthwashes as Crest Pro-Health does not give me a stinging sensation in my mouth when I gargle it.      </li>
            <li> it does keep your breath fresh for a long time the only down side is every thing you eat is slightly minty afterwards.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean, and I have not experienced any staining.</li>
            <li> This is the most useless excuse for a mouthwash I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> Also has a long lasting minty breath is key.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally look in my mouth, but one evening, after a few months of Pro-Health, I peeled back a lip to examine the roots and gum line, and YEE GODS!!</li>
            <li> I thought it was plaque and tried pretty hard to remove it with floss</li>
            <li> but I also use the tooth paste which has a slight abrasive in it and although not completely happy have noticed my mouth does feel, smell and look better.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, my dentist was able to clean up the mess with my normal checkup cleaning, but I feel incredibly sorry for the people who are looking for healthy teeth and end up with terrible stains.</li>
            <li> I got to try this product free thanks to Crest and Bzzagent, but I must say, after a few weeks, I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> Only a professional cleaning at the dentists will get rid of this mess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my third week and don&#x27;t know how long others used it to notice the brown teeth</li>
            <li> I can never swish it around long enough!</li>
            <li> all germs in your mouth have been conquered and the feeling last for so long</li>
            <li> The individuals have NOT used the product long enough to notice the damage it does to your teeth.</li>
            <li> I noticed after both times though, there&#x27;s an incredibly bitter taste in my mouth, similar to earwax (gross, I know, but everyone has had that gross taste in their mouth once in their life.)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only because the taste/feeling lasts SO stinking long.</li>
            <li> I used this every morning and night until I finished the bottle and, sadly, was excited to switch back to my regular, basic mouthwash.</li>
            <li> long lasting freshness.</li>
            <li> it was long lasting and dont have that burn that othert mouthwashes give you.</li>
            <li> I have used Crest products for as long as I can remember, and the Crest Pro Health Multi Protection Rinse definitely lives up to the expectations I have for Crest.  </li>
            <li> Just flooring that this could pass inspections with something that long lasting.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;ve done different is rinse with this mouthwash and after reading all the \\&quot;brown stain\\&quot; comments on here I can confirm that I am a victim of Crest&#x27;s brown stains.  </li>
            <li> It took roughly one week for my sense of taste to return to normal, which is what I had read from other people as well.  </li>
            <li> When ive used other brand mouthwashes, i am litterally counting down the seconda in my head for it to be over because it burns so much.</li>
            <li> I realize there is a vague warning on the back, but I&#x27;ve been using mouthwash for 20 years with no problem so why would I be reading the fine print?&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching endlessly for a less intense mouthwash with all the effects of Pro-Health, but this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> Plus, a liquid can really reach deep into those hard to reach areas</li>
            <li> Crest should step up and pay for the extra, extra deep dental cleaning I now need, due to the THEIR CRAPPY PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I had only been using the mouthwash for about the last six weeks, but my dental hygienist said the staining that suddenly occurred on my teeth was entirely due to the mouthwash.</li>
            <li> i received this product for free from a promotion and i love that there is no burn or horrible after taste.</li>
            <li> Now Amazon has arbitrarily decided to remove it from Subscribe and Save, and is suggesting a substitute product (a whitening product) that is more expensive and does not offer the plaque/gingivitis treatment that this product provides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far, I have used the Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection rinse only a few times.</li>
            <li> The effects last longer than I had expected and using it at night definitely helps prevent morning breath.</li>
            <li> It has left my teeth with brown stains after I&#x27;ve spent 100&#x27;s to get my teeth white.  </li>
            <li> Luckily I stopped using it before it got any worse.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash does not have the same feeling as other mouthwashes on the market, it is a lot more subtle with a very slight &amp;#34;tingling&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Not the best mouthwash I&#x27;ve ever used but certainly not the worst.</li>
            <li> What I dislike about this product is that it still does burn a little but not as much as all the other bottles of mouth wash.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely angry about this and just took back our third and forth bottles to the store we purchased them from for a full refund.</li>
            <li> my first usage of the product, I noticed that little bits of blue sludge were stuck to my tongue, and the mouthwash left a horrible chemical aftertaste in my mouth rather than a fresh, clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> I did a bit of internet searching and discovered other people had the same problem, especially with salty foods.  </li>
            <li> I was horrified, and finally found other people who had the same problem with the product.</li>
            <li> About six hours later, with my tongue still feeling incredibly odd, I tried to eat dinner and realized that I only had taste on the very back of my tongue.</li>
            <li> I mention the fact that I brushed thoroughly because I have read 5-star reviews in which the reviewers state that the only reason that this product turns other people&#x27;s teeth brown is because they either don&#x27;t brush well or don&#x27;t brush at all.</li>
            <li> The active ingredient in this apparently affects the majority of the population in ruining your taste buds for hours to days.</li>
            <li> Ive used other creast mouth washes such as the tartar control one this one has made a improve ment to my daily brushing of my teeth, my nreath smells fresher, my teeth feel cleaner</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for something that not only works but also a product that doesn&#x27;t have that burn like other mouthwash.</li>
            <li> However (similar to other reviewers), my tongue has felt like it had been burnt from the start--even several hours after using it.</li>
            <li> My gums would bleed a little and now they have completely stopped.</li>
            <li> I no longer have to buy little kid rinse and adult rinse</li>
            <li> Then I discovered all those negative reviews and the small fine print on the bottle...</li>
            <li> recently received a free sample of the product #gotitfree and have transformed from a casual user ie.once every day or once every other day to a regular user.  </li>
            <li> My hygienist had to really work hard at getting the stains out, and it was not pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing I noticed is that my tongue felt a little bit &amp;#34;numb&amp;#34; for a few minutes after I finished using it, but I just rinsed really well with water and the numbness went away.</li>
            <li> For now, I highly recommend this mouthwash, especially if you&#x27;re tired of the regular, alcohol based mouthwash drying out your mouth and contributing to potential dental</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really bad when you can&#x27;t stand your own breath.  </li>
            <li> I found that the burn from this product was actually more unpleasant than a regular mouthwash.</li>
            <li> while using this mouthwash, unfortunately, my dentist confirmed it will leave spots on my teeth.</li>
            <li> Hideous dark brown stains at the root line, and on closer examination some of the same stains between several teeth.</li>
            <li> It also left a bitter taste in my mouth that lingered for quite some time.</li>
            <li> I have been using crest mouthwash for a long time</li>
            <li> But THEN I started having issues with a strange sort of numbness on my tongue.  </li>
            <li> For as long as I have used mouthwash I always thought that alcohol included meant it was  &amp;#34;working&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have few days using this mouthwash so far</li>
            <li> but i have not been using this product for every long.</li>
            <li> the FDA would of taken this product off the market a long time ago.</li>
            <li> My brown stains are not completely gone, but now I&#x27;ll have to fork out</li>
            <li> I was wondering what could be the reason of the brown strain; later discovered the bitter fact from the reviews of this product.</li>
            <li> Why is this still on the market after so long?</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and have had my 8 yr old try it</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to give Crest a try when the campaign came out, since it seemed to leave a burning sensation in my mouth after using it, but it has come a long way in improving the flavor and the tingle sensation that it leaves in my mouth after rising.  </li>
            <li> But once I spit it out, there was a strange sensation in my mouth.</li>
            <li> My tongue feels strange and when I breathe I taste chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crest for a long time now.  </li>
            <li> IT HAS KILLED MY TASTE BUDS COMPLETELY AFTER ONE USE,</li>
            <li> after a long night of snoring...</li>
            <li> It does not burn as harshly as the others which is a big plus to me since I could barely keep the others on my mouth in the allotted time.</li>
            <li> It says to use 2x a day, but anymore than once every couple of days and my taste buds are killed off as if i&#x27;ve just eaten a whole package of sour patch kids.  </li>
            <li> After only using it for a bit less than 2 days, I lost my taste totally.</li>
            <li> Fresh breath with out the burn and with out the alcohol that can dry out your mouth and make you breath worse</li>
            <li> It seemed like it didn&#x27;t last as long throughout the day as some other mouthwashes I have used.  </li>
            <li> However, any other mouthwash i have tried left me screaming in pain.</li>
            <li> was almost out of my other crest mouthwash (actually same product), when I was given the opportunity to review this as well.</li>
            <li> I have used other products that do the same thing.</li>
            <li> She said she had seen the stains on several other clients and found they had been using this mouthwash as well.  </li>
            <li> You have to look all the way at the bottom of the label and read the small print after it discusses how to get your money back if unsatisfied (which, by the way, apparently only last 60 days after purchase).</li>
            <li> only thing I like about this product is that it does not burn like other mouthwashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The flavor of the rinse seems similar to other mouthwashes I have used before.</li>
            <li> I HAVEN&#x27;T BEEN USING LONG BUT PLAN TO CONTINUE USE TO SEE THE PROGRESS THIS PRODUCT CAN GIVE ME!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this was caused by the mouthwash until I read some other reviews that have the same problem as me.</li>
            <li> and we didn&#x27;t have the same problems other people are reporting.</li>
            <li> This will definately be a long time mouthwash in our household!</li>
            <li> will definitely be reporting back if my teeth start to \\&quot;turn brown\\&quot; or if there are any other adverse effects due to this mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I have used several other mouthwashes and none of them come close to the feeling I get from using this product.</li>
            <li> I did find that using it prior to brushing my teeth (compared to after, as recommended) helped eliminate interference with other flavors while eating.    </li>
            <li> their formula has changed over the past few years and maybe that&#x27;s why there are so many negative reviews.</li>
            <li> Similar to other mouthwashes nothing out of this world.</li>
            <li> The only other mouthwash that is not a joke is Listerine, but it does NOT offer the anti-plaque and anti-gingivitis features of Pro-health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> BTW the hygienist also informed me of other patients, using this product, had similar stains.</li>
            <li> In some fairness, it does say on the back of the bottle in little tiny letters that this product may cause staining.</li>
            <li> This is NOT Clear!  </li>
            <li> get bad breath due to dry mouth from certain medications and such, and I do say my breath stays fresh even after eating and drinking.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34; I was upping my hygiene game, but started to notice my teeth getting more dull looking with brown stains between each teeth.</li>
            <li> and I am happy to use it daily (unlike some that burn my mouth or taste awful)!  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn your mouth or dry it out like Listerine does.</li>
            <li> I gave this a shot however because I had hopes it would help with my dry mouth from my meds.</li>
            <li> And we like the taste, too (but only the blue, not the green variety).</li>
            <li> (It is only the blue bottle, not the green).  </li>
            <li> Every person is different and some people do experience these side affects from the active ingredient, but the majority of users suffer no side effects at all or else</li>
            <li> The toothpaste contains the same active ingredient (CPC); stay away from that one, too.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I did not notice the stains on my teeth until I almost used up the whole bottle (had a busy work schedule....).</li>
            <li> The dentist gives away those small travel sized bottles of Crest Prohealth clear mint</li>
            <li> I was not able to get rid of the brown stains until my teeth were professionally cleaned.</li>
            <li> It almost looked as if I had big spaces between my teeth because the stains were so dark.</li>
            <li> I am totally into doing anything that helps prevent or lessens plaque since it is no fun going to the dentist and having your teeth scraped with it</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and by the end of the second bottle noticed dark stains on my teeth, sort of like a chewing tobacco user.  </li>
            <li> After visiting my dentist today (which I do religiously twice a year and also floss, brush and water pik each day) he ended up scraping off dark brown stains all over my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I love how my mouth feels after using without that crazy &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; feeling that you get from other mouthwashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have been a long time user of Crest products, but apparently i&#x27;m not much for reading labels.  </li>
            <li> Within a month of morning and evening use (the bottle recommends 2x daily for &amp;#34;Better Dental Check-ups&amp;#34;) and flossing, I had HORRIBLE brownish stains along the edges and gums of my lower front teeth, and flossing those teeth was more painful and sensitive than when I first started the dreaded flossing routine!</li>
            <li> The rest of this bottle got dumped down the drain, and the second one of the two-pack I gave to a friend who uses this stuff and doesn&#x27;t have a problem with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only down side is</li>
            <li> After going to many drs and dentists with no one knowing what was wrong, my sister found this report about a lawsuit regarding crest pro health and loss of taste, browning of the teeth, swollen glans and a few other symptoms.</li>
            <li> The first mouthwash I used really burned my mouth so bad that I had to add water to the bottle.</li>
            <li> it does have a slight burn initially, but I didn&#x27;t mind that.</li>
            <li> It leaves my mouth refreshed similar to leaving a pro cleaning but obviously much less invasive.  </li>
            <li> I have only used it a week and a half...</li>
            <li> i tossed it out after only using half the bottle.</li>
            <li> I used this product for aprox a year and thought that I was having other issues due to medical reasons.</li>
            <li> The stains appeared after about a month of usage, and since at the same time I had been eating a bit of dates and black inky colored rice</li>
            <li> I started using this mouthwash a week and a half ago.. and after reading the reviews on here started worrying about the potential side effects.</li>
            <li> Not real sure why that would happen, but it may not be the same for everyone.</li>
            <li> Also if you have to get a tooth pulled like I did due to calcium and bone loss due to medical issues and medications I can tell you that it also helps your mouth heal faster.</li>
            <li> After about 2 weeks of use, we started to notice big black and brown staining spots on our teeth that would not come off.</li>
            <li> i have not noticed any issues with mine nor any issues with the other i have used for a long time.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I&#x27;ve noticed, is that the freshness doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would prefer.</li>
            <li> In fact, at my last check-up the dentist commented on how much less plaque I had, which I attribute partially to the rinse.  </li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this product to avoid harsh gum dry out caused by regular mouth wash.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can understand the business motivation for Crest to keep this product on the market (apparently this mouthwash works for some people) but its failure to highlight its product&#x27;s potential problem is inexcusable.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last up to 24 hours, but does last longer then other mouth washes I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I did a little research and turns out the blue dye they use</li>
            <li> The next day I had a little redness in the corner of my mouth.</li>
            <li> I have been rinsing with it twice a day for the past week and haven&#x27;t had any major concerns.</li>
            <li> I DO see little blue pieces in the sink sometimes when I spit it out.</li>
            <li> Another VICTIM of Crest!  </li>
            <li> I religiously followed the directions to wait before eating, so morning coffee was not the culprit, and I was so desperate to find a solution that I went online and found HUNDREDS of other people with the exact same problem!!</li>
            <li> Like many of the other reviewers, it did seem to dull my tastebuds, but I didn&#x27;t mind terribly because it made my fresh breath last for a long time.</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be hard on my sensitive mouth.</li>
            <li> I started using whitening strips to remove the brown stains, but within 3 days of whitening my teeth they are back to brown &amp; very dark brown in between the teeth.</li>
            <li> I love how it gets rid of my bad breath,kills germs and keeps teeth feeling cleaner longer.</li>
            <li> You have nothing to lose...except bad breath :)</li>
            <li> On top of that my gums would sting really bad when I used the mouthwash.</li>
            <li> Iam happy that i have not experienced any of these bad side effects.</li>
            <li> but I have noticed that for a mouthwash that&#x27;s alcohol free it burns like crazy</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of mint in general and usually get the winterfresh</li>
            <li> After I noticed this effect and found that hundreds of people have complained of the same problems, I stopped using the product, yet my sense of taste is still impaired 3 days later.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know anything about brown stains; this did not happen to me -- at least not so far.  </li>
            <li> last time: There is absolutely nothing wrong with the product, if it there was the FDA and Proctor and Gamble would take the product off the shelves.</li>
            <li> The fact is that a small minority of people because of their body chemistry and condition of their teeth experience minor side effects such as staining of the teeth and a temporary loss of taste.</li>
            <li> making an appointment to see if I can get these stains cleaned, but I really don&#x27;t appreciate having to endure a deep cleaning just because I used the wrong mouthwash.</li>
            <li> When I looked this up online, I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d find anything but after seeing all these other negative reviews I&#x27;m really surprised that it&#x27;s still on the shelf!  </li>
            <li> I have never been a big fan of mouthwash because the alcohol always left a burning sensation, and I never liked the taste.  </li>
            <li> but I do use every few months an occasional whitening strip</li>
            <li> Currently I do not have but a few blisters in mouth.</li>
            <li> It is harder to use because it \\&quot;grips\\&quot;</li>
            <li> As for staining, I haven&#x27;t seen anything yet, but I use it only a few times a week before I brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> While shopping at Costco, I saw a two-pack of this Crest Pro-Health and decided to buy it to replace the empty bottle of Listerine.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I did not enjoy about it was the aftertaste.</li>
            <li> After using it only a few times, I already have noticed a difference for me.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until I used the product again a few days later that I began to suspect that is was Crest Pro Health mouthwash causing my loss of taste.  </li>
            <li> I have absolutely no tarter build up anymore.</li>
            <li> After a few basic health questions, she asked if I used Pro Health products, and I said I started using the Pro Health Rinse about 6 months ago.  </li>
            <li> She told me my tartar build up was minimal and ask me how I brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> but I feel the burn of alcohol, it is not intense but the feeling is still there.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now im curious to why this is happening to people.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days, but have not noticed any staining of my teeth like others have mentioned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a fortune on them and a lot, LOT of time at these specialists.  </li>
            <li> A few weeks later I realized my teeth were turning browner and browner.</li>
            <li> I will never enjoy food again because of Crest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am emotionally devastated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used Crest products, but absolutely never will again.</li>
            <li> It actually feels like its cleaning without the harsh burn.</li>
            <li> Just ask my dental hygienist who spent over 2 hours cleaning these stains from my teeth.</li>
            <li> Not a drop is wasted or thrown away because all 5 of us now use this mouthwash 2x daily.  </li>
            <li> So, yes savvy shoppers, this name brand product is worth the money (although it&#x27;s not an expensive product to begin with).&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also dried out my mouth and left my tongue rough feeling, like I&#x27;d burned it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I stopped using it on the 3rd day and my taste slowly came back after around 4 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am loving the fact that this product protects with out that annoying sting.</li>
            <li> My sense of taste is almost completely gone from the first half of my tongue, and it feels oddly numb.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Within a couple of days the little red corner tripled in size and then I got another one on the other side of my mouth.</li>
            <li> I have not had any issues with staining like many other reviews have stated; perhaps, there was a bad batch.</li>
            <li> May of the other products I tried for me and my son, were too harsh and my son would not use it  With Crest Pro-health, we both use it regularly and without a problem  </li>
            <li> Just like me, I thought that manufactures really could not fix the nasty taste that some mouthwashes leave behind, but not this one, it leaves a cool fresh feeling, that I look forward to rinsing every day.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s really awful and is not at all what I would describe as clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> After just one single use of this mouthwash, I have lost my ability to taste!!</li>
            <li> This is a huge fail for Crest!</li>
            <li> It does sting a bit (which is to be expected) but other than that i don&#x27;t have any problems with it.</li>
            <li> I used it the next morning, and while I was at work I noticed that my gums seemed to be burning, and that my tongue felt raw.  </li>
            <li> To minimize the taste bud changes, after rinsing with it wash it off your tongue with clean cold water.</li>
            <li> Just back from the dentist and and was shocked to find out that for a large number of people -- including me -- Crest Pro-health mouthwash actually INCREASES STAINING.</li>
            <li> There was very little plaque buildup, and overall he said he thought our teeth seemed whiter and our mouths were cleaner!</li>
            <li> It seems to me that there was very little if any product testing done on this mouthwash, and if there was, it was possibly not enough.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for this last past week</li>
            <li> As I was reviewing the other reviews, I noticed a lot of people indicated this product stains their teeth.</li>
            <li> Unlike other well-known brands of mouthwash, this product from Crest does not burn your mouth.</li>
            <li> It does not burn my mouth and using it is not difficult or uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It was JUST on the other side of being a burning sensation, as though I&#x27;d spread benzocaine all over it.  </li>
            <li> due to how it is marketed.</li>
            <li> I recently got braces and was given the usual instruction brush after every meal, floss and rinse.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t burn when I used it like some other mouthwashes I have used.</li>
            <li> Tried this product not thinking there would be a difference from any other mouth wash</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any issues with brown stains on my teeth due to this</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn your mouth like other mouth washes containing alcohol.</li>
            <li> ,t imagine what other are talking about&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> I will not stop using it over my other brand</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not pretty.  </li>
            <li> Ordered it once, but switched to ACT and am happier with that (see my other review).&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> No burning like with other products and has helped preventing build up.</li>
            <li> My daughter does not smoke, drink red wine, excessive coffee, etc.</li>
            <li> I also did a bit of online research, and other people have had this problem.  </li>
            <li> I hope as other people have mentioned that the dentist can remove it.</li>
            <li> you get extreme cotton mouth in the morning</li>
            <li> This was despite the fact that I had brushed my teeth thoroughly, as usual, before using this product.</li>
            <li> There are plenty of other mouthwashes out there.</li>
            <li> such waste of money!</li>
            <li> I looked at other reviews who stated having pain after using it</li>
            <li> I will chose crest over any other mouthwash.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave the burn that some other mouthwashes have.</li>
            <li> I have a past of dealing with gum disease and have seen a big difference in my gums since using this.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn my mouth like other mouthwashes</li>
            <li> ,t imagine what other are talking about&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> I would not change to any other brand.  </li>
            <li> I like that the rinse does not burn in my mouth like some other rinses do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rather impatient when it comes to gargling that long.  </li>
            <li> I thought I was imaging the loss of taste in my mouth and the stains on my teeth from using this product, until I read the other review posted here.  </li>
            <li> At any rate I am quite fond of this mouthwash and would choose Crest before other competitor brands.</li>
            <li> I have read the other reviews about brown teeth,  </li>
            <li> Have not experience any spotting on the teeth like the other reviews state.</li>
            <li> Stick to whatever other mouthwash you have been using.</li>
            <li> I seen other reviews saying something about staining their teeth brown.</li>
            <li> It contains no alcohol so it doesn&#x27;t burn like other mouthwashes.  </li>
            <li> Other mouthwashes do not even come close to doing all these things but Crest Pro-health does.</li>
            <li> I was still having extreme pain in mouth.</li>
            <li> , I could t concentrate on anything g due to the see deity of my mouth condition.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try using it once every other night to see if that helps prevent the staining.</li>
            <li> Usually I&#x27;m pretty skeptical when it comes to oral hygiene products.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have said, this product can turn your teeth brown.</li>
            <li> Unlike other reviewers, I have not noticed any brown stains on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> and so there&#x27;s no burning sensation that you get with the other leading brands.  </li>
            <li> It did not stain my  teeth like in some of the other reviews.</li>
            <li> and I am not sure why others are having such issues with it!</li>
            <li> I have read other reviews about the brown spots and it has scared me to try it again.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now, and I have not noticed any of the staining that people were talking about in other reviews.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels cleaner for a longer period of time compared to other mouthwashes.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak for the other reviewers and experiences..  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any brown spots like other people have, but god damn, my tongue feels like I don&#x27;t have any tastebuds or something.</li>
            <li> Other adverse effects found in animal testing include nervous depression, convulsions and limb paralysis.</li>
            <li> Well, if you read the small print on the bottle, there is a tiny warning about teeth staining.</li>
            <li> Now last week a bottle of this \\&quot;blue\\&quot; rinse made it&#x27;s way into my household, not sure who bought it</li>
            <li> After a few days or seriously strange breath after brushing and rinsing, I started to wonder if maybe it was something I was eating for breakfast that was interacting with the Pro-Health rinse.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Based on other reviews it appears I am in the minority.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the alcohol burn that other brands do.</li>
            <li> ,t imagine what other are talking about&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> any other way)</li>
            <li> We picked this up thinking it must be like all other mouthwashes.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other mouthwash&#x27;s and the after taste and soreness</li>
            <li> other mouthwashes do its no overpowering and does not hurt to use it like others.</li>
            <li> When I touched my tongue, it was very rough.</li>
            <li> Before falling asleep, I noticed a very bitter taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I was super afraid to use this mouthwash after reading the reviews</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I soon learned that the active ingredient, Cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), can leave brown stains on teeth.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash has a pesticide as the active ingredient.</li>
            <li> We can&#x27;t really afford the expensive other mouthwash&#x27;s</li>
            <li> She said that it&#x27;s really common from mouthwashes such as Crest with cetylpyridinium chloride as the active ingredient</li>
            <li> Really love the Crest ProHealth toothpaste, so was a little bit disappointed with the mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I have such a hard time getting my family to use mouthwash, but for this product it is not the case.</li>
            <li> Cetylpyridinium chloride can make your mouth or throat numb, increase the risk of severe allergic reactions, such as swelling of the mouth, face, lips or tongue, labored breathing, rashes, and hives and ingesting high concentrations of cetylpyridinium chloride can lead to lung damage.</li>
            <li> I do thoroughly enjoy that it doesn&#x27;t burn nearly as bad as the alcohol based mouth washes do.    </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t find this mouthwash painful to use, probably because it is alcohol free.</li>
            <li> That is my only complaint.</li>
            <li> On the 4th day I thought about what I had done differently lately and the only thing I could think of was the mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27; s not worth seeing if you will or not.</li>
            <li> I really should have looked up some of the scary stuff online, but who has time for that at the grocery store?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have that strange aftertaste like you usually get.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe that a company can create a product with such dangerous side effects, arrogantly call those side effects normal, and continue to sell the product knowing that consumers will trust it because it is a name brand.</li>
            <li> You Love Or Hate This Product ?</li>
            <li> I was surprised to learn that this mouthwash could get any worse than it already was.</li>
            <li> I brush my teeth as well as can be expected for everyday, at-home cleaning.</li>
            <li> I hate most mouth washes because they always burn my mouth and for some reason locks up my jaw, but</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that while it doesnt burn as much as other mouth washes it still burns a little.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing that I have to say about it is that at about 20 seconds into 30 seconds of swishing it starts to burn slightly .</li>
            <li> Until then, the rest of my Crest Pro Health has been dumped down the drain.</li>
            <li> In fact, mine&#x27;s going down the drain.</li>
            <li> (someone in a review video identified these) going down the drain.</li>
            <li> If you want to know what it feel like to run your tongue up and down a cheese grater while simultaneously dousing it in acid, then use this stuff.....</li>
            <li> This stuff is going down the drain.</li>
            <li> However, this one may not be for me, though it could be completely down to my body chemistry.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Needless to say, I poured the rest of the bottle down the drain.</li>
            <li> I would buy this product over any other mouthwash out there!</li>
            <li> We poured our cups into our mouths and immediately looked at each other in surprise!</li>
            <li> it has a sickly sweet flavor and it is impossible to gargle as it foams up in your mouth as if you have rabies.</li>
            <li> As the other users mentioned, I had my tongue numb after the first use for 12 hours.</li>
            <li> not that harsh medicine scent does the job along with other Crest Pro health Products can&#x27;t beat an well known name in mouth healthcare</li>
            <li> Where the taste/feeling lasts so long it makes food taste weird later on, but that&#x27;s to be expected</li>
            <li> She had trouble swallowing food and liquids due to the pain, and had to deal with days of headaches and throbbing in her jaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Typically, I use Listerine--</li>
            <li> Maybe an odd comment here and there but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed less plaque in the morning and night.</li>
            <li> Less than one-tenth of 1% of people... have raised this concern.\\&quot;     </li>
            <li> I guess  i&#x27;m the odd man out.</li>
            <li> everything has an odd sweetness to it nothing else</li>
            <li> It also leaves an odd slimed like feeling on my tongue.  </li>
            <li> AND YOU HAVE LESS PLAQUE BUILT</li>
            <li> and I have less plaque build up.</li>
            <li> I hope to have a better experience in December when I go for my six month check-up and possibly have less scraping of the nasty plaque.  </li>
            <li> and since I started using it, I have had whiter teeth and less cavities.</li>
            <li> If you keep using it, your teeth will turn black.</li>
            <li> I was previously using the Crest Advanced White mouthwash, and hated it.  </li>
            <li> Being alcohol-free, it doesn&#x27;t have the burn factor that typical mouthwashes do.</li>
            <li> Mine seemed less severe because I chose to rinse my mouth out after rinsing with the Crest mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I grew up with Crest Products and always believed they were \\&quot;top of the line\\&quot; - last year I had tried the whitening rinse (contains peroxide) and it gave me horrible gastritis - threw it away, called the 800 number and promptly received a refund.  </li>
            <li> There is a slight burn but nothing compared to the death burn of Listerine.  </li>
            <li> My teeth feel cleaner and there is less plaque on my floss at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> so mad right</li>
            <li> ITS NOT STRONG AT ALL LIKE OTHER MOUTHWASHES, OF COURSE</li>
            <li> Finished a bottle of this before starting to worry that there was something horribly wrong with me or my dental hygiene habits due to the staining on my teeth that was so bad multiple people noticed and told me to see a dentist right away.</li>
            <li> Leaves your breath feeling cool doesn&#x27;t have a bad taste I like it</li>
            <li> I flew up to Virginia a few days ago to visit my model gorgeous daughter and was shocked to see how brown her bottom teeth were (she looked like she had been sticking a wad of chewing tobacco behind her bottom lip!)</li>
            <li> A few days ago, I noticed some dark brown stains on the inside edges of my teeth.</li>
            <li> NOT TRUE.</li>
            <li> I like to use mouthwash and got tired of Listerine (works well, but not exactly flavorful), so I picked up some Pro-Health, which I used regularly.</li>
            <li> I think the blue color will stain our teeth somewhat, which is a little annoying, since i think they could make it in white or clear.</li>
            <li> I thought that was common sense, but apparently common sense is not so common these days especially when corporate profits are involved</li>
            <li> Did not clean my teeth like it should have.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty gross and really annoying.  </li>
            <li> Our kids got these little sand timers from the dentist for brushing their teeth so we used those to time ourselves.</li>
            <li> like I have lots of little cavities between my now gray-tinged teeth.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure where the other reviewers are getting these stains from.</li>
            <li> I was a little scared because it says on the bottle that it may stain your teeth.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any Brown stains as other reviewers have mentioned in the past which leads me to believe they have updated their formula.</li>
            <li> It takes a lot to get me to write a review for something that costs so little over the counter, but man oh man, stay away.</li>
            <li> This is not like the other kinds I have used in the past, since this campaign has started I have been using Pro-Health Multi Protection mouthwash every morning and evening before bed</li>
            <li> I have to say after using this product for a little over a month</li>
            <li> For all our effort and investment, we did not expect to be INFLICTING ourselves with dark brown stains!</li>
            <li> I used a little bit just to try out the flavor.</li>
            <li> I was a little alarmed by the reviews I read on amazon regarding brown stains, but I decided to try it anyway.  </li>
            <li> it does feel a bit burny on the tongue, but no more or less than other mouthwashes, and seems to do the trick!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little harsh</li>
            <li> The rest of the Crest is going down the drain!</li>
            <li> My eyes start watering and tears come down my eyes!</li>
            <li> After a couple of days the little red mark stayed but didn&#x27;t get worse.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn as bad others containing alcohol do, but it still leaves my mouth feeling tingly and fresh.</li>
            <li> but it burnt after a few moments..</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few days  </li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few.</li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few.</li>
            <li> It is like a dentist visit in your mouth everyday.</li>
            <li> Trying Crest Pro-Health was the least of what I had expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, my second attempt to use this product was even worse.  </li>
            <li> I see a bunch of reviews that state they were finding stains on their teeth but those reviews were frm a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> but I hate the bad taste left in my mouth , like I can not grab a taste for the food till after having a good time rinsing the mouth</li>
            <li> It doesnt have a harsh burn either.</li>
            <li> I am giving this 4 stars because it did burn for a few rinses.</li>
            <li> Anything that kills the crud growing on your teeth will leave the dead crud as a brownish film on your teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Crest Pro Health for a few days now with no problems</li>
            <li> It was not there when I visited a few months ago.</li>
            <li> Unlike some negative reviews, I noticed absolutely no staining with this rinse.  </li>
            <li> I use it a few times a week in the morning  </li>
            <li> (that&#x27;s how harsh this stuff is).</li>
            <li> Killed my sense of taste, like the tip of my tongue was burned.  </li>
            <li> Within a few weeks, I noticed stains on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks I was noticing brown stains on my teeth and couldn&#x27;t figure out what was going on.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for the last month, approximately when I noticed the stains.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it twice everyday for about two weeks</li>
            <li> and I have one in a few weeks</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few days</li>
            <li> This stains your teeth worse than coffee, tobacco, red wine, and tea combined.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not too harsh like some.</li>
            <li> I had switched to Crest Pro Health mouthwash a few months ago and it started immediately, though I didn&#x27;t put it together myself.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a few people commenting about it changing the color of their teeth</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been using this for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I have been using this mouthwash for a few weeks now.  </li>
            <li> I had used it a year or so ago then switched to another brand because it was on sale at the time, not realizing that I was missing out.  </li>
            <li> and I was very skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> like I was a heavy smoker or something.</li>
            <li> Within a few days, my tongue felt like it was burned.</li>
            <li> (I purchased my locally)&lt;br /&gt;- Not too harsh for my sensitivity</li>
            <li> but figured I would just finish this one since I do not like to waste money.</li>
            <li> so I used it at night after meal time were all over, after a few weeks</li>
            <li> I started using Crest Pro Health for a few days, then I decided to look at reviews</li>
            <li> I very much disliked that sensation, and would put off using mouthwash because of it.</li>
            <li> Just save yourself the trouble and get something else.</li>
            <li> He uses it everyday (without me nagging at him).&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> and I went without mouthwash for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> My dentist would probably slap me for doing so, but yes, I picked it up, took it home and rinsed with it for a few nights.</li>
            <li> CLEANED BECAUSE OF HEAVY STAINING</li>
            <li> I stopped using the product a few days ago.  </li>
            <li> So ive been using this for a few months after my dentist recommended it.</li>
            <li> I have been Crest Pro Health products longer than this though, been using this item for a few years now</li>
            <li> My husband and I testing the #Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection# Mouthwash at the moment, well my husband has been using it for a few years already and sticks with it.</li>
            <li> For me though, through continued use, it leaves my mouth feeling a little raw.</li>
            <li> I would at least like them to not look like they are rotted due to gray/black staining.</li>
            <li> I was highly concerned when I saw all the negative reviews that there must be something wrong with me.  </li>
            <li> Label on the plastic bag that it came in and the advertising in the Amazon web site plainly states &amp;#34;Clear Mint&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> there is no strong achool taste</li>
            <li> The metallic aftertaste, persisting numbness, unpleasant dye-residue, staining and depreciated sense of taste are all present for me after only 3 days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Contrary to the warning on the bottle, these stains ARE NOT easy to get off.  </li>
            <li> My biggest issue is that it gives a very odd aftertaste every time I use</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sold because I couldn&#x27;t believe it could possibly work without the terrible burning other mouthwashes have.</li>
            <li> I was always skeptical of trying new mouthwashes because I never liked the burning medicine taste.  </li>
            <li> After the first day my month/tounge burned bad.</li>
            <li> I usually have trouble with mouthwash burning</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been rinsing twice a day for the past few days along with brushing.</li>
            <li> I had not been to the dentist in a few years and usually I have a cavity or two.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m shoving my face full of crap and then complaining about the sugar-rot like it&#x27;s someone else&#x27;s fault.</li>
            <li> FDA site still does not pull up problem in search so they are evidently not taking this seriously.  </li>
            <li> However, I do not agree with the claim &amp;#34;no burn&amp;#34; and do not enjoy the very harsh burn I experience.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that I had areas of my gums that felt raw.  </li>
            <li> Sure didn&#x27;t have them before, they look bad and make feel uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about you, but that is way too long to have a strange, numb sensation in my mouth.</li>
            <li> After a week or so of using this product I noticed that my teeth were turning gray....and slowly they got darker and darker til they looked almost black.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the other reviews I am a little confused.</li>
            <li> This is ridiculous, that a product that is marketed to help avoid stains and clean the teeth would cause it to look diseased, like I use tobacco!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another disgusting side effect that I&#x27;ve only seen a few people mention is the blue flecks left in my mouth after use.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t worry too much about bad breath with this rinse.</li>
            <li> Ive used this for over a year now and not sure of why they claim it stains teeth</li>
            <li> Usually when after drinking coffee, I would have to refresh my mouth...</li>
            <li> Usually when after drinking coffee, I would have to refresh my mouth...</li>
            <li> For several days, I chalked it up to that &#x27;weird taste&#x27;</li>
            <li> Count this as one more reason why I hate Crest!</li>
            <li> all those nasty comments from on of the top selling products in the marketplace just doesn&#x27;t add up.</li>
            <li> It also made my teeth feel even cleaner than usual after brushing.  </li>
            <li> ill have to buy my next, and every one after that&lt;br /&gt;BECAUSE</li>
            <li> Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34; I have had stains on my teethe either from coffee or soda not really sure which and maybe even both.</li>
            <li> This does not contain alcohol--which I usually prefer but if you want alcohol this isn&#x27;t for you.  </li>
            <li> Not pleased at all.</li>
            <li> (I can usually taste that even if my nose is stuffed up).  </li>
            <li> I think I will stop using it :/</li>
            <li> and I feel like a few people panicked and are now blasting Amazon with negative reviews on this product.</li>
            <li> I called her and found that her dental hygienist had switched her to Crest Pro Health Mouth Wash just a few months ago!.</li>
            <li> However, it does not burn horribly like many mouthwashes I have tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mouthwash exclusively for the past month.</li>
            <li> I am not sure I would buy it again over Listerine.  </li>
            <li> Usually after brushing my teeth, it burns just to drink a glass of semi-cold water...</li>
            <li> So, when I noticed these small brown spots at my bottom gumline, I could not imagine what it could be from.  </li>
            <li> Left me with random brown spots in my teeth</li>
            <li> For the past week I have used the rinse morning and night after brushing and flossing.</li>
            <li> There is no burning sensation like you get using a mouth wash that includes alcohol in it, which would make me hesitant to gargle in the past.</li>
            <li> tried!I receive this from Crest and BzzAgent, but had used it in the past.</li>
            <li> I have been having problems with staining of my teeth over the past 6 months despite brushing and flossing.</li>
            <li> Not sure how I am going to get rid of these stains.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what in it would even make your teeth brown in color, maybe something they&#x27;re doing in combination with it.</li>
            <li> As usual, I can always trust a Crest product.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d always choose this mouthwash out of all the others out there on the market.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure what that is all about.</li>
            <li> No more Crest products in this household.</li>
            <li> Not sure..</li>
            <li> Not much more to say than that.</li>
            <li> Usually before purchasing a product, I always read reviews in order to come to a conclusion</li>
            <li> First of all the taste is awful, which isn&#x27;t a big factor for me</li>
            <li> I always wondered with all the scientific information at hand why can&#x27;t a tasteless mouthwash be made, natural breath is nicer than flavored breath.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t make it past 10 seconds.</li>
            <li> I have been using it the past month or so and can already see and feel the difference I hoped for.</li>
            <li> AND, it wasn&#x27;t just a small amount.  </li>
            <li> but there is no more slipperyness to my teeth...</li>
            <li> It is unbelievable that this product is still on the market.</li>
            <li> I usually get up, have a cup of coffee and breakfast, and then brush my teeth before I leave for work.  </li>
            <li> I used it for 2 days, a total of 3 times, but it&#x27;s been awful since the first time.  </li>
            <li> It would burn my mouth and was a bit harsh!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if I would buy this product,</li>
            <li> buy a small bottle at the drugstore.  </li>
            <li> She would refuse to rinse her mouth unless it was with one of the kids mouthwash which after research I found contained a lot of sugar...that in my opinion was not okay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pro-Health mouthwash for the past two years.</li>
            <li> Maybe you&#x27;ll have no problems but you&#x27;ve been warned about this unbelievable product, shame on Proctor &amp; Gamble.</li>
            <li> so I know they make it and this false advertising is absolutely no help to me at all.</li>
            <li> I always said that I would never use anything other than a previous brand I was using, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> When this toxic chemical was tested on animals the following symptoms occurred: nasal discharge, respiratory difficulty, weight loss, bloody tears, and inflammation of the iris, cornea and aqueous humor (the fluid part of the eye).</li>
            <li> Well, we brush VERY properly and floss religiously every single day, and yet still got terrible staining!</li>
            <li> I have a bad breath issue and need a high quality product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of the burning from alcohol in other mouthwashs but was a little skeptical of one without the alcohol.  </li>
            <li> It has got some of the yellow stain off my teeth and it doesn&#x27;t burn or foam badly like some of these other mouthwash</li>
            <li> /burning mentioned in other reviews, but this was bad enough.</li>
            <li> It was only then that I found all these other bad reviews.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is the mouthwash that required the user to gargle for at least a min.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what&#x27;s going on with all those negative reviews?</li>
            <li> And unlike Listerine it doesn&#x27;t really burn my mouth, way less painful!</li>
            <li> it keeps your mouth clean and fresh, it gets rid of that disgusting hard to reach plaque behind your teeth that causes bad breath :/</li>
            <li> I just bought a new batch and was shocked to read all the negative comments about teeth turning brown?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleans Hard To Reach Spots</li>
            <li> And my dentist worked hard at getting the stains off, but he didn&#x27;t get it all.</li>
            <li> but I also get a faint licorice taste that I do not particularly like.</li>
            <li> I thought I was brushing too hard</li>
            <li> Even though I drink enough water I was still having issues with a strange and very unpleasant aftertaste developing 30 minutes after use, even after eliminating my morning coffee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to disagree with the negative reviews on here-</li>
            <li> I use this at least once if not twice a day</li>
            <li> I have been using this product twice a day and have not had any negative results.</li>
            <li> Mouthwash can be an effective treatment to protect our mouths from a diversity of health problems but this liquids can also be painful and annoying.</li>
            <li> I do not experience the negative issues of burning at all with this.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t* want to hear the number of people who have complained.</li>
            <li> If I could give this a negative amount of &amp;#34;stars&amp;#34; I would.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give it negative stars.</li>
            <li> I was truly astonished to read all of the negative reviews of this mouth wash.  </li>
            <li> she let me know this is a common problem with the brand.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would give this product negative starts if I could.</li>
            <li> Have used this rinse for at least two years.  </li>
            <li> Almost immediately after using this product, I noticed really ugly brown stains on my teeth - made my teeth look like 100 year old dentures.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to write a negative review unless truly compelled to.  </li>
            <li> I could give this NEGATIVE STARS, I would.</li>
            <li> and it was slightly painful for my sensitive gums.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try and file a complaint, but from hereon, I will NEVER use another Crest product again.  </li>
            <li> My fiance had also complained that his sense of taste was off after using it, but I thought he was imagining it.</li>
            <li> My husband complained about the aftertaste too.</li>
            <li> I have no idea where all the negative reviews are coming from.</li>
            <li> Just tried this product this evening and the after-taste it left was like if someone had sprayed hair spray directly in my mouth - and the worst part is the taste won&#x27;t go away!  </li>
            <li> I was so afraid I would never get it back.</li>
            <li> Still using my Crest mouthwash every day at least two times a day.  </li>
            <li> will update my review if I start to experience any negative results.</li>
            <li> I looked at all the negative reviews on this site and thought, \\&quot;what the h**!?\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> those implying that all the negative reviews are shills or lying, do a google search for \\&quot;crest prohealth loss of taste.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This product sucks.</li>
            <li> I know there are a bunch of negative reviews, but I have not had my teeth stained.</li>
            <li> And there is no effective OTC</li>
            <li> I decided to challenge myself to use this twice a day for at least a month.</li>
            <li> I never really used mouthwash due to hating the burn from the alcohol and the bad taste.</li>
            <li> And this product helps with that everyday!!</li>
            <li> and my throat was swollen out past my chin!</li>
            <li> Then rinse with a SMALL amount!</li>
            <li> All of these \\&quot;features\\&quot; dont mean squat without trust.</li>
            <li> The worst part is that the manufacture admits this significant side effect, but, never put them on the label.</li>
            <li> wait, I mean we WERE.  </li>
            <li> It is very harsh on your mouth environment and does terrible staining that can only be removed by the type of deep cleaning that dentists reserve for smokers.  </li>
            <li> There is a small burn but not as bad as regular mouthwash!</li>
            <li> Same thing and after eating I had a lot of trouble tasting my food. :(</li>
            <li> After diligently using this product for nearly two months, I was shocked and appalled when I noticed brown stains near the gumline of my lower teeth.  </li>
            <li> They told me and others: \\&quot;[staining] is reported by a very small percentage of people.</li>
            <li> Maybe the enamel the outer coating is staining and since I have little to none mine does not really stain as bad?</li>
            <li> I find that I actually use it on a regular basis because I don&#x27;t dread the terrible burn that I associate with mouthwashes.</li>
            <li> and tried cutting back, but it got worse.  </li>
            <li> This product has a subtle mint taste, that doesn&#x27;t stick around.</li>
            <li> It actually doesn&#x27;t mean that the mouthwash is bad for you.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel clean without leaving a film behind or a nasty aftertaste.</li>
            <li> I hope you have the fortune of reading these reviews prior to making this unnecessarily bad life experience...</li>
            <li> I use it in the morning and at night and have noticed it is constantly fighting bad breath</li>
            <li> I awoke in the middle of the night because my gums were burning so badly.  </li>
            <li> Finally I saw online that Crest was known to be bad for your health</li>
            <li> When products burn, the actual usage decreases as bad breath increases...</li>
            <li> After finishing the second bottle, my wife said it looked like some of my teeth were rotting because they were stained so badly.</li>
            <li> The un waxed floss is not for the faint of heart and will take a few weeks to get used to.  </li>
            <li> Crest mouthwash might work, but the awful side effects aren&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
            <li> Her hygienist is going to be shocked since the last time my daughter was there</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not good.</li>
            <li> Just came back from the dentist, they were literally shocked looking at my teeth.</li>
            <li> NOT fair to consumers</li>
            <li> This stuff left ugly brown stains all over my teeth.  </li>
            <li> It leaves a nasty after taste in my mouth instead of a fresh feeling.  </li>
            <li> I feel like this product has been falsely targeted for negative reviews.</li>
            <li> Not pleasant.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers here have reported, this product caused nasty brown stains on my teeth that could not be brushed away.</li>
            <li> I would never use mouth wash because of the harsh burn and the nasty after taste it left in my mouth, but this product is my holy grail.</li>
            <li> There are worse things I&#x27;ve had to deal with.  </li>
            <li> Worse, I realized I couldn&#x27;t taste anything.  </li>
            <li> I have read a lot of criticism about some of the products on this list but, they seem to be from people who have poor dental hygiene.  </li>
            <li> the use the worse the stains can become.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any of the adverse effects that others mentioned.</li>
            <li> i however have not experienced the brown teeth</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any of this.</li>
            <li> I just got done brushing and will poor out the rest of this product.</li>
            <li> I do know that it hasn&#x27;t made anything any worse</li>
            <li> My situation could have been much worse had a followed</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be using it again to find out if it gets worse</li>
            <li> Crest and bzzagent are both attempting to game Amazon&#x27;s rating systems to trick you into making a misinformed purchase.</li>
            <li> so it doesnt burn as bad as other mouth washes but it did make my eyes water a bit.</li>
            <li> I personally haven&#x27;t had anything bad happen to my teeth (like some of these awful reviews), but I think it&#x27;s no better then any other mouth wash.</li>
            <li> After reading these reviews i was very skeptical and afraid of the same thing happening to me.</li>
            <li> It is strong, but not as bad - or awful - as Listerine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to use Listerine mouthwash occasionally because of the alcohol burn was very unpleasant</li>
            <li> No more uncomfortable burn after I use mouthwash!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any of the nasty side effects that other people have talked about (stains on teeth, trouble with taste buds).</li>
            <li> If you have trouble with gum health or bad breath</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it every time I brush because I feel like it dries my mouth out and leaves a stale taste behind.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had a problem getting my teen to use mouthwash because he hated the taste.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend was also using it, and unfortunately, fared much worse.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what is going on with these bad reviews.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE GASTRITIS, stay away from these products they&#x27;re apparently poison...</li>
            <li> I lasted 4 days and could not take the effects of this crap anymore and dumped it down the drain.</li>
            <li> I thought I must be getting sick, but thought it was weird that a cold would influence salt and sour</li>
            <li> I have to say that I was skeptical of this mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I thought something was wrong with them, but then discovered the pickles didn&#x27;t taste salty either.  </li>
            <li> last year my teeth were HORRIBLY stained.  </li>
            <li> The fact that these people sell oral hygiene products that STAIN YOUR TEETH is absolutely absurd and reprehensible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using only 1/2 of a bottle of this horrible concoction, every tooth was stained, and I had to have my teeth cleaned with a baking soda blaster at the dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this stained my bottom row of teeth brownish.  </li>
            <li> fortunately an expensive dental cleansing visit got the stains off.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;About one month into use I noticed a weird stain in between two of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to have to just wait for my mouth to heal itself, but seriously, wtf Crest...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M NOT HAPPY CREST!</li>
            <li> used it once at night time then again in the morning and thats when my tongue started feeling a bit weird</li>
            <li> This product left an awful taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I noticed it on the bottle and assumed it meant white stains, and figured that since it wasn&#x27;t permanent it wasn&#x27;t too terrible of a side effect.  </li>
            <li> I also think crest is so expensive.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I will never use this mouthwash again.</li>
            <li> I was not sure what the Crest Pro-Health Multi Protection mouthwash would taste of feel like, since in the past I have had some terrible memories of the way mouthwash would leave a burning feeling in my mouth after rising.  </li>
            <li> Also, not all of the staining could be removed unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> I am angry as a result.</li>
            <li> Ill keep an eye out on the reviews to see whats going on with it.</li>
            <li> It did the job, but left an awful taste when I was done.</li>
            <li> so weird</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a truly frightening product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel a weird film on my teeth afterwards.</li>
            <li> I started using this product about 6 weeks ago -- and within a week started experiencing a horrible metallic taste in my mouth continously and food tastes differently.  </li>
            <li> It sounds silly, but never underestimate the power of word of mouth.</li>
            <li> WRONG.</li>
            <li> Sadly, will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> We are a family of questionable breath....</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t care for this product it left my tongue numb and a nasty after taste.</li>
            <li> though I&#x27;ve never experienced it so badly), I did not think anything of it.</li>
            <li> I finished my other mouthwash and started using this terrible stuff exclusively.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was because of horrible brown stains that had appeared between my teeth where the teeth touch each other.</li>
            <li> Personally I think it does everything it says it will, like fighting gingivitis and killing all those nasty bad breath germs.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash doesn&#x27;t leave that nasty alcohol taste in your mouth like other mouthwashes do!</li>
            <li> have tried using a scaler, hydrogen peroxide, brushing hard (bad for gums and teeth!)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make anything you drink after taste awful, we&#x27;ve all been there before, when you can&#x27;t even drink water without it tasting odd.</li>
            <li> Use hydrogen peroxide to rinse if you are afraid of getting oral cancer.</li>
            <li> and I always feel like they look dirty</li>
            <li> Not just numb, but severe metallic taste</li>
            <li> When ever I wash my mouth, my tongue feels like it was burned and feeling numb.</li>
            <li> Also my tongue was feeling numb.</li>
            <li> , you may not like the burning Alcohol used in Mouthwash, but I prefer that over a burned and numb tongue.</li>
            <li> and he looked at me like I was crazy.</li>
            <li> It does contain artificial sweeteners, which I avoid in products.</li>
            <li> My tongue goes slightly numb, and I have the earwax-y taste in my mouth for upwards of 3 hours after washing.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I DO NOT recommend this product!</li>
            <li> and it was even worse!!  </li>
            <li> I am SO mad.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Mouthwash cleans up what my toothpaste leaves behind and lasts longer!!</li>
            <li> you can not go wrong!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really mad.</li>
            <li> Not only does the chemical flavor remain, but the mouthwash burns like acid even for hours after use, and worst of all, it destroys your tastebuds and leaves a sickening metallic flavor in your mouth...for days.  </li>
            <li> The minty taste lingered for hours, but it wasn&#x27;t unpleasant</li>
            <li> I feel it works as promised but just leaves an unpleasant aftertaste in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> There is something VERY wrong with this product.  </li>
            <li> Be very wary when using this mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I thought I had some type of poisoning, was literally sick (bad diarrhea) besides the fact that my mouth was numb, swollen, I was drooling.  </li>
            <li> Some foods merely taste blander than they should, while others react very poorly with the \\&quot;licking a battery\\&quot; flavor that still lingers in my mouth and taste downright awful.  </li>
            <li> The worst factor of this product is that after rinsing, it will leave a horrible after taste in our mouth and also it will ruin your taste buds for a long period of time causing everything you eat to be tasteless and unappetizing.</li>
            <li> bad breath and kills germs.</li>
            <li> and I always use a mouthwash to reduce plaque and kill the bacteria that cause bad breath.</li>
            <li> It helps prevent and reduce plaque buildup, fight bad breath and keeps teeth cleaner longer than brushing alone.</li>
            <li> It fights bad breath and kills germs and it keeps teeth cleaner longer (vs. brushing alone).</li>
            <li> I have never been a fan of mouth wash because I felt that it burns really bad.</li>
            <li> bad breath and kills germs</li>
            <li> It kills 99% germs, and fights against plaque, gingivitis and bad breath.</li>
            <li> Mine has not been too bad but upgraded to med bristle tooth brush and never just use this product alone</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my breath isn&#x27;t as bad as normal(I smoke cigarettes and have allergies really bad this time of the year).</li>
            <li> I have never had a side effect from any product, but I used this mouthwash for about 3 days and got a bad chemical burn on my tongue.</li>
            <li> I have had really bad tarter build up until using this product.</li>
            <li> I see a ton of bad reviews on this rinse.  </li>
            <li> Maybe you won&#x27;t be one of the people who has a bad reaction, but why take the chance?</li>
            <li> This is a high-quality product and I am convinced that I am getting  protection against plaque, gingivitis and bad breath, all while killing germs and keeping my teeth cleaner longer.</li>
            <li> That is how badly this product stained my teeth.</li>
            <li> Because that&#x27;s how bad</li>
            <li> AND I HAVE NOT NOTICE ANYTHING BAD</li>
            <li> Fight bad breath  </li>
            <li> BAD  </li>
            <li> My morning breath isn&#x27;t as bad as it was before and my mouth feels cleaner throughout the day.i</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> I went to the dentist this morning for a cleaning and the hygenist told me she&#x27;s never seen staining that bad on my teeth.</li>
            <li> As a rule I never write bad stuff on products that I do not like.</li>
            <li> If you do not mind your mouth burning all day and food tasting bad</li>
            <li> Then my lips chapped so bad that no amount of chapstick can fix.</li>
            <li> but I just couldn&#x27;t use it anymore since reading the bad reviews.</li>
            <li> you to a healthier mouth from day one*Fights bad breath and kills germsKeeps</li>
            <li> patients that my breath is bad.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think this product was that bad</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t too bad</li>
            <li> This product stained my teeth so badly that my dentist and orthodontist both asked me if I&#x27;d taken up smoking.  </li>
            <li> I like the freshness and it keeps hubby bad breath in check.</li>
            <li> , that doesn&#x27;t cause painful blisters to appear in my mouth</li>
            <li> i hate the crazy burning sensation that i get from mouth washes that does have alcohol in it and for the taste</li>
            <li> Her cheeks became swollen and also painful to the touch, and the swelling then continued up her jaw and to her ear.</li>
            <li> I was so frustrated about what was causing my teeth to stain and today I found out that this piece of sh!t is causing this.</li>
            <li> Sounds like you all have been getting repackaged turpentine from Asia... : (</li>
            <li> Crest, I&#x27;m so disappointed in you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a bit disappointed in this product from Crest.</li>
            <li> Some of them irritate my gums and leave me disappointed.</li>
            <li> Dissatisfied and disappointed    </li>
            <li> I got so desperate I googled \\&quot;teeth suddently turning brown\\&quot; &amp; look what turned up!  </li>
            <li> And something I hate about ALL mouthwashes - the artificial coloring!</li>
            <li> Very disappointing company.</li>
            <li> Wrong!!</li>
            <li> I really Hate this size but like  the product.</li>
            <li> It made my lower set of teeth brown as crap.</li>
            <li> I have always used mouthwash products that have an alcohol base and sting, as it seemed that was proof that it worked.</li>
            <li> My teeth didn&#x27;t get that annoying fuzzy feeling.</li>
            <li> Food tasted awful and the burning numb feeling lasted all day.</li>
            <li> I noticed brown at the side and base around the gum area on one tooth.</li>
            <li> I am so appalled</li>
            <li> the rest out there burn my mouth and taste like crap.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed and mad about this product, it should be recall from the market.</li>
            <li> Plus, it tastes bad and leaves a nasty after taste.</li>
            <li> Kills bad breath in a zap!</li>
            <li> I never would have thought something that is THIS consistently bad would still be on the market, but here it is!  </li>
            <li> and I stopped using it because of all the bad reviews it was getting about it staining your teeth!</li>
            <li> I felt a cleaner mouth ,fights bad breath, kills germs, keeps teeth cleaner longer !</li>
            <li> If you had a bad experience, tell someone!</li>
            <li> I was shocked!</li>
            <li> was seriously shocked!</li>
            <li> I bought the mouthwash without reading reviews on Amazon, terrible and tragic mistake.</li>
            <li> I hated the alcohol in a lot of the mouthwashes I had tried previously.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s horrifying and embarrassing.  </li>
            <li> I have not had the pleasure of experiencing the staining, but I did hear from my dental hygienist that this does in fact have the tendency to stain teeth very badly.</li>
            <li> Very bad product.</li>
            <li> YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed to.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s insane!</li>
            <li> This stuff has to be the WORST mouthwash I have ever used.</li>
            <li> But, It is terrible to leave brown stain on my teeth.</li>
            <li> Worst Mouthwash ever!</li>
            <li> This is literally the worst product I&#x27;ve ever used in my life.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shocking this is still on the market.</li>
            <li> Terrible product.</li>
            <li> This is just terrible.</li>
            <li> This is a TERRIBLE product.</li>
            <li> Horrible product!</li>
            <li> I have to admit that when it comes to my oral hygiene (because there&#x27;s an awful lot of $$ in my mouth!)</li>
            <li> This product is awful!!  </li>
            <li> Tried a pinch of salt on the tongue after and tasted like nothing I have ever had (terrible by the way).</li>
            <li> Stained my teeth something awful.  </li>
            <li> Worst garbage ever!!!  </li>
            <li> This is disgusting!  </li>
            <li> This is dangerous stuff!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Terrible product, I am boycotting crest and going with colgate.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the worst mouthwash I have ever tried</li>
            <li> I noticed horrible stains all over my teeth.</li>
            <li> but no, it was just horrible staining</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not the worst either.</li>
            <li> , I have no shame in admitting that even on sale this was probably one of the worst purchases of my life, if not the worst.</li>
            <li> After rinsing, it leaves a lot of gooey residue inside your mouth which can be very disgusting.</li>
            <li> With this product, your mouth won&#x27;t know the difference between nasty health food and tasty junk food.    </li>
            <li> -- I don&#x27;t know what chemical they are using, but it will ruin your taste buds and leave a horrible taste in your mouth 24/7!</li>
            <li> The worst side-effect is horrible breath.  </li>
            <li> Horrible product.</li>
            <li> I wanna r@pe who ever created this crap!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a terrible product.</li>
            <li> this junk is just horrible.  </li>
            <li> Maybe not all but the unlucky consumers, like me, may find horrible browns spots on their teeth after using this product.</li>
            <li> Horrible product.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I decided to try this because it was alcohol free. After the first couple days of use, actually after the first day, using Crest I noticed a strong metallic taste in my mouth and on my breath that lasted all day. This product left the strong bitter taste in my mouth  making everything I eat or drank just taste bad… I&#x27;m going back to Act. The rest of the Crest is going down the drain!</li>
            <li> This is by far the only mouthwash I will ever use. Their is no burn with this and my mouth just feels clean and fresh for hours! I received this #Free to test #crestPro-Health #BzzAgent</li>
            <li> I tried Crest Pro -health for the first time few days ago and instantly became a fan! Other brands that I have used prior to this product would usually leave strong burn in my mouth(even alcohol free). But this product does the opposite. ..leaves cool ,fresh feeling after each rinse. My 13 year old loved Crest Pro-Health as well. Buy it, try it -YOU&#x27;LL LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> My famy and I have been using this everyday and can really feel it working. I would recommend this to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> I love this mouthwash! It has a taste of mint and it didn&#x27;t burn at all, my mouth felt fresh all day and my breath smelled fantastic. I use this every morning now. The first mouthwash I used really burned my mouth so bad that I had to add water to the bottle. I&#x27;m so glad that I switched to crest, my mouth feels so much healthier, and less abused.</li>
            <li> I received this to try out and I am glad I did!  The Clean Mint flavor is the best I have ever used.  I usually shy away from this flavor because the mint is too strong but not with this one!  It is not an overload like most mouthwashes are.  The clean feeling my mouth has after use doesn&#x27;t go away right away.  It stays fresher for a longer period of time.  There is no &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34; like with most mouthwashes.  My teeth did feel sore after the first few uses but I think it was just because they were getting the cleaning they needed and had not received for quite awhile!  I would definitely recommend this to my friends and family (in fact I already have ;-) )</li>
            <li> If you like brown stains in between your teeth then this mouthwash is perfect for you! Lmao last time I checked mouthwash was supposed to clean your teeth.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of this product. I use this product constantly and it really works. There is no burn of alchohol either. The mouthwash leaves my mouth fresh for several hours and goes great with most toothpastes. I am doing this for the purpose of review for BZZAGENT, and though  i&#x27;m happy with the result .Thank You BZZAGENT</li>
            <li> I received the product for free to try out. I am so glad i got to try this mouth wash! I love it. My mouth feels cleaner and fresher.</li>
            <li> Bzzagent here. works well, doesn&#x27;t burn. last for hours, not 24 hours. Listerine would be a better choice if you have gum problems. I received the product as part of a promotion from Crest.</li>
            <li> i received this product from crest by bzzagent for free in return for review. and this is really worth it i like that its alcohol free and does not burn your mouth. it keeps my teeth feeling refreshed all day and Moves you to a healthier mouth from day one&lt;br /&gt;Fights bad breath and kills germs.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Ive used this for over a year now and not sure of why they claim it stains teeth - I&#x27;ve never had that problem but I do use every few months an occasional whitening strip but thats cause I drink a lot of coffee - I&#x27;ve had problems before and ever since I used this I&#x27;ve had 3 clean checkups so I will always use this product. Please don&#x27;t change it - my healthy mouth thanks you lol!!! :)</li>
            <li> We received this product #free and from the first use you can feel the difference with Crest Pro. Your mouth feel so clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Bzzagent here, I like the taste of this mouth wash and how it doesn&#x27;t burn. It doesn&#x27;t last up to 24 hours, but does last longer then other mouth washes I have used in the past. Overall I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Very impressed and satisfied with this product.  I got the privilege to sample for free from Bzzagent.  Thank u. Now at home this is the product were using for better healthier teeth and good smelling breath...</li>
            <li> I recently received this for free from Crest through buzzagent, i was so excited to give this product a try. When i first opened the bottle the smell was pleasant but not too strong, which is what I&#x27;m not usually use to. I have been using it for this last past week and  I don&#x27;t have any complaints so far, except that i read the labels and it said it could &amp;#34;possibly&amp;#34; cause staining on your teeth. This mouthwash does not have the same feeling as other mouthwashes on the market, it is a lot more subtle with a very slight &amp;#34;tingling&amp;#34; feeling which is a plus if you don&#x27;t like strong mouthwash. Other than that it has been kept my breath smelling fresh for hours. For now I&#x27;m going to keep using this mouthwash and will update my review if need be but overall I&#x27;m satisfied so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of different mouth washes over the course of years. I don&#x27;t really taste a difference between them all, and they all seem to work well. I hate that alcohol burn from mouth wash, so luckily this one was pretty smooth, but makes your mouth feel and smell minty clean. I&#x27;m happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what is going on with these bad reviews. My husband and me buy it at&lt;br /&gt;Costco in a 2 pack. We both really like this mouth wash and never had any issues with it. It seems to clean my teeth very well.</li>
            <li> as described, shipped on time</li>
            <li> I received this as a free sample from bzzagent. I thought it worked but it burnt after a few moments..it made my mouth and teeth feel clean and fresh and it lasted for hours.</li>
            <li> I do not like the taste.I only used it once.I did not like it at all.I dont like the burn effect or the medicial taste.I did get it free and was excited to try it.</li>
            <li> I have to disagree with the negative reviews on here- although I generally don&#x27;t use the Crest line up, I received a bottle of crest pro health mouth wash through BzzAgent and am very impressed. I noticed my mouth feels fresher longer, the taste is better than most available mouthwashes on the market, and my entire mouth feels cleaner after using. Highly recommend a second look</li>
            <li> I received this as a promotion with Crest and I don&#x27;t know that I would buy it on my own. I miss that burning, sparkly clean feeling that I get with alcohol-based washes. Maybe it is all in my head, but I associate the burn with a clean, germ-free mouth. It also left a bitter taste in my mouth that lingered for quite some time. And something I hate about ALL mouthwashes - the artificial coloring!</li>
            <li> i am so thankful for smiley360 for letting me have a chance to try this out for free. this has been the best mouthwash i have ever used. i will never use anything else.</li>
            <li> My family has been using this mouthwash for the past couple weeks all thanks to the free sample we received from Crest. I love using Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection Mouthwash!!! Not only does it keep my breath fresh during the day but it also keeps my teeth healthy!! I always feel like my mouth is clean and teeth are nice and bright. My family feels the same and my spouse has mentioned how one&#x27;s breath feels continually fresh between brushings. The flavor is great and my family agrees that this is now our go-to mouthwash!!</li>
            <li> I recieved a bottle of crest pro-health from Smiley360 for free product testing.  It is a pretty good mouthwash. Does not burn your mouth, leaves your mouth feeling clean, fairly tasty sweet mint flavor</li>
            <li> My husband and I LOVE this mouthwash. No burn but It makes your mouth feel fresh with that &amp;#34;just brushed your teeth feel&amp;#34; I use this multiple times a day and was SO EXCITED TO TRY IT FOR FREE THANKS TO CREST!! It Fights bad breath and (you can feel it) kills germs!!  Keeps teeth cleaner longer and Helps improve your dental check-ups  by fighting plaque and gingivitis (We will see in January!)  I really enjoyed using this!</li>
            <li> I received this  product free for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried this mouthwash and I love it. It is not as strong as most mouthwashes. I can actually use this mouthwash without my mouth being on fire. As I was reviewing the other reviews, I noticed a lot of people indicated this product stains their teeth. I have yet to experience this issue. I love Crest products and have been using them for years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy on the mouth &amp; not strong to the point where it burns. Leaves your mouth feeling clean &amp; refreshed. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I am reading that a lot of people are having problems with this mouthwash staining their teeth. I have not had any issues with it at all. I have been using crest mouthwash for a long time and I think it works great. I especially like the alcohol free kind.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-health mult-protection mouthwash kept my breath fresh and clean longer than the other mouthwashes. It do not have the burn of alcohol.  I am completely satisfied using crest pro-Heath multi-protection mouthwash. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I have been using Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Rinse for three weeks now and I&#x27;m very happy with this product. My mouth never feels fully clean after brushing alone and I always use a mouthwash to reduce plaque and kill the bacteria that cause bad breath. Unlike other well-known brands of mouthwash, this product from Crest does not burn your mouth. It&#x27;s alcohol free and makes for a much more pleasant rinsing experience. I use this at least once if not twice a day and I will be a repeat customer. Thank you Crest for making a quality product. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying Crest-Pro Health as part of #BzzAgent survey #IGotItFree. I am extremely satisfied with Crest. I have a condition in my mouth called Pemphigus Vulgaris a very rare skin blistering disease. Currently I do not have but a few blisters in mouth. However, any other mouthwash i have tried left me screaming in pain. I have noticed fresher breath, no nasty film on my teeth, definitely my mouth feels CLEAN! Let&#x27;s see what dentist says in two weeks.</li>
            <li> I love this mouthwash! It left my breath feeling fresh all day. It doesn&#x27;t have alcohol which I love because it doesn&#x27;t burn when I use it.

This mouthwash is the BEST I have tried in quite I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opsome time. I have tried quite a few. I do know they have a Night time one, but after brushing my teeth for the night, I used the mouthwash also. To awake with a fresh mouth is refreshing. I brushed and floss that morning, and then use the mouthwash. Usually when after drinking coffee, I would have to refresh my mouth...NOT after use of the mouthwash. I am really please with my purchase, and will continue to buy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review, opinions are 100% my own!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mouthwash is the BEST I have tried in quite some time.

I love this mouthwash. My holly Grail from light till moon 🌙. It keeps my teeth withe and cleaner then ever. Kills bad breath in a zap! Must try must buy!? Makes ya teeth whiter they feel so much cleaner like I am not joking its on my experience with this product and I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 2months now and I have had no problems not bad burning with this products. Leaves your breath feeling cool doesn&#x27;t have a bad taste I like it and if ya brush well before using it won&#x27;t burn so much like most say it those trust me! It is like a dentist visit in your mouth everyday. It&#x27;s healthy for you and it feels great doing it by the comfort of ones home. I am not the one to exaggerate but it has done wonders for my teeth I&#x27;m in love with it and will be repurchasing again!</li>
            <li> I really like this brand of mouth wash.I have been a long time user of the crest line and thought this was a nice addition to the product line. I did receive this as a free product to review through bzzagent. I liked the refreshing feel and it did not burn at all. It was refreshing and the mint taste did last for awhile.</li>
            <li> I am shouting to the roof tops the excellent things about Crest Pro Health Multi Protection mouthwash! Besides how wonderful this product makes my mouth feel, it is also healthy for my mouth too! It moves you to a healthier mouth from day one. It fights bad breath and kills germs and it keeps teeth cleaner longer (vs. brushing alone). I love the way this product helps improve your dental check-ups, by fighting plaque and gingivitis. Highly recommend. I was graciously able to try this product for free thanks to Crest.</li>
            <li> I recently had my wisdom teeth removed, and after a week my dentist told me to start rinsing with half-water, half-mouthwash.  Typically, I use Listerine--I know it&#x27;s pretty harsh for most people, but I&#x27;ve always kind of liked it.  However, this time around I figured maybe that burning sensation wouldn&#x27;t be such a good idea on tender gums, so I tried this stuff.  The aftertaste immediately turned me off.  It has that same sort of clinging-to-the-back-of-your-mouth stickiness that Scope does, but I decided to stick with it.  There are worse things I&#x27;ve had to deal with.  But THEN I started having issues with a strange sort of numbness on my tongue.  It&#x27;s hard to describe.  It was JUST on the other side of being a burning sensation, as though I&#x27;d spread benzocaine all over it.  Worse, I realized I couldn&#x27;t taste anything.  For several days, I chalked it up to that &#x27;weird taste&#x27; people describe when their tooth extraction sites are healing, despite the fact that I&#x27;ve been staying right on top of my oral hygiene.  But there was still a nagging suspicion that the mouthwash was to blame, and sure enough, after a quick online search I discovered there are a TON of people who&#x27;ve had adverse reactions to the stuff.  Researching mouthwash is not one of those things I would have ever thought to do.  It seems pretty straightforward: you swish it around your mouth for a bit, spit it out, good to go.  I never would have thought something that is THIS consistently bad would still be on the market, but here it is!  Luckily, I didn&#x27;t experience the tooth staining, but losing my sense of taste for several days was quite enough.  Count this as one more reason why I hate Crest!</li>
            <li> Does it&#x27;s job and more it&#x27;s perfect and cleans really well</li>
            <li> I got this to try for free from smiley360 but my opinions are my own. I was surprised how good and and well this mouth wash was. I really liked that it was not to strong so I was able to swish around my mouth without it burning and that&#x27;s a big plus for me because I can never finish with the other brands it burns to much so I stop using it. It worked very well on keeping my mouth feeling fresh and clean. I liked the added protection I got from it then just brushing my teeth. It was a winning product fro me and mu family because we are all using it. I&#x27;m glad I got to try it and will be continuing to use it for many years to come.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying crest pro health free thanks to crest, and I was super excited to be able to try it! I personally haven&#x27;t had anything bad happen to my teeth (like some of these awful reviews), but I think it&#x27;s no better then any other mouth wash. It leaves my mouth feelin really clean, it does a pretty good job at keeping bad breathe at bay, but I haven&#x27;t really seen any noticeable changes in my tooth appearance. It also has a pretty good taste to it, but overall it is no better then my regular brand!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay product. Not the best mouthwash I&#x27;ve ever used but certainly not the worst. I don&#x27;t like alcohol free mouthwashes and this is a bit over priced for my liking.</li>
            <li> My best friend is in his final year as a dental student.  He recommended to me these following products:    1.  Crest Pro-Health Whitening Toothpaste, 4.2-Ounce Carton (Pack of 6),   2.  ACT Restoring Mouthwash, Cool Splash Mint, 18-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 4)   3.  Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection Alcohol Free Clear/Clean Mint, 1-liter Bottles (Pack of 3).    4.  Reach unwaxed dental floss by Johnson &amp; Johnson  5.  Oral-B Triumph Professional Care Electric Toothbrush.   This is the regiment he advised me to follow:  1. Use the toothpaste morning and evening.  2. Use the Act mouthwash in the morning because it has a really potent amount of fluoride in it and it&#x27;s the best time of day for using fluoride.  3. Use the Crest mouthwash at night because it has a protective film it leaves on your teeth to prevent plaque from building at night.  4. Use the Un Waxed floss once per day at night prior to the mouthwash.  The un waxed floss scrubs the teeth way better than waxed floss and especially better than Glide.  The reason is the Glide \\&quot;glides\\&quot; right past the plaque and food build up leaving the teeth unclean.  The un waxed floss is not for the faint of heart and will take a few weeks to get used to.  It is harder to use because it \\&quot;grips\\&quot; the teeth and you do have to use a sawing left to right motion to get it between some close teeth.  But, it&#x27;s way worth the effort.  After months of using the un waxed, I don&#x27;t even think about it!  5. I used to use the Sonicare for years but my friend convinced me that the Oral-B Triumph cleans better and it does if you do the research.  This model also has a handy 4 stage 30 second prompt so you don&#x27;t have to wonder \\&quot;did I brush good enough\\&quot;. It tells you when you are done!  CONCLUSION:  My dentist friend says that if you follow this routine, you will probably never have a cavity again!    I have read a lot of criticism about some of the products on this list but, they seem to be from people who have poor dental hygiene.  I use the tooth paste with the electric toothbrush on high and have had no problems whatever.  My teeth are clean and gums healthy.  Once you get through \\&quot;the tunnel\\&quot; using this type of regiment, your gums will never bleed and you will have great oral care!  I wish you happy, healthy teeth!</li>
            <li> Hey, just wanted to let you all know that I have been using crest pro health mouthwash now for years. I needed a mouthwash to help with mild gingivitis and I can&#x27;t stand Listerine. Since I started using it I haven&#x27;t had any gingivitis and my teeth have been in excellent shape. The idea that this mouthwash could \\&quot;leave\\&quot; stains is ludicrous.  I feel like this product has been falsely targeted for negative reviews. I wouldn&#x27;t advise ordering something like this online, but I pick up a new bottle at target every couple months. My only complaint is that lately I haven&#x27;t been able to find the clear kind, but the blue kind is just about as good.  As a side note, I looked into their FDA submission and they had to do extensive testing on this due to how it is marketed. I would trust any bottle with the seal in tact that you purchased from a reputable store. Sounds like you all have been getting repackaged turpentine from Asia... : (</li>
            <li> I got this product free from BzzAgent to try and I&#x27;ve really enjoyed it. Even though it&#x27;s alcohol free it does have a slight burn initially, but I didn&#x27;t mind that. I felt like my mouth felt fresher and clean after using. I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> I got to test Crest Pro Health Mouthwash for free from # BzzAgent and Crest. I love how it is alcohol free so my 3 year old can use it now, and learn how important having great oral hygiene is. No burning feeling. Super fresh mouth. And great taste!</li>
            <li> I recently got braces and was given the usual instruction brush after every meal, floss and rinse.  I was shopping around for a mouthwash came across this Crest Pro health I though it was a pretty neat mouthwash since it didn&#x27;t have the alcohol burn.  After using it for about a month I wish I had the burn and not the brown stains on my teeth.  I started noticing brown stains on my teeth but blamed it on the coffee I stopped drinking coffee and the stains persisted. The only thing I&#x27;ve done different is rinse with this mouthwash and after reading all the \\&quot;brown stain\\&quot; comments on here I can confirm that I am a victim of Crest&#x27;s brown stains.  I read the back of the bottle and it does say some surface staining may occur, I assumed they were referring to blue stains (from the dye) but nope it&#x27;s brown stains. After brushing with an electric toothbrush some of the stains have come off but others haven&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s insane! They even have to nerve to write on the back of the bottle \\&quot;Surface staining  is not permanent or harmful , and may be prevented by adequate brushing or removed at your next dental visit\\&quot;  I know my dentist will be able to remove the stains! but he won&#x27;t do it for free!  I&#x27;m beyond upset.  I think one of the reason we all brush our teeth, floss and rinse is to have a healthy White smile. It kinda defeats the purpose of brushing, flossing and rising if the outcome will be brown stains. I regret not doing my research on this mouthwash before buying it.  First and last time I ever buy anything from Crest.  Hopefully the stains come off.  Does anyone have any suggestions on what to do next? Do I write them a letter, email? call?  will I refunded what I paid for the mouthwash? Can they cover the cost of my dentist to remove the stains?  any advice will be greatly appreciated  please please stay away from Crest Pro health</li>
            <li> This stuff has to be the WORST mouthwash I have ever used. I used it for two days (morning and evening). After the first use, I noted some loss in taste and thought that I had eaten too soon after using the rinse. After day two I awoke in pain. Not only was my tongue swollen, but it felt like it was on fire. I skipped the mouth wash, and when I ate breakfast I noticed my sense of taste was still dulled. It has been two days now since I&#x27;ve stopped using this product, and I&#x27;m still having some swelling, taste has not fully recovered, and I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s from a mouthwash! Keep in mind, I only used it for 2 days! I have not had the pleasure of experiencing the staining, but I did hear from my dental hygienist that this does in fact have the tendency to stain teeth very badly. I&#x27;d recommend skipping this at all costs, and picking a different alcohol free mouthwash. I hope you have the fortune of reading these reviews prior to making this unnecessarily bad life experience...</li>
            <li> I just bought a new batch and was shocked to read all the negative comments about teeth turning brown?  I have no issues......does it make sense that Crest probably the biggest name in toothpaste and dental care would have this product on virtually every grocery store and drug store shelf in the USA and it turns your teeth brown?  Something smells here.  Maybe an odd comment here and there but all those nasty comments from on of the top selling products in the marketplace just doesn&#x27;t add up. I am very happy with the product as are the members of may family.</li>
            <li> Cool.  Brown stains in between my teeth.  Thanks Crest.  Now I have to shell out money for trip to the dentist.  Hopefully they can remove the stains.  Please inform me if a class action lawsuit happens.</li>
            <li> I received Crest Pro Health Multi Protection mouthwash free to try from Buzzagent. I have to say that i love this product despite all the negative comments about the mouthwash. I have great a great experience with this mouthwash. I use it 2x a day as directed and my mouth feels cleaner and happier. Iam happy that i have not experienced any of these bad side effects. I absolutely recommend this mouthwash to use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I have been using Crest Pro-Health mouthwash for two years and I LOVE IT. I haven&#x27;t had a cavity since I started using it and that is amazing for me. The thing I like most about this mouthwash is that I actually feel like it leaves a protective barrier on my gums that will last for hours. My husband doesn&#x27;t like this about the product, but I LOVE it. I can tell that it is actually doing something! My last bottle #GotItFree was a bonus from Crest and I wanted to make sure to thank the company. This review is my honest opinion. I really do use this product and it really has helped me have a healthier mouth!</li>
            <li> I love Crest Pro Health products.  I have been using them for years and this mouth wash is no exception.  It leaves my mouth clean and fresh and fighting plaque all at once.  What more could you ask for.  It doesn&#x27;t sting my mouth cause it&#x27;s alcohol free.  It keep my teeth cleaner longer during the day and My mouth is happier, I love it.  I&#x27;m trying the product for free thanks to Crest.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample for testing and review and I love this mouthwash..Leaves my mouth feeling clean and refreshed...will definately buy in the future</li>
            <li> Love this mouthwash really gets your teeth clean w.o the burn.</li>
            <li> I am a member of buzzagent and recieved this product to try and so i would say that this is a great product. I really enjoy this next to Listerine for the most part. When there are most days where i don&#x27;t want feel the intense burn from Listerine I&#x27;m glad I have Crest Pro-health there to use instead.My boyfriend would rather use Listerine instead so that&#x27;s why I have the 2 to choose from. Great product overall and definitely lives up to its expectation being set forth.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product as a test sample and will always use this mouthwash.My breath stayed fresh through lunch my mouth tast3d cleaner theoughout the day and it doesnt leave a sugary film.</li>
            <li> Ok Guys...&lt;br /&gt;So I did receive this product for review and am going to be completely honest will all my opinions and everything. I defiantly want to comment on the alcohol free taste which is amazing compared to Listerine which burned my mouth alive. The minty flavor was also another bonus because it was not at all overpowering, The fact that people keep saying that it leaves their teeth brown boggles my mind ... I&#x27;m on my third week and don&#x27;t know how long others used it to notice the brown teeth but right now I&#x27;m pretty safe from the brown teeth scare. Bottom line for the price and the alcohol free taste alone I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for sometime now. I ended up getting this product for free #GotItFree thru #BzzAgent, and I just have to say I LOVE IT!! Oral Health is something I find very important. And this product helps with that everyday!! No burning from alcohol is a big thing for me. That is one reason I stopped using my last mouth wash. This is a perfect product for me and my family!! Especially since I&#x27;m a big coffee drinker. I don&#x27;t get that Coffee Breath any more!!</li>
            <li> I used to use Listerine mouthwash occasionally because of the alcohol burn was very unpleasant so i quit using it until now. I tried Crest Alcohol Free rinse and find it to my liking. The taste is pleasant and the no alcohol burnt in the mouth and tongue. As a smoker sometimes i need a quick fix to get rid of the smells of cigarettes breathe , and crest did a good job of doing that in one rinse. My mouth and teeth feels clean and my breath is minty fresh. Will definitely buy and used it again. &amp;#34;I received a free product from Smiley 360 for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I like the taste and lack of burn that this product offers, but I am not thoroughly convinced it does anything. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a week now and haven&#x27;t noticed any added benefits beyond the brushing and flossing I already do. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Amazing Product! So happy to have gotten my free sample. This product leaves my mouth feeling fresh and lasts for hours. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I had the pleasure of trying this mouthwash out for free (thanks to Crest). I&#x27;ve had a positive experience with the mouthwash from the very beginning when I went to use the mouthwash and noticed no burning when I was using it.  I then check out the label and it says &#x27;alcohol-free&#x27; and I thought &amp;#34;Well, this is AMAZING!&amp;#34; As if that wasn&#x27;t a big enough plus to keep using the mouthwash I notice every time I use the mouthwash I notice it cleans my teeth very well and it helps a lot with my gum pain. Usually I have sore gums throughout the day and after using this mouthwash I have seen a significant change in the way my gums have felt. I will definitely continue to buy this mouthwash!!!!</li>
            <li> I got this product for free as part of a bzzcampaign. I have to say that I was skeptical of this mouthwash. Normally when I use any mouthwash I can&#x27;t stand the minty taste and the BURN! I can never swish it around long enough! The taste is actually very mild. I am not a fan of mint in general and usually get the winterfresh but I actually prefer this one! I was shocked! And I LOVE how clean my teeth feel for the ENTIRE day! I haven&#x27;t noticed any staining on my teeth but will keep watch and update if necessary!</li>
            <li> This mouthwash is one of if not the BEST I have tried in quite some time. It leaves my mouth refreshed similar to leaving a pro cleaning but obviously much less invasive.  It doesn&#x27;t burn or overwhelm your taste buds like some others do.  Very smooth flavor, hard to explain unless you try it yourself.  Definitely comfortable to use continuously and my children like it too.  I am very thrilled with the whole Pro-Health lineup...</li>
            <li> I just started using this product and I love it. I use it at night before bed and wake up in the morning still feeling clean. No complaints here</li>
            <li> Just got this product for free from Buzzagent and for the past 2 weeks I&#x27;m feeling so much cleaner and fresher. I love the non burning feeling that you get but it&#x27;s very clean and the flavor is perfect. Not too strong but not weak at all. Keeps me fresh all day and all night. Also no weird filmy taste after</li>
            <li> I have never been a fan of mouth wash because I felt that it burns really bad. Trying Crest Pro-Health was the least of what I had expected. For the longest my gums would hurt atleast 4 times in the same spot, but after I started using crest pro-health I notice the pain started to reduce more and more everyday. Of course I do not expect it to make the pain go away forever but this is a lot better then 4 times a day. What I dislike about this product is that it still does burn a little but not as much as all the other bottles of mouth wash.</li>
            <li> I was always skeptical of trying new mouthwashes because I never liked the burning medicine taste.  But this one is different.  I received a trial from the manufacturer and I loved the flavor and how fresh my breath was.  It also made my teeth feel even cleaner than usual after brushing.  I would definitely recommend this mouthwash especially to anyone who has put off trying mouthwash because of the medicine taste.  This one will impress you.</li>
            <li> will not use left brown stains on my teeth. took the denist awhile to get them looking better</li>
            <li> This mouth wash leaves a not so fresh after taste that last all day and makes whatever I eat or drink taste funny the whole day.....not a fan of this mouth wash</li>
            <li> I liked using the crest mouthwash. It has a refreshing and lasting taste. It was a sample given to me by smiley 360.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this product in our home for about 5 years- 2 adults and 3 kids. Our kids have used it since they&#x27;ve been able to understand to spit it out- about 2.5 years old (we diluted it with water for a while). It really does protect from cavities and make your mouth feel super clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I was giving Crest Pro Health Mouth was to try for free. I absolutely love it.  I would brush Anna use Crest Pro Health mouth wash after.  I would have a long fresh mouth for hours.  I was using another brand before.  But Crest Pro Health mouth d wash Is my first choice from now on.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product free hanks feel great does not burn my mouth like alot of them do and i feel cean also to Crest.Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Mouthwash&lt;br /&gt;Fights bad breath and kills germs&lt;br /&gt;Keeps teeth cleaner longer (vs. brushing alone)&lt;br /&gt;Helps improve your dental check-ups, by fighting plaque and gingivitis  free thanks to Crest.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T LISTEN TO THESE GUYS TRASH MY!!! AMAZING MOUTHWASH&lt;br /&gt;I did a campaign on this FINE product as a bzz agent!&lt;br /&gt;I proudly told people how I LOVED IT&lt;br /&gt;I got a free bottle from bzz agent &amp;#60;they are cool, like that&amp;#62;&lt;br /&gt;BUT ill have to buy my next, and every one after that&lt;br /&gt;BECAUSE ITS AMAZING</li>
            <li> I received a sample bottle of Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Mouthwash through BzzAgent.  This mouthwash offers excellent protection in an alcohol-free formula that tastes great!  It kills germs, reduces plaque, helps prevent gingivitis, freshens your breath and keeps your teeth looking and feeling cleaner for longer than brushing alone.  This product works well and I am happy to use it daily (unlike some that burn my mouth or taste awful)!  I will definitely be purchasing this in the future!</li>
            <li> Wow i disagree with all the reviews and don&#x27;t understand. I love Crest Pro health because it doesn&#x27;t make my eyes water like others. I did receive a free bottle to try and fell in love. I have a bad breath issue and need a high quality product.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34; I have had stains on my teethe either from coffee or soda not really sure which and maybe even both. But since I have been using this they have began to fade! I love the taste and the way it makes my whole mouth feel very clean!</li>
            <li> For as long as I have used mouthwash I always thought that alcohol included meant it was  &amp;#34;working&amp;#34; that powerful bite that it provided meant yes. That was until I got a free sample of the crest pro health from crest. It has made my mouth feel more refreshed and kept my breath fresh all day. Before the sample i was experiencing soreness in one my my teeth but after using it for a few days my tooth some how feels better. I had my girlfriend start using it and she too has said how much she enjoys it compared to our previous brand.</li>
            <li> We were given a free same via Bzzagent and were eager to try it! We have been using the product for a few weeks and have had great results! Our breath has been fresher and our mouths feel cleaner. It is definitely a strong mouth wash, but we have not experienced any burning. The flavor is excellent and lasts for quite a while. I have not had any issues with staining like many other reviews have stated; perhaps, there was a bad batch.</li>
            <li> I received a full size sample of Crest Pro-health from BZZAgent as a promotion. After using Crest Pro-Health for about a week my mouth feels much cleaner for way longer than it has with other mouth washes. Even 2 hours later I can still taste the mouth wash in my mouth! My only complaint is that while it doesnt burn as much as other mouth washes it still burns a little. I guess that&#x27;s just it doing its job!</li>
            <li> I like the taste,  Did not clean my teeth like it should have.</li>
            <li> I got this product to try for free since I am a buzzAgent and report my own thoughts on it. I really like this product. Doesn&#x27;t burn when I used it like some other mouthwashes I have used. Helps to keep a healthy clean mouth to keep my smile looking great. #‎GotItFree‬</li>
            <li> I got this Crest Pro health free from Bzzagent to try it out!  Cool Mint is the classic crest pro health  flavor that everyone is used to. With no after burn! I really Hate this size but like  the product.It makes my mouth feel clean as well as protects my teeth and cuts down on the plaque,it also kills germs and helps prevent gingivitis Im so glad i can keep my teeth so frsh and clean with crest pro health multi protection.</li>
            <li> Received this product from BzzAgent to try. After using this product I have to say I love this product. My teeth feel cleaner and  I have fresher breath.</li>
            <li> Received this mouthwash as part of a promotion from Crest and immediately was excited to begin trying the product. I have been using it for about two weeks and have no complains. I love the way that there is no burn and the clean feeling is prolonged. I get so thrilled to use my mouthwash because I know my mouth is well protected ;)</li>
            <li> This is a effective mouth wash that doesn&#x27;t hurt or burn my mouth like an alcohol one does. My dentist recommended this for me because I need the fluoride for my very sensitive teeth. This has helped keep my teeth from being super sensitive to hot and cold foods.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Mouthwash for two weeks now #gotitfree thanks to #Bzzagent. I&#x27;ve seen alot of improvement in my mouth, especially my gums and my teeth plus my mouth stays cleaner and fresher for during the day. @Crest</li>
            <li> I received a bottle of Crest Pro-Health for free to try out and review, it&#x27;s been a few weeks since I starting using it and I am hooked, I felt the difference after the first day. The taste is great, it&#x27;s not harsh and doesn&#x27;t burn your mouth. It leaves my mouth with a fresh, clean feeling all day and my breath smells great! This stuff kills 99% of germs that cause plaque and gingivitis! That&#x27;s one awesome mouthwash! I&#x27;m excited for my next check-up, my dentist is gonna be proud of me.</li>
            <li> I received this mouthwash as part of a #BzzCampain. It was free and I won&#x27;t be buying this after trying it. The packaging is appealing and just looking at the bottle I feel I&#x27;m getting a good product. But after trying the product twice a day for a few weeks now, I&#x27;m really not crazy about it. I miss the standard mouthwash burn and my teeth don&#x27;t feel as clean after using this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get why this product has so many negative ratings. I recently tried this product and loved it. It is not as strong as others which i consider a good thing. It leaves your breath smelling fresh. I have no stains like others have mentioned. I recommend that you try and judge for yourself what works for one may not work for others. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I received a free bottle of this from Smiley360. I wouldn&#x27;t even give this one star. It makes my teeth brown. I only like that it leaves your mouth with fresh breath and not an aftertaste. I don&#x27;t recommend this product. I stopped using it before I had to get my teeth professionally cleaned.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample through Smiley360.  I&#x27;ve been using this for years. It&#x27;s made a big difference in my dental visits. I don&#x27;t get the build up I used to. This does not contain alcohol--which I usually prefer but if you want alcohol this isn&#x27;t for you.  As for staining, I haven&#x27;t seen anything yet, but I use it only a few times a week before I brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> This is such a wonderful product of crest pro-health. It does not burn and leaves your mouth feeling refresh and great. I use it every night and when I remember to use it in the morning. To me my main concern is using it at night since there is more chance of getting cavities or anything wrong with your mouth when you sleep.&lt;br /&gt;I also love using all crest products because for me not seeing a dentist for 6 years my teeth are strong and only needed two fillings :)</li>
            <li> Update:  It took roughly one week for my sense of taste to return to normal, which is what I had read from other people as well.  The rest of this bottle got dumped down the drain, and the second one of the two-pack I gave to a friend who uses this stuff and doesn&#x27;t have a problem with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist recommended that I use a mouthwash, so I first bought a bottle of Listerine and used it up with no ill effects whatsoever.  While shopping at Costco, I saw a two-pack of this Crest Pro-Health and decided to buy it to replace the empty bottle of Listerine.  This was a big mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my first usage of the product, I noticed that little bits of blue sludge were stuck to my tongue, and the mouthwash left a horrible chemical aftertaste in my mouth rather than a fresh, clean feeling.  I only used it a couple of times before I stopped.  On my recent dental checkup, I was once again reminded that I should use a mouthwash (the dentist recommended alcohol-free Listerine), so I decided to try this again since I still had most of the two bottles left and figured maybe it wouldn&#x27;t be so bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, my second attempt to use this product was even worse.  Not only does the chemical flavor remain, but the mouthwash burns like acid even for hours after use, and worst of all, it destroys your tastebuds and leaves a sickening metallic flavor in your mouth...for days.  After I noticed this effect and found that hundreds of people have complained of the same problems, I stopped using the product, yet my sense of taste is still impaired 3 days later.  Some foods merely taste blander than they should, while others react very poorly with the \\&quot;licking a battery\\&quot; flavor that still lingers in my mouth and taste downright awful.  I hope that, like others have posted online, my sense of taste returns within a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Crest mouthwash might work, but the awful side effects aren&#x27;t worth it.  From my personal experience, I would recommend Listerine, which gave me no trouble, or basically anything that isn&#x27;t Crest.rouble, or basically anything that isn&#x27;t Crest.</li>
            <li> Crest pro health is simply amazing! Its alcohol free so it doesn&#x27;t burn as much, but it does have a bit of a burn. That aside, I been using it for several days now and already see a result! Oh-and the taste is really great.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the mouthwash. It did it&#x27;s job and it didn&#x27;t have the classic mouthwash burn. It kept my mouth clean and feeling refreshes throughout the day. It has a great taste while using the product as well. The only thing I did not enjoy about it was the aftertaste. It reminded me of hairspray. Thankfully the aftertaste does go away, but I just do not know if I could purchase it knowing the aftertaste will be there. I did get this product free and participated in a bzz agent campaign.</li>
            <li> Tried this product not thinking there would be a difference from any other mouth wash but there was it&#x27;s been almost a week since my bottle ran out and my mouth still feels cleaner then before using it .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a BzzAgent and received Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection as part of a word-of-mouth campaign. I&#x27;m a HUGE fan on Crest Clinical. This, not so much. I&#x27;m not a fan of its sweetness that early in the AM. My husband tried it, but oral products must always be cinnamon in his mind, so it didn&#x27;t win him over. My 7 yo son wasn&#x27;t a fan either. All that being said, it&#x27;s effective, lasts a good while and tastes less medicinal than most mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of crest products. Whenever I buy toothpaste, or floss, toothbrushes or even mouthwash, my go-to brand is Crest.&lt;br /&gt;I was almost out of my other crest mouthwash (actually same product), when I was given the opportunity to review this as well. I use it every night after I floss and brush.  I come from a family of dentists and they also recommend the crest brand. It kills 99% germs, and fights against plaque, gingivitis and bad breath. I use it for the plaque and gingivitis. People have said it leaves stains on their teeth, that hasn&#x27;t happened to me. I am satisfied with the product I received and will use the product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This product works so well.  It helps to freshen your breath and protect your teeth.  I haven&#x27;t had any issues with brown stains on my teeth due to this product.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I love this mouth wash i have been using it for a couple of weeks now. I have noticed a difference in my breath and the sensitivity in my mouth has lessened! And its alcohol free which is a HUGE plus for me because I have an alcohol allergy!</li>
            <li> I tried this product and absolutely love it.  I love it because it continues to work well into the day.  I also use this at night before bed and it helps to cut back on the &amp;#34;morning breath&amp;#34; the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> So ever since having braces as a kid my smile is very important to me and I put a ton of effort to keep it pretty. So as a BZZAGENT I was so excited to try this mouthwash. I usually have trouble with mouthwash burning so I stop using it but not with this one. I am so happy to report that unlike other I haven&#x27;t had staining or any gross feeling after. My breath stays fresh and my teeth look amazing!!</li>
            <li> I was impressed on how well and clean&lt;br /&gt; my mouth felt after using the mouthwash before bed and when i woke up my breath was still fresh.  I thought that while rinsing  my mouth, it was very strong and tingling in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Cleans Hard To Reach Spots&lt;br /&gt;Clean Teeth&lt;br /&gt;Durable&lt;br /&gt;Easy To Use&lt;br /&gt;Gentle On Gums&lt;br /&gt;It makes my mouth feel fresh and clean! Great product!&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line Yes, I would recommend this to a friend. My grandmother and mother use it on a daily basis also</li>
            <li> I received a free bottle from smiley360 to try and all opinions are 100% mine. This mouthwash does still burn alot, I thought it wouldn&#x27;t since it&#x27;s alcohol free. Overall though I was satisfied with the results. My teeth and mouth felt clean and fresh. Also, I didn&#x27;t get any mouth sores or brown stains on my teeth.</li>
            <li> I was recently given an opportunity to try this product for free, thanks to Bzzagent and my experience was very much satisfieing. This product works really great I surprisingly love the taste and not in a rush to spit it out because it doesn&#x27;t have that strong burning like other brands have. I also love that it is alcohol free, and my mouth, teeth and gums feel very clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I received a free bottle of Crest Pro Health mouth wash from Smiley360 and am very pleased with the product. It has a great taste and leaves your mouth and teeth feeling fresh and clean. I will definitely continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I began using Crest for two reasons, first my son&#x27;s dentist recommended it because his teeth do not have a good coating of enamel and second because I wanted a product that would keep my teeth healthy.  After using it only a few times, I already have noticed a difference for me.  I love the flavor and I am so happy that it is alcohol free.  I feel that a once a day use is doing so many positive things for my teeth and mouth.  My very favorite thing is that it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; my mouth when I use it.  May of the other products I tried for me and my son, were too harsh and my son would not use it  With Crest Pro-health, we both use it regularly and without a problem  I look forward to our continued use and reporting back to the dentist that we are doing as he asked us to and I now have the good feeling that I am doing the best thing for my son&#x27;s teeth.  I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I see a bunch of reviews that state they were finding stains on their teeth but those reviews were frm a few years ago.  Crest must have figured out the issue and resolved it.  For me in my opinion this is a GREAT mouthwash.  I will be switching to the full line of Pro-Health products way to go Crest!  I&#x27;m so happy I was able to try the product for free thanks to Crest.  I was in a campaign through bzzagent.com.  But this is my HONEST opinion of this product!</li>
            <li> Through my Smiley360 membership, I was given a free sample of Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Rinse â\\&quot; Refreshing Clean Mint to try and review. After using for a week, I can say I am extremely satisfied with the rinse. My mouth feels clean, refreshed, and invigorated. I love that on top of all that, I know it is working to protect my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review.&lt;br /&gt;My gum turned very sensitive and even bleed often due to pregnancy, and my wisdom teeth ache too. So I have to clean my gum and teeth every time after eating to remove bacteria and relieve the problem. This mouthwash helps a lot in getting cleansing easily done, so I do not have to brush my teeth all the time. But I give it four stars because the taste is too strong for me to rinse for over 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> I love them Crest Pro-Health Alcohol Free u get the clean of Creating without the burn of the alcohol it leaves your mouth refreshingly clean and breath amazingly fresh I give it 5 stars!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mouthwash for the last two weeks and have zero complaints. It doesn&#x27;t burn your mouth like other mouth washes containing alcohol. The taste is pleasant. Love the clean feeling I have throughout the day after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I JUST RECEIVED FROM SMILEY360 A FREE PRODUCT FOR THE PURPOSE OF A REVIEW.I HAVE NEVER TRIED CREST PRO HEALTH BEFORE AND IT SEEMS TO WORK REALLY WELL.THANK YOU SMILEY360</li>
            <li> This is the best mouthwash I have ever used. No alcohol so no burn when you gargle. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh. Getting great check ups with my dentist! I use with the toothpaste for better results. Great product! Two thumbs up crest !</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-health is an excellent product for daily dental hygiene. I rinse in the morning and at night leaving my mouth feel fresh. The uniqueness with this product is that it is alcohol free. Love the after affects!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received a free product from Smiley 360 for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I am trying this product for free thanks to Crest.  #BzzAgent&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for a few weeks now, and my favorite thing about it is that there is significantly less of the typical mouthwash burning sensation.  I have been very happy with the result so far!</li>
            <li> I really like Crest Pro-health a lot.  I have been using it for quite some time and am very pleased with the feeling I get after using it.  It does not burn when I rinse with it and my mouth feels so fresh and clean afterwards.  My son recently got his wisdom teeth removed and the oral surgeon has his irrigating the area in the back of his mouth with 1/2 Pro-health and 1/2 water into a syringe.  It does a really good job of keeping the area clean and bacteria free.  I do also have to say that in the past I have had some issues with my gums and during my last appointment all signs were good.  I do think that Crest Pro-health helps your gums be healthier too.  Yippee!!  I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Been using this for some time now. Taste great and freshens breath. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> i received my crest pro-health multi-protection free from smiley360 and i have to say i have been a user of crest product for a number of years and thought that brushing was enough until i used this product i am more then please, it has giving me a refreshing feeling after brushing with crest total care.</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&lt;br /&gt;I love it. My mouth feels clean and fresh. I love using before bed just so I don&#x27;t wake with morning breath. I know for some all experiences are different. I just love how my mouth feels after using, and it doesn&#x27;t leave behind a bitter taste like some I have used before.</li>
            <li> First of all, I&#x27;m really surprised to see all these negative reviews. Crest has always been probably my top 1 or 2 favorite brands for teeth. I did not have any problems with staining of teeth. I really like this mouthwash because it&#x27;s a light minty flavor and contains no alcohol. The next mouthwash I bought from listerine (it was on sale) has 20% alcohol which is too strong for my taste. So perhaps this crest one isn&#x27;t as effective (due to being alcohol-free) but it does freshen my mouth/breath and is a nice flavor. I am still going back to Crest after using my listerine, although maybe looking at my other options in the crest brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Rinse. I use it in the morning and at night and have noticed it is constantly fighting bad breath and my mouth feels cleaner. I am so glad I was able to try this product before purchasing and now I have a new favorite. I was lucky enough to receive a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own and honest.</li>
            <li> I have tried this product through Smiley missions for free and I liked the way it made my mouth feel clean. I did notice a film in my mouth but have not seen any stains or anything else unusual. So far I like it</li>
            <li> I will start by saying that I did not have any staining of my teeth are any burning caused by this product. I have been using this product twice a day and have not had any negative results. The taste is good, not overwhelming at all. The \\&quot;fresh and clean\\&quot; feeling did not last as long as I would have liked though.    I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I got to try this product free thanks to Crest and Bzzagent, but I must say, after a few weeks, I&#x27;m not impressed. My teeth do not feel cleaner, they feel thicker and more sensitive if anything. They also are not whiter by any means! I&#x27;m kind of disappointed. I really had high hopes for this as I usually enjoy Crest products.</li>
            <li> The taste is great and I love that it contains no alcohol but I do advise a medium bristle tooth brush when using. This product does cause staining and the more prolonged the use the worse the stains can become. Mine has not been too bad but upgraded to med bristle tooth brush and never just use this product alone I brush immediately afterwards. This to me would counteract the effect but I also use the tooth paste which has a slight abrasive in it and although not completely happy have noticed my mouth does feel, smell and look better. This product is not for everyone I myself had a high fever as a child so my enamel never formed properly. Maybe the enamel the outer coating is staining and since I have little to none mine does not really stain as bad? Great concept, great idea but misses the mark with the staining issue. This product needs to be taken back to the drawing board and reworked.  I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I like the Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection Rinse. I see some reviewers complaining of teeth staining. I have never had that problem. My tongue turns blue after using it but that&#x27;s to be expected. Crest rinse doesn&#x27;t have a strong after taste or burn when rinsing. I really like that. I&#x27;ve tried another name brand rinse that burns when rinsing. Crest leaves my mouth feeling fresh. I received a bottle of this rinse for free and my opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I love the taste because it is not that strong, I love that it is alcohol free so it wont age my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;No staining or adverse effects at all and I have 2 veneers-can,t imagine what other are talking about&lt;br /&gt;Love this product and endorse 100%&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I really liked it because it doesn&#x27;t burn out my mouth. But, It is terrible to leave brown stain on my teeth. Very disappointed to.</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.” The refreshing mint flavor was not over powering, leaving my mouth fresh and tingly.  I really liked this mouth rinse better than some other mouth washes I have tried.</li>
            <li> I received a bottle multi crest pro health protection of a free, thanks to crest .. and BzzAgent . I sincerely feel them fresh and clean mouth. but I hate the bad taste left in my mouth , like I can not grab a taste for the food till after having a good time rinsing the mouth</li>
            <li> Got this mouthwash free from BzzAgent.com thanks to CREST for providing it!  After reading these reviews i was very skeptical and afraid of the same thing happening to me. I went ahead and tried it. No brown stains for me. It doesnt have a harsh burn either. Ive had no problems with it and it has made my teeth feel cleaner longer!!! It also gave me a good report from the last dentist appt.  I give it two thumbs up.</li>
            <li> I have few days using this mouthwash so far I like how fresh it is with out the burning sensation.  I&#x27;m still going to have  healthy teeth and enjoy rinsing my mouth using Crest Pro Health Multi-Potection. The exciting part is that even my 5 yr old is enjoying using this product.  #CrestProHealth #FreeFromCrest</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying this free thank to Crest! I&#x27;ve noticed less plaque in the morning and night. I&#x27;ve noticed my breath isn&#x27;t as bad as normal(I smoke cigarettes and have allergies really bad this time of the year). And unlike Listerine it doesn&#x27;t really burn my mouth, way less painful! Only con about this product is I&#x27;m pretty lazy and had to add this to my nighttime routine. Overall it&#x27;s great and I was recommend it to everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m now editing(June 24, 2015) because I&#x27;ve used this for a longer time and I can say I stopped using it because my teeth started getting brown spots on them and I had to get my teeth cleaned to get it off. Not pleased at all. Only reason I&#x27;m giving two stars is because it never caused any discomfort for my sensitive teeth/gums unlike the original Listerine.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Mouthwash is a new innovative product that must be added to anyones personal care. I got the product for free and tested it out with my family until it ran out. For starters the taste is similar to medicine, so it may not be that enjoyable for some people; for us it was fine. After the first use you will be left with an odd feeling in your mouth since it feels extremely clean! We found it to last quite a while so that&#x27;s a plus in our list. It states that it Kills germs, thing that we all need and want while leaving a fresh breath!</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health rinse left my teeth with a clean and refreshed mouth! Works great and tastes great too!</li>
            <li> Mouthwash can be an effective treatment to protect our mouths from a diversity of health problems but this liquids can also be painful and annoying. In difference with Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Mouthwash which I have been trying it for free thanks to the brand, is that this one is actually a pleasant and a refreshing experience. This formula is alcohol free which mean that it is safer and easier to maintain it for 30 seconds in our mouths because it wont hurt our burn. Also when you analyze the bottle you can see a 24HR protection symbol which I really trust for Crest being an exceptional brand but most important than that is that I am proof that it works for 24HR and in does hour it kills germs, reduce plaque and prevent gingivitis which it is information we all want to know before buying this products. What I truly admired of this mouthwash is all the effective things it does without burning our mouth, this make it perfect for all the people out there that feel annoyed by other mouthwashes that contain alcohol and do the same our less protection than Crest Pro-Health. I would only recommend to make the after taste better because it is not bad but I know that it could be better since I have use other products from Crest that leave and amazing after taste like the Crest Be toothpastes. Besides all this is my FAVORITE mouthwash out there and I will continue using it and keep evolving with the brand each time they launch a new one.</li>
            <li> No burn I definitely recommend it to anyone who has sensitive gums/teeth</li>
            <li> By far, this is my favorite mouthwash.  I have tried numerous other brands and I find them to be too strong and burn during use.  The Crest Pro-Health is nicely minty without being harsh.  I do not experience the negative issues of burning at all with this.  I look forward to rinsing after brushing daily and in between as needed.  It&#x27;s not overly priced and you get great results - so win/win!  I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> My hygienist recommended this product because alcohol-based mouthwash makes my teeth sensitive.  Initially, I was very pleased with this--it didn&#x27;t sting like those based on alcohol.  The minty taste lingered for hours, but it wasn&#x27;t unpleasant so that didn&#x27;t bother me.  However, while preparing lunch, I noticed the olives didn&#x27;t taste salty.  I thought something was wrong with them, but then discovered the pickles didn&#x27;t taste salty either.  I tried straight salt, and it was also flavorless.  None of the foods I tried had much flavor, but salty and sour things were especially flavorless.  I thought I must be getting sick, but thought it was weird that a cold would influence salt and sour (I can usually taste that even if my nose is stuffed up).  Hours later, my sense of taste began to return.  It wasn&#x27;t until I used the product again a few days later that I began to suspect that is was Crest Pro Health mouthwash causing my loss of taste.  I did a bit of internet searching and discovered other people had the same problem, especially with salty foods.  Beware!</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection mouthwash leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean everytime I use it. My teeth are whiter and my mouth feeld awesome.</li>
            <li> I received this free through bzzagent &amp; I love it. My 6 year old also likes using it bc it has no burn. Will continue to buy!!</li>
            <li> I honestly can say I liked the mouth wash. I will not stop using it over my other brand but it works well and smells fresh. I am a satisfied customer. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a month ago. I had clean white teeth. I always floss, brush and rinse my teeth. Three days ago I noticed brown stains on my teeth. I don&#x27;t drink coffee or tea and I do not smoke. This mouthwash has caused the stains on my teeth. Please stay way from it!</li>
            <li> Like so many other people, my teeth developed grey-brown stains. I had no idea that this product was probably the cause. The risk should have been clearly and prominently noted on the bottle.    They told me and others: \\&quot;[staining] is reported by a very small percentage of people. Less than one-tenth of 1% of people... have raised this concern.\\&quot;     That might lead you to think that only one in a thousand people experience stains. But according to a story posted at newsinferno.com dated August 24, 2009 \\&quot;Proctor &amp; Gamble has said that 3 percent of all Crest Pro-Health users will experience such staining.\\&quot; That&#x27;s one in 33 customers (if you believe Proctor &amp; Gamble). Which raises a question: If the company knows the real statistic, then why are they giving out a misleading statistic about how many customers complain when you ask them how many customers get staining?    The bottle, in a place I didn&#x27;t notice, says, misleadingly in my view, that the staining \\&quot;may be prevented by adequate brushing or removed at your next dental visit\\&quot;. I brush for several minutes a day - is that not \\&quot;adequate\\&quot;? And my dentist worked hard at getting the stains off, but he didn&#x27;t get it all. Their wording, like that of their response to customers, might be technically true but, in my opinion, doesn&#x27;t leave the average reader with an accurate perception of the risks and of the prospects for successful treatment.    I called the company (1-800-285-9139) and asked for the staining statistics. I said right off I *don&#x27;t* want to hear the number of people who have complained. The rep went away, then came back. She then said 99.9% of customers have not complained. I said that wasn&#x27;t my question - I want to know what percentage of people get stains. She said research showed there was no difference in staining between their product and a control group, but she couldn&#x27;t cite the research. She said I could find the study at dentalcare dot com in the section for professionals. I looked. Didn&#x27;t find it.</li>
            <li> I think that the effectiveness of this product is outstanding!  I use it for keeping my son&#x27;s retainer clean and fresh.  I would buy this product again.  I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Worst Mouthwash ever! I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s still on the market. It stains teeth and caused me to lose my taste. It also left blue colored residue on my tongue. If I could give this a negative amount of &amp;#34;stars&amp;#34; I would. This is the most useless excuse for a mouthwash I&#x27;ve ever seen. You might as well rinse your mouth out with acid. It&#x27;d leave stains and burn off taste buds just like Crest, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;d be cheaper.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does work. My gums feel healthier and my teeth feel cleaner for longer.</li>
            <li> When I received my Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection mouthwash, I was excited to try it because I have had bad experiences with other mouthwash brands that were too strong or had too much alcohol in them.  This brand promised to be alcohol-free, and I use Crest toothpaste, so it is a brand that I already know and trust.  Personally I did not have any of the issues that a lot of people seem to be experiencing with teeth staining, and my mouth feels fresh and clean after using Crest.  I will continue to use this brand as it is much better than what I was using previously, and worked perfectly as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product. I wish I could give it negative stars. This mouthwash caused brown stains on my lower teeth along the gum line for years. I didn&#x27;t know what was causing it and had to visit my dental hygienist 4 times a year to have the stains removed using a cavitron. I worked with my hygienist to try and determine the cause but she couldn&#x27;t figure to out either. Started looking at Amazon to purchase all my hygiene needs and came across the reviews for this product. I then realized that this product was the cause of this issue that had plagued me for several years. I switched to Act and the stains haven&#x27;t come back. I now visit my dental hygienist 2 times a year instead of 4. My dental hygienist is thrilled that she doesn&#x27;t have to deal with constant staining. I can&#x27;t believe Crest sells a product like this. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED!</li>
            <li> When receiving the Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection free from Crest, I was scheptical due to the fact mouthwash can stain teeth, and also burns even without alcohol. I am giving this 4 stars because it did burn for a few rinses. But, now it doesn&#x27;t. I am already almost out (since my Fiance decided to try as well.... which he LOVES this stuff!) Anyways, I will definitely buy either this product again or another Crest product! I used to use Colgate, which I will be happy to do the switch since now I know Crest mouthwash really does the job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to also state that it really does help with bleeding gums. I have been using this mouthwash for about 15 days now, and I am happy to say my gums do not bleed anymore when I am brushing them! I am excited to see what the dentist will say when I go and see him next month! :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get bad breath due to dry mouth from certain medications and such, and I do say my breath stays fresh even after eating and drinking. My teeth stay squeaky clean, my teeth tend to build up plaque easily and since using this mouthwash it definitely hasn&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.s. The Clean Mint is definitely an awesome taste and not to strong! :D</li>
            <li> Has a great taste and makes your mouth feel refreshed I did get this product to try for free but i love it i have and will buy it for my family. No stinging just a refreshed feeling with a good clean taste</li>
            <li> I am on a mission from Smiley 360, so I got a free full-size sample (blue bottle) to buy.  I don&#x27;t know anything about brown stains; this did not happen to me -- at least not so far.  It DOES say on the bottle that any antimicrobial product may cause stains, that the stains are not harmful or permanent, and adequate brushing or a visit to the dentist will remove them.  It did leave my mouth feeling clean and refreshed and gives me fresh breath, but I use it every other day to every two days because of the fear of staining.  I use the Crest Pro-Health toothpaste as well, and I also use the Crest Pro-Health Clinical rinse (white opaque bottle) before I used this product, and the toothpaste and rinse, I believe, has reversed my gingivitis.  The blue bottle does not burn either, like Listerine, and by the way, the white bottle rinse does not burn either, though the white bottle rinse does not taste particularly good. &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.”</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t suffered from my mouth peeling or having brown stains on my teeth. I use this along with flossing and brushing with a Sonicare toothbrush, so who knows to the extent this works on it&#x27;s own but it DOES make breath smell nice for some time and has a pleasant (gentle/non-harsh) feel while using.</li>
            <li> I noticed after the very first time of using this that I lost my sense of taste for 12+ hours. Just to be this is the cause I tried a few more times and sure enough - this is the cause.  Google reviews before using any Crest Pro-Health mouthwash.  Apparrently it also causes brown staining on teeth within 1-2 bottles.  Google it - you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> i liked the fresh feeling it left in my mouth without the burn.  i received this item as a part of the bzzagent campaign and will continue to use it</li>
            <li> Crest pro health has made my teeth look really white and my breath smell good.</li>
            <li> I have to join the chorus in warning potential customers that this stuff can stain your teeth.  Here you buy a product thinking you&#x27;re doing something for your dental health and you end up with brown streaks at the gum line and across your front teeth.  It&#x27;s not pretty.  I read somewhere online Crest claims only 3% of customers get stains, but it happened to my husband as well after just a week of using this.  Now, the FDA must have made Proctor and Gamble put a tiny warning well out of the way of the \\&quot;official\\&quot; warning on the drug facts label.  It acknowledges that the product can stain teeth, but with \\&quot;adequate brushing\\&quot; it \\&quot;may be prevented.\\&quot;  So, you know, it&#x27;s all your fault, right?  If you absolutely must use this product for some strange reason, monitor your teeth for stains daily and stop at the first sign of streaks and darkening at the gums.  Also make sure you have a dental cleaning scheduled as you may need it more than you ever have in your life.  Better still, stay away from this product and keep a close eye on Crest and Proctor and Gamble products for those tiny warning labels that may contain the most important information of all.</li>
            <li> I have never had a side effect from any product, but I used this mouthwash for about 3 days and got a bad chemical burn on my tongue. I can&#x27;t really eat anything and it even hurts to touch the roof of my mouth or teeth. Stay away from this product</li>
            <li> I received Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Rinse as a Free Product to try and i was very happy with it. I have used it for a couple of weeks and I like the taste and it really does help freshen my breath. Unlike some other products, it had no bad aftertaste and I really do think it improved the condition of my gums. I will continue using it and I would definitely reccoment it.I  was so happy to have such a great product to try for free.</li>
            <li> I am trying this product free thanks to Crest and BzzAgent! Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Alcohol Free Mouth Rinse has excellent tarter control. I have had really bad tarter build up until using this product. It has a nice fresh taste that lasts a long time. I have compared this to my normal mouth rinse and I find that Crest Pro-Health is much better in making my mouth feel fresher longer. I have absolutely no tarter build up anymore. The only down side is I have some yellow brown stains now but it does state on the back of the bottle that it may stain teeth and that it is not harmful or permanent. If it were not for the staining I would give Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection 5 stars. #FreeFromCrest #BzzAgent #CrestProHealth</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Mouthwash is a new innovative product that must be added to anyones personal care.

            <li> !BROWN STAINING! Started using CrestProHealth months ago. I began to notice embarrassing brown build-up. Couldn&#x27;t wait to go for regular 6mos dental cleaning. The hygienist noticed the unusual staining too...and asked me (initiated the question-) if I was using Crest Pro Health rinse!?! I then replied yes. We&#x27;ll never buy ANY Crest products again!</li>
            <li> We have used this product for years because it is alcohol-free. My husband and I really enjoy the taste of it. It also leaves your mouth feeling very clean and refreshed. Even the kids were able to use it since it didn&#x27;t burn our mouths. We like Crest Pro-Health mouthwash so much that we purchased the Pro-Health Complete with flouride for our children to use. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I was using this product for some time, was a good experience and I know that I spend my money well, feel that feeling of cleanliness in my mouth and that I don&#x27;t feel that i am burning my lips is extraordinary, My husband and I many people have tried this product and us to like gives you the opportunity and i try crest pro healt... superstar123</li>
            <li> I had a pleasent  experience using this product. It made my mouth feel cleaner after the first use. The taste isn&#x27;t that alcohol burn like some other brands but more of a cool minty burst in my opinion. I don&#x27;t use mouthwash all the time but I can see this being used often to get rid of those morning breath moments. I am eager to see if the dentist can tell an improvement. I would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks #crest and #bzzagent for letting me #gotitfree</li>
            <li> I received Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Refreshing Clean Mint Rinse as a part of a BzzCampaign. I had never tried it before and was excited to try something new. This mouthwash does not burn like others I have tried. No one wants mouthwash that burns. People seem to think if it doesn&#x27;t burn, it doesn&#x27;t work. That is so untrue because this works really well. It made my teeth feel really smooth like silk. I felt no plaque on them at all. It makes my breath fresh for a very long time. It doesn&#x27;t fade away after a short time like others. I know my dentist is going to love me on my next visit because my mouth is in such good shape! Thanks BzzAgent and Crest for giving me the opportunity to try this mouthwash. I now have changed my brand of mouthwash!</li>
            <li> Not only does this product cause you to lose taste in your mouth, it caused problems with my gums.  The tissue will likely cause weeks to heal!  There is something VERY wrong with this product.  Do not take a chance.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy, stained my teeth.</li>
            <li> Wow... I was about to reorder this product after using it all last year.  It is sheer luck that I read these reviews because it solved a huge mystery for me...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All last year my teeth were HORRIBLY stained.  I couldn&#x27;t figure out why.  Now I know why.  This mouthwash RUINED my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so mad right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product should be recalled.  There should be a class action lawsuit against these P&amp;G hacks.</li>
            <li> Finished a bottle of this before starting to worry that there was something horribly wrong with me or my dental hygiene habits due to the staining on my teeth that was so bad multiple people noticed and told me to see a dentist right away. It took my a while to figure out that this was causing it, because mouthwash is probably the last thing you would expect to stain your teeth. The fact that these people sell oral hygiene products that STAIN YOUR TEETH is absolutely absurd and reprehensible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never buy this product unless you want your teeth to look like they&#x27;re rotting. This is literally the worst product I&#x27;ve ever used in my life. It does exactly what it&#x27;s designed not to do. I&#x27;m definitely never buying Crest products again and will probably try to avoid P&amp;G all together just on the principle.</li>

            <li> Another VICTIM of Crest!  4 weeks ago my teeth were white and clean.  Bought Crest pro-health mouth wash about a month ago and now my teeth look like they are turning brown and rotting.  Don&#x27;t know how they can get away selling a product like this.  I will NEVER EVER buy a Crest product again, and I will tweet and facebook about this experience so that everyone I know will never to buy Crest again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product twice now, and already I&#x27;m terrified if I should use it again.  My sense of taste is almost completely gone from the first half of my tongue, and it feels oddly numb.  I don&#x27;t know what to do about this problem, if its permanent or if it&#x27;ll go away, but I&#x27;ll tell you one thing; I&#x27;m not using this product ever again.</li>
            <li> Just imagine my frustration when I finally make a real effort to increase my dental hygiene by adding flossing and crest pro health mouthwash twice a day to my routine-- which already includes using a sonicare toothbrush-- and now I  have stubborn brown stains in between all of my bottom teeth. When I read the warning on the bottle that \\&quot;staining may occur\\&quot; I had no idea that it would be like this! I thought maybe a tinge of blue, but brown crud?? And it does not brush off. I only hope that my dentist can remove it. Until then, the rest of my Crest Pro Health has been dumped down the drain. I know this has been reported in MANY other reviews, but I thought adding my story will send a stronger message to the manufacturer that this is not a rare occurrence, and BUYER BEWARE! The lack of alcohol burn is nice, but brown teeth is too much of a price to pay.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Mouthwash is a new innovative product that must be added to anyones personal care. I got the product for free and tested it out with my family until it ran out. For starters the taste is similar to medicine, so it may not be that enjoyable for some people; for us it was fine. After the first use you will be left with an odd feeling in your mouth since it feels extremely clean! We found it to last quite a while so that&#x27;s a plus in our list. It states that it Kills germs, thing that we all need and want while leaving a fresh breath!</li>
            <li> I have yet to have a problem with this mouth wash... I have only used it a week and a half... I am seeing it all with brown stains on everyones review... I think I will stop using it :/</li>
            <li> After just one single use of this mouthwash, I have lost my ability to taste!! Woke up this morning with a strong metallic taste in my mouth, and despite brushing my teeth twice today (soon after i woke up, and after lunch), i still can&#x27;t taste any of my food, and not just any food, but spicy Thai food and chocolate ice cream!! And even when not eating, my tongue and mouth just feel funny - kinda soapy and numb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe since it&#x27;s only been one day, i&#x27;ve not seen very noticeable staining yet, but i&#x27;ve heard from so many others about how their teeth stained sometimes irreversibly, from as soon as one use, and also from extended use. Beware!</li>
            <li> i was able to test this mouthwash for free through bzzagent. I like that there is no alcohol in it so it doesn&#x27;t burn my mouth. i also like that leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I was truly astonished to read all of the negative reviews of this mouth wash.  My entire family has used this product for over a year at the suggestion of our dentist, and we love it.  None of us has had any loss of taste, burning or teeth staining.  In fact, at my last check-up the dentist commented on how much less plaque I had, which I attribute partially to the rinse.  And we like the taste, too (but only the blue, not the green variety).</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks now. I floss twice a day, never smoked, drink water, reagular visits to the dentist, I do what I can to keep my teeth healthly and my teeth look like they are decaying!! With this product staining so many people&#x27;s teeth, why is Crest Pro Health still on the market!!! I would have not given this product ANY stars if I could!!</li>
            <li> I received Crest Pro-Health Multi Protection Alcohol Free as part of a promotion and have been using it for about a week. I really like it. I use it after I floss but before I brush. It does a great job and I haven&#x27;t noticed any staining the others are complaining about (however I am using it before I brush as that seems to be the key) My favorite things about this mouthwash is that it has a strong &#x27;cleaning&#x27; feeling without containing alcohol. I hate how so many alcohol containing mouth rinses burn, but most of the non alcohol rinses taste like mint water. This really feels and tastes likes it&#x27;s working and my teeth look great! I really like the product and even though I got it free through a promotion, I will definitely buy it when I run out.  i recieved this full size product for review by Bzzagent.</li>
            <li> I received a free full size bottle of Creest Pro-health from BzzAgent to try a few weeks ago. The product was free and was shipped directly to my home. I have been using it for almost 3 weeks and I love the results! First, I really like the fact that this product is alcohol free. Second, I love the fact that the promised results really happen. My mouth feels fresh and clean all day long and the appearance of my teeth are visibly improving gradually.</li>
            <li> Wow, hysteria on Amazon! I&#x27;m used to the opposite! Many products on Amazon receive what I consider to be fraudulent reviews in favor of poor products but now I see it goes both ways!&lt;br /&gt;Regarding this product: Anything that kills the crud growing on your teeth will leave the dead crud as a brownish film on your teeth. I have used other products that do the same thing. One is grape seed extract or GSE. When I first started rinsing with that it left my teeth brown! I did panic a bit but then found I could simply scrape the brown off. It&#x27;s like a rock in a river with moss on it. The moss weakens the rock because of the roots but take the rock out of the water and in to the sun and the moss dies and turns dark but then can be easily scraped off leaving a more healthy rock or in this case a healthy tooth.&lt;br /&gt;Another such product is MMS or sodium chlorite. When used properly to gargle in the mouth it kills everything.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Crest Pro Health for a few days now with no problems and I feel like a few people panicked and are now blasting Amazon with negative reviews on this product. Crest Pro health is a good product!</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest I was able to try this product for free. It left my mouth feeling clean and germ free. I would definitely go out and purchase this product. It is also alcohol free which I really love.</li>
            <li> - Brand name Crest Mouth wash&lt;br /&gt;- Lacked a sense of strength because its got a weak taste to it, wondered if it was able to do what its supposed to with such a bland taste.&lt;br /&gt;- Ordered it once, but switched to ACT and am happier with that (see my other review).&lt;br /&gt;- Shipping was fast with Amazon.</li>
            <li> I received a free bottle of this through Bzz agent and I LOVE IT! I always said that I would never use anything other than a previous brand I was using, but I was wrong. This is a great mouth wash!</li>
            <li> Great Clean feeling. Great taste. No burning like with other products and has helped preventing build up. I use it twice a day and I can see a big difference. This is a great product.</li>
            <li> NO, it is NOT a smear campaign by Crest competitors! I flew up to Virginia a few days ago to visit my model gorgeous daughter and was shocked to see how brown her bottom teeth were (she looked like she had been sticking a wad of chewing tobacco behind her bottom lip!) She was very embarrassed and I was very scared for her. It was not there when I visited a few months ago. I came home and did some searching on the internet to see if her teeth were dying and you guessed it! I called her and found that her dental hygienist had switched her to Crest Pro Health Mouth Wash just a few months ago!. Her hygienist is going to be shocked since the last time my daughter was there they were so impressed by how beautiful her smile was. She called Crest and got a case number and they had better pay for a professional cleaning or I am going to sue them! THIS PRODUCT SHOULD NOT BE ON THE MARKET! My daughter does not smoke, drink red wine, excessive coffee, etc. There is a teeny tiny warning on the label about the possibility of staining but suggests that it proves the product is working! Well, it only works if you want to go from a Vanna White smile to looking like you haven&#x27;t brushed your teeth in years!  And don&#x27;t let anyone try to tell you that it causes this in only a \\&quot;few\\&quot; cases.  Check the internet, there are thousands of complaints out there!  My daughter is taking pictures and I will post when I get one.  By the way, I have never posted a review on Amazon in my life (or anywhere else for that matter).</li>
            <li> Do not buy this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives- great taste and no alcohol burning feel like you get with some mouth washes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives- after using for 6 months, it seemed to leave stains on my teeth.  My dentist mentioned the same thing.  After switching back to Listerine, I haven&#x27;t had any of these issues.</li>
            <li> I began using this product as an alternative to Listerine because it is alcohol-free.  I used a bottle or two and then went for a routine cleaning.  My hygienist noticed brown spots on my teeth and asked if I had been consuming more coffee, soda, etc.  I told her no, so then she asked what kind of mouthwash I used, and I told her I had been using this particular kind of mouthwash.  She said she had seen the stains on several other clients and found they had been using this mouthwash as well.  She called the local distributor and asked about having the item pulled from the shelves, or at least have some kind of warning put on the label, but Crest hasn&#x27;t done so.  I also did a bit of online research, and other people have had this problem.  (It is only the blue bottle, not the green).  Fortunately the stains do come off, but it requires the hygienist to work a bit harder.  I&#x27;ve been telling colleagues about this problem so that they can avoid buying it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mouthwash. There is no burn from alcohol and it taste great. Also, it leaves a fresh feeling in your mouth and last for quite some times.</li>
            <li> This leaves such a fresh flavor in my mouth and lasts for hours!</li>
            <li> Husband loves it - I&#x27;m no fan of mouth wash - however, this is one I could use daily. Doesn&#x27;t burn, no burning afterwards, no nasty taste. I got this for free, from smiley360, these opinions are my own!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, my mouth didn&#x27;t feel any cleaner with this product than the one I currently use. I won&#x27;t purchase this product and will continue to use my current product.</li>
            <li> This product gave me tongue ulcers. I actually thought I had a throat infection. After a trip to my doctor and a week of antibiotics (which did nothing) I called my doctor for a different antibiotic. He said if it were bacterial I would be getting better with the current antibiotic. My glands were size of golf balls. Not viral, not bacterial must be environmental. The only thing I had been doing differently was the mouthwash, which I discontinued. I am on the mend and recommending everyone to stay away from this product.</li>
            <li> My husband uses a lot of this product. I have to keep it in stock. He doesn&#x27;t want to run out.</li>
            <li> After using only 1/2 of a bottle of this horrible concoction, every tooth was stained, and I had to have my teeth cleaned with a baking soda blaster at the dentist&#x27;s office. I will never again buy any Proctor &amp; Gamble product.</li>
            <li> Used this product once and noticed taste lost the next day, but didn&#x27;t connect the dots until a day later when the issue continued and I found information on Crests own FAQ indicating the product can cause taste problems.  It&#x27;s shocking this is still on the market.</li>
            <li> Clean fresh taste. Leaves mouth feeling clean.</li>
            <li> I wanted to know if this mouth wash truly worked like the commercials say. It really does. It left my mouth so fresh and clean. I loved the tingly feeling and that it is alcohol free is a huge plus. I recieved this product as part of a promotion from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> We received this product as part of a campaign from BzzAgent. After a week of letting my son use this, my husband and I were jealous. We decided we needed to give it a try! Let me tell you, WOW! First of all, the cap was easy to open! That may not seem like much but, for someone with wrist pains, that&#x27;s a big plus! There is a mark on the inside of the cap for easy measuring with no guessing. Our kids got these little sand timers from the dentist for brushing their teeth so we used those to time ourselves. It was almost like we were challenging each other to see who could last the longest because frankly, most mouth washes burn your mouth and make you want to spit them out early! We poured our cups into our mouths and immediately looked at each other in surprise! It didn&#x27;t burn at all! In fact, we really enjoyed it! It is now a &amp;#34;family affair&amp;#34; and we all take time to swish together. The after effects are amazing, the fresh and clean feeling lasts for hours! Crest Pro Health Multi Protection genuinely feels like it is in fact, &amp;#34;protecting&amp;#34; our pearly whites. We had our checkups at the dentist just yesterday and, he was completely happy with the health of mouths. There was very little plaque buildup, and overall he said he thought our teeth seemed whiter and our mouths were cleaner! If you&#x27;re on the fence about this product, jump off of it and get get yourself some Crest! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Like so many others have experience, this product stained my teeth brown. I had no idea what was causing the brown stains because, despite switching to this mouthwash being the only change to my dental hygiene practices, the thought did not cross my mind that my *mouthwash* could be causing stains, so I&#x27;ve been using it for months. Luckily, my hygienist mentioned she&#x27;d seen staining on teeth from other who used this product once I explained that this was the only change I&#x27;d made. Had she not thought of that, I&#x27;d likely have continued using this product indefinitely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While there is indeed a mention on the back of the label that it can cause staining, Crest don&#x27;t even mention it in the warnings! You have to look all the way at the bottom of the label and read the small print after it discusses how to get your money back if unsatisfied (which, by the way, apparently only last 60 days after purchase). Terrible product.</li>
            <li> This is the only mouthwash that my family uses. It leaves your mouth fresh and clean and the flavor is great. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  Have been using it for YEARS!!  I use it at night after brushing my teeth and always wake up with my mouth still feeling refreshed.  I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I love this mouth wash. My mouth felt more clean then ever before. I like the fact that there is no alcohol in it. My parents tried it also and agreed that this was better then the other mouthwash they have used before.</li>
            <li> I like this mouthwash. I got it for free from BzzAgent (and Crest!) and I will definitely purchase it once the product runs out. It&#x27;s strong enough to make your mouth feel super clean but it doesnt burn (because it does not contain alcohol). My teeth feel clean all day after using this product. I&#x27;ve been using it now for almost a month and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&lt;br /&gt;First off I do like the taste of this mouthwash. I hated the alcohol in a lot of the mouthwashes I had tried previously.&lt;br /&gt;This did not have that effect and I thought the taste was pleasant. There is a huge problem/con though!&lt;br /&gt;My teeth have been are stained brown! This is just terrible. I hope as other people have mentioned that the dentist can remove it. I am very upset.</li>
            <li> Let me say that I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I like about this product is that it does not burn like other mouthwashes.&lt;br /&gt;It does stain your teeth.  It says it might do that right on the bottle and it says you can have them removed from your dentist on your next visit!!  REALLY!!!  Who wants staining and if it happens who wants to wait until you go to the dentist.  This is a huge fail for Crest!</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t care for this product it left my tongue numb and a nasty after taste. if you rinse before bed and don&#x27;t drink at least a full glass of water you get extreme cotton mouth in the morning</li>
            <li> I think this is a quality mouthwash. It leaves my breath fresh, and even greatly decreases the ever-dreaded morning breath! There is a clean &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; that goes along with this mouthwash, but I like it, and gives me the feeling of that deep clean. However, it does not burn horribly like many mouthwashes I have tried. I have not experienced any of the adverse effects that others mentioned. I would use this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> i see there is alot of reviews on here for getting brown teeth. i however have not experienced the brown teeth but i have not been using this product for every long. from what i experience it leaves me with a nice minty breath and i always feel clean after. also this product does not burn which is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand and after a month of using it I would recommend this product because my mouth feels cleaner and my breath fresher; however if you have a sensitive mouth you will experience burning sensation for one or two minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually pretty confused as to why people are reporting brown stains on their teeth as a result of using this product-- Crest sent me a bottle of this product to try and review, and I actually love it. There isn&#x27;t any bitterness or acidity and it feels very mild on my mouth while still freshening. I certainly haven&#x27;t experienced any staining, and I&#x27;ve used this product for about a month. I would recommend this mouthwash highly based on my personal experiences with it, which have been nothing but positive. This is actually my new favorite mouthwash!</li>
            <li> Love the taste and the fact it is alcohol free is a plus. The color is nice and helps freshen my breathe and whiten my teeth . Take the challenge to try something new you may be surprised.&lt;br /&gt; I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite brands of mouth rinse. I have tried many different types of mouth rinse including rinse for dry mouth and this is my favorite. My favorite thing about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t burn because it is alcohol free. As far as the other claims, I&#x27;m sure it works as well as others in removing food debri and biofilm. The only downside to this product is that it stains the sink. It requires more than a simple rinse of your sink after use as the blue particles stick to the basin of the sink. That is my only complaint. Other than that I noticed it leaves my breath just as fresh as Scope but without the burn of alcohol. I just wish they would make this in an all natural format.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. The opinions above are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Unlike some negative reviews, I noticed absolutely no staining with this rinse.  My daughter and I have been both using it and really enjoy it.  I believe it&#x27;s just another fine quality product from Crest!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample bottle for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I use it twice a day and more if I fee like I need a breath boost. It leaves my mouth feeling clean and minty. I&#x27;ve also noticed my teeth look brighter and cleaner since I&#x27;ve been using it. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I like the taste of the mouthwash, I like that it&#x27;s not too strong, and it leaves me with a fresh clean feeling. I received a sample and these opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> i received this product for free from a promotion and i love that there is no burn or horrible after taste. i also believe that if you don eat all day that it keep you feeling refreshed!!!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this mouthwash.  It left my mouth feeling clean and minty fresh! I will be getting it again.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t even give Crest Pro Health one star. This is a TERRIBLE product. After about a month I noticed my teeth were stained around the gums. I could scrap it off only to have it quickly return. I found out from my dentist that Crest was sued because the mouthwash stained people&#x27;s teeth; so now there is a warning label on the back in the smallest print warning people of possible \\&quot;side effects.\\&quot;    DO NOT BUY. I won&#x27;t buy anything from Crest ever again.</li>
            <li> I really like this mouthwash and would recommend it. I recently received a promotion from Crest to try the mouthwash. I had purchased it several times before that and really liked it. It makes my mouth so clean and fresh. Since it is alcohol free, it does not dry out my mouth like other mouthwashes.</li>
            <li> At the dentist my hygienist took one look at my teeth and asked if I used Crest pro health mouth wash. Why? Because my teeth were much more stained than what would naturally happen in a few months (I had thought my coffee habit had gotten way out of control...) she let me know this is a common problem with the brand.&lt;br /&gt;I was seriously shocked! It should be pulled from the shelves and Crest should be horrified to have sold this product. I feel like this is a way to con customers into purchasing their whitening products once they&#x27;ve ruined your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll never use any crest product ever again - there is a market full of competitors so it&#x27;s very easy not to.</li>
            <li> I think that Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Rinse Refreshing Clean Mint is a great mouthwash. I have been using this mouthwash for over a year. I purchased it at a drug store. I also received a free sample to try from Crest. I use it a few times a week in the morning  before I leave the house to work, school, or to an event. I brush my teeth twice in the morning once when I get up to remove the biofilm of bacteria that grow in the mouth overnight and freshen my breath and then again after breakfast to get rid of the sugar. I use the mouthwash after I brush the second time right before I leave the house. It gives me confidence because it freshens my breath and is supposed to last about 12 hours. I also think it is very important that it kills germs, prevents gingivitis, keeps teeth cleaner, and reduces plaque buildup. The one thing that I have mixed feelings about is the possibility that it can stain my teeth. I did some reading on it online and Crest admits that it can cause brown staining between the teeth. Also the blue dye concerns me because it clumps up when I spit out the mouthwash. This still does not prevent me from using the mouthwash since overall I really like it. I especially like that it is alcohol free because alcohol can lead to dry mouth where bacteria can thrive. Perhaps I will talk about the staining issue with my dentist, since I have not noticed staining on my teeth, but it could be that I have overlooked it or have not noticed it if it has evolved over time. But overall I really like the mouthwash and would recommend it. Just look out because some say their teeth stain, although it seems not everyone is affected by this. Strong oral hygiene is so important and can prevent heart disease. This is remaining part of my morning regimen.</li>
            <li> I think this is the best mouthwash i have used so far. it left my teeth white and my it made my breathe feeling fresh. I dont normally like any mouthwash because i stings my mouth but this product is amazing i love it.Thanks to crest I&#x27;m trying out this product for free.</li>
            <li> I received a bottle free from Smiley360 and Crest.  I like it, I have not had any issues with teeth staining or my mouth stinging.  The taste is refreshing, not overpowering, and does not burn like some mouth rinses do nor does it leave me with dry mouth.  There&#x27;s no bad aftertaste.  I received a free product for the purpose of my review, and this opinion is 100% my own.  I fully recommend this product and I currently purchase it.</li>
            <li> I see a ton of bad reviews on this rinse.  I really happen to like this! Tastes great doesntt burn.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to write reviews for anything but I recently received this product from #bzzagent for a review and my husband and I just love this product. It makes my teeth look great and my mouth feel super fresh. So fresh and so clean !!! Thank you for such a great product !!!</li>
            <li> Be very wary when using this mouthwash. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two months and I noticed brown stains on and in between my teeth. I was horrified, and finally found other people who had the same problem with the product. I will never use it again!</li>
            <li> I received this mouthwash free to try from Smiley360. I thought it worked great. It doesn&#x27;t burn your mouth or dry it out like Listerine does. It left my mouth feeling fresh and clean. I would purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> Love this mouthwash. Performed as promised. Leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean all day. Got this product free for testing review. Will purchase in the future for continued use.</li>
            <li> I honestly cannot believe that this product is still on the market after so many complaints. I only had to use this product one time to experience the adverse side effects that the vast majority of the reviewers for this product have experienced. Immediately after using the mouthwash, my tongue felt as if I might have been rubbing it with sandpaper (that&#x27;s how harsh this stuff is). However, since it was mouthwash and mouthwash generally has that effect (though I&#x27;ve never experienced it so badly), I did not think anything of it. About six hours later, with my tongue still feeling incredibly odd, I tried to eat dinner and realized that I only had taste on the very back of my tongue. This was the case until the next day.  I did not know that this product also turned teeth brown until I read the reviews for this product on Amazon to see if anyone else had my experiences with taste-loss and a tongue that felt like it&#x27;s been scraped with sandpaper. I was surprised to learn that this mouthwash could get any worse than it already was. After reading about the brown teeth, I examined my own teeth and realized that my teeth were indeed tinged a light brown on the sides - after only one use! This was despite the fact that I had brushed my teeth thoroughly, as usual, before using this product. I mention the fact that I brushed thoroughly because I have read 5-star reviews in which the reviewers state that the only reason that this product turns other people&#x27;s teeth brown is because they either don&#x27;t brush well or don&#x27;t brush at all. I brush my teeth as well as can be expected for everyday, at-home cleaning. I would have to get a professional cleaning to have them cleaned anymore thoroughly than they already are.  Needless to say, I DO NOT recommend this product! No matter what oral health benefits this product may provide, side effects as drastic as the ones most of us have experienced should be prominently featured on the back of the bottle in at least a similarly-sized font asthe rest of the information on the bottle; not in tiny print! No consumer purchases non-prescription mouthwash with the expectation that it might ruin their sense of taste and turn their teeth brown. I was not able to get rid of the brown stains until my teeth were professionally cleaned. Since the company that sells this product doesn&#x27;t have the decency to adequately warn consumers, I advise people to avoid buying this bottle of acid altogether. For my part, I will not be buying anymore Crest products, period.</li>
            <li> I received the full size sample as a bzzagent and I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a so-so product. I love the clean feeling I have for hours and the fresh breath the product provides. However, I do not agree with the claim &amp;#34;no burn&amp;#34; and do not enjoy the very harsh burn I experience. It lasts much longer than expected from a mouthwash and then fresh, clean feeling isn&#x27;t really worth the mouth on fire feeling it gives me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mouthwash exclusively for the past month. I like that it is alcohol free and safe for my family. It doesn&#x27;t burn my mouth and it is a lot easier to rinse for the full recommended 30 seconds. I can taste the minty flavor for a while after use. Crest is a trusted brand in my household. We use Crest toothpaste and floss as well. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Killed my sense of taste, like the tip of my tongue was burned.  And stained my teeth too.  I can&#x27;t believe this stuff is still on the market !!  Back to Listerine.</li>
            <li> I got to test Crest Pro-Health Multi -Protection Alcohol free Mouthwash,  through Buzzagent, its fresh and minty without the burn. I notice that some stains were gone while using this mouthwash, however I did not like the after taste of the mouthwash. I like the regular Crest Pro mouthwash better  than the alcoholfree one, but it was worth a try, thanks Buzzagent and Crest</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth, RUN, don&#x27;t walk away from this product. If you use a sensitive toothpaste, it will quite literally STRIP the sensitive toothpaste protection from your teeth and you will be in unbearable agony. I would give this product negative starts if I could. Listerine may burn, but the burning stops. If you have sensitive teeth it will take over a week away from this product to begin to build your resistance back up. Shame on you Crest!</li>
            <li> My family likes it. Evem my youngest likes to use it. And we all agree, our teeth feel cleaner and breath is fresher! #GotItFree</li>
            <li> It does a good job at keeping your mouth feeling fresh for awhile but it leaves a bad after taste thats hard to get out of tour mouth I haven&#x27;t noticed no changes in my tartar protection or anything so not the best out there</li>
            <li> Have used this rinse for at least two years.  Dentist compliments.  Also alcohol free so it won&#x27;t age my mouth.</li>
            <li> I started noticing brown stains on my front teeth. they are large stains as well. i will stop using this product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this stained my bottom row of teeth brownish.  It mostly came off with a cleaning at the dentist, but I will have to go back a 2nd time to get it all off.  Very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need a non-alcohol rinse, but this one is not it.</li>
            <li> using Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection mouth wash was a great switch from the alcohol based product that I was using.  I thought the Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection mouth wash was light years ahead of the Listerine mouth wash.  I liked the flavor (fresh mint) the 24 hour protection. and how it made my teeth feel all day. I have used this product for three weeks now and would recommend it to friends. I&#x27;m excited to see who the product worked during a regularly scheduled dental check up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was compensated for this review</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this from Amazon, and I wish that I had because I would have seen these reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for about 2 weeks, I noticed my teeth were getting brown stains. The only thing that I have done differently from normal is to use Crest Pro Health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now a week later, after only 2 weeks of use, my teeth still have brown stains on them. I&#x27;m hoping that they come out with extended sonicaire brushing focussing on those spots. If that doesn&#x27;t work I really hope my dentist will get them out. Horrible product!</li>
            <li> After diligently using this product for nearly two months, I was shocked and appalled when I noticed brown stains near the gumline of my lower teeth.  The stains appear to be tartar - something I&#x27;ve never had a problem with in my life.  I can&#x27;t believe that Crest is allowed to keep this product on the market.</li>
            <li> I floss and use soft picks daily and very rarely have issues with soreness or bleeding, but after three uses of this mouthwash, my gums became visibly swollen and so tender that flossing was very painful and resulted in a fair amount of bleeding, to the point where I had to stop flossing. After more than 48 hours the symptoms have not decreased at all. I haven&#x27;t had the brown stains or numbness/burning mentioned in other reviews, but this was bad enough. I rarely have allergic reactions to anything and have never had issues with dental hygiene products before. Even if Crest won&#x27;t pull the product, the warnings on the package need to be expanded significantly. Maybe you won&#x27;t be one of the people who has a bad reaction, but why take the chance? There are plenty of other mouthwashes out there.</li>
            <li> I picked up a bottle of Crest Pro-Health because the store was out of my regular non-alcohol mouth wash and I didn&#x27;t have time to wait for an order from Amazon.  Within a few weeks, I noticed stains on my teeth.  My dentist confirmed that it was the mouthwash.  Fortunately, the dentist office was able to polish the stains off.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample from Crest and Bzz agent to try and I have to say I love it! I use it regularly especially because there is no harsh alcohol taste. I feel that my mouth is much cleaner and feels healthier. I also noticed my morning breath seemed reduced and friends or coworkers even noticed a difference in my smile!</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this product. I tested it for a campaign on Buzz. I am normally a Listerine user and I like my citrus Listerine. I gave this a shot however because I had hopes it would help with my dry mouth from my meds. Really all it did was leave a funny taste in my mouth all day. It didn&#x27;t matter if I used it  before I brushed or after.</li>
            <li> *Repost edited version: I got a bottle from bzzagent as part of a promation, and it was not as good as I thought it would be. It was not bad but it wasn&#x27;t great eaither. I found the it didn&#x27;t keep my breath as fresh as some other mouth washes. I did like that there was not burn from no alcohol. I wish I would have picked crest pro health tartar protection  I think it would have been better for my dental need and I have heard amazing reviews about it !</li>
            <li> I received this from Bzzagent to try and review. Made my mouth feel and look fresh and made my gums not hurt! I enjoyed the not &amp;#34;crying&amp;#34; from the lack of burn when using it! All and all I will use it again and I recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> They need to fix the staining issue. But if you do use this product, be sure to have your mouth fairly clean before using it, and rinse extremely well after using it. I use this product sometimes, and I rinse a lot. Otherwise, if you use it a lot, you will feel the residue. Don&#x27;t use this product independent of brushing and without rinsing thoroughly. It&#x27;s also good to alternate and not use the same mouthwash forever, then you can minimize side effects of each product.</li>
            <li> I tried this product free from Crest through BzzAgent.  It does what it says, and has a pleasant taste, but it seems expensive for something that is so basic.  I am not sure I would buy it again over Listerine.  Yes Listerine burns more, but it also whitens better</li>
            <li> I am a loyal Crest user but this product is just ridiculous. My tongue feels like it has been chafed with sandpaper, when I rinse I spit out blue flecks that also adhere to my tongue (which I then need to brush! AFTER a mouth rinse!?). I have also experienced staining, like so many other reviewers state. Crest, I&#x27;m so disappointed in you. I&#x27;ve been searching endlessly for a less intense mouthwash with all the effects of Pro-Health, but this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> Almost immediately after using this product, I noticed really ugly brown stains on my teeth - made my teeth look like 100 year old dentures.  I made mention of these new stains when I saw my dental hygienist.  After a few basic health questions, she asked if I used Pro Health products, and I said I started using the Pro Health Rinse about 6 months ago.  That is exactly when the stains started appearing.  She proceeded to tell me that the Pro Health rinse is the bane of her existence. Apparently, many people have the same problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro Health Rinse leaves a film on the teeth that is easily stained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contrary to the warning on the bottle, these stains ARE NOT easy to get off.  My hygienist had to really work hard at getting the stains out, and it was not pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product.  In fact, mine&#x27;s going down the drain.</li>
            <li> I love Crest Pro Health, My kids actually like using it too. It tastes great and leaves a clean minty taste in your mouth, without the burn effect. I like the bottle design and the easy to use cap. I have seen the health of my teeth improve over the last couple of weeks since using Crest Pro Health. I was able to try this product free thanks to Crest.</li>
            <li> Best mouthwash by far. It&#x27;s fighting against tartar build up and cavities while keeping your breath minty fresh for 24 hour. What more could you ask for?! Ohh the best part, there is no alcohol burn at all! Completely clean comfort. I got Crest Pro Health for free to review, BzzAgent Stephanie121.</li>
            <li> Personally, this product did not stain my teeth - I found that it did a fairly good job of cleaning, and there was absolutely no alcohol burn.  Unfortunately, the fault that I&#x27;ve found with this product is that when I spit it out, it clumps together in bright blue, fiber-like strands that stick to your sink and have to be SCRUBBED off - even if you spit while the water is running!.  If you don&#x27;t clean your sink daily while using this product, you&#x27;re more than likely going to end up wit awful, vibrant blue chunks stuck all over it.</li>
            <li> I was provided a free sample by Proctor and Gamble to try this product, but the views are my own.  This mouthwash really does taste good and it does not burn, probably because it is alcohol-free,  It leaves your breath minty fresh and your teeth sparkle all day.  The fresh sensation last for hours.  I have been using it twice a day and am very satisfied with the overall results.  This is a high-quality product and I am convinced that I am getting  protection against plaque, gingivitis and bad breath, all while killing germs and keeping my teeth cleaner longer.</li>
            <li> This product works wonders for your teeth. I was lucky to try this product for free from BzzAgent and Crest. It is great for leaving your mouth feeling clean and minty fresh. Even though I got this product free this time, I can&#x27;t see myself liking any mouthwash as much as this one. It works great and does the cleaning without all the alcohol burn and aftertaste. It doesn&#x27;t interfere with food afterwards either.</li>
            <li> I am currently trying this product free (thanks to Crest) and I truly love this product. I am an avid mouthwash user and I regularly find myself struggling to find a balance between the stinging feeling and feeling refreshed for extended time. I use this mouthwash multiple times daily and I feel clean and refreshed with a slight tingle. It is a great product, I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I am SOOO glad that I decided to try this type of mouthwash bcuz I was getting for free just to try it and write MY own review on what I thought about it and I must admit that I was skeptical at first bcuz I was partial to another brand/type of mouthwash, but this mouthwash is AMAZING!!!! My teeth are cleaner, MY breath is fresher, and MY last checkup turned out EXTREMELY well, thanks to Crest I have NO plaque or tarter build-up anymore, the enamel on my teeth is actually getting stronger than it was and MY dentist was amazed at how much better my check up was.... So like I&#x27;ve already said but can&#x27;t say enough.... THANK YOU CREST FOR MAKING AN AMAZING MOUTHWASH!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to write a negative review unless truly compelled to.  I bought Crest Prohealth Alcohol Free, not expecting at all to have any issues with it.  I threw away my receipt because why would ever want to try to return it?  Well, after just two days of using it my taste buds were altered.  I had the \\&quot;metal mouth\\&quot; many have complained about.  I also had tenderness/soreness on the bony ridge above my upper teeth.  It hurt so much I had to take some OTC pain relief.  I did not at first suspect the mouthwash so I continued using it.  On the 4th day I thought about what I had done differently lately and the only thing I could think of was the mouthwash.  I stopped using it and after a full day my symptoms went away.  It was only then that I found all these other bad reviews.  I took it back to the store where I purchased and explained what happened.  Despite not having a receipt they thankfully took it back and gave me a refund.  Seems like not everyone has this same reaction but I think it&#x27; s not worth seeing if you will or not.</li>
            <li> Started using this because it boasted alcohol-free.  After a few weeks I was noticing brown stains on my teeth and couldn&#x27;t figure out what was going on.  I didn&#x27;t even get stains like this when I was drinking coffee daily.  Then I read the fine print on the bottle and it said right there may cause staining of teeth, what the eff, that&#x27;s the exact opposite result I want in a mouthwash.  Quit using and fortunately an expensive dental cleansing visit got the stains off.  Crest your products are supposed to clean teeth, not make more work for the dentist.  Don&#x27;t use this stuff!</li>
            <li> Crest is hurting its customers by selling this product.  Bought a bottle of this product a week ago and I now have brown spots between my teeth.  I look like like I have lots of little cavities between my now gray-tinged teeth.  I am furious!  Crest should step up and pay for the extra, extra deep dental cleaning I now need, due to the THEIR CRAPPY PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this; it isn&#x27;t worth pouring down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could give this NEGATIVE STARS, I would.</li>
            <li> (if possible).  This mouthwash is my least favorite of all time.  I can&#x27;t figure out what it does versus a traditional mouthwash.  Alcohol free is good and bad...good because it doesn&#x27;t burn, bad because you don&#x27;t have a good aftertaste or refreshing feeling after using it.      It&#x27;s pointless to use an alcohol free mw if the active ingredient actually makes your teeth hurt (it does to me).  If you&#x27;re worried about alcohol you should try something like biotene which is excellent but you need a second mortgage on your house to buy it.  Personally, I just use low alcohol mouthwash like the generic scope you could try using a flouride rinse but again...expensive.    The crest brand has some good products...the pro health line is not one of them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried both the Crest Prohealth mouthwash and the Prohealth toothpaste.  Both caused brown staining within a couple of days of using.  I had to undergo deep  cleaning at the dentist and it was slightly painful for my sensitive gums.  My dental hygienist told me that some patients had stains as a result of this mouthwash and some did not.  I guess it depends on the person but I&#x27;m staying away from this product.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy!  This is NOT Clear!  I cannot use dyed products, so to have something listed as Clear and get a huge BIG bottle of BLUE really ticks me off!.  Cannot use, have to give it away, a $22 gift!  Bah.</li>
            <li> Very bad product. Turns teeth brown and causes loss of taste. This product legally should be removed from all stores until further notice.</li>
            <li> Just a couple of weeks ago, I received a bottle of this Crest Pro Health Multi-Protection mouthwash in the mail from Crest. I have been using it every day, twice a day as instructed on the bottle. Overall, I have to say that I am really impressed with the product and I love the results I have recieved. For starters, I have never been a huge fan of mouthwash because my mouth is so darn sensitive! Usually after brushing my teeth, it burns just to drink a glass of semi-cold water... So for me, mouthwash has always been nice in the aspect that it freshens breath, but it has been a pain because it does not feel the greatest to use. To my surprise, using this mouthwash did not burn my mouth at all. This is the first time I have EVER used mouthwash that DIDN&#x27;T burn my mouth. If you can&#x27;t tell, I am completely thrilled about that. Second, the mouthwash tastes great and smells great as well. I have noticed over the years that some mouthwashes will say &amp;#34;clean mint,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;sweet mint,&amp;#34; etc.. But do not taste that great or do not smell the greatest either. This mouthwash has really freshened my breath. (I asked my husband who can at times speak his mind a little bit too much. Haha!) Third, overall my teeth feel healthier. I&#x27;m not going to lie to you and say that this mouthwash has fixed every little problem in my mouth, say that it has made my teeth pearly white, or go as far to say that it has replaced my routine dental exams because hey.. It&#x27;s just that awesome. No, this mouthwash hasn&#x27;t done any of that, but I do notice a huge difference in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I initially received this as a sample in the mail for free, but I definitely plan on buying this from now on in the future. My husband and I both really love this mouthwash. I can&#x27;t honestly think of a single thing that either of us disliked about this product.</li>
            <li> Started to get brown stains in between my bottom, front teeth.  I did some research online to try and figure out what was causing it and came across the reviews on Amazon.  This product should be taken off the market.</li>
            <li> Ive just started using this product ( got a free sample) and so far so good. No burning sensation when I gargle and my breath stays fresh through lunch! I am a heavy coffee drinker and this product still leaves my mouth feeling clean. I also notice after brushing my teeth feel amazing too. I will review again after using the bottle longer.</li>
            <li> I love the taste of this mouthwash...protection.  After using it for just a few days, along with the toothpaste, my teeth feel a lot better and I believe they are getting stronger.  These were delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> I recently tried crest pro health multi protection.i definitely recommend it I&#x27;ve used listerine for years thinking that the burning sensation meant it worked.well ever since I&#x27;ve tried crest pro health multi protection I changed my mind about having to burn my mouth for it to work.crest pro health works great and leaves your mouth feeling clean all day.i definitely recommend this product!😊</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other mouthwash brands and I personally like this one the best. It does not burn as harshly as the others which is a big plus to me since I could barely keep the others on my mouth in the allotted time.</li>
            <li> So I was able to sample this product for free thanks to BuzzAgent!&lt;br /&gt;I actually enjoy the mouthwash so far have been using it for about a week and haven&#x27;t noticed any &amp;#34;stains&amp;#34; or anything like that&lt;br /&gt;I have been tons of complements on my teeth and how minty my breath smells throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;I defiantly get a clean feeling from it.. but I have noticed that for a mouthwash that&#x27;s alcohol free it burns like crazy&lt;br /&gt;I assumed the first time it was just cleaning super well but now it seems like it&#x27;s all the time it&#x27;s super intense!</li>
            <li> UPDATE: APRIL 10, 2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last time: There is absolutely nothing wrong with the product, if it there was the FDA and Proctor and Gamble would take the product off the shelves. The fact is that a small minority of people because of their body chemistry and condition of their teeth experience minor side effects such as staining of the teeth and a temporary loss of taste. I like millions of others who use this product, do not experience these side effects. End of story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE OCTOBER 19, 2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Went to dentist last week for cleaning after about 3 years. I been using this Crest Pro-Health for about the same amount of time. Honestly, she said there really isn&#x27;t much to clean. She told me my tartar build up was minimal and ask me how I brush my teeth. I told her I try to brush twice a day, in the morning and at night. Sometimes I skip the nightime brushing and just use the Crest Pro-health. Saying that, I use this product twice a day, morning and night, every night. She was convinced it had to be the Crest Pro-Health. This is the best product for tartar control on the market. No staining, not taste difference after using. Every person is different and some people do experience these side affects from the active ingredient, but the majority of users suffer no side effects at all or else the FDA would of taken this product off the market a long time ago. This is a great mouthwash and recommended it to everyone who does not experience any ill effects from the product.</li>
            <li> If I could give this abomination a zero star review, I would. I&#x27;m a Sonicare user and floss daily. My semi-annual cleanings are stellar -- almost no plaque, three cavities in my life, and all my own teeth. I like to use mouthwash and got tired of Listerine (works well, but not exactly flavorful), so I picked up some Pro-Health, which I used regularly. I don&#x27;t normally look in my mouth, but one evening, after a few months of Pro-Health, I peeled back a lip to examine the roots and gum line, and YEE GODS!! It was like looking in the mouth of a cadaver! Hideous dark brown stains at the root line, and on closer examination some of the same stains between several teeth. I got on the Internet and did a search for teeth brown stains, and there it was -- Crest Pro-Health. I dumped my supply, but nothing I could do would get rid of those stains. Went to the dentist and she removed them with no difficulty. It has now been six months, and I use only Plax and Listerine. Not a trace of the stains.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that when it comes to my oral hygiene (because there&#x27;s an awful lot of $$ in my mouth!) I do everthing I can to keep my teeth in good condition.  So, when I noticed these small brown spots at my bottom gumline, I could not imagine what it could be from.  Yes, I&#x27;m a coffee/tea drinker, but I have been for years, and I have never had any staining like this.  Then, I googled teeth staining, and came across this to my astonishment.  I have been using this for the last month, approximately when I noticed the stains.  I hope my dentist belives me.  I&#x27;m going to try and file a complaint, but from hereon, I will NEVER use another Crest product again.  I&#x27;ve gone back to good old listerine.  It burns, but it doesn&#x27;t stain.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Pro-Health Mouthwash from Crest for about a week. I received a free bottle courtesy of BzzAgent and Crest to provide my review. I love that there is not the alcohol taste in this product, however is does have a strange taste to it. After using a few times you don&#x27;t really notice it. A lot of reviews speak about tooth staining and loss of taste. I have not encountered this, and hope that I don&#x27;t!! I like the product, but wish they would come up with a better tasting flavor. Crest is a top notch brand in my opinion and I trust them greatly with my teeth!</li>
            <li> I really wish I had researched this product before I used it, but who creates a mouthwash that will stain your teeth? I am a coffee drinker who has never had a problem with staining, but this product definitely caused me some embarrassment. Use hydrogen peroxide to rinse if you are afraid of getting oral cancer.</li>
            <li> I picked up this Crest Pro Health Mouth Rinse at Sam&#x27;s Club- was out of my regular mouthwash &amp; figured I&#x27;d try this (and that the flouride might be a nice addition)-- WRONG. I used the rinse twice daily and was not immediately aware of a loss of taste sensation, but within 2 weeks had lost my sensation of sweetness for the first time in my life. Kind of suspected the Pro-Health as this was the only change in my routine. I am in good health otherwise. Continued using for about 2 more weeks and sense of taste worsened so all food tasted bland/different. Just started researching on the web and see numerous others with same problem. Will stop using immediately and hope normal taste will resume soon (I read that taste buds are replaced about every ten days). Perhaps only a small peercentage of users experience this problem, but I sure did. BEWARE!!!! (Crest should provide a warning on the label!)</li>
            <li> My teeth are naturally quite white. I don&#x27;t drink coffee and only drink tea on occasion.  I take good care of my teeth by brushing, flossing and regularly using a Sulca Brush. When I got Invisalign braces I was advised to take my oral hygiene up another notch and use a anti-cavity rinse. I used an Oral B rinse for about six months with excellent results but it was recalled due to manufacturing problems. As a result I switched over to Crest Pro-health. Since using Crest Pro-Health, like many other reviewers on Amazon, I developed very noticable brown stains on my teeth. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with tooth staining before, I haven&#x27;t changed anything else in my approach to oral hygiene and assume that it is because of the Pro-Health. I have stopped using it and do not recommend the product.</li>
            <li> The exact same thing was happening to me and I had no idea WHAT was going on. Then I read the reviews here which made perfect sense!!! Left me with random brown spots in my teeth (I thought they were cavities at first) I bought two packs of it and is through 1/2 of one of them. Now I have to throw them away or something! such waste of money!</li>
            <li> I have used Crest Pro-Health tooth paste and mouth wash for years and I love it. I will not buy anything else. I have never, ever had any staining of my teeth from this product. I have never had my dentist tell me that I have stains, in fact my dentist tells me I have very white teeth (and no I do not whiten my teeth!) I am not sure where the other reviewers are getting these stains from. Perhaps the gallons of coffee, pop/soda, or wine Americans drink in a year. I guess each person has their own results.</li>
            <li> Had no problems with this mouthwash. I really like it and think it&#x27;s held up my teeth and gums well. To be honest i don&#x27;t brush my teeth as often as i should on some days, but i always usually mouthwash with this product and at my last 6 month checkup i got a clean bill of health and the Doctor said, \\&quot;Whatever you&#x27;re doing, keep it up\\&quot;, although i did have quite a bit of plaque build up (which they cleaned off). We can&#x27;t really afford the expensive other mouthwash&#x27;s and i think the price is great for this one. It does sting a bit (which is to be expected) but other than that i don&#x27;t have any problems with it. I think the blue color will stain our teeth somewhat, which is a little annoying, since i think they could make it in white or clear. But overall, in my opinion, this is a 5 star product. Kinda odd to see so many negative reviews. I guess  i&#x27;m the odd man out.</li>
            <li> Just like many of the other reviewers here, this product also stained my teeth. I didn&#x27;t realize until my mom pointed it out to me.. I thought my brushing habits were causing it, but then I remembered the fine print on the back of the label. Avoid this product unless you want brown teeth!</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this mouthwash thanks to Crest and BzzAgent. I have been using this product for almost two months now and I absolutely love the product. It makes my mouth feel so healthy and clean without the painful alcohol burn. I find that I actually use it on a regular basis because I don&#x27;t dread the terrible burn that I associate with mouthwashes. I am definitely converted over to this product as my new go to mouthwash!</li>
            <li> I have had no problems with staining.  Really like the fact of no alcohol and no burning. The mint keeps my breath fresh for hours.</li>
            <li> this product is complete garbage. it has a sickly sweet flavor and it is impossible to gargle as it foams up in your mouth as if you have rabies. it never provided me with the fresh breath feeling that i expect from mouthwashes, and the various reviews that vouch for this product causing stained teeth are alarming. i tossed it out after only using half the bottle.</li>
            <li> I am currently trying this product for free thanks to Crest! Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Rinse has become a staple in my dental care regimen. For the past week I have used the rinse morning and night after brushing and flossing. Before trying the rinse I assumed it would leave a burning effect in my mouth, however, I was pleasantly surprised with its mildness. Although I would consider it mild, it still produces a optimally clean and fresh effect that lasts! The majority of today&#x27;s dental products are classified as &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34;, which can lead to a weaker enamel. I am happy that this product does not whiten, rather, it makes my teeth stronger and healthier from within. The flavor-&amp;#34;Refreshing Clean Mint&amp;#34;-is about as fresh as they come but not overpowering. It also complimented well with the toothpaste flavor that I am already using. After using Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Rinse for a solid week, I am hooked and will be turning to the brand to take care of my smile from now on!</li>
            <li> This product is awful!!  I can&#x27;t believe it is still being sold with all these complaints.  I wish I would have looked at reviews before I bought it.  After the first time using it I thought it burned a little more than it should, but I just put it at the back of my mind.  After using it for 2 days twice a day the left side of my mouth is in pain.  I can&#x27;t drink anything or it causes more pain or even chew!  I can&#x27;t believe they are selling a product like this.  I am hoping the pain goes away.  I looked at other reviews who stated having pain after using it and they said it would go away.  Shame on this company!!  Do not use it!!</li>
            <li> I didnt buy this on amazon but i got it at the store, this has burned my tongue it feels like i have my tongue on a 9 volt battery all day i have used it twice a day for 4 days now, i can also confirm that it does stain your teeth a brown color that you will have to go to the dentist to remove. There is also a chemical taste in your mouth that doesnt go away until 3 or 4 hours. I have been struggling with my dental care and this product really makes me upset now that i had to get my teeth cleaned at the dentist. DO NOT GET THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> It says to use 2x a day, but anymore than once every couple of days and my taste buds are killed off as if i&#x27;ve just eaten a whole package of sour patch kids.  What kind of mouthwash does that? Don&#x27;t waste your money on this mouthwash.  I now only use it once in a while just so I can avoid ruining my tongue.</li>
            <li> I tried crest pro-health multiproction mouthwash and I  think it is a very great mouthwash. I will chose crest over any other mouthwash.</li>
            <li> With @Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Mouthwash in with my daily teeth cleaning, my mouth feels fresh and clean! #GotItFree&lt;br /&gt;I could instantly tell the difference! The feeling that i have while i feel the mouthwash working on my teeth and gums is very refreshing and powerful!</li>
            <li> I have been a long time user of Crest products, but apparently i&#x27;m not much for reading labels.  It wasn&#x27;t until I prepared to write this review that I read the disclaimer about the &amp;#34;darkening&amp;#34; of teeth.  I&#x27;ve never noticed any off coloring as a result of the &amp;#34;Clear Mint&amp;#34; prohealth that I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently received a free sample of the product #gotitfree and have transformed from a casual user ie.once every day or once every other day to a regular user.  Twice daily use leads to noticeably fresher breath in the mornings for me.  Only time will tell about the better dental check-ups!</li>
            <li> First thing Crest Pro-Heath is my number one mouthwash . From the first time you use Crest  mouthwash it is like winter in your mouth. The cool minty taste leaves you feeling like all germs in your mouth have been conquered and the feeling last for so long you know your teeth are cleaned. Using it over short time cuts my  time at dentist office as it prevents and reduces plaque build up. And who does not want to cut time having  your teeth  scarp. We all have better things to do with our time. Also I love that it is  alcohol-free so no alcohol burn. So give Crest Pro Health Multi-Protection a try. &amp;#34; I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have been using listerine for the past year first time trying crest pro health mouth wash and I loved how it leaves your mouth fresh and kills 99%of bacteria in your mouth..</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest, I got to try this product full size for FREE! I&#x27;ll admit i never really liked using mouthwash before, it burns and I&#x27;m kind of a wimp. But the alcohol-free formula really made a difference. I have been using it twice everyday for about two weeks and I will say that my mouth felt cleaner for longer on day one. You can feel confident with fresh breath and know that your fighting plaque and gingivitis, without the burn that your used to. I would definitely recommend this mouthwash to anyone that wants a healthier mouth.</li>
            <li> I love this mouth wash so far! The taste is really good and it makes my teeth feel alot cleaner than just brushing them alone. The only down side I&#x27;ve found is that it leaves a kind of film in your mouth but that&#x27;s taken care of by gargling water after wards. I highly recommend trying this mouth wash! And you&#x27;re dentist will love your cleaner teeth :) I even got to try it as a promotion although I&#x27;ll be for sure buying some in the future!</li>
            <li> I have been trying this product free from bzzagent.com. So far I love it. This mouth wash is alcohol free which means it does not burn your mouth. My teeth feel shiny and clean. I would highly recommend crest pro health mouth wash to every one. From now on this is the only mouth wash I&#x27;ll be using.</li>
            <li> It works wonders for me. Leaves my mouth feeling fresh and without the burning feeling. I Started using especially more and am talking about it do to I received a free bottle of it through bazzagent.com campaign #GotItFree to help promote this product and my own personal experience. Crest Pro-Health since it came out and fell in love with it immediately. I enjoy using it at night right before bed as well as my three-year old daughter. She loves using it and will always ask me to let her have some after I brush her teeth. If a 3 year old likes it I am pretty sure you will like it.   I would encourage everyone to give this a try and have your own experience.</li>
            <li> Love this mouthwash! No burn and my mouth feels fresh for hours!! 😬</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Mouthwash! Ive been using it everyday for several weeks, and I love Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Mouthwash! I love how it gets rid of my bad breath,kills germs and keeps teeth feeling cleaner longer. I dont get the burning I normally get when using a mouthwash it just make my mouth feel fresh and clean. I read it helps with dental checkups and I have one in a few weeks so Im excited to see what my dentist says on my visit. I highly recommend buying Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Mouthwash it a great product. I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
            <li> I have use this product and I love it. My teenage son also uses it and never had problems with his or my teeth getting colored. But that&#x27;s just us. I also got this product free for me to try and write a review.</li>
            <li> I got a free bottle from Bzzagent and unfortunately it was just too strong for me. I guess I thought since it was alcohol free it would be really mild, but, while it didn&#x27;t burn as bad as the ones with alcohol, I definitely felt it and my tastebuds were funny for about 2 hours after I used it. Maybe better for someone else. #GotItFree</li>
            <li> Been using this for about 2 weeks now and love how my mouth feels and taste. Feels fresh and do not worry as much about my breath. Even in close situations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to try out and use it two weeks now and really love it. I like that it does not burn my mouth and love the taste and after taste. I can really feel it working on my gums and teeth. My gums would bleed a little and now they have completely stopped. Personally I think it does everything it says it will, like fighting gingivitis and killing all those nasty bad breath germs. Only thing I wish is that it still had a childproof top, as I have a soon to be 2 year old that loves to drink and eat anything she gets her hands on. Definitely keeping on top shelf 😆</li>
            <li> I personally love this product! I have used many different mouthwashes as i have a fairly sensitive mouth and this one is one of the most mild that I have used. It leaves my mouth feeling refreshed and genuinely clean and fresh. It seems to last a long time as far as freshness of breath goes to which is always a plus. I would recommend this product to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a free product for the purpose of my review. All opinions stated are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Thank you BzzAgent for allowing me to try this product for free. My review of this product is 100% my opinion.  I love the fact Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Mouthwash is alcohol free. The fresh mint flavor smells and taste great. This product has not burned my mouth once.  I have been using Crest Pro-Health Mouthwash for two weeks now. I have recommended this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> Great mouth wash, isn&#x27;t overly minty for those who don&#x27;t like mint, and my favorite part is that it really doesn&#x27;t burn when you use it, since it is alcohol-free.  It also doesn&#x27;t say that it is a whitening product, but I&#x27;ve definitely noticed some coffee stains that have faded.</li>
            <li> It works very well, great product !!&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review thru a trial with smiley360. I have been using it for a few days thus far it leaves my breath fresh and minty.  It doesn&#x27;t leave the burn that some other mouthwashes have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks now. I love how fresh and simple the flavor is. I have a past of dealing with gum disease and have seen a big difference in my gums since using this.I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I like it. After reading reviews about the brown stains, I am no longer using this product.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see so many negative reviews.  I haven&#x27;t noticed the staining issues.  Perhaps that&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t simply gargle with this product.  I also brush with the Crest Complete, Extra Whitening + scope tooth paste.  The mouth wash does feel as if it kills germs, reduces plaque, and freshens my breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other advantages:  it is alcohol free and it doesn&#x27;t burn like some other brands.</li>
            <li> I love this mouthwash!  It leaves me feeling clean and refreshed, I can use it as often as I want, and it doesn&#x27;t leave that burning feeling like alcohol-based washes to.  I received it free from BzzAgent for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> As the other users mentioned, I had my tongue numb after the first use for 12 hours. My sense of taste is gone and even bottled water tastes salty to me. Even a Chewing Gum did not help.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, no alcohol, so it&#x27;s easier to rinse for the recommended period of time. But when I looked in the mirror this morning, I noticed my teeth were a light shade of brown along the gumline. Had recently started using Crest mouthwash, so on a whim I googled it, and low and behold I was not imagining it. My fiance had also complained that his sense of taste was off after using it, but I thought he was imagining it. Guess I owe him an apology.</li>
            <li> That is how badly this product stained my teeth. I had some buildup of brown stains over time while using this product, but the real shock was when my lower teeth became stained dark brown in a single day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ran into a dental office that afternoon because I was so freaked out. The dentist first did an X-ray to make sure my teeth hadn&#x27;t *died.* Because that&#x27;s how bad they looked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, Crest. I&#x27;m done with your products now.</li>
            <li> I Bought This Last Night at Walmart thinking it was going to do wonders because its crest and i do love there toothpaste but this stuff that i have on used twice my teeth started hurting my taste buds feel like they have been burnt off i wonder what did they do and why is this being sold still im so glad i read reviews today and didnt use it long enough for my teeth to turn brown but i wonder why they are still selling this and from this i no longer want to use any crest items</li>
            <li> Do not use this product!! Unless you want your teeth a nice shade of BROWN.  This stains your teeth worse than coffee, tobacco, red wine, and tea combined.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice and both times i lose my ability to taste for hours after. everything has an odd sweetness to it nothing else</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t EVER use this product, unless you want stained, sensitive teeth! I&#x27;ll preface by saying that I&#x27;m in my 20s, don&#x27;t drink more than a couple cups of coffee/tea a week, I&#x27;m at a healthy weight that I maintain mostly by food choices, and I&#x27;ve always been a bit lax in the flossing department, but I brush every day. It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m shoving my face full of crap and then complaining about the sugar-rot like it&#x27;s someone else&#x27;s fault. This year, II made it my New Year&#x27;s resolution to get on top of my dental routine, and a couple months ago I added Crest Pro-Health mouthwash to my routine. I really should have looked up some of the scary stuff online, but who has time for that at the grocery store? Within a month of morning and evening use (the bottle recommends 2x daily for &amp;#34;Better Dental Check-ups&amp;#34;) and flossing, I had HORRIBLE brownish stains along the edges and gums of my lower front teeth, and flossing those teeth was more painful and sensitive than when I first started the dreaded flossing routine! I religiously followed the directions to wait before eating, so morning coffee was not the culprit, and I was so desperate to find a solution that I went online and found HUNDREDS of other people with the exact same problem!! How Crest can continue to market this product is beyond me, and their PR response is a patronizing joke. &amp;#34;Dirty teeth means it&#x27;s working!&amp;#34;, indeed! Thankfully, my dentist was able to clean up the mess with my normal checkup cleaning, but I feel incredibly sorry for the people who are looking for healthy teeth and end up with terrible stains. Shame on you, Crest/P&amp;G!</li>
            <li> WOW! this stuff must be a miracle diet because it makes you not want to eat anything. Used it (because it was under the sink) and right after had a burning sensation on tongue that would not go away. Waited an hour and a half, had some salami and wondered why it was so sickly sweet. Tried some lemon juice to see the opposite and it tasted like pure battery acid. Tried a pinch of salt on the tongue after and tasted like nothing I have ever had (terrible by the way). The active ingredient in this apparently affects the majority of the population in ruining your taste buds for hours to days. Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> I gave  a bottle to my Mom and she loves it! I like how fresh it leaves my mouth. Clean and fresh and alcohol free!</li>
            <li> I got the opportunity to try Crest® Pro-Health Multi-Protection Mouthwash for free through BzzAgent. I am honestly really happy with the product. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and I don&#x27;t have any complaints. There is no burning sensation like you get using a mouth wash that includes alcohol in it, which would make me hesitant to gargle in the past. The flavor is pretty good, too. It&#x27;s like a sweet mint flavor and it keeps my mouth tasting good for awhile after I use it. I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in plaque or anything, but I didn&#x27;t see any to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a good mouthwash and I&#x27;d totally recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love this! Makes my mouth feel so clean! It doesn&#x27;t burn my mouth like other mouthwashes I&#x27;ve tried!I receive this from Crest and BzzAgent, but had used it in the past. I had forgotten how great my teeth feel afterwards!</li>
            <li> I love the taste because it is not that strong, I love that it is alcohol free so it wont age my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;No staining or adverse effects at all and I have 4 veneers-can,t imagine what other are talking about&lt;br /&gt;Love this product and endorse 100%&lt;br /&gt; &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Through BzzAgent I was able to try this product. I was a little scared because it says on the bottle that it may stain your teeth. I also had a problem with my teeth being more sensitive since using this. I do like the color and flavor of the mouthwash though. There is a small burn but not as bad as regular mouthwash!</li>
            <li> I received a free full size sample of this product from BZZAGENT to try it out and I thought the product was wonderful. Kept my mouth feeling fresh and clean all day. Loved using it before bed and waking up the next morning with a fresh minty taste in my mouth. I noticed that even after brushing and flossing this made my mouth feel cleaner. Theres no alcohol so it doesnt burn as bad as other mouth washes but it did make my eyes water a bit. Overall this product is great :)</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this wonderful product.  My opinions are completely my own.  I have actually used Crest products, most recently this one, for many years.  I would not change to any other brand.  I love the way they protect your teeth and make your mouth feel clean.  The taste is not overpowering.  And they do what they claim, it has been over twenty years since I have had a cavity.  I would gladly try any new product they offer.</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a bit disappointed in this product from Crest. I have always been a fan of how clean and pretty Crest products have helped my teeth stay; however, I did not like the aftertaste that this mouthwash leaves. I don&#x27;t use it every time I brush because I feel like it dries my mouth out and leaves a stale taste behind. I do like that it is alcohol-free but I don&#x27;t get a good, clean feeling using this. My husband complained about the aftertaste too.</li>
            <li> I have no idea where all the negative reviews are coming from. My experience with Crest Pro Health has been nothing less that Great! Got it Free thanks to BzzAgent. To start I love the no alcohol no sting because it really does what it&#x27;s suppose to do without having to gargle with Fire! My teeth feel much cleaner and look far whiter than before using Crest Pro Health. I have nothing to complain about with this mouthwash.</li>
            <li> The mouth is full of bacteria (hundreds of species were found in a recent study of the salivary microbiome) so the Cetylpyridinium Chloride anti-microbial in this mouthwash is the primary reason I bought it. Having gone through two 1.5 litre bottles I have been very happy indeed both with the taste and efficacy of this mouthwash.I use it in conjunction with a professional ultrasonic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I loved this flavor just as much as the \\&quot;tartar protection\\&quot; one. it&#x27;s not too harsh like some. Pleasant taste and makes my mouth feel super clean. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I received a free bottle of Crest Pro Health mouth wash from Smiley360 and am very pleased with the product. I love the refreshing taste that leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean. I also love that it&#x27;s alcohol free and won&#x27;t burn my mouth.  It works great to freshen breath in between brushing as well.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  It has a nice taste and it doesn&#x27;t burn like other mouthwashes.  My husband and I really enjoy using it and it&#x27;s actually the first kind that we have kept up with using.  We like Crest toothpaste too so it&#x27;s not a big surprise.  This makes your mouth feel really clean and also gives you fresh breath.  It&#x27;s got my vote!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample bottle from Smiley360.  All comments and opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the bzz campaign, I received a free crest pro-health multi-protection mouth wash and it&#x27;s just great!!! it keeps your mouth clean and fresh, it gets rid of that disgusting hard to reach plaque behind your teeth that causes bad breath :/, there&#x27;s no tingling, and you only have to use it for 30 seconds!!! it&#x27;s the best!!</li>
            <li> So far, I have used the Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection rinse only a few times. The flavor of the rinse seems similar to other mouthwashes I have used before. So, the flavor is good. I find the rinse to work well on making my mouth feel fresh after using once per day. I like that the rinse does not burn in my mouth like some other rinses do. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 mounts now and it has been great i have not had any problems out of it and my mouth is much cleaner now than before using it and it stays clean all day there is no strong achool taste so that is great although I think that the ment taste is a bit to strong for my liking by love the product I got my full sized bottle for bzzagent</li>
            <li> I received the Crest Pro-Health multi protection mouthwash complimentary from Crest through a BzzAgent campaign. I like that the product is alcohol free and does not burn. I did not notice any staining after a months use of the product. If anything, my mouth felt more fresh than usual. I added the mouthwash to my dental regimen 2 times a day. In the morning I brush with sensitive toothpaste, followed by flossing, followed by waterpik, and lastly mouthwash. In the evening it is brush and mouthwash only. The mouthwash is indeed minty but I also get a faint licorice taste that I do not particularly like. Depending on the packaging, some bottles may be more child safe than others. The bottle that I received did not have the &#x27;squeeze to open&#x27; safety feature that I am accustomed to seeing with mouthwashes.</li>
            <li> If nice looking pearly whites is what you want, then stay away from this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently got invisalign, and was brushing/flossing my teeth after every meal. I added the crest mouthwash to my routine to keep my teeth &amp;#34;cleaner..&amp;#34; I was upping my hygiene game, but started to notice my teeth getting more dull looking with brown stains between each teeth. I was thinking it was the invisalign to blame since I had pretty white teeth before!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I then saw my dentist for a normal check up and even she comment how stained my teeth seemed. I explained to her my routine, from toothpaste brand to mouthwash. She had another patient who experienced something similar and found crest mouthwash to be the culprit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I took on the experiment and only brushed and flossed my teeth following my dentist appt. NO CREST MOUTHWASH. After one week without the crest pro health mouthwash, my teeth were noticeably whiter and the brown stains diminished! Argggg I really wished I read these reviews beforehand! My brown stains are not completely gone, but now I&#x27;ll have to fork out so some extra $$ to get my teeth whitened. Save your money!</li>
            <li> Buying this mouth wash has never disappointed me and the company lives up to its reputation.Never leaves a after taste.</li>
            <li> My dentist told me to start using an alcohol free rinse at my cleaning 4 months ago. I didn&#x27;t like it at first because it left a strange after taste that would make everything I ate taste strange for about 2 hours after rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About one month into use I noticed a weird stain in between two of my teeth. I thought it was plaque and tried pretty hard to remove it with floss but it would not come off. Since then I have had *dark* stains develop in between most of my teeth. I floss, brush, and waterpik daily and have never had this problem before. Stay away from this product at all costs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is the mouthwash that required the user to gargle for at least a min.  I&#x27;m rather impatient when it comes to gargling that long.  There&#x27;s a similar product (same brand) that has the user rinse for 30 seconds, twice a day.  I like using that product.  This product itself does its purpose.</li>
            <li> I literally have chemical burns on the inside of my lower lip and roof of my mouth from using this product this morning/last night. I&#x27;m like incredulous that they would allow this product to be sold!! But who can I even complain to? I&#x27;m going to have to just wait for my mouth to heal itself, but seriously, wtf Crest...</li>
            <li> Stained my teeth something awful.  I thought it was soda, tea, coffee, etc. and tried cutting back, but it got worse.  I had switched to Crest Pro Health mouthwash a few months ago and it started immediately, though I didn&#x27;t put it together myself.  My dental hygienist told me today what caused it and (thank goodness) took an extra 20 minutes to clean my teeth and make sure it was all taken off!  Plus, it tastes bad and leaves a nasty after taste.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this!!  I have been having problems with staining of my teeth over the past 6 months despite brushing and flossing. At my dental check today, the dentist told me many of her patients using Crest Pro Health mouthwash have had the same problem with staining/discoloring of teeth.  She suggested I use Listerine instead.</li>
            <li> I thought I was imaging the loss of taste in my mouth and the stains on my teeth from using this product, until I read the other review posted here.  I would not recommend this at all.</li>
            <li> Never buy this product. This \\&quot;Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection Mouth Rinse\\&quot; caused brown stains on my lower teeth just after 3 weeks of using. I was wondering what could be the reason of the brown strain; later discovered the bitter fact from the reviews of this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product not on Amazon but should have read the reviews first. I only used it for 2 days and almost didn&#x27;t wake up on 1-20-14. I am very lucky that I did. I was gagging, my tongue was swelling and my throat was swollen out past my chin! I took a Benadryl and went to the ER. I am on Benadryl, Prednisone and have to carry an Epipen all from this mouthwash! I have seen my Allergist Doctor and tomorrow I see a Ear, Nose, Throat Doctor as I am still having issues. I have been a Crest user since I was a kid and this is the first time I tried the mouthwash and it TRIED TO KILL ME! Don&#x27;t use this product. I have seen over 500 consumer complaints on the internet about this very thing since then. It is not just me that this is happening to. My bills are skyrocketing from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update as of Jan 23rd. Saw a ENT Doctor today and I still have residual allergic reaction swelling.  More predinsone and benedryl with a recheck next week. I haven&#x27;t used this mouthwash since Sunday night and it&#x27;s still causing issues! My doctor and I are reporting it to the FDA. If you have a reaction to this product please also report it to the FDA to get it off the shelves!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update as of Feb 10th. Still have jaw and tongue swelling and more medical bills. I just reported it to the Better Business Buerau.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***This product won&#x27;t get off the shelves unless your report it to the FDA and the BBB online. It is very easy to do both. Just doing a review like this won&#x27;t get it off the market. Please do the reports****</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now.  It has a great minty taste and isn&#x27;t too overpowering.  I&#x27;ve read a lot of reviews complaining about staining but I haven&#x27;t seen that.  It&#x27;s a good mouthwash and if you&#x27;re really concerned with staining then use a different brand.  I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I was given this product to try for free from bzzagent and crest. At first I was like it is just a mouth wash. But after trying it my mouth feels cleaner and my teeth look whiter.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to get a healthier mouth and whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> Just tried this product this evening and the after-taste it left was like if someone had sprayed hair spray directly in my mouth - and the worst part is the taste won&#x27;t go away!  I returned it, got a different flavor (the purple stuff) and it was even worse!!  Gave some to my roommate to see if it was just me and it wasn&#x27;t.  I can&#x27;t believe Crest is still selling this.  Worst garbage ever!!!  Don&#x27;t they bother to test this stuff before releasing it to the public?  Tony</li>
            <li> My teeth have never had issues with discoloring and I get regular 6 month dental checkups. I was given a trial of Crest Pro Health Multi-purpose mouthwash to use after the last checkup. I recently started noticing patches of brownish gray staining on my front teeth and in the corners between the teeth. It&#x27;s embarrassing and I researched to find out what could have caused this so quickly with no diet changes. Then I read that this product I started using is not only NOT making my smile better, but it is the reason for the staining. I&#x27;M NOT HAPPY CREST! Research your products better before releasing them to the public.   Now I have to see the dentist again just to see if they can buff the stains off or see if I need some sort of bleaching to correct it.</li>
            <li> Used this to help my gums so I could look good for the dentist again. I&#x27;m tired of his lectures to brush and floss and rinse more. So I saw the add on tv, boosting to do just that.   Used it for a week and ruined my white teeth.   I am SO mad. I&#x27;m going to return it.</li>
            <li> It made my lower set of teeth brown as crap. Why is this still on the market after so long?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using alcohol-free mouthwashes for years now, but my one problem with them is that I&#x27;m always getting a filmy gel in my mouth afterwards.  It&#x27;s pretty gross and really annoying.  I noticed that with the Crest Pro-Health, I didn&#x27;t have that issue.  It was an issue big enough to make me permanently switch to Crest Pro-Health and highly recommend it to others!  I also found that my breath stayed fresh longer than with other brands, and that equates cleaner to me!</li>
            <li> I usually use Listerine and have successfully for years.  Bought this because it was on sale and I have lost my job. I was trying to economize.  Now it will cost me more to remove the brown stains that have developed atop and between my bottom front teeth!  FDA site still does not pull up problem in search so they are evidently not taking this seriously.  Complaints are all over the internet though!  Wish I had known this would happen before using though.  I have never had staining in my life--even when I used to drink lots of coffee and soda (caffeine now makes my heart rate elevate too much).  This is disgusting!  The Crest website claims that this is rare (doesn&#x27;t seem to be from the volume of complaints that I find online--there are surely many more who have not complained online) and even that this is a good sign of dead bacteria!  What a load!  I used Crest for many years, but this has soured me.  I will not use any of their products now.  Not sure how I am going to get rid of these stains.</li>
            <li> Short and sweet: Look at all these reviews.  Too many people are losing their sense of taste for this to be a fluke.  Why is Crest still selling a product that completely kills your sense of taste?  I was so afraid I would never get it back. Steer clear of Crest pro health mouthwash!</li>
            <li> I have been using Crest Pro-health Multi-Protectino Alcohol Free Clean/Clear Mint Mouthwash for a while now and I am quite fond of it. I received it free to try out and so far I like it. I&#x27;ve noticed a few people commenting about it changing the color of their teeth, I have not had this problem. I like that it leaves my breath feeling fresh, I&#x27;m a big fan of mint. And if anything my teeth are looking brighter. I&#x27;m not sure what in it would even make your teeth brown in color, maybe something they&#x27;re doing in combination with it. At any rate I am quite fond of this mouthwash and would choose Crest before other competitor brands. Anything that helps gingivitis and plaque gets a big thumbs-up from me!</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Mouthwash cleans up what my toothpaste leaves behind and lasts longer!! Crest sent this to me for free and i would definitly buy this in the future!!</li>
            <li> I began using this product after receiving a free full sized sample from Smiley360 and I have to say that my mind has been changed. I noticed fresher breath, longer lasting clean feeling, and less sensitivity within 2 weeks of using Crest-Pro Health rinse every day. I recommend to anyone who is looking for a boost in oral health to challenge yourself to use this product for 2 weeks and you&#x27;ll see the difference!!</li>
            <li> I was fairly pleased by this mouthwash, Ive only used it a handful of times but so far I love it. Makes my mouth feel fresh and it doesnt burn my mouth and no bad breath! I was lucky enough to try this for free from crest.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. And I was pleasantly surprised to see how great it actually is. I will definitely be buying this product from now on.</li>
            <li> Love my Crest Pro-Health Mouthwash that I got as a promotion from BzzAgent.com. No over-powering alcohol taste, just a subtle, sweet flavor. No burning after finished, just the right  amount of clean tingle that lasts long after rinsing. It has even helped with my tooth sensitivity!</li>
            <li> I AM A MEMEBER OF SMILEY360 AND RECIEVED CREST PRO-HEALTH PROTECHTION ALCOHOL FREE MINT FLAVOR FOR FREE AND I HAVE READ THE REVIEWS STATING ABOUT BROWN SPOTS ON THE TEETH I HAVE USED IT A COUPLE OF WEEKS AND IT IS NOT BAD TASTING AND NICE SMELL NOT TO STRONG AND I HAVE NOT NOTICE ANYTHING BAD I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this mouthwash from bzzagent. I&#x27;m not a fan of the burning from alcohol in other mouthwashs but was a little skeptical of one without the alcohol.  But after a couple weeks of use I love it!! It had a good taste. You can feel it working and keeps my breath fresh. I will continue to use this mouthwash!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the pleasure of trying Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Mouthwash free, and I am absolutely a believer. I have since switched from my norm of Listerene to Crest Pro-Health. It leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh, without the burn!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, several times after using this product, I have noticed my teeth turning a light yellow color. I since discontinued use of this product.</li>
            <li> I was given this product to try from BZZAGENT  - I have never been very diligent with any routine orally besides brushing my teeth but I make sure I use this product at least once a day! My biggest problem was my breath - no matter how many times I brushed or what mouthwash I used my breath ended up needing a refresher about 3 or 4 hours later. When I use this in the mornings I honestly don&#x27;t have to worry about it - it keeps my breath smelling nice! I have not noticed any Brown stains as other reviewers have mentioned in the past which leads me to believe they have updated their formula. My teeth feel cleaner, my breath stays fresh and my gums feel better as well (they hurt before) this is only 2 weeks in to using it. I would definitely look into purchasing this on my own, and would recommend if you are struggling with your dental care.</li>
            <li> I received a free bottle of Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection from Crest.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Crest, I have been using the Crest ProHealth Mouthwash for a little over a week, also I am brushing my teeth twice a day, it really does prevent and reduce plaque buildup, I am rarely having to floss.  When I do floss, rarely am I getting plaque on the string.&lt;br /&gt;It does freshen breath but I feel the burn of alcohol, it is not intense but the feeling is still there.&lt;br /&gt;By using Crest ProHealth toothpaste with the Crest ProHealth mouthwash keeps teeth cleaner for longer with that smooth teeth feeling.  I love that feeling especially when coming back from the dentist, clean refreshing feeling in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free through Smiley360 for a review! I like this mouthwash! It has a good taste and no burning until after I spit it out and my mouth kinda burned for a few seconds and it went away. It left my mouth feeling clean!!</li>
            <li> I love this mouthwash. My mouth feels fresh afterwards and I don&#x27;t burn my tongue when I use it. I feel like my breath smells better for longer and my teeth feel really squeaky clean! I&#x27;m so glad crest sent me a free trial so I could give this amazing product a try before I go out and buy it.</li>
            <li> This mouth wash is missing that fresh tingle clean feeling that I want/expect from a mouthwash. It also leaves an odd slimed like feeling on my tongue.  Really love the Crest ProHealth toothpaste, so was a little bit disappointed with the mouthwash. I was provided this mouthwash for free, courtesy of Bzzagent and Crest for product review purposes.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been using this for a few weeks and we both really like it. We will continue to use it and now my teenagers are using it and love it also. It seems to work a lot longer than anything else we have used and it doesn&#x27;t have that alcohol burn like others we have tried.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash makes my mouth feel more cleaner after every use and leaves my mouth feeling minty fresh.</li>
            <li> I use this product every day I have never had any problems with it at all.</li>
            <li> I received a free bottle of Crest Pro-health Multipurpose Mouthwash to test compliments of www.bzzagent.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for about a month now and am pleased with the results.  My mouth feels fresher and my teeth feel cleaner in between brushings.  I have also noticed that my breath is fresher in the morning! That&#x27;s a definite plus :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mouthwash tastes good (minty) but is not overpowering! It does not burn at all (even my 6 year old likes it).  My gums have always had a tendency to bleed but the bleeding has been minimized since I started using this mouthwash.  Looking forward to my dental appointment in January to see what my dentist thinks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give Crest Pro-Health mouthwash a try for yourself! You have nothing to lose...except bad breath :)</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review, but the opinions are 100% my own. I enjoyed the fresh taste and the clean feeling that it left in my mouth, however, the sensation didn&#x27;t last as long as other mouthwashes. While this product is alcohol free, it is also fluoride free. I am in need of a mouthwash that has fluoride so this isn&#x27;t my first pick, but it does a decent job for commercial mouth washes</li>
            <li> I am not a mouth wash person,  but I got the opportunity to review this product from bzz agent so I decided to give it a try. I hate most mouth washes because they always burn my mouth and for some reason locks up my jaw, but I actually like this one more than most. It does not have a strong burning taste like the Crest Pro Health Clinical does. I do wish it would give me fresh breath for a longer period of time which is why I only give it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;As i member of Smiley360 i was able to try this product for free..&lt;br /&gt;I really liked it cleaned my mouth and teeth ..fresh clean taste and does not burn.I would totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I received Crest Pro-health to try for free from smiley360 for the purpose of my review. I like this product After two week of use I feel that  my mouth is so clean and refreshed.The taste is soft ,does not burn you mouth because this mouthwash is alochol free.I will continue to buy Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection Alcohol Free, Clean Mint/Clear Mint. The opinion is 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and find it to be one of my favorite mouthwashes. I recently received a free bottle via Smiley 360 to review. I hadn&#x27;t used mouthwash in awhile and i forgot how Crest Pro Health makes my teeth feel extra clean. It has a mild and minty taste which is very refreshing compared to Listerine brand harsh tastes.I like that it is alcohol free because it doesn&#x27;t have a Listerine burn. Overall it is a refreshing mouthwash with a great taste.</li>
            <li> Works great, Just as described!</li>
            <li> I recently recieved this. To test. Ive used other creast mouth washes such as the tartar control one this one has made a improve ment to my daily brushing of my teeth, my nreath smells fresher, my teeth feel cleaner and i feel that its aspects of work works great for my teeth. I use it with my crest whitenin.  iT HELPS*  *Prevent and reduce plaque buildup  *Kills germs  *Fight bad breath  *Prevent and reduce gingivitis for healthy gums  *Keep teeth cleaner longer, versus brushing alone( MORNING BREATH BE DAMNED)Avoid the burn of alcohol; 12-hour protection against plaque and gingivitis by using in your daily oral care routine; Prevent and reduce gingivitis for healthy gums; Keep teeth cleaner longer, versus brushing alone.  \\&quot;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product. I like that it doesn&#x27;t have alcohol. I leaves a fresh and clean feeling in your mouth that really lasts. It also makes me feel good to know that it is protecting my teeth. I will definetly continue to buy this product for my family.</li>
            <li> For a couple months now Crest Pro-health multi-protection has been our favorite brand of mouth wash.  We purchase it about every two weeks.  I am sensitive to the &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; of most mouthwashes and Crest is just right for me.  Our mouths feel clean and refreshed!&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> It really works,just has a strange after taste and foam</li>
            <li> I received this product for free, and all opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this mouthwash because it&#x27;s alcohol-free, so it doesn&#x27;t burn my kids&#x27; mouths. It&#x27;s minty, but not spicy-minty. I have no trouble getting my 4 kids to use the mouthwash, but beware that it CAN cause staining. It does seem counterintuitive for a mouthwash to cause brown staining.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample from Smiley360 and my opinions are my own, but I love the product!  The taste was great, no burning like the brands containing alcohol have and it worked great for me!  I will definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that I tried this because I am now a convert to no-alcohol mouthwash. It has a very pleasant flavor and absolutely no alcohol &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34;. The effects last longer than I had expected and using it at night definitely helps prevent morning breath. As usual, I can always trust a Crest product. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Absolutly love crest pro health it leaves my mouth feeling fresh and breath smelling great this is def my fav mouthwash</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years now and I love it. My mouth stays fresh and clean feeling all day. I have had great success in using this product with Crest Pro Health toothpaste, at my last dental cleaning my dentist was amazed at how little tartar I had after he realized I hadn&#x27;t had my teeth cleaned in close to five years. I credit the Crest Pro Health mouthwash and toothpaste, I use it daily and have had no problem with staining.  \\&quot;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.\\&quot;As i member of Smiley360 i was able to try this product for free.</li>
            <li> One of the best products I have tried! Keeps my mouth clean for most part of the day .</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product! I love that it isn&#x27;t so strong in flavor that your eyes water when using it. My breath stays fresh for hours and I really like the benefits for my gums and teeth. I use this everyday and have had my 8 yr old try it and she loves it as well. I received this free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite brands of mouthwash.  I feel like my mouth is actually clean compared to other ones that feel less than clean before i even exit my bathroom. I would recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> Helps keep my breathe extra fresh and teeth are healthy and strong</li>
            <li> I have been using this mouthwash for a few weeks now.  My teeth feel clean.  My breath is fresh.  The part I really like is that it does not burn.  I have read the other reviews about brown teeth,  I have not experienced any of this. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Best mouthwash ever !! Keep mouth feeling clean and breath fresh for hours . Not to mention how white my teeth has gotten</li>
            <li> I really liked this, i read the reviews and i had the opposite experience, my mouth felt great after using it as well as my teeth, i will use this from now on. \\&quot;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any of the nasty side effects that other people have talked about (stains on teeth, trouble with taste buds). My problem with this mouthwash is that I just didn&#x27;t really feel like my mouth was that clean after I used it. After spitting it out, I even had a feeling in my mouth and on my lips similar to the way I feel after eating candy. Maybe they just put too much flavoring in it (in my opinion, P&amp;G really overdoes the flavoring in its toothpastes). This product just doesn&#x27;t inspire a lot of confidence in me.</li>
            <li> OKAY SO, SO FAR I JUST LOVE THIS PRODUCT! RIGHT AWAY IT MADE MY MOUTH FEEL, CLEANER, FRESHER, AND ITS NOT STRONG AT ALL LIKE OTHER MOUTHWASHES, OF COURSE I HAVEN&#x27;T BEEN USING LONG BUT PLAN TO CONTINUE USE TO SEE THE PROGRESS THIS PRODUCT CAN GIVE ME! GO PRO! SO FAR ITS GREAT FOR BATTELING BAD  BREATH NOT ONLY THAT IF YOU STRUGGLE WITH GINGIVITIS THIS DEFINETLY CAN HELP, AND A BIG THANKYOU TO BZZAGENT FOR SENDING ME MY FREE PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> I love Crest Pro- Health Multi - Protection Alcohol Free . I like this because it does not burn your mouth like the other mouth washes does and it makes my mouth feel clean  and leaves my breath smelling fresh and clean.  I&#x27;m trying the product for free thanks to Crest.  I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.#CrestProHealth</li>
            <li> I received Crest Pro-Health Multi Protection Alcohol Free as part of a promotion and have been using it for about a week. I really like it. I use it after I floss but before I brush. It does a great job and I haven&#x27;t noticed any staining the others are complaining about (however I am using it before I brush as that seems to be the key) My favorite things about this mouthwash is that it has a strong &#x27;cleaning&#x27; feeling without containing alcohol. I hate how so many alcohol containing mouth rinses burn, but most of the non alcohol rinses taste like mint water. This really feels and tastes likes it&#x27;s working and my teeth look great! I really like the product and even though I got it free through a promotion, I will definitely buy it when I run out.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! Providing the protection i needed and the best part is it is alcohol free</li>
            <li> I received Crest Pro-Health Tartar Protection or Multi-Protection Mouthwas as part of a BzzAgent trial and have been using it for several days. I have to say I really do like this product. It has a clean fresh taste and provides the protection I need for healthy teeth and gums. I have always used mouthwash products that have an alcohol base and sting, as it seemed that was proof that it worked. I am loving the fact that this product protects with out that annoying sting. It just leaves a good, clean taste and feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been much of a mouthwash user, I can&#x27;t stand the alcohol taste but, I was pleasantly surprised by this one. It does still have a bit of an odd after taste but, its nothing compared to most mouthwashes. I noticed fresher breath right away and my teeth feel cleaner overall. I have two fancy caps, like fake teeth, right in the front of my smile and I always feel like they look dirty but, this mouthwash did a good job of making me feel confident. I should say that I did receive this as a free product from Crest but, that I was still quite happy with it.</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. Taste is great and works well. Have not experience any spotting on the teeth like the other reviews state.</li>
            <li> I received a free product to test for my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to test it for weeks before I came to write a review. At first, I thought this product is fine, the only problem is that the taste is a little too strong, well, I could still handle it if this was the only annoying aspect. But after using it for weeks, I noticed brown stains between some of my teeth. I didn&#x27;t realize this was caused by the mouthwash until I read some other reviews that have the same problem as me. So I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. My husband is very picky when it comes to toothpaste and mouthwash and this product won him over as well. I feel it does a really good job of freshening my breath and keeping it fresh. My mouth always feels clean after I use Crest Pro-Health and I don&#x27;t find this mouthwash painful to use, probably because it is alcohol free. I would recommend this product to my friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash is okay. I like the very minty feeling after one use and keeps my breath fresh for a longer period of time than any other mouthwash I&#x27;d used. I received this from a promotion from Crest. Thank you so much for letting try this. After using for several weeks straight, I don&#x27;t see any whitening changes, but there are lesser plague and my gum doesn&#x27;t bleed as much as I used to. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Received my bottle free in my Bzz Agent kit which allows me to try it out and write a review on it.  Well I have to say that I am extremely glad to be back using Crest Pro-Health again! I had used it a year or so ago then switched to another brand because it was on sale at the time, not realizing that I was missing out.  After using Crest, I immediately noticed the clean, fresh feeling in my mouth that lasted most of the day.  I also liked that there was no burn caused by alcohol in other mouthwashes, which&lt;br /&gt;I found pleasing.  I am excited about my next dental check up since using Crest Pro-Health because I know my mouth is healthier since using Crest.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is serious about the health of their mouth because it really does as it claims.</li>
            <li> Its an on product crest pro health is ok #GotitFree bye being a bzzagent I would not buy it but i think the crest pro health could improve some</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this mouthwash!! I got it in the mail to try from buzzagent!! It is awesome!! Leaves a nice minty taste in your mouth with NO burn like other mouthwash! I will definitely be sticking with this one!</li>
            <li> As a licensed dentist I regularly find myself making recommendations one way or another to those around me. Aside from questions about teeth whitening, the number one question I get asked is about mouthwash and which brand works best. In my opinion they all work well but my personal experience with Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Mouthwash through the free sample I received from Crest has been great. I floss, brush my teeth and then use the rinse as directed twice a day for 30 seconds. It leaves my whole mouth feeling fresh and clean which makes sense because the majority of the surface area in your mouth consists of your tongue, cheeks, gums and throat. Plus, a liquid can really reach deep into those hard to reach areas that brushing and flossing alone can&#x27;t. The best part is that with Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Mouthwash I get that 12 hour protection without that painful burning sensation. The only reason I downgraded it to four stars instead of five is that Crest uses CPC (Cetylpyridinium Chloride) as the main ingredient while Listerine&#x27;s formula is composed of four essential oils (eucalyptol, menthol, methyl salicylate, and thymol) which have been shown in comparative studies to yield better results as part of a homecare oral hygiene routine.</li>
            <li> I got this mouthwash for free as part of a BzzCampaign. I really like the taste, it leaves my mouth really fresh. A major U.S. to this product is that it didn&#x27;t burn my mouth at all. This must be because of not having alcohol in it. Other mouthwashes make my eyes water because they&#x27;re just too strong. This was a happy medium. I read some of the other reviews and read that many people are complaining of brown staining on their teeth. After a week of use, this has not happened to me. Overall, I like this mouthwash but I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d always choose this mouthwash out of all the others out there on the market.</li>
            <li> Ive only started using this mouthwash but from reading reviews i dont think i should continue</li>
            <li> I love this mouthwash. It leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean, without being overpowering. It doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol, so there&#x27;s no burn. Try it, your smile will thank you :) Crest was kind enough to provide me with a complimentary sample.</li>
            <li> Got this as part of a Bzz agent Campaign. I love the fact it doesn&#x27;t burn like most mouthwash. Leaves a great fresh taste in your mouth. Smells nice not that harsh medicine scent does the job along with other Crest Pro health Products can&#x27;t beat an well known name in mouth healthcare</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;MY KIDS LOVE THE FRESH MINT FLAVOR&lt;br /&gt;ALSO YOUR BREATH STAYS FRESH LONGER AND YOU HAVE LESS PLAQUE BUILT UP.&lt;br /&gt;I GOT A BOTTLE FREE ON BZZAGENT.COM FREE TO TRY. ITS A GREAT PRODUCT. AND I WILL BUY.</li>
            <li> Well honestly I&#x27;ve been using scope and after taking the crest pro - health mouthwash challenge I&#x27;m ready to switch my mouth and teeth feels clean and fresh and they feel healthier!</li>
            <li> I have been trying this product through bzzagent. They sent me a free bottle and I love it so far! It&#x27;s a little harsh but I like how clean my mouth feels afterwards.</li>
            <li> I Absolutely love This mouthwash! I use it every morning, and it has no burn like the others do, it gives me a fresh, clean, healthy feeling afterwards, giving me the confidence to smile and really mean it! My co-workers and friends have noticed a huge difference in my self esteem and how I am much more open to trying new things, all because my mouth feels clean and healthy! A clean mouth can absolutely change your life! Try it out! Personally, I think it is worth every penny, and i am now squeezing this mouth wash into my budget!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It was smooth and didnt burn my mouth and my mouth felt great all day.</li>
            <li> used it once at night time then again in the morning and thats when my tongue started feeling a bit weird had some juice tasted a bit funny but didnt felt concerned until later on in the day when i had lunch and still could not taste anything its been almost twelve hrs and my taste is still gone</li>
            <li> Burned the tip of my tongue for three days.  Lost taste and had cotton mouth for a week.  This is dangerous stuff!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a swollen lymph node in my life until using this product for just three days.  Thankfully I was able to see this seems to be common with this product.  Nothing like seeing a softball coming out of the side of your face.</li>
            <li> I have braces on my teeth (for over 2 years now...) and I always use a fluoride rinse after brushing to help keep my teeth healthy for the duration. After a week or so of using this product I noticed that my teeth were turning gray....and slowly they got darker and darker til they looked almost black. When I went to my dentist for my regular cleaning the first thing she asked was if I was using this product. I have 2 unopened bottles of this junk sitting upstairs and can&#x27;t even give it away free to someone with good conscience. I have spend almost 9000$ over the last couple years to save my teeth (my orthodontia was for functional not cosmetic reasons) and I would at least like them to not look like they are rotted due to gray/black staining. My dentist was able to remove almost all of the stain with a Prophy jet appliance (like getting your teeth sandblasted) but I will never use this stuff again. Ever. Terrible product, I am boycotting crest and going with colgate.</li>
            <li> ***I was given this product as part of a BzzzAgent Campaign.***&lt;br /&gt;Before being given this product to review, my family and I had actually been using it for about a year. My kids (9 &amp; 7) love the minty flavor. They also love that it doesn&#x27;t burn like other mouthwashes!  It has kept our breath fresher, and gums healthier. I also love being able to use a great tasting mouthwash without feeling the tear inducing burn! Lol</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 weeks now. I received a full size bottle through bzzagent. I am giving my unbiased opinion and i honestly love this product. I do still feel a slight burning sensation but its very tolerable. My morning breath isn&#x27;t as bad as it was before and my mouth feels cleaner throughout the day.i haven&#x27;t noticed any brown stains like everyone says and hopefully i don&#x27;t experience it in the future but so far i have had a positive experience.</li>
            <li> I started using this after it was sent to my as part of a BzzAgent campaign. It&#x27;s not good. I&#x27;ve never had stained teeth before. My teeth are actually stained brown. I don&#x27;t smile any more and now I have to pay for teeth whitening. I am so upset. Take this off the market. NOW.</li>
            <li> I got this as a free sample from Smiley360. I tried it along with my kids and we didn&#x27;t have the same problems other people are reporting. I do not remember our teeth turning brown and I am sure I would have remembered if they did.</li>
            <li> I received this as a free sample from Smiley 360.  I just received it yesterday and I have only tried it 3 times but so far I really like it.  It does not have the regular burn that so many of the other mouthwashes do.  I will buy this in the future when my sample runs out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the teeth staining is accurate but i know for sure that Crest Pro Health leaves a cool,fresh feeling in your mouth. The fact that it is alcohol free &amp; tastes great is a plus. I got a free bottle from BzzAgent and I&#x27;ve been rinsing twice a day for the past few days along with brushing. I love mostly that my teeth feel much cleaner as i start my day and when i climb into bed.</li>
            <li> I have been using Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Mouthwash for almost two weeks free thanks to Bzzagent. I have seen a huge improvement in my Papillae (The gums between your teeth) and have noticed my mouth stays much cleaner for longer periods during the day. I am using less gum because my mouth is staying fresh longer and I have less plaque build up. Overall a great product.</li>
            <li> By using Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Mouthwash, I am not only doing something for my health but also for my self confidence.  My mouth feels clean and fresh for the holday parties going on now.  I like that there is no pain or burn involved just a fresh clean feeling. I am glad I got the opportunity to sample this product and can add it to my routine knowing that it is for me.Although Bzz let me sample this product for free the opinions are me own.</li>
            <li> I received a free bottle of Crest ProHealth Alcohol Free mouthwash from Smiley360. I love fresh minty taste.  My teeth feel so clean and it makes my breath so fresh.  I love the fact that this mouthwash does not make my mouth burn. I would highly recommend this mouthwash to others.</li>
            <li> This product left an awful taste in my mouth. After doing research and finding out that it can stain teeth, I plan on returning it.</li>
            <li> I started using this product through BzzAgent and I was very skeptical at first. I have extremely sensitive teeth and wasn&#x27;t sure about trying something new on them. After a few weeks of using this mouthwash, though, I can definitely say it was a good decision. It doesn&#x27;t burn my mouth at all because of the lack of alcohol. It also tastes so much better than other mouthwashes. It makes my breath smell fresh and the effect actually lasts a while, whereas other mouthwashes would just work for a little while. If I&#x27;m in a hurry and don&#x27;t have the chance to brush my teeth, I can use this and it will actually make my teeth whiter and cleaner without even brushing. But the thing I&#x27;m most pleased with is that this does not hurt my teeth. As sensitive as my teeth are, that&#x27;s a rare thing to find. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I bought this product three days ago.  The first night I used it, I thought it was great.  My mouth had that wonderful fresh and clean feeling.  I used it the next morning, and while I was at work I noticed that my gums seemed to be burning, and that my tongue felt raw.  I dismissed it and thought it was just something I needed to get used to.  I used it again at night.  I awoke in the middle of the night because my gums were burning so badly.  When I woke up, my upper gums were still sore.  It hurts to smile and pucker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I ate popcorn at the movie theater yesterday and it didn&#x27;t taste very good because I couldn&#x27;t taste anything.  The mouthwash had effectively destroyed my sense of taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the worst mouthwash I have ever tried and I am absolutely going to fight to get my money back.  I&#x27;m never buying another Crest mouthwash again.  This shouldn&#x27;t even be available on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed the brown stains side effect.  Even so, that side effect should be listed much more prominantly.  I noticed it on the bottle and assumed it meant white stains, and figured that since it wasn&#x27;t permanent it wasn&#x27;t too terrible of a side effect.  However, since the product seems to be staining people&#x27;s teeth brown, which is a far more noticable and less desireable stain, Crest really should make consumers aware of the side effects.</li>
            <li> Still using my Crest mouthwash every day at least two times a day.  I was reluctant to give Crest a try when the campaign came out, since it seemed to leave a burning sensation in my mouth after using it, but it has come a long way in improving the flavor and the tingle sensation that it leaves in my mouth after rising.  I am a longtime user of Crest products and know it is a brand I trust and it will be around in the future.  I still use the Crest toothpaste and will never change since it has improved over the years with more flavors and different needs for brushing, since we do not all have the same needs for our teeth.  #gotitfree from BzzAgent and Crest, it has been a fantastic experience adding this to my daily brushing.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist recommended this product. Why? After only one use my tongue felt like I had been eating metal. It has been over a week and my taste buds are still off. Does it ever get better? Or are my taste buds permanently damaged? Why does Crest still  market this product? Of course, I can&#x27;t get my money back because the sales receipt is lost. The only receipt I&#x27;ve lost in five years! Purchase of this product is a definite NO-NO. Have to give it one star as zero star is not an option.</li>
            <li> I went to my dentist recently and found out I had multiple cavities, so I thought, \\&quot;welp, time to start taking better care of my teeth!\\&quot; I couldn&#x27;t see any difference between this product and the Listerine version, but this one was cheaper at Rite-Aid, so I got it. I used it about twice a day for two weeks and one day while I was brushing I noticed horrible stains all over my teeth. At first I thought I had food stuck in them but no, it was just horrible staining like I was a heavy smoker or something. I googled it and found all the wonderful warnings about what this product does. Along the way, I also found out why my sense of taste had been dulling since using this product! This product should be taken off the market.</li>
            <li> I just bought this yesterday and tried it last night. I noticed that it though it was alcohol free it seemed to be burning my tongue quite a bit. I went to bed and tried it again this morning. Same thing and after eating I had a lot of trouble tasting my food. :( I came on here wondering if anyone had the same problems and sure enough. Too bad. Next time I&#x27;ll stick to the regular stuff.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have been using this product for a week now and we absolutely love it! Not only does it make our breath smell fresher from the minty taste but our teeth are also becoming whiter and feel cleaner! This mouthwash doesn&#x27;t leave that nasty alcohol taste in your mouth like other mouthwashes do! I definately recommend using this Crest Pro Health mouthwash paired with the Crest Pro Health toothpaste twice a day! I received Crest Pro Health mouthwash as a sample from crest! Thank you crest! This will definately be a long time mouthwash in our household!</li>
            <li> It takes a lot to get me to write a review for something that costs so little over the counter, but man oh man, stay away. Stick to whatever other mouthwash you have been using. The metallic aftertaste, persisting numbness, unpleasant dye-residue, staining and depreciated sense of taste are all present for me after only 3 days. My tongue feels like it has been scraped with sandpaper, it&#x27;s really awful and is not at all what I would describe as clean and fresh. The rest of the bottle is going in the trash after I post this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Crest Pro-Health products for a while now. Mouthwash is my favorite. I really like that the fresh breath stays for some time after rinsing. And it helps to keep my teeth in a great condition. Plus it&#x27;s super affordable. Would recommend to purchase!</li>
            <li> I received a bottle of this crest mouth wash for free,for review purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for maybe a week or so now and It&#x27;s okay not something I could afford or want to buy on a regular basis.I also noticed it said it could cause staining and now that I see it has caused this for so many people I am going to discontinue use,my teeth are brown enough I dont need to look like im smoking now on top of it.I also think crest is so expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for a couple weeks and I like it! It doesn&#x27;t burn and it&#x27;s alcohol free so the whole family can use it too. It leaves my mouth feeling fresh and tastes great!</li>
            <li> I received this free from crest as a bzzagent to sample and review this product.  I had been using this since around June 2014 after I got my wisdom teeth out and was looking for a more gentle wash while my mouth recovered.  I like that it&#x27;s alcohol free and I can comfortably swish.  I use it in combination with crest pro health toothpaste and regular flossing and my mouth is noticeably cleaner.  At my last dental cleaning the hygienist complemented me on how well i had been doing since my last visit and thanked me for making her job easy.  My teeth are visibly whiter even considering I drink coffee daily and the occasional red wine.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve ever bought for which I felt the need to write a review on Amazon. At first, I really enjoyed this mouthwash, because it seemed so potent. Like many of the other reviewers, it did seem to dull my tastebuds, but I didn&#x27;t mind terribly because it made my fresh breath last for a long time. However, after consistent use I started to notice the brown stains. It almost looked as if I had big spaces between my teeth because the stains were so dark. I couldn&#x27;t figure out why it was happening, but after reading reviews on Amazon I realized it was probably because of the mouthwash! I went to the dentist this morning for a cleaning and the hygenist told me she&#x27;s never seen staining that bad on my teeth. Besides the staining, she also said I had a ton of plaque and tartar buildup, so the mouthwash doesn&#x27;t even do an adequate cleaning job! Needless to say I will never use this mouthwash again. Stay away.</li>
            <li> I have always had white teeth... until now.  Now I have brown patches in between my teeth after using this product for 2 weeks. DO NOT USE.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash is truely amazing and has helped my teeth and my gums. And makes my mouth feel alot more fresh than usual! I would recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> I received a free bottle from smiley360.com I must say I think crest pro-health mouth rinse is so much better than other brands I have tried some of them also had no alcohol and others had alcohol in them. crest pro health has such a long lasting refreshing taste. I would highly recommend others give crest pro health a try.</li>
            <li> I received a big bottle as a free sample from Bzzagent.com and I love it. It works great ive been using it for over a week not. I was using the Crest Whitening mouth wash but it tasted funny and I didn&#x27;t notice my teeth becoming whiter so this was a great change.</li>
            <li> Just receive my free sample of Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection Alcohol free. Love that it contains no burning alcohol. Also love the subtle minty flavor. Thanks for the sample.</li>
            <li> I was super afraid to use this mouthwash after reading the reviews however I received it FREE to try for myself from Smile 360.  I wasn&#x27;t impressed and found that I needed to brush my teeth more regularly to prevent any stains that might appear.</li>
            <li> I am trying the product for free thanks to Crest..I have to have something that doesn&#x27;t hurt or burn my very sensitive teeth..this doesn&#x27;t thank you Crest!!</li>
            <li> I think this mouthwash is okay. It&#x27;s not the best but it&#x27;s not the worst either. I seen other reviews saying something about staining their teeth brown. I haven&#x27;t had anything like that happen to me while using this product so I&#x27;m not sure what that is all about. Anyways, I think this Crest mouthwash it decent for it&#x27;s price and works as much as any other mouthwash does. I don&#x27;t really have any complaints. I received a free product for the purpose of my review through Smiley360.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when BzzAgent sent me Crest Pro-Health mouthwash to try for free! I was pleasantly surprised by the taste. I really like the noticeable difference that this mouthwash had on the plaque build up on my teeth. The alcohol free formula is important in my decision to purchase a mouthwash. If this was a completely natural product then I would have found my perfect match!</li>
            <li> This mouthwash is truly amazing! I cannot believe the improvement on my overall mouth health!!</li>
            <li> best mouthwash I have used, I actually received this through bzzagent to try and it turned out to be excellent. I love the flavor of the product and the feeling more than other products on the market right now and I have pretty much tried them all (teeth fan lol) My daughter even uses this product, I would rec this to anyone looking for a great mouthwash and not to mention its alcohol free too!</li>
            <li> I have been using crest brand tooth paste for over 20 years and I know I can trust the brand name. I was not sure what the Crest Pro-Health Multi Protection mouthwash would taste of feel like, since in the past I have had some terrible memories of the way mouthwash would leave a burning feeling in my mouth after rising.  This is not like the other kinds I have used in the past, since this campaign has started I have been using Pro-Health Multi Protection mouthwash every morning and evening before bed and I can tell that my breath stays fresher much longer.  I was really amazed that this mouth was alcohol free and leaves such a tingling, fresh feeling in my mouth after rinsing.  I have been looking for a product that would provide fresh breath and that would actually taste like something I would not want to give up using and Crest Pro-Health Multi Protection mouthwash, does actually that for me.  I am totally into doing anything that helps prevent or lessens plaque since it is no fun going to the dentist and having your teeth scraped with it feels like to me an unending process especially with my molars in the back of my mouth;  it seems like the plague likes to attack those teeth and hang on for life and not let go.  I hope to have a better experience in December when I go for my six month check-up and possibly have less scraping of the nasty plaque.  I can definitely tell in my front teeth, that it looks like they are somewhat cleaner and feel really smooth when I run my tongue across my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend for anyone that just wants to have less plaque buildup and clean smelling breath to give Crest Pro-Health Multi Protection mouthwash, clean mint flavor a try.  Just like me, I thought that manufactures really could not fix the nasty taste that some mouthwashes leave behind, but not this one, it leaves a cool fresh feeling, that I look forward to rinsing every day.  One thing I would like to point out to friends and family, is that this is something you can do right after brushing your teeth that takes less than a few minutes to promote a life time of healthy gums and fresh breath!&lt;br /&gt; #gotitfree from BzzAgent and Crest, a big shot out for giving me this product free to try out and I definitely will print the free coupons from  www.coupons.com search word crest in brands (http://www.coupons.com/brands/crest-coupons/?PLID&#x3D;MEDIAADS&amp;CRID&#x3D;CRESTRINSE102414BZZAGENT_EXT&amp;CID&#x3D;18490031~18490033~18379389~18379119) direct link to coupons and take advantage of having fantastic trips to the dentist in the future.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection Alcohol Free is a fantastic mouth wash! The flavor is just right. Some mouth washes are super strong but this Crest is just right! I use this rinse twice a day, once in the morning and once before bed and it leaves my mouth feeling super clean and fresh! I would recommend this rinse to everyone who is looking for a great wash that tastes great and is effective! I received this mouthwash through a promotion from BzzAgent! check it out if you have not already!</li>
            <li> I got to try this product because I got it free from buzzagent.com it tastes great makes my mouth happy I would definitely recommend this to everybody</li>
            <li> Love the fact that this rinse is alcohol free! The flavor is great but it is very pricey compared to other brands. Crest is a brand u trust so I will spend the extra $</li>
            <li> Through my Smiley360 membership, I received a free sample of Crest® Pro-Health™ Multi-Protection Rinse to try in order to rate and review. While this opinion is my own, my husband also tried to product. We loved the way it made our mouths feel fresh, clean, and invigorated without the pain of alcohol. I like that while my mouth feels clean, it is working to protect my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Tried many mouth washes, however this is the best mouth wash out there. Nice taste and with multi-protection you can not go wrong! I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own</li>
            <li> i got this mouth was as a promotion from crest and to be honest its not my fav but i dig it. it does keep your breath fresh for a long time the only down side is every thing you eat is slightly minty afterwards. but it&#x27;d be great just before a date.  :)</li>
            <li> This product is labeled almost eactly the same as the Flouride Crest....It does not have flouride. So then what is the point. Crest should be ashamed of themselves for offering this junk....No point. Don&#x27;t buy .....</li>
            <li> I want minty fresh breath just as much as the next person, but I can&#x27;t stand the burn from the alcohol in mouthwashes such as Listerine. When Crest offered to let me try Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Alcohol Free mouthwash FOR FREE, I decided I had nothing to lose! Well, that&#x27;s before I lost my ability to taste! Let me back up. It started out fine. I liked the minty taste and loved the fact that I didn&#x27;t feel like I was swishing rubbing alcohol around in my mouth. But once I spit it out, there was a strange sensation in my mouth. Loss of feeling in my tongue. And then I realized loss of taste as well. Now I know what you&#x27;re thinking...no one can taste anything but mint after they use mouthwash. But that wasn&#x27;t the case here. I had a loss of taste for almost an hour after using this mouthwash. I don&#x27;t know about you, but that is way too long to have a strange, numb sensation in my mouth. I have since tried ACT alcohol free mouthwash and found that it is minty fresh and doesn&#x27;t cause my mouth to go numb.</li>
            <li> This is hands down my favorite mouthwash.  It contains no alcohol so it doesn&#x27;t burn like other mouthwashes.  If you have a canker sore simply gargle with this a couple of times a day &amp; it will be gone within a day or two.  I used this mouthwash when I had braces &amp; nothing helped heal up those braces nicks like Crest Pro Health.  It&#x27;ll leave your breath fresh &amp; your mouth feeling super clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of Crest Pro Health for free from Smiley360; however, I have been using this mouthwash for years.  If you&#x27;re not a member of Smiley360 you should check it out.  Lots of FREE products.</li>
            <li> I personally love this mouthwash. It didn&#x27;t burn my mouth, which is a plus. It made my mouth feel cleaner and my breath feel fresher for longer. My teeth didn&#x27;t get that annoying fuzzy feeling. Will buy this when my 1st bottle runs out. I got a bottle free from Crest through BZZAGENT. But I am surley going to buy this.</li>
            <li> I love this mouthwash!  The taste isn&#x27;t too strong, yet it works wonders.  My mouth stays fresh all day!  I&#x27;m definitely a fan.</li>
            <li> I love this mouthwash. I love that it doesn&#x27;t have the burn of alcohol, and my mouth still feels fresh and clean! I will continue to buy this product!</li>
            <li> I received a sample from Smiley360 and i&#x27;m glad I did! This mouthwash left my whole mouth feeling clean, refreshed and my breath smelling minty fresh! Other mouthwashes do not even come close to doing all these things but Crest Pro-health does. I am happy it doesn&#x27;t have alcohol in it so my children have been using it now too and they enjoy the flavor saying its not too strong like others and I agree with them. I love that the size of the bottle is very easy to hold and fits perfectly on my sink shelf without taking up too much room. I have noticed also that my breath stays freshened clear up to around mid afternoon and I use it at 9am so I don&#x27;t worry too much about bad breath with this rinse. The fact that it is fighting plaque and preventing gingivitus only furthers my need for this product. Even though I received my bottle from Smiley360 for free, I have checked the price out and it is priced decently well for the top quality product I have found it to be. All the benefits in one place can only have me saying WOW! I would highly recommend this to everyone who uses mouthwash. For parents out there, my 10 and 12 year old children use it and are happy with the taste and no burn results.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this brand! I have tried Scope, Listerine, Colgate, and out of all of them, this is my favorite! The taste leaves your mouth feeling clean for hours and freshens your breath! When you spit, any pieces of food or plaque come out as darker clumps of blue so older kids and teens like to use it because they can visually see how much they are cleaning out of their mouth my using it! I use it twice and day and since I started using it, I have had whiter teeth and less cavities. (I get dental check ups every 6 months.) This is the no alcohol version so there isn&#x27;t much of a burn, which is also better for Teens and people who are sensitive to the burning feeling. I use this after brushing with Crest 3D whitening toothpaste. They also have coupons for this product in the Sunday paper in P&amp;G inserts so you can try it really cheap to see if you like it as much as I do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would you like to try products like this for free? Become a bzzagent like me and sample free products! You get to try them then tell everyone what you think about it! This is my first sample product and I love it so much that I went out and bought 4 of them during a Target promotion just so that I would not run out for a while! Crest now has a loyal customer for life!</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the fresh clean feeling that I had after using this rinse.  It lasted for hours and is the brand that my dentist always gives me a sample of when I get my annual checkup.  I was excited to get the full size so I could keep my teeth in prime cleaning mode.  It is not overpowering and I love that it is also alcohol free.  I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> After my deep dental cleaning, I decided to try Crest Pro Health, along with daily flossing and brushing with an electric toothbrush. After five weeks of using Crest Pro Health once a day in the morning with no other changes in my routine, I was growing concerned at the brown stainings that were appearing in between my teeth and near the gum lines and becoming worse. I thought maybe I was grinding my teeth during my sleep, but how could this have happened if I did everything I did before using Crest Pro Health? I decided to research online and was upset at the hundreds of complaints I read with the majority having the same problem I did! From this experience, I am reminded to research, research, research the products I use and consume! I decided to switch to a herbal toothpaste called Auromere (with ingredients I can understand) and am going in for a deep cleaning / whitening again. Sigh, I cannot believe I have to go back to the dentist again and pay the costly treatments over a cheap $8 bottle! I do not understand why P&amp;G have not taken Crest Pro Health off the shelves since first complaints reported five years ago in 2008? In closing, paying more for a reputable product and integrity of the company are important learning lessons for my and your health&#x27;s sake!</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend this to those who dont like the burn from Listerine. Fresh breath with out the burn and with out the alcohol that can dry out your mouth and make you breath worse</li>
            <li> Do NOT use this product or any of the pro health products!!!   Like many other people I had a loss of taste but also had extreme pain, swollen glans! I used this product for aprox a year and thought that I was having other issues due to medical reasons. However once those issues were explored and stopped taking all the medicines I was still having extreme pain in mouth. After going to many drs and dentists with no one knowing what was wrong, my sister found this report about a lawsuit regarding crest pro health and loss of taste, browning of the teeth, swollen glans and a few other symptoms. It made me think maybe that was the problem so I stopped using it and the pain lessened with in a couple of days, still have some but it has only been a short time and am still waiting for my taste to return to normal. So please do NOT use and pass the info on to all who will listen!</li>
            <li> I thought I ordered the clear liquid, not the blue.  The clear has been discontinued and amazon is sneaky in the footnotes that they may alter which one they send you.  P&amp;G is changing the clear liquid version to a different assortment and more expensive, and the color can stain plaque on the teeth, so brush carefully.</li>
            <li> I thought I had some type of poisoning, was literally sick (bad diarrhea) besides the fact that my mouth was numb, swollen, I was drooling.  Not just numb, but severe metallic taste, I could t concentrate on anything g due to the see deity of my mouth condition.  Finally I saw online that Crest was known to be bad for your health and I switched toothpastes.  There was an immediate difference.  I am dumbfounded that Publix carries the product, that the ADA endorses it. Clearly the ADA is not a source for information in regards to health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crest toothpaste should be removed as a product.</li>
            <li> A few days ago, I noticed some dark brown stains on the inside edges of my teeth. I&#x27;m really good about brushing/flossing and I couldn&#x27;t think of what the cause might be. I started searching online and found a news article about this mouthwash causing tooth stains. I went in the bathroom and, sure enough, I started using this mouthwash a couple of months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really mad. I realize there is a vague warning on the back, but I&#x27;ve been using mouthwash for 20 years with no problem so why would I be reading the fine print?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m making an appointment to see if I can get these stains cleaned, but I really don&#x27;t appreciate having to endure a deep cleaning just because I used the wrong mouthwash.</li>
            <li> Years ago I used Crest Pro-health and I had no problems with it. But recently Crest apparently has decided to use a new formula and now I can&#x27;t use it! When ever I wash my mouth, my tongue feels like it was burned and feeling numb. Yet it clearly states that it is Alcohol Free! So what&#x27;s in it to cause this?! I have no clue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought my mouthwash from Costco. Great price until I was using it. Within a few days, my tongue felt like it was burned. When I touched my tongue, it was very rough. Also my tongue was feeling numb. Luckily I stopped using it before it got any worse. I read online many have paid the price using the mouthwash. When I went to the stores, many people told me to use ACT or Listerine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look, you may not like the burning Alcohol used in Mouthwash, but I prefer that over a burned and numb tongue. I want my Taste Buds intact! Also don&#x27;t use Crest Pro-Health Toothpaste. Crest apparently changed the formula and people are complaining everywhere I go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay away from the Crest Pro-health series. Stick to Listerine or Act.</li>
            <li> My husband brought some of this home from the dentist. I did not buy it on Amazon but I just bought some more at the grocery store tonight. I am well aware of the potential for brown staining however I am actually not too worried about it. I had gingivitis and was prescribed a medicated mouthwash that had an antiseptic in it. It worked great but the side effects of the antiseptic caused brown staining. My insurance allows one free dental cleaning a year. So my dentist cleaned it off my teeth with a little scrapey tool and my teeth were fine. He also explained that antiseptic mouthwashes can cause staining but it was nothing to be alarmed about. I want to keep the gingivitis away, so I like the antiseptic in Crest ProHealth. I decided to try using it once every other night to see if that helps prevent the staining. But even if it doesnt, its not the end of the world. I like this mouthwash better than Listerine because it doesn&#x27;t burn (and I&#x27;m kind of a wuss lol)  and the brown staining is a harmless side effect from the antiseptic used to fight plaque and gingivitis. It actually doesn&#x27;t mean that the mouthwash is bad for you. Obviously,  good oral hygiene works best to keep away gingivitis but its nice to have the added help from this Crest Pro Health mouth wash. I haven&#x27;t used it for very long but so far, I like it. If you don&#x27;t want brown staining, look for mouthwash that doesn&#x27;t contain the antiseptics known to cause the staining. I&#x27;m sure there are some out there. For now, I&#x27;m happy with this mouthwash.</li>
            <li> Usually I&#x27;m pretty skeptical when it comes to oral hygiene products. Some of them irritate my gums and leave me disappointed. I&#x27;ve tried several different oral rinses. Most of them were too strong for me; they would make my mouth burn and my eyes water! I had the opportunity from BzzAgent and Crest to try this Crest Pro-Health Muti-Protection Rinse for free and I thought hey, why not. I have to say after using this product for a little over a month, I&#x27;m surprisingly pleased. I like that there&#x27;s no burn, that was a big plus for me. It left my mouth feeling clean and minty each time I used it, with no irritation. My gums even look healthier since using this product. Before, they were more red and bled sometimes. Now I have no bleeding and they&#x27;re a nice light pink color, as they should be! Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied and would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> First of all, my sympathies for those who have experienced problems with this product. I&#x27;ve been using this mouthwash for several months, and my experience has been positive. No staining, no taste problems, etc.  The dentist sure noticed my improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My best recommendation is to try the product and see.  If it creates a problem for you, stop immediately.  Also - and most importantly:  DON&#x27;T use it twice a day as Crest  (and the bottle itself)recommends. Once a day is fine.  Perhaps twice a day is the source of some people&#x27;s problem with this product? It is strong, but not as bad - or awful - as Listerine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update my review if I start to experience any negative results.</li>
            <li> This stuff should be pulled from the shelf!  It has left my teeth with brown stains after I&#x27;ve spent 100&#x27;s to get my teeth white.  It has also messed up my tastebuds and the flavor of food has changed.  DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> UPDATE: While I was loving how clean my teeth felt while using this mouthwash, unfortunately, my dentist confirmed it will leave spots on my teeth. Therefore, I will drop a star. Hoping they will develop an effective mouthwash that does not have negative side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Up to recently, I was using another brand of mouthwash which produced moderately good results. I had just run out of it when I saw Crest Pro-Health Rinse locally and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After only a few days of switching to the Crest rinse, I was amazed with how clean and plaque-free my teeth were. It felt as clean as having the dental hygienist clean my teeth. The surface of my teeth are smooth and there is no plaque between my teeth. This wasn&#x27;t the case before in spite of flossing, brushing and rinsing regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I soon learned that the active ingredient, Cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), can leave brown stains on teeth. This reminded me of chlorhexidine prescribed by my dentist awhile ago. It too is effective, but can stain your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It appears that at the moment there is no silver bullet for clean and white teeth. So I&#x27;ll keep using the Crest rinse until I have an issue with brown stains. I should mention that it is said dental hygienists can remove the brown stains. Will check with my dentist at my next visit and update later if anything changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 or 5 stars??? At the moment, I&#x27;ll have to give Crest mouthwash 5 stars. It works better than any mouthwash I&#x27;ve ever used. However, if I start to see those brown stains, then I&#x27;ll have to drop a star... but it wouldn&#x27;t be fair to do that until it really happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Very effective at removing plaque&lt;br /&gt;- Reasonably priced (I purchased my locally)&lt;br /&gt;- Not too harsh for my sensitivity&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- none so far&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TBD:&lt;br /&gt;- Potential to leave brown stains (though I have not been using it long enough to say for sure)</li>
            <li> Just back from the dentist and and was shocked to find out that for a large number of people -- including me -- Crest Pro-health mouthwash actually INCREASES STAINING. I had only been using the mouthwash for about the last six weeks, but my dental hygienist said the staining that suddenly occurred on my teeth was entirely due to the mouthwash. As soon as she started to clean my teeth, she took one look and said, \\&quot;Have you by any chance been using Crest Pro-health mouthwash?\\&quot;    I have no idea why Crest doesn&#x27;t take this product off the market.  I strongly advise you NOT to use this mouthwash!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and by the end of the second bottle noticed dark stains on my teeth, sort of like a chewing tobacco user.  After visiting my dentist today (which I do religiously twice a year and also floss, brush and water pik each day) he ended up scraping off dark brown stains all over my teeth.  I&#x27;d noticed them recently and couldn&#x27;t understand where they had come from as nothing in my normal routine had changed.  He nailed it with the mouth wash!  I will NEVER buy this product again and will not be buying any Crest products because of it.  There should be a warning on the bottle indicating the staining problem as my dentist said it is a known problem with this product.  It should be taken off the market in my opinion. Also, not all of the staining could be removed unfortunately.  I am angry as a result.</li>
            <li> this has saved  us lots of money go to the dentist keeps are breath in good shape I will keep buy this all the time</li>
            <li> As a rule I never write bad stuff on products that I do not like. This is the one exception. I bought a bottle of this stuff mostly just to give it a try and since it said it was alcoal free. After the first day my month/tounge burned bad. Food tasted awful and the burning numb feeling lasted all day. Right off the bat I said this will be the last bottle I buy but figured I would just finish this one since I do not like to waste money. I lasted 4 days and could not take the effects of this crap anymore and dumped it down the drain. Even after I stopped using my mouth did not feel right for a few days. I went back to Scope with no problems at all. If you do not mind your mouth burning all day and food tasting bad then you will be fine with this product.</li>
            <li> This product gave me very dark brown stains that gradually snuck up on me, in between my teeth, by the time the first bottle was gone. I can&#x27;t get them off! Do not use this product! We brush and especially floss religiously every single day, we even use two mouthwashes afterwards as part of our normal routine. For all our effort and investment, we did not expect to be INFLICTING ourselves with dark brown stains! I guess this must come as a shock to crest, but we actually were using their product to CLEAN our teeth. I thought that was common sense, but apparently common sense is not so common these days especially when corporate profits are involved apparently!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried using a scaler, hydrogen peroxide, brushing hard (bad for gums and teeth!) and will turn to my dentist for my next attempt. The stains appeared after about a month of usage, and since at the same time I had been eating a bit of dates and black inky colored rice I assumed it might have been from them. After several more weeks had passed of avoiding dark foods the stains intensified enough to make me investigate the mouthwash since it was the only new part of our routine. Sure enough on the back of the label it warns that it might stain teeth, and that proper brushing prevents it. Well, we brush VERY properly and floss religiously every single day, and yet still got terrible staining! This is ridiculous, that a product that is marketed to help avoid stains and clean the teeth would cause it to look diseased, like I use tobacco! I am absolutely angry about this and just took back our third and forth bottles to the store we purchased them from for a full refund. I am going to be looking to join a class action suit the first chance I get and will update this review with a link when I find one. Obviously, I am not alone. Shame on Crest. I will never use another of their products for my teeth or my family&#x27;s dental care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolute shame on them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I just went to a lawyers and settlements website and requested a case review. If anyone out there wants to join I suggest you do the same! I know I cannot post the link here, but if you contact me in the comments section I will get you the link or somehow help organize.yers and settlements website and requested a case review.

            <li> I can confirm the brown stains. Just went to dentist, and dental assistant was mystified as to why my teeth were so stained. I don&#x27;t drink coffee, tea or wine; it was using this mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I have used this product but instead of turning my teeth brown like most other&#x27;s, my teeth turned a yellow-orange color, especially close to the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately went back to Scope and Literine.  No more Crest products in this household.</li>
            <li> I have to say the 1 star reviews for this product are accurate; a family member of mine experienced all the terrible things mentioned in other reviews. According to our doctor, this product caused her to loose all the good bacteria in her mouth and encouraged yeast/thrush. Now she&#x27;s completely lost her sense of taste and there&#x27;re white/dry spots all over in her mouth. Please beware, don&#x27;t ever use this thing. The toothpaste contains the same active ingredient (CPC); stay away from that one, too.</li>
            <li> I started using this mouthwash a week and a half ago.. and after reading the reviews on here started worrying about the potential side effects. Not sure.. but so far, I have had nothing but perfect results with this mouthwash. It doesn&#x27;t burn like the Listerine I used previously (although I just noticed that Listerine has its own version of alcohol free mouthwash; will need to try that out at some point) . Also, my mouth feels incredibly clean after swishing. So clean, in fact, that I can&#x27;t remember it ever feeling this clean. I don&#x27;t know how it works exactly, but when you spit, you can see clumps(yeah, it&#x27;s kind of gross) of dead bacteria (someone in a review video identified these) going down the drain. For now, I highly recommend this mouthwash, especially if you&#x27;re tired of the regular, alcohol based mouthwash drying out your mouth and contributing to potential dental problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be reporting back if my teeth start to \\&quot;turn brown\\&quot; or if there are any other adverse effects due to this mouthwash. You can count on that.</li>
            <li> Just came back from the dentist, they were literally shocked looking at my teeth. Brown stains throughout the bottom row of my teeth, it took well over an hour to get the stains out, the hygenist had her work cut out for her.  They both thought I had started smoking, My dentist was in literal shock stating \\&quot;I have never seen your teeth look this way\\&quot; I am seriously interested in getting together some sort of class suit against this company.  NOT fair to consumers, I repeat do not use!!!</li>
            <li> It will turn your teeth brown. If you keep using it, your teeth will turn black. Not much more to say than that.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff. It works and all mouthwashes are pretty much the same anyway. So choose the kind you like.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers have said, this product can turn your teeth brown. Unfortunately, I did not notice the stains on my teeth until I almost used up the whole bottle (had a busy work schedule....). Then I discovered all those negative reviews and the small fine print on the bottle...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can understand the business motivation for Crest to keep this product on the market (apparently this mouthwash works for some people) but its failure to highlight its product&#x27;s potential problem is inexcusable. Won&#x27;t buy anything from this company ever again.</li>
            <li> I looked at all the negative reviews on this site and thought, \\&quot;what the h**!?\\&quot;  I&#x27;ve used crest pro-health for years with no issues such as brown teeth, loss of taste, etc etc.  My hygienist recommended it and she&#x27;s been giving me compliments on my teeth and gums at my appointments. So I&#x27;m with the 5 star reviewers on this one!</li>
            <li> I love Crest Pro-health mouth wash.  It leaves my gums healthy and UN-swollen. I also feel cleaner for a longer period of time, and I feel more confident when I speak with people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I usually use Crest&#x27;s 3D white mouthwash, but Crest sent me a free bottle of this Pro-health mouthwash to try. It lacks the minty flavor and whitening that I love from the 3D white mouthwash, but it does feel like it leaves my mouth healthier overall. If you have trouble with gum health or bad breath this is probably a better choice for you.</li>
            <li> love that its alcohol free leaves me feeling fresh and clean without the burn of most mouthwashes i highly recommend thank you bzzagent for sending this to me for free to try this is my honest opinion</li>
            <li> I was recently given an opportunity to try this product for free, and my experience was very much satisfieing. This product works really than the other mouth washes I have tried. I also love that it is alcohol free, and my mouth and teeth and gums feel very clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I love the Crest® Pro-Health(tm) Multi-Protection Rinse.  I have been using it for years.  It leaves my mouth feeling clean and refreshed the whole day.  I clearly noticed the difference from other mouthwashes as Crest Pro-Health does not give me a stinging sensation in my mouth when I gargle it.      I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro Health mouth wash is great! My mouth feels so clean aftwr swishing and its a great flavor and ny breath smells fresh for so long! Love this!</li>
            <li> I love this! It really doesn&#x27;t burn and it leaves your mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> I got to try this product for free and I really liked it. I really enjoyed the flavor of the mouth wash and it left my mouth feeling fresh and clean. I have had no trouble what so ever with the product. I would most definitely buy this product.</li>
            <li> Love the product. Noticed the difference immediately after using the product just once. I received a free sample of the product from Crest and now I am a definitely going to be a returning customer. I love how my mouth feels after using without that crazy &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; feeling that you get from other mouthwashes. I have used several other mouthwashes and none of them come close to the feeling I get from using this product. After two weeks of use my teeth look brighter, feel cleaner and my breath feels fresher. This product has also given me more confidence when talking with co-workers and friends alike. I am no longer worried if my breath is fresh enough or making sure I have a piece of gum at the ready.</li>
            <li> I really like this mouthwash. No burn and makes your mouth feel fresh. I am a tea drinker and used to have stained teeth. This product as well as using the crest pro-health toothpaste have really improved the looks of my teeth. This mouthwash keeps your mouth feeling fresh! Definitely a must have!  I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I received Crest Pro Health Mouthwash as a try out free of cost through Bzzagent.com. With that being said I will definitely be switching to this product permanently. Not only have I noticed fresher breath and a more cleanly all around feeling but I am experiencing this effects with no burning sensation I am used to with many other brands I have tried. Most rewarding of all my step daughter will now rinse with mouthwash because it does not burn her gums. If you have young children that wont use mouthwash because of the burn, I highly suggest trying this product.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash has a pleasant taste that doesn&#x27;t burn the mouth. My mouth stays fresh and clean for hours. I have used this product for almost two months now without any problems with teeth staining. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic mouthwash! It doesn&#x27;t burn as bad others containing alcohol do, but it still leaves my mouth feeling tingly and fresh. It&#x27;s strong enough that I still feel that I have to rinse after use, though. Overall, I like the product better than others I have tried. #gotitfree</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-health is a great tasting mouthwash that makes my teeth feel extra clean!  Unlike other reviewers, I have not noticed any brown stains on my teeth.  I feel that this mouthwash is making my teeth look better and helps keep my mouth healthier and cleaner!</li>
            <li> The flavor I got was Refreshing Clean Mint.  I must say that I really liked this product.  It doesn&#x27;t contain any alcohol and so there&#x27;s no burning sensation that you get with the other leading brands.  I have sensitive teeth so this was a nice change for me.  My family also really liked the fact that it didn&#x27;t burn their mouths like the other brands do.  I also like the fact that it has multi-protection (kills germs, reduces plague, helps prevent gingivitis, freshens breath) that your teeth need without the alcohol.  The mint flavor wasn&#x27;t over powering either, which was nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con to this product would be that a while after rinsing I would have a funny taste in my mouth.  Not real sure why that would happen, but it may not be the same for everyone.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free to test thanks to Crest and BzzAgent. I like that this product doesn&#x27;t have the alcohol sting like regular mouthwashes do. The taste is good and I have noticed that my mouth feels cleaner and fresher.</li>
            <li> I like this product is very good and it taste good too.</li>
            <li> I loved this mouth wash. It did not stain my  teeth like in some of the other reviews. It taste great and my teeth feel clean. I was sent this free product for my product review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I received my bottle of Crest Pro Health FREE from BZZAgent and LOVE it!! My 10 year old was here when it arrived and he looked at me like I was crazy. I opened it and the clean mint scent was amazing and my son thought so too! He doesn&#x27;t like mouthwash and so I had him try it with me, we both love it! It is the most refreshing, clean feeling I&#x27;ve ever experienced from a mouthwash that lasts for hours. I don&#x27;t have that strange aftertaste like you usually get. Bonus, my son is using it too!!! :) Thank You BZZAgent!!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t burn and my kids loved it! makes your whole mouth feel clean and healthy!</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to try this product for free from Bzzagent and Crest. This has become a part of my daily dental hygiene and am happy with the results. I have fresher breath, cleaner feeling teeth, and the health benefits of using an alcohol free mouthwash. I didn&#x27;t experience any burning in my mouth and thought this tasted great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several months and I&#x27;ve not had any concerns at all.  My teeth are white and no concerns with burning etc.  Overall happy with product.</li>
            <li> Love it! It&#x27;s refreshing, it does not burn, sting or make me want to spit it out. I love the way it makes my teeth feel clean all day. Crest Pro Health actually works!</li>
            <li> Entire family started using crest pro health and our mouths feel cleaner without the burn. Still has the great Mint flavor, not overpowering. Better than other mouthwashes!</li>
            <li> My teeth have always been in good shape. Althought not completely white, not yellow. My Dentist told me to use mouthwash with flouride to keep the sugar from eating at my teeth. So I tried this product. Have been using at morning and at night. I have even watched the clock so I was rinsing for 1 minute as the directions dictate. I noticed brown at the side and base around the gum area on one tooth. I&#x27;m 52 years old and just thought it was an age thing. But then I see it on 75% of my teeth now. I just searched, \\&quot;why are my teeth turning brown\\&quot;. To my surprise I find all kinds of peole saying the same about this product. I just got done brushing and will poor out the rest of this product. I just had a tooth cleaning 6 months ago. I hope this can be removed. I have been using this product for 8 months. It all seemed to appear with in a one month period.</li>
            <li> I bought the mouthwash without reading reviews on Amazon, terrible and tragic mistake. The stuff burnt my tongue at first use, 3 days later I still can&#x27;t taste the food. As far as browning teeth goes, I don&#x27;t want to stay and find out. I am lucky that my teeth color looks fine, for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;Update 1/29/2013&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product 9 times. That was enough to put my tongue through every level of hell. First came the wonderful bruning sensation, followed by the usual taste lost, eventually I couldn&#x27;t drink fluid at one point because it hurt too much. Then my lips chapped so bad that no amount of chapstick can fix. There were days my tongue hurt so much that it felt like there&#x27;s hole in my tongue. I am glad to report I&#x27;ve now regained my taste and my tongue seems to be healed after stopped using this product for 10 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as this mouthwash goes, it&#x27;s a great toilet cleaning product. It kept my toilet shining and ordor free.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was lucky enough to be blessed with great dental health my entire life. About 2 months ago I decided to change my regular mouthwash in order to try something new, just to figure out if I can get better results. Usually before purchasing a product, I always read reviews in order to come to a conclusion wehther I should purchase a product or not. However, I work at CVS and this item was on a great sale so I decided to try it without having any knowledge as to what I should expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I have no shame in admitting that even on sale this was probably one of the worst purchases of my life, if not the worst. I did not want to write a review right away because I wanted to experience the product first over a long period of time. This product really does not have any positives. First of all the taste is awful, which isn&#x27;t a big factor for me however I wanted to mention it for anyone who feels as if the flavor is important. While using the mouthwash, it does cause a lot of burning sensation but bearable. After rinsing, it leaves a lot of gooey residue inside your mouth which can be very disgusting. At first I thought I just had a defective product, after exchanging for a different one I experienced the same gooey substances after rinsing. The worst factor of this product is that after rinsing, it will leave a horrible after taste in our mouth and also it will ruin your taste buds for a long period of time causing everything you eat to be tasteless and unappetizing. While reading the bottle I realized this product states a warning that it might cause discoloration to your teeth......wait what? A product that is supposed to be good for your oral hygiene might actually cause you more harm. After reading the warning, I immediately threw away the product without having an second thought. I really do not like &amp;#34;hating&amp;#34; anything, however this product is absolutely trash and should be avoided by consumers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully my review has been helpful! if you have any question or comment please let me know! Thanks.helpful! if you have any question or comment please let me know! Thanks.</li>
            <li> this is one of those products that I don&#x27;t like to run out of.  Love the fact that it does multiple things without alcohol in it</li>
            <li> I like Crest Pro because it does what I need it to do, It has a nice taste, but a bit to sweet. I always wondered with all the scientific information at hand why can&#x27;t a tasteless mouthwash be made, natural breath is nicer than flavored breath. It should be one with  the smell and flavor of water. Thanks</li>
            <li> I used this stuff for a couple of days.  After the second day I realized I couldn&#x27;t taste anything except spicy, salty and sweet flavors. Can&#x27;t taste anything sour or any type of unique flavors.  It has been 3 days and I still have tastebud impairment.</li>
            <li> We love the taste and the freshness it leaves in your mouth!  We have all been using it and all really like it!</li>
            <li> I like it. It really made my mouth feel good and it is tasty. Nobitter aftertaste. I would highly recommend this to everyone</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.  I love this stuff!  If you brush your teeth properly it wont stain.  It doesnt burn my mouth which I LOVE and doesnt taste putrid.. just a great mint flavor.  I can also tell the difference of my overall mouth health - it does as promised and I have not had to scrape plaque off my bottom teeth since I have used it!  Give it a try - its a great item and I am not sure why others are having such issues with it! I love it.</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.    I have only tried this once since I received it and have not noticed any brown spots on my teeth. I have read other reviews about the brown spots and it has scared me to try it again.  Now im curious to why this is happening to people.   I will have to say the taste was not bad and I did like how my mouth felt so refreshing after using it. Ill keep an eye out on the reviews to see whats going on with it.</li>
            <li> I recieved this to try free from smiley 360. I&#x27;m not being paid to write a review, when I tried this mouthwash I was very happy with the taste and how clean my mouth felt. I just started using this mouthwash and I really like it!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this from Smiley360 and think its a great product.It tastes great and I didnt have any problems with it.</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review.  Opinions are 100% my own...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product.  It leaves your breath fresh and feeling clean for a very long time!  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it right before you plan on eating.</li>
            <li> I tried the Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection mouth wash and haven&#x27;t had any major issues with it. It makes my mouth feel fresh and definitely doesn&#x27;t cause any burning. I also like the minty flavor. The only thing I noticed is that my tongue felt a little bit &amp;#34;numb&amp;#34; for a few minutes after I finished using it, but I just rinsed really well with water and the numbness went away. Love the fact that it is alcohol free! I received this free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I tried this mouthwash for free thanks to Crest and BzzAgent. I wasn&#x27;t too impressed with it. I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in the health of my mouth and it didn&#x27;t leave my breath smelling much fresher than brushing. It definitely didn&#x27;t have a strong flavor or burn, so if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for, you might want to try it. It does contain artificial sweeteners, which I avoid in products.</li>
            <li> i received this product free for the purpose of my review my opinion&#x27;s are 100% my own. after trying this product for a while now. my opinion is that it works really good it has helped to remove stains off my teeth. i can tell my gum&#x27;s are healthier and my breathe is fresher.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now, and I have not noticed any of the staining that people were talking about in other reviews. I do like the alcohol free aspect. It doesn&#x27;t burn near as much, though there is some burning. However, I also feel like it leaves some form of residue on your teeth for awhile. I really don&#x27;t like that feeling. It&#x27;s not a bad product, although, I won&#x27;t say it is the best either.</li>
            <li> We love the alcohol free, fresh taste! I have loved Crest whitestrips for years and we love adding more of the line to our routine! We lucked out getting to try it free from Crest, but it was an easy sell! Just stocked up on a three pack to share with friends and family.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a while. It really does get your mouth clean!</li>
            <li> First off this stuff made my tongue feel raw which lasted for hours so I used it at night after meal time were all over, after a few weeks I noticed my teeth getting stained with a yellowish brown color. I had to get them cleaned and stop using this stuff. I&#x27;m sticking with Toms for now.</li>
            <li> I used this last night for the first time after brushing and flossing my teeth. It said to rinse for one minute....I didn&#x27;t make it past 10 seconds. If you want to know what it feel like to run your tongue up and down a cheese grater while simultaneously dousing it in acid, then use this stuff.....because that exactly what it feels like. The lingering effects of this unintentional, self-inflicted, torture lasted for hours before finally subsiding into a numbing ache that has altered the taste of everything I&#x27;ve eaten over the last 24 hours. I&#x27;m hoping it will go away completely in the next day or so as I would really like to taste the food I eat again. I don&#x27;t particularly like not being able to taste chocolate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously though, stay away from this stuff if you value your taste buds. I&#x27;ll be returning the bottle I bought.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.”Thank you Smiley 360&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This mouthwash has a pesticide as the active ingredient. If you use this mouthwash be aware that it does work very well killing plaque however do NOT exceed the amount on the label. 20 ML or 4 teaspoons. Its not Listerine. Most people are rising with a whole cap full, which is too much and magnifying the side effects. For best results, use it with REACH floss handles to get in between the teeth and down the gum line. Then rinse with a SMALL amount! Not a whole cap full. To minimize the taste bud changes, after rinsing with it wash it off your tongue with clean cold water. I hope this helps. If you have an allergic reaction you should then go back to an Alcohol based product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mouthwash. It isn&#x27;t too overpowering but leaves you with a feeling of refreshment. I have been using it the past month or so and can already see and feel the difference I hoped for. I got the opportunity to try this product for free thanks to crest and won&#x27;t ever change mouthwash again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Mouthwash! The best part for me personally is the no alcohol solution! No more uncomfortable burn after I use mouthwash! My teeth and mouth feel fresh and clean for HOURS, even after I eat! I did receive a bottle for free thanks to a promotion.</li>
            <li> I had white teeth before starting crest pro health. I have been using it for a couple days and now I have brown stains on my teeth. My tounge is sore and is like sandpaper. I could not taste anything till the next day. I will never use this again. I received this product for free to review. These opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I started using Crest Pro Health for a few days, then I decided to look at reviews and I stopped using it because of all the bad reviews it was getting about it staining your teeth! I mean it does have a cool mint taste but I just couldn&#x27;t use it anymore since reading the bad reviews.</li>
            <li> I received a bottle free from Smiley360 and Crest. My whole family liked it. It was a bit powerful mint-wise but over all it was something we would use again.</li>
            <li> Tastes good, and leaves me feelin fresh.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash has so many benefits without the burning sensation. The first time I used it, I noticed blue specks in my sink. I did a little research and turns out the blue dye they use can stick to germs. Some may not like this, but I actually feel reassured that the mouthwash is doing it&#x27;s job. The mint flavor is not too strong. It&#x27;s very refreshing. However, occasionally I notice an aftertaste that isn&#x27;t all that pleasing. My mouth feels cleaner for a longer period of time compared to other mouthwashes. And the rest of my family seems to really like this one. Will surely buy in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I received a free product from Crest for my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like that the mouthwash doesn&#x27;t have a burn and makes my breath smell good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The things that I do not like is just like on the back of the bottle, I can see some discoloration on my bottom teeth.</li>
            <li> I have only used this mouthwash for a week, but it is burn free and tastes good.  I haven&#x27;t experienced the brown spots other reviewers have mentioned, but it does make me concerned and unsure if I will continue using it.  I like the taste of this one better than all other alcohol-free mouthwashes I&#x27;ve tried before. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34; Crest Pro-Health has a pleasant minty taste and leaves my mouth feeling fresh for hours without the burn of alcohol. I feel that my teeth feel cleaner and smoother when I use the rinse compared to when I don&#x27;t. I didn&#x27;t feel there was any noticeable improved whiteness, which I was hoping to find when using this product. But overall, I like the rinse and feel that it does a decent job in keeping my mouth clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I have not had any problems with this mouthwash Me and My daughter are using it just fineMoves you to a healthier mouth from day one*Fights bad breath and kills germsKeeps teeth cleaner longer (vs. brushing alone)Helps improve your dental check-ups, by fighting plaque and gingivitis. With all these benefits im happy i got to try it for free thru Bzzagent Thanks to Crest. Im a happy customer and i have recommened this to my friends and family</li>
            <li> I received this mouthwash, thanks to Crest and Bzzagent. Normally, the mouthwash I use is mediciny. It did the job, but left an awful taste when I was done. Crest Pro-health remidied that!&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it do the job, if not a better job, than the bitter mouthwash that is now in the trash, but Crest Pro-health makes my breath minty and fresh! Using it along with Crest toothpaste, I see a difference in my smile, and my fiance notices a difference in my kisses.&lt;br /&gt;I have a dentist check-up coming up in two weeks, and I know he&#x27;ll notice a difference as well.&lt;br /&gt;Deffinitely recommending this mouthwash!</li>
            <li> Thank you Crest and Bzz Agent for letting me try this mouthwash for free. This product is outstanding for the whole family. I received my free bottle two weeks ago and it&#x27;s already gone. I have such a hard time getting my family to use mouthwash, but for this product it is not the case. When you&#x27;re rinsing with Crest Pro it is a refreshing experience. There is no burn whatsoever, just a nice clean feeling after. I&#x27;ve also noticed how much whiter everyone in my family&#x27;s teeth are. Hey if I can get the family to actually enjoy getting better oral health that&#x27;s a win win for me!!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the flavor!.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this for about 5 days now and my breath has been good all day, even the next morning, and my teeth FEEL clean after I brush. There is NO burning sensation with this mouthwash. Its just a normal feeling lile im rinsing with water, except its actually cleansing your mouth. When ive used other brand mouthwashes, i am litterally counting down the seconda in my head for it to be over because it burns so much. My eyes start watering and tears come down my eyes! Yes, this happens to me. And with Crest Pro Health, it doesnt. Its a pleasant experience. I actually now enjoy using mouthwash, it no longer is pure torture. And my teeth and mouth feel lile I just left the dentist. Amazing Crest!  #GotItFree #ProHealth #BzzAgent.Com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very pleased with the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I love this product! We use it regularly in our household. First we received it as a product to test for bzz agent. Now we buy it regularly.  My seven year old son even uses it and doesn&#x27;t complain about it burning his mouth.  I no longer have to buy little kid rinse and adult rinse so It&lt;br /&gt;Saves me some money! Bonus! I would recommend this product to anyone my teeth feel great and my breath is always fresh.  I worry about that as a nurse when I&#x27;m taking close care of&lt;br /&gt;My patients that my breath is bad. I don&#x27;t worry anymore! Get this mouthwash and see for&lt;br /&gt;Yourself!!</li>
            <li> I like how this mouthwash makes my mouth feel fresh and clean. The feeling of a clean mouth makes me happy and it has not stained my teeth as some posters are saying.&amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I notice brown stain also.  I will not use this any more.</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.  I like this mouthwash.  It has a fresh taste and leaves a clean feeling to my mouth.  Though it says alcohol free, I did get a slight burning sensation when I used it.  Overall I liked Crest Pro Health and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  I am trying to avoid mouthwash with alcohol because I don&#x27;t like the taste or burn from alcohol. I am using mouthwash to help keep my teeth and gums healthy. I have found this rinse to be gentle and without the burn.  I will definitely continue to use. I received this for free from Smiley 360 for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t burn as much, and it leaves a fresh feeling for hours afterward. Where the taste/feeling lasts so long it makes food taste weird later on, but that&#x27;s to be expected I suppose.    I do thoroughly enjoy that it doesn&#x27;t burn nearly as bad as the alcohol based mouth washes do.    I got this for free to try as a trial from BuzzAgent.com. My opinion is not biased on price.</li>
            <li> I belong to Smiley360 and was sent a free sample bottle of Crest Pro-Health to try. The first few days were tough since I am not a fan of strong minty tastes. But after I realized that my mouth felt fresh and clean hours later decided that maybe this product isn&#x27;t so bad after all. I have been using it every morning and evening for two weeks now and although I still find that I am not crazy about the taste when I very first use it, I love the fresh, clean feeling that it leaves behind. I haven&#x27;t really noticed any difference in there being less &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; when I brush and floss or in the color of my teeth or gums. I do know that it hasn&#x27;t made anything any worse and I will continue to use this product. Definitely leaves my mouth fresher longer than the mouthwash I currently use!  &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have been using the mouth wash and am very satisfied with the product. The first time feeling was so amazing.... it leaves a fresh strong clean feeling for hours.  I like the fact that it is alcohol free and it also does not burns as much like other mouth wash I used before but one thing I noticed is that, the fresh feeling though last for hours it does makes the food taste so weird so I realized the best time to use is right before going to bed. Over all I like and recommend the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a member of Smiley 360 and received the Crest Pro-health for free for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Find yourself reaching for cake and chocolate when you should be reaching for brussels sprouts?  Look no further!  With this product, your mouth won&#x27;t know the difference between nasty health food and tasty junk food.    Unfortunately, I only gave it one star since I was looking for a mouthwash, not a dieting product, that doesn&#x27;t cause painful blisters to appear in my mouth and since I enjoy being able to taste things.</li>
            <li> Love the taste and clean</li>
            <li> Minty fresh breath is the best and this will do the job. Love the way my mouth feels. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. Thanks smiley360 and crest for putting me on this mission</li>
            <li> I really like this mouthwash! It leaves my breath minty fresh and doesn&#x27;t burn while I&#x27;m swishing! I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Crest pro-health is absolutely amazing. I have seen amazing results compared to any other mouth wash I have used. I would definitely recommend Crest to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Leaves my mouth Feeling fresh and clean all day!</li>
            <li> I really like the Crest Pro-Health alcohol free rinse. It keeps my mouth feeling fresh for a long time and without the burning usually associated with this type product. It actually has a pleasant taste. I haven&#x27;t experienced the teeth brownness other reviewers have mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Thanks to bzzagent and Crest, I was able to try this product free. Crest Pro-Health mouthwash leaves a nice refreshing feeling that lasts all day even after eating! I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for something that not only works but also a product that doesn&#x27;t have that burn like other mouthwash. I was excited to receive and try the Crest Pro-Health mouthwash and now I dont plan on using anything else.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff!  I love the flavor and the freshness.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak for the other reviewers and experiences..  I&#x27;ve been using Crest mouthwash for a couple of years I had a lot of work done on my teeth and needed something not alcohol like but fresh minty long lasting I can happily say it works great for me! specially after brushing which I do 3 to 4 times daily the taste stays with me for hours.. I drink a cup or two of coffee daily I haven&#x27;t notice any brown spots or discoloration of any sort..   I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I like this mouthwash much better than many other types because it does not burn my mouth. I very much disliked that sensation, and would put off using mouthwash because of it. This one does not burn my mouth, and it leaves a nice, fresh breath behind. I highly recommend it for someone who is looking for something different than the norm. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I have tried the purple bottle by crest prohealth. i enjoy that one very much. so i received this one to try. i was quiet impressed with the nice mint taste and it doesnt have the alcohol in it. which is a plus in my book. i saw some reviews on teeth browning. i have not noticed any issues with mine nor any issues with the other i have used for a long time. i would recommend this to anyone seeking a good mouthwash that is reasonably priced. I received this free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> This is a great mouthwash. I have tried several different mouthwashes and like the way this one leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean without the alcohol burn. I use this daily and know that it works. I had not been to the dentist in a few years and usually I have a cavity or two. I had no cavities on my last visit and the dental hygienist was amazed that I had not had a professional cleaning in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> received from bzz to right a review leaves my mouth feeling fresh</li>
            <li> I used a little bit just to try out the flavor. The next day I had a little redness in the corner of my mouth. Didn&#x27;t think anything of it. After a couple of days the little red mark stayed but didn&#x27;t get worse. I finished my other mouthwash and started using this terrible stuff exclusively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within a couple of days the little red corner tripled in size and then I got another one on the other side of my mouth. On top of that my gums would sting really bad when I used the mouthwash. I thought I was brushing too hard so I bought a softer toothbrush. Then I decided it might the toothpaste (even though I used the paste before I don&#x27;t know why I jumped on that) so I bought some Tom&#x27;s toothpaste. The pain in my gums got a little better but the rash or burn or whatever around my mouth persisted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I stopped using this product a couple of days ago but after doing some research on it I&#x27;m pretty confident that this was the cause. Now my lips are very chapped and the corners are really dry, flaky and still red. There are even a couple of spots lower near my chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would never have even considered this product if I had read these reviews. Just save yourself the trouble and get something else.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended the wash. I use an oz every night before bed. It has a wonderful taste &amp; it really works.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product!  We think this product stained his teeth.  After using it for a while we were wondering why his teeth were getting brown.  It wasn&#x27;t until we brought he product name up in a dental cleaning session that the dental assistant mentioning this product might be the cause.  Once we stopped using the product his teeth go remarkably better.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this product to avoid harsh gum dry out caused by regular mouth wash. I use this daily in my water pick and this works well mixed with water, a cap full for the full water pick load works well. Or 1/2 cap for 1/2 a load etc.</li>
            <li> we&#x27;re used to that bite of alchol in our mouth wash.. Not here with this and it really does make your mouth feel fresher longer.  Not so sure how it would work after you just ate Limburger cheese, onions on dirk rye however.  :)</li>
            <li> Ironically, this mouthwash stains the teeth. See the lawsuit [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that, P&amp;G only added a fineprint on the production: \\&quot;In some cases, antimicrobial rinses may cause surface staining the teeth.\\&quot; And in crest website, [...] they make statements to let people somewhat feel: (1) crest is not alone, every mouthrinse does that; (2) it is consumer&#x27;s fault; (3) discoloration is actually good sign. What a shame! Our language is really powerful to let people describe snow as black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon, we really should consider to support zero-star reviews.</li>
            <li> I used this once, and I lost my ability to taste anything right until the next day. I used it only one more time, and I can confirm the taste side effects. It also dried out my mouth and left my tongue rough feeling, like I&#x27;d burned it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a truly frightening product. I hope Crest sees a class action lawsuit over this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To those implying that all the negative reviews are shills or lying, do a google search for \\&quot;crest prohealth loss of taste.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> After only 2 uses I have a swollen parotid (saliva) gland on going to urgent care as soon as it opens. Come to find out there is a whole forum on the subject. They need to take this off the shelves!!!</li>
            <li> Been buying this product for quite a while using Subscribe and Save.  Product works great, been very happy with it.  Now Amazon has arbitrarily decided to remove it from Subscribe and Save, and is suggesting a substitute product (a whitening product) that is more expensive and does not offer the plaque/gingivitis treatment that this product provides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve marked this product one star because of Amazon&#x27;s decision to drop it from Subscribe and Save, in order to get their attention.  I would otherwise rate it as 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon for making it more difficult to get the product I want.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 2 weeks now and out of nowhere have these pretty brown stains between my teeth that were never there before. I have my wedding coming up too so even better!! Thanks, Crest! You&#x27;re the best!</li>
            <li> It is May 6, 2013 and I have just returned home from an hour in the dentist&#x27;s chair having my teeth scaled (scraped) and then sand-blasted with a sodium bicarbonate fine powder. Not pleasant. This was because of horrible brown stains that had appeared between my teeth where the teeth touch each other. It looked like I had food stuck in my teeth. My dentist took one look and said, \\&quot;Have you been using Crest Pro-Health?\\&quot; I said, \\&quot;Yes, for about two months.\\&quot; He explained that, for some people, it causes brown staining. I fall into that unlucky group. I read the back of the bottle and it does warn of possible staining, but says good brushing should take care of it. NOT TRUE. I am a religious brusher and flosser, but that didn&#x27;t help at all. Only a professional cleaning at the dentists will get rid of this mess. Looking online, I see hundreds (thousands?) of others have had similar experiences dating back years. Why are they still selling it? Avoid this product at all cost.</li>
            <li> So I decided that I would try it out thinking that it would help and got it because it says alcohol free but the second that I used it it burned my entire mouth. Plus when I spit it out, blue chuncks came out that im am now suspecting are the inner lining of my cheeks. Instead of having a fresh clean feeling, my mouth burned and my tongue was numb. I haven&#x27;t experienced any staining of my teeth but I dont want to. This stuff is going down the drain.</li>
            <li> I have a love/hate relationship with this product. I love the minty freshness and clean feeling. BUT I CANT FREAKING TASTE ANYTHING NOW. I honestly haven&#x27;t been able to taste anything for the past two days. I haven&#x27;t noticed any brown spots like other people have, but god damn, my tongue feels like I don&#x27;t have any tastebuds or something.</li>
            <li> I got it free for #bzzagent. I love the Crest pro-health mouthwash. It left my breath fresh and my mouth feeling clean. Love the taste of it too.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always had a problem getting my teen to use mouthwash because he hated the taste. He loves this mouthwash though. He uses it everyday (without me nagging at him).&lt;br /&gt;This is a great mouthwash and all we will be using from now on!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. It has a fresh, minty taste that left my mouth tingling clean but without the burn of some mouthwash containing alcohol. It lasts all day and leaves your teeth and gums feeling like you just left the dentist! Great product! An amazing free offer as a BzzAgent! So glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> I have been a Crest product user for years but just recently have been using the Crest ProHealth toothpaste and mouthwash. I must confess they are a great new line up for Crest. My teeth not only feel cleaner after each brushing but look cleaner. Combining the ProHealth line of toothpaste and mouthwash make for a fresh long lasting effect with fresh breath as well. My mouth feels as clean if not cleaner than going to the the dentist and a lot less invasive. I highly recommend the whole Crest ProHealth line of products as a sure defense for your teeth and mouth needs. Try it you will definitely like it and so will your mouth. Thanks to Crest for sending me a free sample!</li>
            <li> I like the taste but still burns a tad too much for being alcohol free.</li>
            <li> After receiving this product as part of a BzzAgent Challenge for Crest, I  am mostly impressed with the results. It has a nice clean taste, and doesn&#x27;t burn your tongue like other mouthwash which is a big plus. The only negative thing I&#x27;ve noticed, is that the freshness doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would prefer. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days, but have not noticed any staining of my teeth like others have mentioned. All in all, I would still recommend this product, especially if you have kids that use mouthwash as part of their daily brushing routine!</li>
            <li> I like the Crest alcohol free mouthwash.  I was highly concerned when I saw all the negative reviews that there must be something wrong with me.  But it tastes great and doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro Health Multi-Protection is amazing! I have the alcohol free one so there is no burn, but I get a great clean feel! I brush my teeth in the morning and my breath and teeth smell and look fresh even by the afternoon! I am looking forward to my dental check-up to see what my dentist thinks!</li>
            <li> I love that this mouthwash Isn&#x27;t too harsh and yet still protects my mouth. I was given the opportunity to try this out for free from Crest. I use it in the morning, after every meal, and before bed for a fresh new start. I do notice that it stains though.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product! It&#x27;s my new fave! my mouth feels so fresh after using it, I can definitely see some improvements of my precious plaque build up!! Overall it&#x27;s awesome! Thanks crest 😊 I got to try it free thanks to #BzzAgent</li>
            <li> So far, so good! I received a bottle of Crest Pro-Health Muli-Protection Rinse for free to sample thanks to Crest. I&#x27;ve read tons of reviews stating people are experiencing stained teeth after using this mouthwash. I can say so far, I have not found any stains on my teeth from this product. I really love the burn free no alcohol sting feel when using this rinse vs. my Listerine. I will probably buy this again as long as I do not experience any staining or sensitive teeth issues.</li>
            <li> I received this Crest Pro - Health Multi -Protection Alcohol  as a sample and was very pleased . right from the start  I felt a cleaner mouth ,fights bad breath, kills germs, keeps teeth cleaner longer ! I enjoyed using my sample  right from the start.</li>
            <li> #BzzAgent free fullsize product trial. I love the #Crest Pro-health mouthwash. My mouth feels fresh and clean using it. Also if you have to get a tooth pulled like I did due to calcium and bone loss due to medical issues and medications I can tell you that it also helps your mouth heal faster. I love this product and will never go another day without it. No alcohol in it makes the product great to use. Helps keep your pearly whites white.</li>
            <li> Best mouthwash out there. Refreshing without the burn.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!had i not resieved this product Free from Bzzagent I would not have believed it! Great taste without the burn. So good for my pearly whites!</li>
            <li> Love this mouth wash!! It is my favorite. I love how I can feel it cleaning but there is no burn. My mouth always feels amazing after using it!</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GREAT MOUTHWASH IT LEAVES YOUR MOUTH FEELING FRESH AND CLEAN FOR HOURS AND NO BURN!</li>
            <li> Crest Pro Health  Mulit protections  make my mouth feel great! Been&lt;br /&gt; using it for a while now and it over long time fresh feeling. I got it as a free trial through bzzagent and i will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I received Crest Pro-Health as a free promotion with BzzAgent.  I have used the product for 3 days now and have started see improvement with morning breath.  This product doesn&#x27;t leave a burning feeling.</li>
            <li> love  the fact its alcholo free</li>
            <li> Very good refreshing mouth wash, That most importantly is alcohol free!! Would reccomend to others!! This was sent to me for review &amp; now that I tried it I would buy it on my own!!</li>
            <li> I spend a lot of money on my teeth.  Dentists, endodontists, oral surgeon, you name it, I&#x27;ve had it done to my teeth.  I&#x27;ve spent a fortune on them and a lot, LOT of time at these specialists.  I have my teeth cleaned twice a year and I brush twice a day and floss every day.  I decided a couple of months ago to add mouthwash to the routine.  Since my husband had bought a Crest ProHealth a while back, just figured I&#x27;d use that up before buying Listerine (which I&#x27;ve read is the best).  Within a month or so of using it daily, I now have brown stains all over my lower teeth!!!  I was so freaked out!  I used to drink 1/2 a cup of coffee a day, but I even stopped that about 2 months ago, in order to be healthier.  I drink nothing but water and club soda, so they cannot blame the teeth stains on my drinks.  After looking online and seeing all the complaints about this product, it boggles my mind that this product is still on the shelves!!  Come on P&amp;G, do the right thing and get rid of it already!</li>
            <li> This product sucks. I used it 1-2 times a day for about four days, and today I have no taste! I can&#x27;t taste anything! My teeth are also getting yellow in the corners. Using windex would be just as good as using this blue devil&#x27;s liquid</li>
            <li> I got this for review for being a buzzagent... i gotta say its by far my fav mouthwash. Leaves my mouth feeling super fresh without the feel of alcohol burn... i use it daily and have gotten my family to use it as well. I will purchase this and continue to do so... #gotitfree #buzzagent</li>
            <li> I love this mouth wash. It&#x27;s great it&#x27;s not too harsh and it leaves my mouth feeling refreshed and clean longer than just brushing. I feel more confident when I use this mouth wash. It fights plaque all day so your mouth feels amazing all day long even after your sugary indulgence. I recieved a free bottle from crest and I&#x27;ve bought 2 since.</li>
            <li> I agree with others that this product is poison!  After using this mouthwash (thinking I would try something different from Listerine)I started noticing that when brushing my teeth my gums would bleed.  AND, it wasn&#x27;t just a small amount.  I would spit out a few mouthfuls of bright red blood.  I also noticed that I had areas of my gums that felt raw.  If this product continues to cause harm to people, the makers of this product may have a product liability class action on their hands.  In the meantime, I have switched back to Listerine.</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.  I love this mouthwash!  I loved the taste of the clean mint.  It did not have that alcohol burn.  Mint flavors were the only flavors I see this mouthwash in.  I wish there was a peppermint flavor or a citrus flavor.  I also like that there are different kinds of mouthwash that Crest has.  There is one for tarter control, sensitive teeth and multi-protection.  This mouthwash left my mouth feeling fresh and clean.  My breath stayed fresher longer!  I recommend this mouthwash to everyone.</li>
            <li> I loved how this mouth wash tasted and that it didn&#x27;t burn my mouth.It was smooth to gargle and had multiple benefits.Overall this is 1 of my very favorite mouth washes period on the market at this time.</li>
            <li> I think product free to try for the purpose of my review. I love this mouthwash it is the best one i have every tried. The taste is good and it keeps my mouth clean. It keeps my breath nice after i use it. I have tried it for awhile and I have not seen any brown spots. I do not know what people are talking about.  I do wish though that it could make my teeth whiter. If you want a good mouthwash this is the one.</li>
            <li> I received this free from BzzAgent for review! I was previously using the Crest Advanced White mouthwash, and hated it.  It just wasn&#x27;t for me!  The taste would make me want to throw up, even before I was pregnant.  And now that I am pregnant, my dental care is even more important.  I also can&#x27;t handle mouthwashes that make your mouth burn, and this one totally doesn&#x27;t!  It makes me want to use it more often, therefore getting a lot more out of it.  My dentist and hygienist have noticed a huge difference since I started using mouthwash regularly as well ... my mouth is staying healthier!</li>
            <li> So I received a full size, bottle of this mouthwash from BzzAgent a couple weeks ago! I was so excited! Now given that I paid a lot of money for my smile (braces), I like to take care of that smile, too! I&#x27;ve been using this daily, and it has helped keep my breath fresh. It doesn&#x27;t give that burn that some other mouth washes do, probably because it is alcohol free! I also notice my teeth feel cleaner longer too (helps fight off that fuzzy teeth feeling!) I would totally recommend you all to try it out, and to also try out!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product when I got it free from BzzAgent. I started using it twice daily, as recommended. There are pros and cons with this mouthwash, so I can&#x27;t give it any higher than 3 stars.    My mouth did feel extremely clean from the first use. My husband even noted that I still had minty breath the following morning. Being alcohol-free, it doesn&#x27;t have the burn factor that typical mouthwashes do. All these things were great.    However (similar to other reviewers), my tongue has felt like it had been burnt from the start--even several hours after using it. And while the minty-freshness had serious longevity, it also greatly diminished the flavor of food. That&#x27;s a huge bummer.  I did find that using it prior to brushing my teeth (compared to after, as recommended) helped eliminate interference with other flavors while eating.    Overall, it&#x27;s just okay. I don&#x27;t plan to buy it and honestly may not even finish the bottle I have.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free from Bzzagent to review and, after using it for a week so far, I love it! At first I wasn&#x27;t sold because I couldn&#x27;t believe it could possibly work without the terrible burning other mouthwashes have. In the last week though my mouth feels much cleaner, especially when I first wake up in the morning. I also love that it&#x27;s gentle on my mouth and doesn&#x27;t make my gums peel like other washes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> the best one of the mouths I use. I can feel and within two days Im starting to see a difference.</li>
            <li> I received a full bottle to test and I absolutely love it. It doesn&#x27;t burn your mouth but I feel the clean day in and day out! After reading some of the other reviews I am a little confused. I have no brown spots on my teeth and have not lost the taste in my mouth. My teeth feel cleaner than ever and my breath smells fresher longer! I have sensitive gums and they feel better using Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection vs. other brands I have used that made my gums feel even more sensitive. I personally love this mouthwash and would recommend it to anyone! Thank you Crest for the free bottle! You&#x27;ve gained a future customer! - From an HONEST BzzAgent</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think this product was that bad I have received this product from bzzagent to test out and one of the things i most love was the alcohol free i hate the crazy burning sensation that i get from mouth washes that does have alcohol in it and for the taste it wasn&#x27;t too bad i mean not the greatest but it&#x27;s mouth wash I&#x27;ve been using the tooth paste fora while now and I never had a problem actually i think it had improved the overall health of my gums</li>
            <li> I like the taste of it when I use this.  I have used this for awhile and like that it doesn&#x27;t have the alcohol taste or burn. I would definitely recommend this as the entire product line really is worth it.</li>
            <li> ***I was able to try this product for free thanks to Crest &amp; BzzAgent.*** My opinions are completely my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My guess is their formula has changed over the past few years and maybe that&#x27;s why there are so many negative reviews. Or maybe it&#x27;s just not for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say this works for me though. Upon first rinse I could instantly tell this mouthwash was doing the job without the burn. It kept my mouth clean for quite a while, and I could even tell it was still working after eating. I didn&#x27;t feel a weird film on my teeth afterwards. After trying it over the course of a week it is still doing the job.</li>
            <li> CREST PRO HEALTH products can cause brown stains on teeth - check the packaging label. Fortunately I&#x27;ve heard these stains can be easily removed at the dentist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always on the lookout for products that promote good oral health,  as I suffer from periodontal disease.  Most are harsh and burn my gums. This product states no alcohol. ..but it still burns. Dissatisfied and disappointed    I received this product free from the manufacturer as part of a Bzzagent Campaign</li>
            <li> I have been a Crest user since I was a kid. This is the brand of toothpaste I grew up on and thus, a certain amount of brand loyalty (call it trust, really) was built into my decision to purchase this product. I used to use Crest toothpaste (until now), and as for mouthwash, had tried Listerine before this (which I found fairly strong, a little too strong for my taste), and Closys (which I really liked as it did not contain alcohol and I found it quite mild yet effective). I ran out of Closys one day (it was prescribed and given to me by my dentist) and I went without mouthwash for a few weeks. Finally, while walking through my local Sam&#x27;s club, I noticed the Crest Mouthwash and decided to give it a shot. After all, like Closys, it had no alcohol, and also had fluoride like my Carifree® after-brushing fluoride paste. I could kill two birds with one stone! My dentist would probably slap me for doing so, but yes, I picked it up, took it home and rinsed with it for a few nights. This is where I started to notice that maybe, just maybe...something was rotten in Denmark...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first day I tried it I lost the ability to taste food. My taste buds just stopped working. Next, after two days of use, was the severe burning in my mouth, on the inside of my cheeks. My cheeks then started to swell, and not only burned, but were extremely sensitive to the touch. My girlfriend was also using it, and unfortunately, fared much worse. Besides the hallmark loss of taste, her gums were in severe pain. Her cheeks became swollen and also painful to the touch, and the swelling then continued up her jaw and to her ear. However, her lymph nodes also became inflamed and sensitive to the touch. She had trouble swallowing food and liquids due to the pain, and had to deal with days of headaches and throbbing in her jaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She went to the dentist to try and figure out what the problem was, and her dentist could not figure it out. Until after a few days, we both discussed oursymptoms together for the first time and put two and two together. They all matched, except her&#x27;s was more severe. We both had our symptoms start on the same day. Mine seemed less severe because I chose to rinse my mouth out after rinsing with the Crest mouthwash. The directions say to leave it in without rinsing for 30 minutes. My situation could have been much worse had a followed these directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps you will not have these issues (I didn&#x27;t have the teeth staining issue it warns about on the bottle). But in case you do, hopefully you research and come across this information early to forgo the pain caused to others by this mouthwash. It seems to me that there was very little if any product testing done on this mouthwash, and if there was, it was possibly not enough. In my opinion, after using it, this product is utter garbage at best and possibly harmful to your health at worst. With so many time tested alternatives on the market, its simply not worth even trying in my opinion due to the risk of adverse reactions, and loss of time in trying to recoup your costs from the company if it doesn&#x27;t work out. How a company can continue to sell this product is beyond me. The damage to the Crest brand might be hard to quantify, but if they keep selling garbage like this, it could be fairly impactful. Trust is a key ingredient in products we put in our bodies. A business that operates in this market segment needs to get it right, or make it right. Period. Despite what focus tests and market research might say, the core reason I chose to buy Crest products was not because they have 50 features like whitening, anti-cavity formulas and say the words \\&quot;Pro\\&quot; on the bottle. All of these \\&quot;features\\&quot; dont mean squat without trust. You dont need to go to business school to figure that out, or to understand what losing a customer means in the \\&quot;Information Age\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A quick Google search online brings up countless complaints against this mouthwash, listing the same symptoms, so we are obviously not alone. We stopped using it that day, and the symptoms are \\&quot;slowly\\&quot; receding. As I mentioned above, perhaps different people react differently, and not everyone will suffer these issues. If not, then the product could be a good fit for you. However, for many it seems (as I write this 83% of the amazon reviews for this mouthwash are 1 star), this is not the case, and the incidents seem far more than isolated. I will attempt to get my money back, and will write another review based on how the company handles its customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Addition: do a quick search on Cetylpyridinium chloride, the key antibacterial agent in Crest Pro Care Mouthwash, and you will find some interesting information from a variety of sources. Cetylpyridinium chloride can make your mouth or throat numb, increase the risk of severe allergic reactions, such as swelling of the mouth, face, lips or tongue, labored breathing, rashes, and hives and ingesting high concentrations of cetylpyridinium chloride can lead to lung damage. Cetylpyridinium chloride is toxic if swallowed or inhaled. When this toxic chemical was tested on animals the following symptoms occurred: nasal discharge, respiratory difficulty, weight loss, bloody tears, and inflammation of the iris, cornea and aqueous humor (the fluid part of the eye). Other adverse effects found in animal testing include nervous depression, convulsions and limb paralysis. Yay. Sounds like something awesome to put in your mouth right? Wrong!!</li>
            <li> My dental hygentist recommended I use flouride rinse cause of my sensitive teeth. She said it fills in the porous holes so my teeth won&#x27;t be so sensitive.  I purchased Crest Pro-Health 1L bottle \\&quot;anticavity flouride rinse\\&quot; from Sam&#x27;s Club.  A few weeks later I realized my teeth were turning browner and browner. I started using whitening strips to remove the brown stains, but within 3 days of whitening my teeth they are back to brown &amp; very dark brown in between the teeth. I got so desperate I googled \\&quot;teeth suddently turning brown\\&quot; &amp; look what turned up!  How could Crest do this???!!!!  There should be a Class-Action suit against P&amp;G.  At my age, who can read that tiny disclaimer?! They should put a large font WARNING sign on the Front of the bottle \\&quot;IN MOST CASES, WILL CAUSE BROWN TEETH\\&quot;!  Not only are they brown but there is no more slipperyness to my teeth...their entire texture has changed, like the outerlayer of enamel seems to be stripped away as though acid ate through it.  I am so appalled w/P&amp;G I will no longer purchase their products. To think I had to use Crest Whitening Strips to get rid of the Crest Pro-Health induced brown stains!  What a racket!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection Alcohol Free mouthwash! My 6 year old son and I use it twice a day. It leaves your breath refreshed and it has no bad after taste.  Many rinses i used before would be so strong and  would burn my gums.  This one doesn&#x27;t! I can take my time with rinsing.  I recommend this to families of all ages.  Definitely an amazing product!</li>
            <li> Used this for the first time last night, hoping it would help with some of my tonsil and gum issues. WRONG!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe I have received a chemical burn from this product as it is over 12 hours later and I cannot taste anything. My tongue feels strange and when I breathe I taste chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope I will be able to taste food again in a few days, but most likely not. I will never enjoy food again because of Crest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am emotionally devastated.</li>
            <li> I started using this product about 6 weeks ago -- and within a week started experiencing a horrible metallic taste in my mouth continously and food tastes differently.  The only thing that helps is sucking on mints. Almost feels like my toungue has been burned.  I&#x27;ve stopped using the mouthwash and hope that my taste buds return to normal.  Do NOT use this product -- I don&#x27;t know what chemical they are using, but it will ruin your taste buds and leave a horrible taste in your mouth 24/7!</li>
            <li> Received a sample bottle and have to say it&#x27;s easily one of my favorites. Left my mouth feeling cool, clean and even fresh breath first thing in the morning without that annoying burn that comes with most mouthwashes.</li>
            <li> Wonderful! This is the best mouthwash I have ever used. My teeth feel clean without leaving a film behind or a nasty aftertaste. It is great for after brushing or after morning coffee for those us who brush at home then drink coffee on the way to work. I would definitely buy it after I finish the free sample I received thanks to Crest. The only downside is that the nice minty taste does not last as long after rinsing as some other mouthwashes do.</li>
            <li> This is a great product which doesn&#x27;t leave a strong or bad taste in your mouth afterwards.  My mouth feels really clean after using it.</li>
            <li> I liked it! I know there are a bunch of negative reviews, but I have not had my teeth stained. The only real complaint is I wasn&#x27;t in love with the flavor because I like a little more WOW factor with my mouthwash. Turns out the WOW factor is alcohol, which I can do without. I&#x27;ve noticed after time that my teeth feel cleaner for longer, and have enjoyed this product very much.</li>
            <li> I really like how it feels in my mouth before and after so glad they made a mouth rinse with no alcohol I use every morning and before bed.I received free to try and I&#x27;m glad I did</li>
            <li> I had a dental cleaning and checkup yesterday and I asked the hygienist for a mouthwash recommendation and this was it. I bought it and used it before bed last night. I thought it was pleasant while using it so I was pleased at the time. Before falling asleep, I noticed a very bitter taste in my mouth. When I got up and had breakfast this morning, I couldn&#x27;t taste anything at all! I wondered if it was the mouthwash so I looked up reviews and sure enough, it was indeed the mouthwash. I won&#x27;t be using it again to find out if it gets worse or if I get the stains others have experienced.</li>
            <li> I have used this as it was recommended by my dentist and hygienist. I also got this through bzzagent. I like the minty taste and for a rinse its not bad. For me though, through continued use, it leaves my mouth feeling a little raw. There is still some kind of effect for being &amp;#34;alcohol free.&amp;#34; I can&#x27;t use this product for a prolonged period.</li>
            <li> I have both pros and cons with this .  crest pro-health was great for taming my &amp;#34;smokers&amp;#34; breath.  but it did cause some staining to my teeth. But that seems to hve corrected it&#x27;s self with continued use</li>
            <li> It is unbelievable that this product is still on the market. Like so many other reviewers, I suddenly noticed (as did those around me) brown stains in between my bottom teeth a few weeks after first using this product. I brush and floss daily and used this mouthwash, so I couldn&#x27;t figure it out. Then I did a search and found a Canadian news article about this product staining teeth and found these reviews. It appears these complaints go back to 2008! How has Crest gotten away with this? And why hasn&#x27;t our litigious society fixed it? Well, if you read the small print on the bottle, there is a tiny warning about teeth staining. So I guess that makes it okay that a mouthwash designed to clean your teeth does the exact opposite? I&#x27;ve always used Crest products, but absolutely never will again. And I am making it my mission to ensure that no one else will either.</li>
            <li> Great for the whole family love the fresh feeling left after using this product</li>
            <li> I got the opportunity to try this from crest free! I love that it&#x27;s alcohol FREE, but still leaves that fresh feeling behind! It  also brittened my teeth! Good Job Crest!!</li>
            <li> Purchased this product twice on different occasions. First time I thought the product was alright but after the second time I started noticing hideous brown staining on and in between my teeth. The kind of stains that no whitening strip or brushing has been able to help remove. I thought it had been a result of my coffee drinking but it turned out to be the pro health mouth wash. It took a visit to a dentist and almost 1.5 hours with a dental hygienist to get rid of the unsightly stains. The stains caused by this product were enough to make me extremely self conscious of smiling. My hygienist confirmed that she was aware of crest pro health mouth washes creating stains and advised I use other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reviews of the product were overwhelmingly 1 Star. The recent trend of 4 Stars and up are rigged reviews by a company known as bzzagent. I&#x27;ve worked with that company many many years ago and they ask members to post positive reviews to create &amp;#34;bzzz&amp;#34; for a product in exchange for a free full sized version of the product. They also ask you to write reports on how you generated &amp;#34;bzz&amp;#34; or word of mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Search &amp;#34;bzzagent&amp;#34; in this product&#x27;s review and you&#x27;ll see 10s of pages amounting to hundreds of reviews referencing it. The reviews are bought and paid for by crest.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/community-content-search/results/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_dp_srch?query&#x3D;bzzagent&amp;search-alias&#x3D;community-reviews&amp;idx.asin&#x3D;B003CP12O8&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not fall for these reviews. The individuals have NOT used the product long enough to notice the damage it does to your teeth. Crest and bzzagent are both attempting to game Amazon&#x27;s rating systems to trick you into making a misinformed purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crest for a long time now.  I hadn&#x27;t been able to find one I liked for so many years, and then when this came out - it&#x27;s not my favorite.  No weird flavors, no burn in your mouth, but it really makes a difference in your oral health.  Great flavor, works well and from a trusted brand.  I got to get one from Smiley360 and use it again, it will most likely always be my favorite! &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Use this product on a daily basis.  Would recommend its use.  The price is fair.  Delivery was made within the period of time promised.</li>
            <li> Great alcohol free mouthwash that wont burn in your mouth or hurt you. I been using this for two days and i like it so much than my old mouth wash! It makes my mouth feel fresh and clean! And when i feel like that, i feel confident! I got It free from Crest and bzzagent!</li>
            <li> I love this mouthwash, great for sensitive teeth!!</li>
            <li> I bought this mouthwash on a whim last week because it was on sale, and because it had no alcohol. I used it only twice and developed severe pain in my molars (sensitivity to touch and pressure), a sore throat, swollen sores on my tongue, stains near my gum line, and I lost my sense of taste for 12 hours. I thought I was just being paranoid, so I did a Google search for this product, lo and behold, there are pages upon pages of consumer complaints for this product. After warning my husband about it, he also had the same problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted P&amp;G, only to be told that all of these things are normal. They told me that I should brush my teeth and have my teeth cleaned by a dentist, as if I wasn&#x27;t already doing that. To add to the insult, they offered me a coupon for their toothpaste. An oral care company should realize that insurance only pays for two cleanings a year, and anything beyond that is out of pocket. I should not have to pay for a special cleaning because of my mouthwash! I have since switched to another brand and, not shockingly, my symptoms have disappeared. I cannot believe that a company can create a product with such dangerous side effects, arrogantly call those side effects normal, and continue to sell the product knowing that consumers will trust it because it is a name brand. I will never buy a Crest product again, and I have told every single person I know about the issues I have experienced. It sounds silly, but never underestimate the power of word of mouth. If you had a bad experience, tell someone!</li>
            <li> I used this once and lost my sense of taste. I was curious to know if anyone else experienced this and now I know.</li>
            <li> I NEVER WRITE REVIEWS FOR ANYTHING AND HAVE BEEN SHOPPING WITH AMAZON FOR OVER 5 YEARS, BUT I MUST WARN PPL ABOUT THIS. IT HAS KILLED MY TASTE BUDS COMPLETELY AFTER ONE USE, HAVE NOT USED IT FOR 2 DAYS NOW AND I STILL DONT HAVE ANY TASTE. MY TONGUE BURNS AND LOSS OF TASTE, I REALLY HOPE THIS IS NOT PERMANENT. THIS GARBAGE NEEDS TO BE RECALLED IMMEDIATELY ARE YOU JOKING ME!?!?!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t burn. My wife and I use daily and have no teeth browning. Don&#x27;t know what others are complaining about!</li>
            <li> I grew up with Crest Products and always believed they were \\&quot;top of the line\\&quot; - last year I had tried the whitening rinse (contains peroxide) and it gave me horrible gastritis - threw it away, called the 800 number and promptly received a refund.  Now last week a bottle of this \\&quot;blue\\&quot; rinse made it&#x27;s way into my household, not sure who bought it but it wasn&#x27;t me, but I did use it for several days and now what do I have??? HORRIBLE GASTRITIS, stay away from these products they&#x27;re apparently poison...</li>
            <li> I will only use this one and now i cant find it(clear mint) the rest out there burn my mouth and taste like crap.  I would buy it here if i knew it was the clear one but the description says it could vary.  I have enough of the ones i dont like in my cupboard and dont want anymore.</li>
            <li> Wow. I have had braces for about two years and I&#x27;m about to get them off. I&#x27;ve been using crest pro health and I pit a flashlight on my teeth to see the progress. Keep in mind I brush my teeth 3x a day a floss my whole set 2x a day... I want clean teeth. Anyway I put a flashlight on my teeth and brown like codes stains were surrounding the bracket s. After 2 years of preparation to have straight and white teeth, I have brown stains in between and surrounding the bracket.</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity through Crest to try their ProHealth Multi-Protection mouthwash for free. After using it twice a day for a few weeks I&#x27;ve noticed a much brighter smile. I love that it&#x27;s alcohol free, so there&#x27;s no burn. I&#x27;ve also noticed my breath has stayed fresh for much longer after using this product. My husband &amp; I have already purchased a new bottle &amp; will continue using Crest!</li>
            <li> The Crest Pro-Health line of dental care are some pretty solid products.  However, this one may not be for me, though it could be completely down to my body chemistry.  I feel it works as promised but just leaves an unpleasant aftertaste in my mouth.  Read on for more detail-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleased to have the opportunity to use the Pro-Health Multi-Protection Rinse in conjunction with my normal Pro-Health Whitening Toothpaste.  The rinse (I still call it mouthwash) promises 12-hour protection against cavities and plaque build-up without the dreaded alcohol burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it each morning for a week.  I usually get up, have a cup of coffee and breakfast, and then brush my teeth before I leave for work.  For a week I followed my morning brush with  the Pro-Health Multi-Protection Rinse.  The clean feeling was definitely there.  I could do the whole swish without having the sting of alcohol.  Initially, it was pleasantly minty.  However, the taste would &amp;#34;turn&amp;#34; 30 minutes after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this perplexing.  After a few days or seriously strange breath after brushing and rinsing, I started to wonder if maybe it was something I was eating for breakfast that was interacting with the Pro-Health rinse.  I eliminated the Stevia in my coffee, the creamer in my coffee, and then eventually the coffee itself.  Even though I drink enough water I was still having issues with a strange and very unpleasant aftertaste developing 30 minutes after use, even after eliminating my morning coffee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on other reviews it appears I am in the minority.  I would have used the product more consistently had it not been for the  aftertaste.  I would recommend this based on the performance, saying that if you are lucky enough not to have the dreaded aftertaste, Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Rinse is indeed very effective at leaving your mouth feeling clean without any sort of sting or burn from harsh alcohols or menthols.&lt;br /&gt;Just as an aside- I wasprovided with a free sample of this product but was not otherwise compensated.  This review is all me and my opinions!</li>
            <li> Right After finishing the whole entire bottle I noticed my bottom and top front teeth with some brownish stains. Sure didn&#x27;t have them before, they look bad and make feel uncomfortable. This mouth wash also leaves a blue sticky web in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;After noticing the stains my wife and I did a quick google research finding out this product with lot of others complains about the same out come and situation. I&#x27;ve using biotene mouth wash for a long time with no problem but wanted to try something new. I&#x27;m very disappointed and mad about this product, it should be recall from the market.</li>
            <li> I thought this product would be a great alternative to my old school listerine antiseptic. After using this product I lost taste, my teeth turned yellow, and ulcers began to form all over my mouth and throat. I have never had a mouth ulcer before, but if it ever happens again PLEASE JUST SHOOT ME! After 3 dentist visits, xylocaine/decadron/hydrocodon prescriptions this 5 dollar bottle of mouth wash has now cost me around $230. Thanks crest...</li>
            <li> I got this product for free from BzzAgent in exchange of my honest opinion. I love this product. Crest pro health has made my teeth look really white and my breath smell good. It Prevent and reduce gingivitis for healthy gums all without the burn of alcohol.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free for testing purposes by Crest and BzzAgent. I&#x27;ve been trying this mouthwash for quite awhile now and it&#x27;s been an okay product. Similar to other mouthwashes nothing out of this world. It gets it job done which is what I&#x27;m looking for a mouthwash to leave my teeth/mouth feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the sloughing problems, but I did actually get a brown stain on one of my CROWNS.  I wondered where in the heck it could have come from.  I was able to scrape it off with my fingernail.  The worst side-effect is horrible breath.  It&#x27;s really bad when you can&#x27;t stand your own breath.  I used it because I had a bone graft and wanted to be sure it didn&#x27;t get infected.  I wasn&#x27;t able to use my electric toothbrush while it healed and had to use a manual one; not as effective at cleaning.</li>
            <li> I had no idea why I had to keep getting my teeth cleaned every three months. Thankfully my new dentist asked me what mouth wash I use - which is Crest pro health - because she also told me it causes teeth to turn yellow. She strongly suggested switching to Listerine Zero.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T USE THIS! I used it for 2 days, a total of 3 times, but it&#x27;s been awful since the first time.  I thought I was overreacting or that my mouth would get used to it, but my tongue feels burned and I haven&#x27;t been able to taste anything in 2 days.  When I looked this up online, I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d find anything but after seeing all these other negative reviews I&#x27;m really surprised that it&#x27;s still on the shelf!  Horrible product.</li>
            <li> Not sure what&#x27;s going on with all those negative reviews? Could it be possible to have had the product contaminated somehow? I have never purchased it through Amazon, but am about to. I&#x27;ve been using this mouth rinse for 3 or 4 years (maybe longer) since my dentist gave me a sample and recommended it, saying it was alcohol free and that it shows the food particles you&#x27;re rinsing away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a great product to use. No ill effects to taste buds or anything ever. I followed my dental hygienist&#x27;s directions, and swish for about 15 seconds (although I think the she said 30)after I floss. And I&#x27;m always amazed at  the food particles it \\&quot;picks up\\&quot;/washes away. Sometimes, I&#x27;ll go back and floss again and rinse again after eating a particularly crumbly item that gets in your teeth (like roasted almonds), and it lets you know when all the food particles that cause plaque are gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of the whole Crest Pro Health lineup; from mouthwash and toothpaste to their floss. This mouthwash helps my mouth feel truly clean and has a good flavor without being overpoweringly strong. I&#x27;ve been using this brand for over three years now and I&#x27;m a satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I lost all my taste buds right after the first use. It has been 2 days and I still cannot taste anything. I have no idea why they still sell this kind of mouthwash. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> So i&#x27;m trying this product for free thanks to Crest So let me just start off by saying this mouthwash by Crest is just simply AMAZING! :o)I have tried a lot of mouthwashes in my day and this is by far one of the best! I like strong mouthwash to keep my breath smelling clean and feeling clean, but do not like the burn and this was on point it did not burn my mouth like the rest of the mouthwashes and my breath smelled oh so minty clean and my mouth/teeth felt super clean like I just went to the dentist to get a cleaning! Way to Go Crest Pro Health! I&#x27;m a believer.</li>
            <li> Tried this product free from BzzAgent and let me tell you I fell a difference in what I normally use and this product.  This product definitely promotes alcohol free line.  The feel that I have after rinsing an leaving my teeth feel fresh and clean is amazing.  Also has a long lasting minty breath is key.</li>
            <li> I started using this because of being sensitivity to the high alcohol content in many other brands. It would burn my mouth and was a bit harsh! This is such a great product that does not leave the burn. My mouth feels fresh-the taste is great and I am a new loyal consumer for Crest Pro Health! I was sent the product fro review. My opinions are 100% my own</li>
            <li> Really good mouth wash. It had everything that mouth wash need but the longer breath last it for 15 mins. But it good.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this mouthwash from Bzz Agent.  I was a little alarmed by the reviews I read on amazon regarding brown stains, but I decided to try it anyway.  I have been using it twice a day now for two weeks, and have not noticed any brown stains.  Quite the contrary, I think it has helped give me an overall cleaner feel.  It definitely doesn&#x27;t burn, which is a good thing for me, and tastes pretty good.  You definitely feel clean right after use, but at first I didn&#x27;t think it lasted very long and was doubtful about the \\&quot;24 hour protection\\&quot; it advertised.  However, the longer I&#x27;ve been using it, the more I notice the clean feeling lasting throughout the day.  I think as you use it regularly, the effects become better and better.  I&#x27;ll update soon if the trend does/does not continue!</li>
            <li> So, I received this bottle for a promotional campaign from the brand.  As of now, I like taste and feel. There is a slight burn but nothing compared to the death burn of Listerine.  I use this after brushing and if I am eating a messy or if I am having a not so breath friendly type of lunch, I take a little swish.  I feel that my breath is fresher and it feels cleaner.  My only con about this bottle is that after doing my swishing for the amount of time recommended, I notice that the mouthwash coagulates some. I spit and you see these bits of gunk on the sink and some in between my teeth that I have to now rinse out with water.  I do not know what causes this buildup, but I am not fond of it.  If that gets fixed, this gets a full 5 stars from me.  However, despite the buildup, it will not keep me from using the mouthwash. I will just add that extra step.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product twice a day as part of a BzzAgent Campaign. They sent me a full size product. We are Crest fans and this product held up to my expectations. I like that it&#x27;s alcohol free which means that my eyes don&#x27;t water when rinsing as they do with the competition. My teeth feel cleaner and my mouth feels fresh long after I&#x27;ve used it. I will certainly be buying this product.</li>
            <li> I was so frustrated about what was causing my teeth to stain and today I found out that this piece of sh!t is causing this. Godd@amn! I wanna r@pe who ever created this crap! Negative 5 stars for sure.</li>
            <li> I got this product as part of a promotion from Crest. I have been rinsing with it twice a day for the past week and haven&#x27;t had any major concerns. My biggest issue is that it gives a very odd aftertaste every time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;However, if I use it in the evening, my breath is noticeably fresher when I wake up, even with the funny aftertaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if I would buy this product, but I haven&#x27;t experienced any of the negative side effects (such as discoloration or tongue problems) that other reviewers have mentioned.</li>
            <li> I have received this product from Bzz Agent!  I have been tryng it for maybe 2 weeks and I like the feel it gives my mouth after brushing! Also has made my gums feel healthier. I have not had any sort of stains from the product!  I also like that it doesnt burn my mouth!</li>
            <li> Great taste and not overpowering! No burn when rinsing and left my mouth feeling clean!</li>
            <li> I received the product for free from BzzAgent! It worked great and left my mouth feeling clean without the burn! After the first couple of uses it is definitely a go to item in my house! It&#x27;s great when you need a quite mouth refresh and helps to ensure my teeth and mouth are getting the protection they need!</li>
            <li> I received the product as part of a promotion from Crest through BzzAgent! After using this for a couple weeks, I definitely noticed fresher breath that lasted longer. The best part about the mouthwash is the taste. It actually feels like its cleaning without the harsh burn. My teeth feel cleaner and there is less plaque on my floss at the end of the day. I would definitely recommend this mouthwash to people who are looking to get better check ups at the dentist.</li>
            <li> The Crest Pro-Health Mouthwash is my new fave! It doesn&#x27;t have the alcohol burn that other brands do. The taste is nice and minty fresh. It makes my mouth feel clean and invigorated. And I can already tell a difference in the lack of tartar or plaque buildup on my teeth. I&#x27;m happy to add this to my brushing routine every day. Thanks BzzAgent for sending me this product to test and review.</li>
            <li> So, Crest Pro Health sent me this for free to try and I have to say... I am pretty happy with the results of this mouthwash! I use it right after brushing in the morning and again after my nighttime brushing right before bed. It&#x27;s a bit on the sweet side and has no burn to it, because it is alcohol free, but there is an invigorating sensation that lets you know it&#x27;s working. I can say for certain that my teeth feel smoother for way longer between brushings... even overnight! I have been staying away from mouthwash because most contain alcohol but I have another option now. I recommend this mouthwash and I will buy it when our&#x27;s runs out. #CrestSmile #CrestProHealth #FreeFromCrest</li>
            <li> Love the taste&lt;br /&gt;Love that it is alcohol free&lt;br /&gt;Have been using for a couple of years&lt;br /&gt;No staining or adverse effects at all and I have 4 veneers-can,t imagine what other are talking about&lt;br /&gt;Love this product and endorse 100%</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers here have reported, this product caused nasty brown stains on my teeth that could not be brushed away. My dentists&#x27; office informed me that the ingredients in CREST PRO HEALTH products were the problem, and that some (not all) people have a problem with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can gamble to see if it will affect you or not, but it took a professional cleaning to get rid of the stains for me.</li>
            <li> I chanced upon this amazing series of reviews because I am housebound for awhile and have to order online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a shill for Crest.  I don&#x27;t use their toothpaste and I doubt they care much about their customers as long as stuff still sells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, there is NO other OTC mouthwash better than this.  The only other mouthwash that is not a joke is Listerine, but it does NOT offer the anti-plaque and anti-gingivitis features of Pro-health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are younger (below 40), I would say use whatever.  But it is the CPC in Pro-health that provides the anti-gingivitis protection that is CRUCIAL if you want to keep your teeth into old age.  The CPC is apparently what causes the browning in SOME people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had no browning or tastebud issues whatsoever after years of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice:  buy a small bottle at the drugstore.  If browning develops, stop of course.  A routine teeth-cleaning will remove it.  You don&#x27;t need a full-blown whitening.  Ask Crest for reimbursement, sue them, whatever.  But smart people just stop using products that don&#x27;t work for them.  Not every product works for everyone.  This works for me.  And there is no effective OTC equivalent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for people who may have an adversion or cannot have alcoholic products, as this has none in it. Pleasant taste too.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN GOING TO THE DENTIST EVERY 3 MONTHS TO GET MY TEETH CLEANED BECAUSE OF HEAVY STAINING, I WENT TODAY AND I ASKED MY DENTIST IF CREST WAS GOOD FOR MY TEETH, HE SAID HE JUST FOUND OUT IT CAUSES BROWN STAINS LIKE I HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING, I WILL NEVER USE CREST AGAIN.</li>
            <li> This product stained my teeth so badly that my dentist and orthodontist both asked me if I&#x27;d taken up smoking.  When I changed to a Listerine rinse (honestly, I don&#x27;t even know which kind) my teeth went back to pearly white.  I absolutely anti-recommend this product, and don&#x27;t understand why in its current formulation it remains on the market.</li>
            <li> I love this product that I received from Crest for review! The non-alcohol burn makes it friendly for not only kids, but adults with sensitivity. I have never found a better product. This product has helped me get a better dental check up already. I would never use mouth wash because of the harsh burn and the nasty after taste it left in my mouth, but this product is my holy grail. My 4 year old niece absolutely loves it. She would refuse to rinse her mouth unless it was with one of the kids mouthwash which after research I found contained a lot of sugar...that in my opinion was not okay. This product has a subtle mint taste, that doesn&#x27;t stick around. It doesn&#x27;t make anything you drink after taste awful, we&#x27;ve all been there before, when you can&#x27;t even drink water without it tasting odd. I swear by this mouth wash. It&#x27;s the best product to ever come into my dental care routine.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ve only used this product a few weeks after being a sent a complimentary bottle to review (I was not compensated n any other way) I&#x27;d say it works great. I have no staining  as some other reviews stated and it works great leaving your mouth feeling fresh without any burn.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used scope before and yeah it works but it ALWAYS BURNED after using it. Now trying this Crest Pro health Multi-Protection it&#x27;s absolutely amazing my teeth are always nice and clean. You get that nice feeling after you get your teeth cleaned at the dentist after every use.</li>
            <li> DO NOT buy this product! I have been using this for about two weeks now, and my teeth are becoming brown. My teeth have also become much more sensitive in the last two weeks, and for at least a few hours after using the product, I can&#x27;t taste a thing. I would really discourage anyone from purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> Label on the plastic bag that it came in and the advertising in the Amazon web site plainly states &amp;#34;Clear Mint&amp;#34;. This product is not &amp;#34;Clear&amp;#34; it is definitely Blue. My wife&#x27;s dentist stated that even this lightly colored blue mouthwash is staining her teeth and I need to buy the clear mint. The dentist gives away those small travel sized bottles of Crest Prohealth clear mint so I know they make it and this false advertising is absolutely no help to me at all. I want to return it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pro-Health mouthwash for the past two years. In that time, I&#x27;ve had unsightly brown staining between teeth that accumulated quickly between dental cleanings. I was perplexed as to the cause -- for over 30 years before starting use of this product I had never had brown staining, and I couldn&#x27;t identify any big changes to my diet or dental routine. I was just about to order a refill of this mouthwash online, and found these reviews that allowed me to connect the dots. Wow. Thank you, Amazon users!</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Mouthwash Review!!&lt;br /&gt;I was sent the Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Mouthwash for review from BzzAgent! This mouthwash is alcohol free and has 24 hour protection! This product has great benefits as well. It kills germs, reduces plaque, helps prevent gingivitis, keeps teeth cleaner longer,and freshens breath. This product helps you achieve a better dental check up! It has a refreshing mint flavor, that is not too over powering! Defiantly a new favorite! Try this product for yourself!</li>
            <li> Unlike many reviewers, my teeth haven&#x27;t turned brown, but I&#x27;ve only used this twice in the past two days. I noticed after both times though, there&#x27;s an incredibly bitter taste in my mouth, similar to earwax (gross, I know, but everyone has had that gross taste in their mouth once in their life.) I thought it was my new toothpaste, but it turns out it&#x27;s this mouth wash. My tongue goes slightly numb, and I have the earwax-y taste in my mouth for upwards of 3 hours after washing. I tried rinsing with water and re-brushing the taste and feeling away, all to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another disgusting side effect that I&#x27;ve only seen a few people mention is the blue flecks left in my mouth after use. I have to scrape them off with my nail, as simply washing my mouth with water doesn&#x27;t work. They stick to my tongue and on my teeth. It&#x27;s not a lot, but enough to be worrisome. It&#x27;s really very disgusting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I poured the rest of the bottle down the drain. I will update if there is any brown stains that come prior to stopping the use of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the 90% of people who don&#x27;t recommend this, I suggest you avoid this at all cost. I bought this at my local Walgreens, so I was unaware of the side effects before I bought it. Hopefully, reader, you have found these reviews before you try it. If not, I sympathize with your mouth and suggest you stop using this product immediately.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Crest Pro-Health Mouth Rinse for a couple months, and have recently noticed browning of in between and top of my teeth.  I couldn&#x27;t believe what I saw.  I stopped using the product a few days ago.  Can anyone tell me how to get rid of the stain?</li>
            <li> After only using it for a bit less than 2 days, I lost my taste totally. At first, I thought it is the food. Then, I realized that I was the only person who keeps complaining about the food in a party. I stopped using it on the 3rd day and my taste slowly came back after around 4 days.&lt;br /&gt;It is a terrible product. The worst part is that the manufacture admits this significant side effect, but, never put them on the label.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking I would get the Clear Mint. The blue Clean Mint is effective but doesn&#x27;t take nearly as good as the Clear Mint.</li>
            <li> I started using crest pro health because my dentist told me that listerine stains teeth.  I never noticed my teeth stained before until I started using Crest Pro health.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 months and I immmediately saw brown staining in between my teeth.  It&#x27;s horrifying and embarrassing.  I don&#x27;t recommend any crest pro health produces to anyone!  STAY AWAY</li>
            <li> We picked this up thinking it must be like all other mouthwashes.....WRONG. After about 2 weeks of use, we started to notice big black and brown staining spots on our teeth that would not come off. We went to our dentist, and he said they have been seeing a lot of this problem and have been advising everyone to avoid this product. It is very harsh on your mouth environment and does terrible staining that can only be removed by the type of deep cleaning that dentists reserve for smokers.  After a cleaning that took 1 hour longer than normal and unpleasant blasting of my teeth, the stains were able to be removed, so they were not permanent.</li>
            <li> this junk is just horrible.  I have never had an oral care product leave as vile an aftertaste as this garbage.  actually, i&#x27;d rather gargle with that water that collects at the bottom of a garbage pail than this.</li>
            <li> So ive been using this for a few months after my dentist recommended it. It causes brown stains that cant be removed by brushing... NOT RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li> This seems to work really well on any type of gum pain or a bit tongue our mouth. It heals the pain quicker than anything . i don&#x27;t use it for listerine even though that what its use for .</li>
            <li> This Mouth Rinse is just OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It performs perfectly well, as far as I can tell, but I don&#x27;t find it exceptional in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others have reported that this product can stain the teeth, and while I have not personally seen this, I can&#x27;t speak for anyone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I can say with certainty is that I&#x27;ve not been so impressed by this Mouth Rinse that I would consider it, given the claims of staining.</li>
            <li> Maybe not all but the unlucky consumers, like me, may find horrible browns spots on their teeth after using this product. Just ask my dental hygienist who spent over 2 hours cleaning these stains from my teeth. BTW the hygienist also informed me of other patients, using this product, had similar stains. Good luck. Maybe you&#x27;ll have no problems but you&#x27;ve been warned about this unbelievable product, shame on Proctor &amp; Gamble.</li>
            <li> This mouth wash is amazing. I like the taste. It makes my mouth feel really clean..</li>
            <li> I decided to challenge myself to use this twice a day for at least a month. Thanks to bzzagent for providing me with a full size sample so I could test it out. I&#x27;ve been using it for awhile now. While I enjoy using it at night (I feel like I wake up without the horrid &amp;#34;morning breath&amp;#34;) using it in the morning ruins my coffee for me! It&#x27;s only because the taste/feeling lasts SO stinking long. My teeth feel clean, and I have not experienced any staining. I DO see little blue pieces in the sink sometimes when I spit it out. I can only imagine its whatever my toothbrush missed, or plaque! Overall, I will continue to use it- and there is only a slight tingle while using it :).</li>
            <li> Minty without burn . Works if you don&#x27;t like that . Don&#x27;t know really if it helps in the areas that it says.  &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Smiley 360 gave a sample size of this product to test for them.  I have been Crest Pro Health products longer than this though, been using this item for a few years now and I adore it.  It really works very well and I love how it feels plus that it does not burn unlike other mouth washes.  I like the fact that I feel like my mouth is cleaner after using this product.</li>
            <li> I have been a Crest product user for years but just recently have been using the Crest ProHealth toothpaste and mouthwash. I must confess they are a great new line up for Crest. My teeth not only feel cleaner after each brushing correctly but they look brighter. Combining the ProHealth line of toothpaste and mouthwash make for a fresh long lasting effect with fresh breathe as well. My mouth feels as clean if not cleaner than going to the the dentist and a lot less invasive. I highly recommend the whole Crest ProHealth line of products as a sure defense for your teeth and mouth needs. Try it you will definitely like it and so will your mouth.</li>
            <li> Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection MouthWash moves you to a healthier mouth from day one. The taste keeps you breath smelling good for 24 hours as long as you use it 2x&#x27;s a day!! It kills the germs in you mouth and as you use it, you will not only see the difference, but you will feel the difference. I brush my teeth three to four times a day, but I use this mouthwash two to three times a day and I am telling you I see the difference in the whitening of my teeth. My dentist even told me that its improving my teeth and she sees that its fighting plaque and gingivitis. She is even going to start recommending it to her paitents. Thanks to Crest, I got to try Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection MouthWash for FREE!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I like the freshness and it keeps hubby bad breath in check. I rotate this with my whitening mouthwash and have noticed a difference in how fresh my mouth remains longer than the other. I am please with this and it is all hubby will use. super happy it is alcohol free!</li>
            <li> I received a free bottle of Crest Pro Health mouthwash from BzzAgent and I won&#x27;t lie I thought it was going to be hard on my sensitive mouth. I was very pleased that the first time I used Crest Pro Health I didn&#x27;t have a break out in my mouth and my taste buds didn&#x27;t change! (That is what normally happens when I use mouthwash) The only negative thing that I have to say about it is that at about 20 seconds into 30 seconds of swishing it starts to burn slightly . I Can deal with a mild burn for 10 seconds since Im having such positive results such as: fresh breath all day, my teeth feel clean no matter what I eat and my teeth ever look brighter! I&#x27;m very pleased with my results and I will be purchasing Crest Pro Health when my free bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> Wish I&#x27;d read the reviews first.  This stuff left ugly brown stains all over my teeth.  It came off with a dental cleaning, but it took the hygienist forever.  She said that it&#x27;s really common from mouthwashes such as Crest with cetylpyridinium chloride as the active ingredient and she doesn&#x27;t recommend Crest for that reason.</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review from smiley360.com. Opinions are 100% my own. I&#x27;ve used other mouthwash&#x27;s and the after taste and soreness I get in my throat from using them discourages me from wanting to use them. With Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection Alcohol free, there&#x27;s not after taste lingering in my mouth only fresh breath, along with no throat irritation. Using this Crest product leaves my mouth fresh breath and clean teeth. I&#x27;ll continue to use this product daily!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m was very hesitant to switch to a new mouthwash. But when I was asked to give this one a try #gotitfree I am so glad I did. It is so refreshing to get up in the morning and get rid of my dragon breath with this non burning mouth wash. Taste great and is great for the health of my teeth and mouth. Thanks Crest. #crestprohealth</li>
            <li> I received my free sample of Crest Pro-Health and it is the best I have ever tried. There is no burn when you use it and therefore for can rinse for the recommended amount of time. It leaves my mouth fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I love this product, my mouth felt so fresh for a long time! I&#x27;ve tried many products over the years and never have I seen such a productive product.   #Smile360  I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> My dentist actually recommended that I use this, and I&#x27;m so glad he did. I received a free sample and tried it.  Since it&#x27;s alcohol free, it doesn&#x27;t burn or make my eyes water.  And I&#x27;ve had better dental visits since i started using it.  I use it after I brush in the morning, and then again before I go to bed at night.  I thought you needed the alcohol to kill the germs and work, but you don&#x27;t.  The taste is pleasant too.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My husband and I testing the #Crest Pro-Health Multi-Protection# Mouthwash at the moment, well my husband has been using it for a few years already and sticks with it. I signed up for a free Trial at bzzagent to see if its also for me. A huge pro for me is, that there is no alcohol in it so it doesnt burn while rinsing. Your mouth feels clean and fresh for hours. #GotItFree</li>
            <li> I received this for free from BzzAgent, I had high expectations for this product, but have to say I was pretty disappointed. It does the job of an average mouthwash, but I still has a pretty strong burning sensation on my tongue and inside of my mouth. I used this every morning and night until I finished the bottle and, sadly, was excited to switch back to my regular, basic mouthwash. I found that the burn from this product was actually more unpleasant than a regular mouthwash. Sadly, will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Luckily I didn&#x27;t have to pay for this. It leaves a nasty after taste in my mouth instead of a fresh feeling.  I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I began using this product after receiving a free sample from Smiley360.  After using for a week I really didn&#x27;t notice a big difference.  It did leave my mouth feeling clean and had a nice refreshing mint flavor.  It&#x27;s says it is not supposed to have the burn like those that use alcohol but I think it did.  Maybe I have a more sensitive mouth.  Overall it is a good mouthwash.</li>
            <li> i love using crest-pro health. It leaves my mouth feeling so refreshed</li>
            <li> Ok Ok, I know it&#x27;s a cheezy title...but it&#x27;s right on the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What would I want to know before I get this product? I would want to know if it is really worth the money.  In today&#x27;s economy, I need to make sure that every choice I make is financially sound. We are a one income family of 5 and need to cut out inefficiency. We frequently purchase store brand products in order to save. This is especially true when we really can&#x27;t justify a big/any difference in name brand versus generic.  In the case of Crest ProHealth, we can justify the purchase.  Not a drop is wasted or thrown away because all 5 of us now use this mouthwash 2x daily.  So, yes savvy shoppers, this name brand product is worth the money (although it&#x27;s not an expensive product to begin with).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now let&#x27;s talk about how it works.  I drink lots of coffee.  My kids and husband eat lots of very spicy foods.  We are a family of questionable breath....wait, I mean we WERE.  Now, we are a family more confident talking to each other and friends/family with fresher breath.  It keeps our breath fresher for longer periods of time.  I&#x27;m not talking MIRACLE, I&#x27;m talking about a clean mouth routine that is easy to follow and has longer-lasting results.  When I say easy to follow, I mean the mouthwash doesn&#x27;t burn.  When products burn, the actual usage decreases as bad breath increases...cause we all dreaded that burning moment.  Now, we get results with fresh mint instead of alcohol.  We&#x27;re all super okay with that!  Next, it&#x27;s important to know that continued, consistent use has lessened our plaque...thus, whiter teeth.  It used to be that when I would wake up in the morning there was still a lingering slime to my teeth, even after brushing and washing the night before.  Now, that isn&#x27;t the case anymore.  When I wake up...after a long night of snoring...my teeth are still clean feeling. NO SLIM.  I know it sounds gross and I&#x27;m running the risk of not making WILL SMITH jealous anymore because I&#x27;m so uncool.  But no worries, my breath is still cool!</li>
            <li> So far so good. Love the fresh minty taste and the fact that there is no burn . Crest Pro-health Multi-Protection left a fresh clean taste for a long time after using it. I haven&#x27;t noticed any discoloration or staining of my teeth after using it for about 3 weeks like others have reported. Overall i&#x27;m very satisfied and will continue using the product. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> Great taste! left my breath fresh longer also.....also didn&#x27;t leave a after taste as most do....&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.”</li>
            <li> long lasting freshness. im so excited to use this mouthwash because of the great affects it gave my teeth and breath. it was long lasting and dont have that burn that othert mouthwashes give you. def recommend this product</li>
            <li> I have long since loved using Crest products, and this mouth wash did not disappoint. I like how the taste is not overly strong and it still leaves my mouth feeling fresh and clean afterwards! I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I love the way it leaves my mouth fresh and minty.</li>
            <li> Received this product free from Smiley360 and love it.  It leaves a fresh feeling in your mouth without the stinging.</li>
            <li> I have used Crest products for as long as I can remember, and the Crest Pro Health Multi Protection Rinse definitely lives up to the expectations I have for Crest.  I have never been a big fan of mouthwash because the alcohol always left a burning sensation, and I never liked the taste.  However with this Multi Protection Rinse, there is no alcohol, the clean mint flavor lives my mouth feeling refreshed and clean with no burning sensation.  I also like the fact that it helps keep my mouth feeling fresh all day, and my breath smells great.  My husband also has started using it, and he loves it as well.&lt;br /&gt;I did receive a free product for the purpose of this review, however all opinions are 100% mine.</li>
            <li> I really liked this mouthwash. It is alcohol free so it did not make my mouth burn. It cleaned well and did not leave any aftertaste. I recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I love Crest Pro Health!  It has a nice minty freshness and makes my mouth feel clean.  Helps with any breath odors too.  I would recommend this to a friend!  No teeth staining issues here!  I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I used this until the bottle was gone.  It was just ok in my opinion. It seemed like it didn&#x27;t last as long throughout the day as some other mouthwashes I have used.  I also didn&#x27;t have that fresh feeling like I get from other mouthwashes.  Maybe I&#x27;m just accustomed to using alcohol based mouthwashes.  My husband has used it and loved it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the taste and clean feeling this mouthwash gives my mouth. It is very crisp and cleansing without the burn that comes with so many other products. The only drawback is that it does seem to stain your teeth a little but as long as you have a good brushing routine, it won&#x27;t effect you. I brush, then use my crest prohealth mouthwash, then I just brush my teeth with the water remaining on my brush. It still does the job with the great freshness and no long term staining. My teeth are almost completely white with no additional products use to treat. Just this wonderful mouthwash and my toothpaste! The product was given to me to test, this review is 100% my thoughts.</li>
            <li> I love this mouthwash.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash is really great- not too strong of an alcohol taste and leaves your mouth fresh until lunch.</li>
            <li> I got this product as part of promotion to test &amp; review. Honestly I love this mouthwash! It makes me feel so fresh and my breath smells great.! I love mint &amp; so you are a person who loves mint as well, you should definitely give this mouthwash a try! I like the fact that it&#x27;s alcohol free, which is not the same with other mouthwash brands. I would definitely recommend this mouthwash to everyone !</li>
            <li> This mouthwash is great, the flavor is good not burning like alot of other mouthwashes out there,#crest-pro-health is welcome at my home and i will continue to but this in the furture. also i #gotitfree from #bzzagent thank you</li>
            <li> I love crest pro health it makes my mouth feel super fresh and gives you great breath and it&#x27;s alcohol free so it&#x27;s not harsh when your gurgling. :)</li>
            <li> Maybe they&#x27;ve changed the formula or there was some sort of smear campaign because I received a full size free bottle to try and give my HONEST opinion and I love it.My entire family prefers it to our other mouthwash and love the taste and way it makes our mouths feel.I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> i received this product has a free sample for testing purpose by crest, and my kids like very much</li>
            <li> I tried this as part of a mission from bzzagent and I loved!!! it it leaves your mouth feeling fresh and clean and it doesn&#x27;t burn your mouth lie other mouthwashes do its no overpowering and does not hurt to use it like others.</li>
            <li> Crest pro health is a great mouthwash! It doesn&#x27;t burn refreshes your breath! Keeps your mouth clean!!!</li>
            <li> I dislike this mouthwash! I feel like it doesn&#x27;t even clean my mouth and leaves nasty stains more than cleans!! Do not recommend!</li>
            <li> I did receive this as part of a promotion from bzzagent.  After reading all of the negative feedback I was kind of scared to try it.  I think it is pretty decent mouthwash.  It kept my mouth fresh all day long. I didn&#x27;t notice any adverse effects from it.  I like the taste and like that it&#x27;s not harsh and alcohol free.  I intend to use in the future.</li>
            <li> I was able to sample this product thanks to bzzagent and crest. I never really used mouthwash due to hating the burn from the alcohol and the bad taste. I was pleasantly surprises by this product. I experienced only a slight burning (much less than with other mouth washes) and it has a great fresh mint taste! The best part is that it kept my teeth feeling nice and clean all day even after eating sweets.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product thinking they had their act together and come to find out I couldn&#x27;t taste anything for the whole day when I used this mouthwash!  I was worried that there was permanate damage but it returned about halfway though the next day.  Just flooring that this could pass inspections with something that long lasting.  I asked around friends about using it and they agreed with the browning and loss of taste, which frightened them as well.  Never buying Crest again.  Very disappointing company.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample from #BzzAgent and have been using it off and on for the past few weeks, I like the way it keeps my mouth feeling fresh for almost the whole day after I swish. it does feel a bit burny on the tongue, but no more or less than other mouthwashes, and seems to do the trick! #sponsored #Crest</li>
            <li> Good buy, great taste. and I swear by this.</li>
            <li> Horrible product. Unless you want stained teeth that is!!</li>
            <li> this product indeed do cause stains, especially the bottom teeth. I have been wondering why my teeth keep staining right after my dental visits. After I read the reviews on here, I made the connection. You would think a mouthwash in blue color would not cause brown stains... think again. Yes, I do drink tea but not a single drop of coffee though. Even the tea I drink mostly raspberry... not those 100% brown colored tea. This product should be pulled from the market in my opinion since the stains really destroys the purpose of cleaning.</li>
            <li> After finishing the second bottle, my wife said it looked like some of my teeth were rotting because they were stained so badly. It took over an hour in the chair at the dentist office for her to scrape all of that staining off my teeth, and I have NEVER had stained teeth before in my life! The dental hygienist said she had several patients who never had staining before begin to have staining when they started using this product. In some fairness, it does say on the back of the bottle in little tiny letters that this product may cause staining. For me, I will never use another Crest product at all!</li>
