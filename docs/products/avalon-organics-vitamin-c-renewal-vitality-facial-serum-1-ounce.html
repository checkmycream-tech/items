    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>For people wondering about the smell, the best thing I can compare the smell to is if you ever ate orange flavored chocolate.</li>
            <li>skin just drinks it up, feels wonderful and the smell is great!&lt;br /&gt;After use</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go!!</li>

            <li>Very good serum at a great price.</li>
            <li>The packaging is great, the glass bottle and plastic pump conveniently and hygenically dispenses product.</li>
            <li>My friends and family are also noticing a difference in my skin complexion so this is a great product that works for me.  </li>
            <li>AT A GREAT PRICE!!&lt;br /&gt;YOU</li>
            <li>I notice a reduction in redness after one use--not drastic, but it&#x27;s still great.</li>
            <li>But this is a great serum.  </li>
            <li>Great citrus smell.  </li>
            <li>Anyways, this product feels and smells great.</li>
            <li>I thought the price of $11.99 was great.  </li>
            <li>I read all the great reviews about this</li>
            <li>soo i wasn&#x27;t too happy about that.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to have found this line a couple of months ago, and am now so bummed that I have to walk away from it.</li>
            <li>Not at all happy about this.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin looking and feeling great.</li>
            <li>so I figured to look on amazon for a great deal.</li>
            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing!</li>
            <li>I use this after treating my skin with 100% tea tree oil, so my skin is thirsty and appreciative of the moisturizer!</li>
            <li>Recommended by a friend and couldnt be more impressed.</li>
            <li>Amazon sells it for the best price I have been able to find.</li>
            <li>it does not have a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>a pleasant citrus scent that&#x27;s not overbearing).  </li>
            <li>This serum is a pump, which makes applying it very easy!</li>
            <li>Smells good too.</li>
            <li>Good before moisturizer and make up.</li>
            <li>Good stuff in my opinion</li>
            <li>I loved it.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients have changed and the product is not as good as it was.</li>
            <li>Loved this, know it was for your face, but I use this on my hands when I go to bed at night.  </li>
            <li>my skin just looks and feels so good with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved every product I&#x27;ve ever used from them and this product is one of my favorites.  </li>
            <li>This feels really good on my skin and absorbs well.</li>
            <li>This may be a good serum for lines and wrinkles but not at the cost of headaches.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s fairly organic.</li>
            <li>Bummer, I think I would have loved this product.</li>
            <li>A good buy, but it</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>good all day moisturizer and 12 dollars cheaper than the store</li>
            <li>Many great treatments</li>
            <li>AND VERY SATISFIED..</li>
            <li>I had heard so many great reviews about this product</li>
            <li>So Glad I Did!  </li>
            <li>Okay, so I had to review this product because I am blown away!  </li>
            <li>I so love this product!</li>
            <li>I have been using the toner, serum, and moisturizer for about 2 months now, and I must say my face looks more luminous and even!</li>
            <li>The ingredients are great and the milky, silky texture of the serum smooths over and absorbs easily into the skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a pungent orange scent, sort of like the scent of an orange peel after you zest it, and not the pleasant smell of the fruit of an orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pros:  smells great  light on face;</li>
            <li>My complexion is smoother, even, bright and more supple.</li>
            <li>This was a nice product till I discovered how toxic it could be.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice smell too</li>
            <li>I liked everything about what it did to my face.  </li>
            <li>AS WELL WAS SHIPPED AND PACKAGED NICELY AND CAME IN A TIMELY MANNER  .</li>
            <li>I see this as an effective serum for my treatment.</li>
            <li>Nice stuff, not greasy but works well under my night cream</li>
            <li>and it smells nice and citrusy.</li>
            <li>The serum absorbs welI and wears nicely under makeup.</li>
            <li>The serum is lightweight and does get into the skin with no residue which I liked.</li>
            <li>I like the way it made my skin feel tighter and it had a nice smell.  </li>
            <li>Has a nice consistency and smell.  </li>
            <li>love this and good price.</li>
            <li>However, I have really liked this product.  </li>
            <li>Overall great product and an excellent deal!</li>
            <li>I am very very happy I bought this product and highly reccommend.</li>
            <li>: I get rashes and hives very easily.  </li>
            <li>I love love it!  </li>
            <li>And then, when I looked at the latest person&#x27;s review, I kind of had to agree.  </li>
            <li>I hope that they don&#x27;t change the formulation, unless it is to improve the results, because this is one of the best products I ever used, and it works without hurting my skin in any way, so far.  </li>
            <li>My skin was balanced and hydrated all day...very smooth and bright.  </li>
            <li>The stores where I live charge WAY more than Amazon, so I hope Amazon continues to provide this product at the great prices they have been offering it!</li>
            <li>Goodbye Avalon Organics - I will make my own ordering the original ingredients from Mtn Rose Herbs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very comfortable and confident going out without makeup</li>
            <li>This serum is one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li>If you use it for 2 weeks, be patient, you&#x27;ll see your face brighten and your complexion become more supple and even.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be enjoying slathering my face with eye serum in the meantime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>sure you check the bottle, my recommendation.</li>
            <li>It is firmer and has more elasticity.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say to give this a-go for sure.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>I happen to be ok with that smell</li>
            <li>pump bottle is okay -</li>
            <li>It would make it much appealing to use.</li>
            <li>Love it!!&lt;br /&gt;Skin</li>
            <li>I returned to Avalon and am glad I did.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say for sure.</li>
            <li>Service was great and fast .</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed this product and will continue to reorder.  </li>
            <li>mostly the face creams..</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love this product after a day in the sun or whenever skin is irritated</li>
            <li>Enjoyable.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, my skin stays moist throughout the day plus it helps on my wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Again, all Avalon Organics because I love their products.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin look healthy.</li>
            <li>They have since changed the packaging which I like better.  </li>
            <li>Pump works much better.</li>
            <li>I put the cream on top and went to bed.  </li>
            <li>But not any more.</li>
            <li>and I love that too.</li>
            <li>I have severe hyper pigmentation, mostly around my eye area.</li>
            <li>think I will try another serum to see if I get better results.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just I want to try and find something better.</li>
            <li>Worked well for my skin.....ordered it many times...</li>
            <li>My skin does look and feel a bit better already.</li>
            <li>The product packaging was okay.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why this is maybe because after I had my child my chemical balance changed but after trying over many times to want the product to work it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad</li>
            <li>I cough title in time and was able to wipe it off.</li>
            <li>so I think it is in part to the vitamin C I have used on my face for so many years.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love both.</li>
            <li>No matter how many times I pumped the spray nozzle, it never worked, not even once.  </li>
            <li>then you will definitely love it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product because of how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>My skin never looked better.</li>
            <li>Liked the original formula better.  </li>
            <li>First, the original serum was the BOMB!!!</li>
            <li>This whole line of products is amazing!</li>
            <li>This product is every bit as good as the higher priced products found in the up scale department stores at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>You can easily apply a richer moisturizer over top, and it wears well under mineral makeup.</li>
            <li>Overall I think this product is very good.  </li>
            <li>this item is exactly what i requested and i am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>First it smells amazing, but I love citrus smell.  </li>
            <li>I use it at night (no SPF for daytime use) as a light, clarifying moisturizer and love the way it refreshes, tones, and moistens my skin.  </li>
            <li>I am 61 and have some wrinkling but not a lot, this helps smooth things out and makes my skin look smoother, plumper and more glowing.</li>
            <li>It was only about $17, the product came in right on time and perfectly packaged.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had compliments that I&#x27;ve never had before so clearly the results are amazing!</li>
            <li>I bought this based on the reviews I have read, well let me tell you that they are true, I totally love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Glowing skin with reduction in fine lines.</li>
            <li>The product over all seems to work fine</li>
            <li>and I am noticing fine lines vanishing,, AND</li>
            <li>I think the product works fine, but I&#x27;m not blown away by it.</li>
            <li>I love that it absorbs into the skin so quickly.</li>
            <li>I am using the whole Avalon Vitamin C line and am in love!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and creamy.</li>
            <li>By itself it could suffice as a moisturizer for oily skin during the sticky summer months, despite the light texture hyaluronic acid and olive squalane oil are hard-working moisturizers.</li>
            <li>non greasy--most time (smooth feeling)  </li>
            <li>May be too light for night use.</li>
            <li>Some might think of this as a cheap chemical peel at home but not me.</li>
            <li>I was so happy with this product when I ordered it a couple times last year.</li>
            <li>GREAT FOR MIXING WITH YOU DAILY FACE LOTION AND UNDER YOUR FOUNDATION.. BRIGHTENS YOUR COMPLEXION AND SMOOTHS SKIN...</li>
            <li>Makes my skin smooth</li>
            <li>The fragrance was light and almost citrus.  </li>
            <li>Smooth consistency that feels like it absorbs well.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin smooth.</li>
            <li>Love it so much that I make sure I don&#x27;t run out and have to wait till I can get some.</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure it was the cocoa butter that did it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li>and there was a significant improvement each</li>
            <li>The original product was the bomb and it was affordable.</li>
            <li>This stuff is super smooth and silk.  </li>
            <li>The oils makes your skin feel soft but unfortunately, most users considering this product are seeking potent Vitamin-C.</li>
            <li>Formula\\&quot; smells funny, leaves a greasy residue on my skin and doesn&#x27;t give me the bright, smooth texture that the old formula did.</li>
            <li>This product turned made my face have bright red blotches all over it and it Burns!</li>
            <li>The serum itself makes your skin feel so soft and the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li>I read that straight vitamin C was better, rather than a lotion, so I bought a 20% vitamin C serum here on amazon.</li>
            <li>I went to Avalon website and got the full ingredient list:&lt;br /&gt;Aqua</li>
            <li>The scent is fresh and light.  </li>
            <li>I cant really say for sure if it has cured or resolved any acne or scars.</li>
            <li>will not see much of it working because you need more of it.</li>
            <li>I love the whole line.</li>
            <li>Good fragrance, good consistence, absortion,  I think is good for the skin,  I &amp;#34;believe&amp;#34; it can help, anyway for me its better than regular creams or expensive ones, which have caused irritation to my sking.</li>
            <li>Although I haven&#x27;t had this happen more than once, one more time, and I&#x27;ll be making a bigger deal.</li>
            <li>This is a light and effective facial serum.</li>
            <li>This does absorb quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel.</li>
            <li>The serum is a light-weight lotion type serum - different from my favorite Body Shop serum which is more like a gel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an Avalon Organics super fan.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s looking younger and tighter more and more.</li>
            <li>the tone evening properties of Vitamin C. Been wanting to try it for months but never was able to get around to it until I did my most recent toiletry shopping at Target.</li>
            <li>My skin look amazing, and I believe its a combination of this product and red light therapy that is doing the trick.</li>
            <li>The smell is mild and I have never got pimples from using it.  </li>
            <li>It glides right on and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because of a lot of positive reviews, a good price relatively, and the organic factor.</li>
            <li>looks dewey and fresh.</li>
            <li>In the morning my skin looked brighter and more clear...</li>
            <li>I first bought this item early this year because it had such great reviews.  </li>
            <li>SUCH A GOOD PRODUCT, BARELY ANY SMELL AND GOES ON LIGHT AND NOT GREASY AT ALL.</li>
            <li>, it just happen to be right there as I was making my way to the checkout.</li>
            <li>and I used the product right after I bought it.</li>
            <li>After using this product my skin therapist noticed right away.</li>
            <li>They make my face soft, hydrated, and clean!</li>
            <li>My face is doing pretty good due to this stuff.</li>
            <li>I am 50 years old, and this serum removed all my fine lines and brightened my skin visibly, leaving it with a golden glow.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sad with all the great reviews, I&#x27;m a 23 year old and have been taking good care of my skin</li>
            <li>Very much like this lotion.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very gentle and nonirritating.  </li>
            <li>Not sure what all the fuss is here in these reviews regarding a change in ingredients; I find its current formula to be more than acceptable and very effective.</li>
            <li>I love this facial serum.  </li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s working pretty well.  </li>
            <li>So I bought another one after I was done with the first one.  </li>
            <li>It is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Only reason I have it a 4 was the smell was overwhelming</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a satisfied customer of this serum for several years now.  </li>
            <li>Not a miracle, but a real improvement!</li>
            <li>serum exactly combines:</li>
            <li>I wish I came to Amazon first...</li>
            <li>it home and tried it that first night and twice a day since then</li>
            <li>The trick is to use it consistently on a cleansed face.</li>
            <li>Still, my face stays clear and smooth since I started using this.</li>
            <li>I had to throw it away after the first use.  </li>
            <li>So I use the stick inside to draw some out onto my hand first, then apply to my face, which is not something</li>
            <li>Too many oils and not enough Vitamin-C.</li>
            <li>Standing next to it is a serum that cost almost four times more, which I&#x27;ll never order again.</li>
            <li>I think my skin tone is more even and some slight discoloration I had from light scarring seems to even be clearing up.  </li>
            <li>, I think the original version was better, this is a down grade if you ask me.</li>
            <li>this didn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;ve used other Avalon Organics products and liked them, but this didn&#x27;t deliver.</li>
            <li>I loved the old formula, I would purchase by bulk since I&#x27;m currently overseas and received the new formulated version.</li>
            <li>But I much prefer a gel-based serum such as the Body Shop&#x27;s since gel smooths out the skin much better than this light-weight lotion.</li>
            <li>just left my skin felling nice soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li>I am very into fitness and healthy eating, and now I&#x27;m taking it further and taking care of my skin!</li>
            <li>Works just as good, if not better since there&#x27;s hyaluronic acid in it and is 70% certified organic.</li>
            <li>Not super fancy orange chocolate, but the cheaper kind or even that chocolate orange that you smash</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, does not have an obnoxious smell - and it makes my skin soft and dewy.  </li>
            <li>All I can say for certain is that I&#x27;ve had no problems with it.</li>
            <li>and my skin is still nice and tight</li>
            <li>I will use the whole product , as of right now I will be planning to purchase a new one once i am done with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re looking for a light moisturizer, Vitamin C Vitality Facial Serum is certainly acceptable as it does provide some moisture and improves the look of my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work for me</li>
            <li>When I stopped using it my skin cleared up fast.</li>
            <li>Even the trace amount in this serum was too much for my face.</li>
            <li>I used the whole bottle and saw no improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Writing reviews really work...</li>
            <li>(I thought it was going to be very orange-y</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s how much I like it.</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it either.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff</li>
            <li>I really wish that this had a fresher citrus scent.</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>I was amazed how fast this worked for me.</li>
            <li>I think if I weren&#x27;t micro-needling with it probably wouldn&#x27;t do much for my skin.</li>
            <li>That said, I really like this serum.  </li>
            <li>What I was looking for in this product was the ascorbic acid, which contains the real vitamin c.</li>
            <li>but since there is not a lot in it... i dont really know if it works well on acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>However, it does leave my face very moisturized.</li>
            <li>I really did want this product to work for me</li>
            <li>I did not notice much of a difference</li>
            <li>and I really like it</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, because I like the product so much, I was reorder, even with the spray pump flaw.</li>
            <li>fast shipment and</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin looking fresh and alive.  </li>
            <li>It feels warm when it is on, but only for a short while.  </li>
            <li>Smells ok, kind of like cooked down orange, not fresh orange.</li>
            <li>even my boyfriend said my face smells of orange when he kissed me (which i think its kinda funny but a little embarrassing, but i guess it&#x27;s better than having scars/</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the batches are different or if something happened in the shipping process, so I&#x27;m not sure that I would buy it online again, despite the great price.</li>
            <li>I used this product at different times over a period of two years but got the same reaction, bright red raised skin that burned.</li>
            <li>One squirt flows over my whole face and neck, and once it has absorbed, I use the facial cream.  </li>
            <li>The same smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I used this particularly for the morning.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a decent serum.</li>
            <li>I have older skin</li>
            <li>They need to do more research or maybe they did and are to selfish so that if they did not as many people would buy and just let the consumer buy without knowing until they find out for themselves.</li>
            <li>The bottle is a wonderful dispenser - has a great pump that dispenses just a little bit of cream at a time which is usually enough to cover half the face, then I squeeze out another little bit for the other side.</li>
            <li>High quality face serum.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and once I am done with this bottle, I will be purchasing again here on Amazon for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li>highly recommend...</li>
            <li>I could really see the difference in my sensitive, acne scarred skin after using it for a month.</li>
            <li>Most of the benzene exposure comes from the environment including cigarette smoke, car exhaust, industrial waste and service stations.</li>
            <li>I am in my early 30s and have good skin but a few sun spots and surface wrinkles, but I saw no improvement in any way, shape, or form after using the entire bottle.</li>
            <li>The pump, however would only squirt out in so strong a stream that it splashed all over me and the sink when I wanted only a dab.</li>
            <li>right now it is summer and humid outside.</li>
            <li>I will no longer be purchasing the newer version of this, and will look for a new serum now.</li>
            <li>Even with the new formula it works for me.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;New</li>
            <li>The most recent purchase smells rancid which is rough since it goes on my face.</li>
            <li>I have combination and very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive too</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t break out my very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>However, I ordered this exact bottle a week ago and trusted that it was the facial serum, as it says so on the label in the picture, as well as the description.</li>
            <li>Initially when I first used it, it was moisturizing</li>
            <li>....and my skin was soft!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product completely!</li>
            <li>Fine lines seem to be less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I understand that vitamin C serum has a short shelf life and to watch their bottom dollar this company has to do something to make sure their product has a good shelf life, but I think we should seriously have a discussion in this country about whether we should allow a company to use the word organic and contain carcinogens in their product, even if it is a small percentage.  </li>
            <li>It has done an amazing job at keeping my face less oily without dry patches.</li>
            <li>I use it to get rid of my old and new acne scar....</li>
            <li>just a little light blush</li>
            <li>and you can really tell the difference from an all natural, organic product from a chemical based commercially manufactured one.</li>
            <li>The dark circles around my eyes have pretty much blended in with the rest of my skin tone which has taken on a brightened glow.</li>
            <li>and I was so surprised to hear after 2 days of using the serum</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering a second bottle which is unusual for me.</li>
            <li>, my skin is so soft, not at all greasy, no shine!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>Initially I utilized this and thought that I hadn&#x27;t seen much improvement.  </li>
            <li>I have worked in skincare for 16 years and have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Some soft drinks have been removed from the market when they were found to contain benzene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s too much for my skin to handle from a daily use of this serum.</li>
            <li>My face is soft  </li>
            <li>it because it didn&#x27;t do much for my facial lines.</li>
            <li>Out of all the ingredients in this product, the ascorbic acid was all the way near the bottom.</li>
            <li>I also like that Avalon Organics are natural products.</li>
            <li>It feels very moisturizing, it does have a bit of an oily texture for awhile, but I actually like that because I have such super dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was not too happy to find out that bottle is much bigger than the contents; i was not able to see results as it ran out within a few days of the purchase.</li>
            <li>compared with other famous brand skin products, this one stands out for it does not have paraben or other harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li>broke out terribly  not a slight difference than before  </li>
            <li>I did notice over the last 4 years they were steadily increasing the price and now this.</li>
            <li>The main issue I have with the serum is the fact that the vitamin c amount is really low.</li>
            <li>The other ingredients mostly included extracts of other organic stuff.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous product and only after a few short weeks the results are very noticeable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my late 20s and still fighting the dreaded acne (sigh, sigh) and was looking for a more natural facial routine.</li>
            <li>I can see a distinct difference in the dark spots that I had in September and how they look now in February.  </li>
            <li>I tried to wait it out to see if my skin just needed to adjust to a new product but by the second week I was seeing mountains on my face.  </li>
            <li>I used it according to the instructions; thus it was not due to misuse</li>
            <li>It has a very faint, natural, pleasant citrus smell.  </li>
            <li>I do like it and may get more if I don&#x27;t find something else a little heavier for a little bit of glow because since this leaves no residue on surface of skin, it does leave your skin with a natural look.</li>
            <li>In general, I like the product.</li>
            <li>Thankfully I discovered a truly 100% all natural organic skin care line through Skin Deep&#x27;s Cosmetic Safety Database called face naturals</li>
            <li>Apparently it has something to do with oxidation.</li>
            <li>Avalon, please bring back the old</li>
            <li>far I would recommend, will have a further analysis after a year.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a very dedicated and consistent costumer and this was just ridiculous.</li>
            <li>this so much I&#x27;m ordering other Avalon products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non greasy, organic and much cheaper than those other fancy labeled Vitamin C products.</li>
            <li>Sometimes too much comes out when you press down to squirt, no matter how lightly and delicately you press.</li>
            <li>I will warn you my face felt hot and my skin was a little red.  </li>
            <li>I was a little red at first</li>
            <li>The first few minutes it might make your face red where you applied, and feel hot, but that goes away within a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>costs way less than more expensive vit c cream but works really well.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> For people wondering about the smell, the best thing I can compare the smell to is if you ever ate orange flavored chocolate.</li>
            <li> skin just drinks it up, feels wonderful and the smell is great!&lt;br /&gt;After use</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good to go!!</li>

            <li> AT A GREAT PRICE!!&lt;br /&gt;YOU</li>
            <li> I notice a reduction in redness after one use--not drastic, but it&#x27;s still great.</li>

            <li> Great citrus smell.  </li>
            <li> Anyways, this product feels and smells great.</li>
            <li> I thought the price of $11.99 was great.  </li>
            <li> I read all the great reviews about this</li>
            <li> soo i wasn&#x27;t too happy about that.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to have found this line a couple of months ago, and am now so bummed that I have to walk away from it.</li>
            <li> Not at all happy about this.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin looking and feeling great.</li>
            <li> so I figured to look on amazon for a great deal.</li>
            <li> Very nice.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!</li>
            <li> I use this after treating my skin with 100% tea tree oil, so my skin is thirsty and appreciative of the moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Recommended by a friend and couldnt be more impressed.</li>
            <li> Amazon sells it for the best price I have been able to find.</li>
            <li> it does not have a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> a pleasant citrus scent that&#x27;s not overbearing).  </li>
            <li> This serum is a pump, which makes applying it very easy!</li>
            <li> Smells good too.</li>
            <li> Good before moisturizer and make up.</li>
            <li> Good stuff in my opinion</li>
            <li> I loved it.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients have changed and the product is not as good as it was.</li>
            <li> Loved this, know it was for your face, but I use this on my hands when I go to bed at night.  </li>
            <li> my skin just looks and feels so good with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved every product I&#x27;ve ever used from them and this product is one of my favorites.  </li>
            <li> This feels really good on my skin and absorbs well.</li>
            <li> This may be a good serum for lines and wrinkles but not at the cost of headaches.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s fairly organic.</li>
            <li> Bummer, I think I would have loved this product.</li>
            <li> A good buy, but it</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> good all day moisturizer and 12 dollars cheaper than the store</li>
            <li> Many great treatments</li>
            <li> AND VERY SATISFIED..</li>
            <li> I had heard so many great reviews about this product</li>
            <li> So Glad I Did!  </li>
            <li> Okay, so I had to review this product because I am blown away!  </li>
            <li> I so love this product!</li>
            <li> I have been using the toner, serum, and moisturizer for about 2 months now, and I must say my face looks more luminous and even!</li>
            <li> The ingredients are great and the milky, silky texture of the serum smooths over and absorbs easily into the skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a pungent orange scent, sort of like the scent of an orange peel after you zest it, and not the pleasant smell of the fruit of an orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pros:  smells great  light on face;</li>
            <li> My complexion is smoother, even, bright and more supple.</li>
            <li> This was a nice product till I discovered how toxic it could be.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice smell too</li>
            <li> I liked everything about what it did to my face.  </li>
            <li> AS WELL WAS SHIPPED AND PACKAGED NICELY AND CAME IN A TIMELY MANNER  .</li>
            <li> I see this as an effective serum for my treatment.</li>
            <li> Nice stuff, not greasy but works well under my night cream</li>
            <li> and it smells nice and citrusy.</li>
            <li> The serum absorbs welI and wears nicely under makeup.</li>
            <li> The serum is lightweight and does get into the skin with no residue which I liked.</li>
            <li> I like the way it made my skin feel tighter and it had a nice smell.  </li>
            <li> Has a nice consistency and smell.  </li>
            <li> love this and good price.</li>
            <li> However, I have really liked this product.  </li>
            <li> Overall great product and an excellent deal!</li>
            <li> I am very very happy I bought this product and highly reccommend.</li>
            <li> : I get rashes and hives very easily.  </li>
            <li> I love love it!  </li>
            <li> And then, when I looked at the latest person&#x27;s review, I kind of had to agree.  </li>
            <li> I hope that they don&#x27;t change the formulation, unless it is to improve the results, because this is one of the best products I ever used, and it works without hurting my skin in any way, so far.  </li>
            <li> My skin was balanced and hydrated all day...very smooth and bright.  </li>
            <li> The stores where I live charge WAY more than Amazon, so I hope Amazon continues to provide this product at the great prices they have been offering it!</li>
            <li> Goodbye Avalon Organics - I will make my own ordering the original ingredients from Mtn Rose Herbs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very comfortable and confident going out without makeup</li>
            <li> This serum is one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li> If you use it for 2 weeks, be patient, you&#x27;ll see your face brighten and your complexion become more supple and even.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be enjoying slathering my face with eye serum in the meantime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> sure you check the bottle, my recommendation.</li>
            <li> It is firmer and has more elasticity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say to give this a-go for sure.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> I happen to be ok with that smell</li>
            <li> pump bottle is okay -</li>
            <li> It would make it much appealing to use.</li>
            <li> Love it!!&lt;br /&gt;Skin</li>
            <li> I returned to Avalon and am glad I did.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say for sure.</li>
            <li> Service was great and fast .</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed this product and will continue to reorder.  </li>
            <li> mostly the face creams..</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love this product after a day in the sun or whenever skin is irritated</li>
            <li> Enjoyable.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, my skin stays moist throughout the day plus it helps on my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Again, all Avalon Organics because I love their products.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin look healthy.</li>
            <li> They have since changed the packaging which I like better.  </li>
            <li> Pump works much better.</li>
            <li> I put the cream on top and went to bed.  </li>
            <li> But not any more.</li>
            <li> and I love that too.</li>
            <li> I have severe hyper pigmentation, mostly around my eye area.</li>
            <li> think I will try another serum to see if I get better results.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just I want to try and find something better.</li>
            <li> Worked well for my skin.....ordered it many times...</li>
            <li> My skin does look and feel a bit better already.</li>
            <li> The product packaging was okay.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this is maybe because after I had my child my chemical balance changed but after trying over many times to want the product to work it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just glad</li>
            <li> I cough title in time and was able to wipe it off.</li>
            <li> so I think it is in part to the vitamin C I have used on my face for so many years.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love both.</li>
            <li> No matter how many times I pumped the spray nozzle, it never worked, not even once.  </li>
            <li> then you will definitely love it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product because of how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> My skin never looked better.</li>
            <li> Liked the original formula better.  </li>
            <li> First, the original serum was the BOMB!!!</li>
            <li> This whole line of products is amazing!</li>
            <li> This product is every bit as good as the higher priced products found in the up scale department stores at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> You can easily apply a richer moisturizer over top, and it wears well under mineral makeup.</li>
            <li> Overall I think this product is very good.  </li>
            <li> this item is exactly what i requested and i am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> First it smells amazing, but I love citrus smell.  </li>
            <li> I use it at night (no SPF for daytime use) as a light, clarifying moisturizer and love the way it refreshes, tones, and moistens my skin.  </li>
            <li> I am 61 and have some wrinkling but not a lot, this helps smooth things out and makes my skin look smoother, plumper and more glowing.</li>
            <li> It was only about $17, the product came in right on time and perfectly packaged.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had compliments that I&#x27;ve never had before so clearly the results are amazing!</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the reviews I have read, well let me tell you that they are true, I totally love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Glowing skin with reduction in fine lines.</li>
            <li> The product over all seems to work fine</li>
            <li> and I am noticing fine lines vanishing,, AND</li>
            <li> I think the product works fine, but I&#x27;m not blown away by it.</li>
            <li> I love that it absorbs into the skin so quickly.</li>
            <li> I am using the whole Avalon Vitamin C line and am in love!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and creamy.</li>
            <li> By itself it could suffice as a moisturizer for oily skin during the sticky summer months, despite the light texture hyaluronic acid and olive squalane oil are hard-working moisturizers.</li>
            <li> non greasy--most time (smooth feeling)  </li>
            <li> May be too light for night use.</li>
            <li> Some might think of this as a cheap chemical peel at home but not me.</li>
            <li> I was so happy with this product when I ordered it a couple times last year.</li>
            <li> GREAT FOR MIXING WITH YOU DAILY FACE LOTION AND UNDER YOUR FOUNDATION.. BRIGHTENS YOUR COMPLEXION AND SMOOTHS SKIN...</li>
            <li> Makes my skin smooth</li>
            <li> The fragrance was light and almost citrus.  </li>
            <li> Smooth consistency that feels like it absorbs well.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin smooth.</li>
            <li> Love it so much that I make sure I don&#x27;t run out and have to wait till I can get some.</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure it was the cocoa butter that did it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li> and there was a significant improvement each</li>
            <li> The original product was the bomb and it was affordable.</li>
            <li> This stuff is super smooth and silk.  </li>
            <li> The oils makes your skin feel soft but unfortunately, most users considering this product are seeking potent Vitamin-C.</li>
            <li> Formula\\&quot; smells funny, leaves a greasy residue on my skin and doesn&#x27;t give me the bright, smooth texture that the old formula did.</li>
            <li> This product turned made my face have bright red blotches all over it and it Burns!</li>
            <li> The serum itself makes your skin feel so soft and the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> I read that straight vitamin C was better, rather than a lotion, so I bought a 20% vitamin C serum here on amazon.</li>
            <li> I went to Avalon website and got the full ingredient list:&lt;br /&gt;Aqua</li>
            <li> The scent is fresh and light.  </li>
            <li> I cant really say for sure if it has cured or resolved any acne or scars.</li>
            <li> will not see much of it working because you need more of it.</li>
            <li> I love the whole line.</li>
            <li> Good fragrance, good consistence, absortion,  I think is good for the skin,  I &amp;#34;believe&amp;#34; it can help, anyway for me its better than regular creams or expensive ones, which have caused irritation to my sking.</li>
            <li> Although I haven&#x27;t had this happen more than once, one more time, and I&#x27;ll be making a bigger deal.</li>
            <li> This is a light and effective facial serum.</li>
            <li> This does absorb quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel.</li>
            <li> The serum is a light-weight lotion type serum - different from my favorite Body Shop serum which is more like a gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an Avalon Organics super fan.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s looking younger and tighter more and more.</li>
            <li> the tone evening properties of Vitamin C. Been wanting to try it for months but never was able to get around to it until I did my most recent toiletry shopping at Target.</li>
            <li> My skin look amazing, and I believe its a combination of this product and red light therapy that is doing the trick.</li>
            <li> The smell is mild and I have never got pimples from using it.  </li>
            <li> It glides right on and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because of a lot of positive reviews, a good price relatively, and the organic factor.</li>
            <li> looks dewey and fresh.</li>
            <li> In the morning my skin looked brighter and more clear...</li>
            <li> I first bought this item early this year because it had such great reviews.  </li>
            <li> SUCH A GOOD PRODUCT, BARELY ANY SMELL AND GOES ON LIGHT AND NOT GREASY AT ALL.</li>
            <li> , it just happen to be right there as I was making my way to the checkout.</li>
            <li> and I used the product right after I bought it.</li>
            <li> After using this product my skin therapist noticed right away.</li>
            <li> They make my face soft, hydrated, and clean!</li>
            <li> My face is doing pretty good due to this stuff.</li>
            <li> I am 50 years old, and this serum removed all my fine lines and brightened my skin visibly, leaving it with a golden glow.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sad with all the great reviews, I&#x27;m a 23 year old and have been taking good care of my skin</li>
            <li> Very much like this lotion.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very gentle and nonirritating.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what all the fuss is here in these reviews regarding a change in ingredients; I find its current formula to be more than acceptable and very effective.</li>
            <li> I love this facial serum.  </li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s working pretty well.  </li>
            <li> So I bought another one after I was done with the first one.  </li>
            <li> It is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Only reason I have it a 4 was the smell was overwhelming</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a satisfied customer of this serum for several years now.  </li>
            <li> Not a miracle, but a real improvement!</li>
            <li> serum exactly combines:</li>
            <li> I wish I came to Amazon first...</li>
            <li> it home and tried it that first night and twice a day since then</li>
            <li> The trick is to use it consistently on a cleansed face.</li>
            <li> Still, my face stays clear and smooth since I started using this.</li>
            <li> I had to throw it away after the first use.  </li>
            <li> So I use the stick inside to draw some out onto my hand first, then apply to my face, which is not something</li>
            <li> Too many oils and not enough Vitamin-C.</li>
            <li> Standing next to it is a serum that cost almost four times more, which I&#x27;ll never order again.</li>
            <li> I think my skin tone is more even and some slight discoloration I had from light scarring seems to even be clearing up.  </li>
            <li> , I think the original version was better, this is a down grade if you ask me.</li>
            <li> this didn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;ve used other Avalon Organics products and liked them, but this didn&#x27;t deliver.</li>
            <li> I loved the old formula, I would purchase by bulk since I&#x27;m currently overseas and received the new formulated version.</li>
            <li> But I much prefer a gel-based serum such as the Body Shop&#x27;s since gel smooths out the skin much better than this light-weight lotion.</li>
            <li> just left my skin felling nice soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I am very into fitness and healthy eating, and now I&#x27;m taking it further and taking care of my skin!</li>
            <li> Works just as good, if not better since there&#x27;s hyaluronic acid in it and is 70% certified organic.</li>
            <li> Not super fancy orange chocolate, but the cheaper kind or even that chocolate orange that you smash</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly, does not have an obnoxious smell - and it makes my skin soft and dewy.  </li>
            <li> All I can say for certain is that I&#x27;ve had no problems with it.</li>
            <li> and my skin is still nice and tight</li>
            <li> I will use the whole product , as of right now I will be planning to purchase a new one once i am done with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re looking for a light moisturizer, Vitamin C Vitality Facial Serum is certainly acceptable as it does provide some moisture and improves the look of my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work for me</li>
            <li> When I stopped using it my skin cleared up fast.</li>
            <li> Even the trace amount in this serum was too much for my face.</li>
            <li> I used the whole bottle and saw no improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Writing reviews really work...</li>
            <li> (I thought it was going to be very orange-y</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s how much I like it.</li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it either.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff</li>
            <li> I really wish that this had a fresher citrus scent.</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> I was amazed how fast this worked for me.</li>
            <li> I think if I weren&#x27;t micro-needling with it probably wouldn&#x27;t do much for my skin.</li>
            <li> That said, I really like this serum.  </li>
            <li> What I was looking for in this product was the ascorbic acid, which contains the real vitamin c.</li>
            <li> but since there is not a lot in it... i dont really know if it works well on acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> However, it does leave my face very moisturized.</li>
            <li> I really did want this product to work for me</li>
            <li> I did not notice much of a difference</li>
            <li> and I really like it</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, because I like the product so much, I was reorder, even with the spray pump flaw.</li>
            <li> fast shipment and</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin looking fresh and alive.  </li>
            <li> It feels warm when it is on, but only for a short while.  </li>
            <li> Smells ok, kind of like cooked down orange, not fresh orange.</li>
            <li> even my boyfriend said my face smells of orange when he kissed me (which i think its kinda funny but a little embarrassing, but i guess it&#x27;s better than having scars/</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the batches are different or if something happened in the shipping process, so I&#x27;m not sure that I would buy it online again, despite the great price.</li>
            <li> I used this product at different times over a period of two years but got the same reaction, bright red raised skin that burned.</li>
            <li> One squirt flows over my whole face and neck, and once it has absorbed, I use the facial cream.  </li>
            <li> The same smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I used this particularly for the morning.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a decent serum.</li>
            <li> I have older skin</li>
            <li> They need to do more research or maybe they did and are to selfish so that if they did not as many people would buy and just let the consumer buy without knowing until they find out for themselves.</li>
            <li> The bottle is a wonderful dispenser - has a great pump that dispenses just a little bit of cream at a time which is usually enough to cover half the face, then I squeeze out another little bit for the other side.</li>
            <li> High quality face serum.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and once I am done with this bottle, I will be purchasing again here on Amazon for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> highly recommend...</li>
            <li> I could really see the difference in my sensitive, acne scarred skin after using it for a month.</li>
            <li> Most of the benzene exposure comes from the environment including cigarette smoke, car exhaust, industrial waste and service stations.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 30s and have good skin but a few sun spots and surface wrinkles, but I saw no improvement in any way, shape, or form after using the entire bottle.</li>
            <li> The pump, however would only squirt out in so strong a stream that it splashed all over me and the sink when I wanted only a dab.</li>
            <li> right now it is summer and humid outside.</li>
            <li> I will no longer be purchasing the newer version of this, and will look for a new serum now.</li>
            <li> Even with the new formula it works for me.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;New</li>
            <li> The most recent purchase smells rancid which is rough since it goes on my face.</li>
            <li> I have combination and very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive too</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t break out my very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> However, I ordered this exact bottle a week ago and trusted that it was the facial serum, as it says so on the label in the picture, as well as the description.</li>
            <li> Initially when I first used it, it was moisturizing</li>
            <li> ....and my skin was soft!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product completely!</li>
            <li> Fine lines seem to be less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I understand that vitamin C serum has a short shelf life and to watch their bottom dollar this company has to do something to make sure their product has a good shelf life, but I think we should seriously have a discussion in this country about whether we should allow a company to use the word organic and contain carcinogens in their product, even if it is a small percentage.  </li>
            <li> It has done an amazing job at keeping my face less oily without dry patches.</li>
            <li> I use it to get rid of my old and new acne scar....</li>
            <li> just a little light blush</li>
            <li> and you can really tell the difference from an all natural, organic product from a chemical based commercially manufactured one.</li>
            <li> The dark circles around my eyes have pretty much blended in with the rest of my skin tone which has taken on a brightened glow.</li>
            <li> and I was so surprised to hear after 2 days of using the serum</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering a second bottle which is unusual for me.</li>
            <li> , my skin is so soft, not at all greasy, no shine!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> Initially I utilized this and thought that I hadn&#x27;t seen much improvement.  </li>
            <li> I have worked in skincare for 16 years and have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Some soft drinks have been removed from the market when they were found to contain benzene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s too much for my skin to handle from a daily use of this serum.</li>
            <li> My face is soft  </li>
            <li> it because it didn&#x27;t do much for my facial lines.</li>
            <li> Out of all the ingredients in this product, the ascorbic acid was all the way near the bottom.</li>
            <li> I also like that Avalon Organics are natural products.</li>
            <li> It feels very moisturizing, it does have a bit of an oily texture for awhile, but I actually like that because I have such super dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was not too happy to find out that bottle is much bigger than the contents; i was not able to see results as it ran out within a few days of the purchase.</li>
            <li> compared with other famous brand skin products, this one stands out for it does not have paraben or other harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> broke out terribly  not a slight difference than before  </li>
            <li> I did notice over the last 4 years they were steadily increasing the price and now this.</li>
            <li> The main issue I have with the serum is the fact that the vitamin c amount is really low.</li>
            <li> The other ingredients mostly included extracts of other organic stuff.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product and only after a few short weeks the results are very noticeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 20s and still fighting the dreaded acne (sigh, sigh) and was looking for a more natural facial routine.</li>
            <li> I can see a distinct difference in the dark spots that I had in September and how they look now in February.  </li>
            <li> I tried to wait it out to see if my skin just needed to adjust to a new product but by the second week I was seeing mountains on my face.  </li>
            <li> I used it according to the instructions; thus it was not due to misuse</li>
            <li> It has a very faint, natural, pleasant citrus smell.  </li>
            <li> I do like it and may get more if I don&#x27;t find something else a little heavier for a little bit of glow because since this leaves no residue on surface of skin, it does leave your skin with a natural look.</li>
            <li> In general, I like the product.</li>
            <li> Thankfully I discovered a truly 100% all natural organic skin care line through Skin Deep&#x27;s Cosmetic Safety Database called face naturals</li>
            <li> Apparently it has something to do with oxidation.</li>
            <li> Avalon, please bring back the old</li>
            <li> far I would recommend, will have a further analysis after a year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very dedicated and consistent costumer and this was just ridiculous.</li>
            <li> this so much I&#x27;m ordering other Avalon products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non greasy, organic and much cheaper than those other fancy labeled Vitamin C products.</li>
            <li> Sometimes too much comes out when you press down to squirt, no matter how lightly and delicately you press.</li>
            <li> I will warn you my face felt hot and my skin was a little red.  </li>
            <li> I was a little red at first</li>
            <li> The first few minutes it might make your face red where you applied, and feel hot, but that goes away within a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> costs way less than more expensive vit c cream but works really well.</li>
            <li> I will probably only use the serum at night since it is so active and to not waste it.  </li>
            <li> usually my acne scars would not leave my face until a couple months later but the Vitamin C serum really help fasten up the process.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to know if it is making my skin any different, but i do like everything about it EXCEPT the smell.</li>
            <li> From past experience I know that pure cocoa butter breaks me out; it even gives me body acne and can clog pores around my lips if I use it like chap stick.</li>
            <li> Second, they did change the formula to exclude several important antioxidant ingredients -Hyaluronic acid, green tea to name a few and they slim down on several ingredients as they are found at the bottom.</li>
            <li> I was a Sudden Change fan for a long time.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing because I used to really like it, but not any more.</li>
            <li> For some reason, however, the product seemed a bit watered down compared to a same I tried in a local store.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this one and was a bit skeptical because the price was quite abit less than most of the competition.  </li>
            <li> with daily use, and you HAVE to keep up with it, my deep pitted acne marks start to become less noticeable in a month.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this product very long</li>
            <li> The area around my nose, side of my nose, and side of my mouth started to feel dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> Little goes a long way, so it will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> Wrinkles disappear instantly and it penetrates deeper than other moisturizers!</li>
            <li> It might leave your face a bit dry bc of the citrus acid in it so apply lotion after!</li>
            <li> I started using this a few months ago and noticed that it has helped clear up a lot of the dark blemishes from the stubborn acne I get every once in a while.</li>
            <li> So the 1 oz. will last for a little over a month.</li>
            <li> Little drying but only use it in the morning, not twice a day as recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for people with dark spots, acne scars, and dull skin.</li>
            <li> only complaint is the bottle just isn&#x27;t big</li>
            <li> Only been using for a few days, but</li>
            <li> I think we as consumers need to be careful of the ingredients we are using on our face.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviews.</li>
            <li> I had to wash my face many times and apply moisturizer :(  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Usually I am extremely fugal and have passed up opportunities to buy Vitamin C serums before</li>
            <li> Other than that I do like this.</li>
            <li> and it it a lot like the other product.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin like me though you may want to use another moisturizer or a little Vaseline at night and use this in the day which is what I do.</li>
            <li> I also use Juice Beauty green apple peel, which I think is helping with the ance, but I&#x27;ve only used it a few times</li>
            <li> I have bought much more expensive products that did not do anything they claimed, or worse, damaged my skin</li>
            <li> know when it is truly an allergic reaction and when it is just active ingredients working.  </li>
            <li> However, I would rather spend the extra money on Clinique; at least their products shows results.  </li>
            <li> but when I asked the cashier for the price, it was too late to turn back, so I bought it at a whooping $22.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not fading my dark spots to my satisfaction.</li>
            <li> (11/7/11)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realized that using this everyday is causing minimal breakouts.</li>
            <li> something I havent done in over a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am black American with a dark brown complexion, this reduced dramatically the appearance of my dull greyish hyper pigmentation.</li>
            <li> but it takes time, this is definitely not a QUICK fix.</li>
            <li> I wake up with smoother hands and the wrinkles seem less noticeable.</li>
            <li> The only thing is, be careful around your eyes, and don&#x27;t rub your eyes when tired if you have this product on your face.  </li>
            <li> I truly felt like I&#x27;d found liquid gold when I started using the previous formula.</li>
            <li> I have sun damage and acne marks, and with this regimen I am wearing less and less concealer.</li>
            <li> I probably won&#x27;t buy again (unless it ends up actually doing what it says it&#x27;s suppose to) because it&#x27;s expensive for such a little bottle</li>
            <li> I noticed a lot of improvement in my skin tone, texture, and clarity within a short time, but it&#x27;s not good for under makeup because it becomes greasy with time.</li>
            <li> I use this after cleansing each morning and it&#x27;s been a little over a month since I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I found this little gem.</li>
            <li> The serum is a little sticky in my opinion.. not oily, doesn&#x27;t clog my pores,  i&#x27;m still using it..</li>
            <li> However, I noticed the consistency was different and by the time I opened it and used it it was too late to return because I had actually been given the EYE SERUM instead, which is actually less expensive</li>
            <li> My skin is just as radiant, acne-free and firm like</li>
            <li> does take quite a few pumps to get anything to come out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tan well and take care of my skin and use sunblock everyday.</li>
            <li> I could tell it worked well &amp; even got a few compliments.</li>
            <li> BEEN USING FOR A FEW YEARS NOW</li>
            <li> I came across a few videos on Youtube praising</li>
            <li> I can tell a diff when I run out and stop using for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I am moving away from harsh chemicals</li>
            <li> I also layer other products over it, so it&#x27;s really hard to say with any certainty.</li>
            <li> I noticed in other reviews it was pointed out that the formulation has changed; that may be why my results are slow, because I&#x27;ve been using this since October.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was a combination of this vitamin c serum &amp; the hyaluronic acid</li>
            <li> got sent the wrong Avalon Organics Vitamin C facial serum, instead they sent me the eye serum instead...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s SOO small,</li>
            <li> Not potent as it used to be.</li>
            <li> Also, when you press/pump to dispense the serum, it is hard to control the amount that comes out.</li>
            <li> pictures because I do want to post &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; pictures or at least show progress.</li>
            <li> This is probably my 4th or 5th order of this product, I really like how it gives my skin a &amp;#34;smoother&amp;#34; base under a tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It clogs my pores and causes small pimples, even on parts of my face where I never break out!</li>
            <li> I am not really excited about the smell.. smells like a weird or rotting oranges...</li>
            <li> And whether I leave it alone or pop them (which I know is bad, but sometimes necessary)</li>
            <li> To bad they were corrupted by corporate greed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I&#x27;m one of the few adults who still gets acne.</li>
            <li> The scent is not particularly pleasant.</li>
            <li> up until today, 3 weeks later and I do not regret plunking down that insane amount of money for a \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; product.</li>
            <li> so I grabbed it anyway because my hyper pigmentation has gotten a lot worse</li>
            <li> I just hope that no one else has a worse reaction than I did and hopefully no trips to the hospital.</li>
            <li> The texture is not great, but I would have tolerated it if it didn&#x27;t have known carcinogens in it for preservative purposes.  </li>
            <li> I have not seen any dramatic improvement in appearance</li>
            <li> Unfortunately target had it for about $25, I was slightly annoyed</li>
            <li> NO MORE CROWS FEET!!!</li>
            <li> At $50 a pop, it started getting too expensive</li>
            <li> and I had to repair with expensive emergency treatments.  </li>
            <li> I was so skeptical, but I decided to give this a try.  </li>
            <li> i use my moisturizer to cover this weird smell).</li>
            <li> While a tad expensive, it seems to work for me.</li>
            <li> NOT HAPPY :(</li>
            <li> Bad smell, weird consistency and texture.</li>
            <li> I was afraid I might be allergic and was scared to put in on my face</li>
            <li> was just disappointing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m crazy about.  </li>
            <li> The smell, the ingredients, the color and texture all WRONG!</li>
            <li> I was using a very expensive department store brand of vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> bad</li>
            <li> Too bad because I was looking forward to using this.</li>
            <li> Not that this one was bad...</li>
            <li> This made my skin break out badly.  </li>
            <li> and I have to discontinue use and end up feeling frustrated and abstaining from all cosmetics for a while.  </li>
            <li> I was sick of this</li>
            <li> I used this product for over a month and realized by process of elimination that this was what was causing my skin to go downhill. :(</li>
            <li> Disappointed with Avalon</li>
            <li> This product is bad for me ...  !.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just very disappointed because this is supposed to be an organic product and there is no warning that reactions might occur.</li>
            <li> Anything irritates and causes horrible breakouts</li>
            <li> It stings terribly if it gets in your eyes.  </li>
            <li> Awful, had an allergic reaction.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Has improved my skin but it takes time, this is definitely not a QUICK fix. Be patient and you see results.</li>
            <li> This serum is one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li> I love this facial serum.  It keeps my face moist. It&#x27;s light and creamy. One squirt flows over my whole face and neck, and once it has absorbed, I use the facial cream.  Very nice.</li>
            <li> I will definitely come back for it again. compared with other famous brand skin products, this one stands out for it does not have paraben or other harmful ingredients. The effect? The same smooth and soft. every woman should get it.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work for me but I will not be buying Avalon Organic Vitamin C serum again. PROS: The packaging is great, the glass bottle and plastic pump conveniently and hygenically dispenses product. The ingredients are great and the milky, silky texture of the serum smooths over and absorbs easily into the skin. By itself it could suffice as a moisturizer for oily skin during the sticky summer months, despite the light texture hyaluronic acid and olive squalane oil are hard-working moisturizers. You can easily apply a richer moisturizer over top, and it wears well under mineral makeup. CONS: It clogs my pores and causes small pimples, even on parts of my face where I never break out! I used this product for over a month and realized by process of elimination that this was what was causing my skin to go downhill. :( When I stopped using it my skin cleared up fast. Bummer! I am pretty sure it was the cocoa butter that did it. From past experience I know that pure cocoa butter breaks me out; it even gives me body acne and can clog pores around my lips if I use it like chap stick. Even the trace amount in this serum was too much for my face.</li>
            <li> I used the whole bottle and saw no improvement in my skin. I am in my early 30s and have good skin but a few sun spots and surface wrinkles, but I saw no improvement in any way, shape, or form after using the entire bottle. Shame this didn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;ve used other Avalon Organics products and liked them, but this didn&#x27;t deliver.</li>
            <li> This was a nice product till I discovered how toxic it could be.  Did you know that what we place onto our skin is adsorbed into our blood stream?  If you cannot eat it, you should consider not putting it on your skin.     AVALON ORGANICS VITAMIN C SKIN CARE: VITALITY FACIAL SERUM is linked to Cancer, Developmental/reproductive toxicity, Neurotoxicity, Endocrine disruption, Organ system toxicity (non-reproductive) at the cellular level according to Skin Deep&#x27;s Cosmetic Safety Database.    Thankfully I discovered a truly 100% all natural organic skin care line through Skin Deep&#x27;s Cosmetic Safety Database called face naturals and you can really tell the difference from an all natural, organic product from a chemical based commercially manufactured one.</li>
            <li> This product is every bit as good as the higher priced products found in the up scale department stores at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> I loved the old formula, I would purchase by bulk since I&#x27;m currently overseas and received the new formulated version. NOT HAPPY :( The smell, the ingredients, the color and texture all WRONG! If I had known I would have purchase one to test. I will no longer be purchasing the newer version of this, and will look for a new serum now. The highlight of my morning use to be this serum, not anymore, just waiting to use the last of the last bottle before I start looking elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I swear by this stuff. If you use it for 2 weeks, be patient, you&#x27;ll see your face brighten and your complexion become more supple and even. However, I ordered this exact bottle a week ago and trusted that it was the facial serum, as it says so on the label in the picture, as well as the description. It even said so on the receipt. However, I noticed the consistency was different and by the time I opened it and used it it was too late to return because I had actually been given the EYE SERUM instead, which is actually less expensive and I was basically ripped off. It was my fault for not reading the bottle, I had just trusted the receipt and my order. Also, the bottle looks the same, so you don&#x27;t catch the \\&quot;eye\\&quot; part instantly. Although I haven&#x27;t had this happen more than once, one more time, and I&#x27;ll be making a bigger deal. I&#x27;m a very dedicated and consistent costumer and this was just ridiculous. I&#x27;ll be enjoying slathering my face with eye serum in the meantime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you check the bottle, my recommendation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Vitamin C Vitality Serum for about a month now and I think it&#x27;s working pretty well.  I think my skin tone is more even and some slight discoloration I had from light scarring seems to even be clearing up.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I see improvement in my skin using this product. It is firmer and has more elasticity. I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to know if it is making my skin any different, but i do like everything about it EXCEPT the smell. it does not have a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Pros:  smells great  light on face; non greasy--most time (smooth feeling)  moisturizing   Cons:  broke out terribly  not a slight difference than before  I&#x27;m pretty sad with all the great reviews, I&#x27;m a 23 year old and have been taking good care of my skin but after trying this, I broke out in a couple of areas. I would still use it because it helps with my flaky skin around the nose. However, I would rather spend the extra money on Clinique; at least their products shows results.  UPDATE (3 WEEKS IN):  Initially when I first used it, it was moisturizing but then it stop. Maybe because I got used to it or something but it stop working for me. The area around my nose, side of my nose, and side of my mouth started to feel dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> My face is doing pretty good due to this stuff. I noticed a lot of improvement in my skin tone, texture, and clarity within a short time, but it&#x27;s not good for under makeup because it becomes greasy with time. I like to use it at night, and it smells like somebody mashed an orange rind into a jar!</li>
            <li> This is a light and effective facial serum. I will be buying my second one soon. I really like it.</li>
            <li> Writing reviews really work...that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m writing one myself.  I&#x27;m in my late 20s and still fighting the dreaded acne (sigh, sigh) and was looking for a more natural facial routine. I read the reviews on the Vitamin C serum and took a leap of faith. So Glad I Did!  I love that it absorbs into the skin so quickly. I have oily skin and I was so surprised to hear after 2 days of using the serum my skin was so even and \\&quot;not so shiny\\&quot;....and my skin was soft! My friends and family are also noticing a difference in my skin complexion so this is a great product that works for me.  I use this after treating my skin with 100% tea tree oil, so my skin is thirsty and appreciative of the moisturizer! It&#x27;s a nice smell too (I thought it was going to be very orange-y but it&#x27;s not...a pleasant citrus scent that&#x27;s not overbearing).  I&#x27;d say to give this a-go for sure. I&#x27;m ordering another today that&#x27;s how much I like it. FYI: I use this after cleansing each morning and it&#x27;s been a little over a month since I purchased it. So the 1 oz. will last for a little over a month. I wish it came in a bigger size but it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff. I started using this a few months ago and noticed that it has helped clear up a lot of the dark blemishes from the stubborn acne I get every once in a while. Smells good too.</li>
            <li> I used this particularly for the morning. Not too creamy. Good before moisturizer and make up. May be too light for night use.</li>
            <li> I have medium-toned, South Asian skin and I swear by Ole Henriksen&#x27;s Truth Serum. At $50 a pop, it started getting too expensive so I had to find a cheaper alternative and lo and behold I found this little gem. Works just as good, if not better since there&#x27;s hyaluronic acid in it and is 70% certified organic. My skin is just as radiant, acne-free and firm like it was when I used the TS. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I was using a very expensive department store brand of vitamin C serum. This is a touch more drying but the results are the same as the expensive stuff. Glowing skin with reduction in fine lines. You really don&#x27;t need to use a lot of it either. I&#x27;m ordering a second bottle which is unusual for me. I really like this stuff and it smells like oranges. I do recommend using a moisturizer over it though day and night. Good stuff in my opinion</li>
            <li> I bought this at Walmart to try and help fade my freckles on my arms. I just started using it so I have no idea how it will work and yes I am not using it on my face. For people wondering about the smell, the best thing I can compare the smell to is if you ever ate orange flavored chocolate. Not super fancy orange chocolate, but the cheaper kind or even that chocolate orange that you smash and it breaks into slices. That&#x27;s what it smells like to me. I happen to be ok with that smell so I like it. This does absorb quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel. I probably won&#x27;t buy again (unless it ends up actually doing what it says it&#x27;s suppose to) because it&#x27;s expensive for such a little bottle and I ended up deciding to use it on my arms, not face. So we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> The serum is a light-weight lotion type serum - different from my favorite Body Shop serum which is more like a gel. It may be applied under moisturizer or worn by itself. The scent is not particularly pleasant. In fact, I once used Avalon&#x27;s Vitamin C Mosturizer and now I remember why I didn&#x27;t purchase it again: the scent! It reminds me of the smell of rotting oranges on the ground. It&#x27;s more of a pungent orange scent, sort of like the scent of an orange peel after you zest it, and not the pleasant smell of the fruit of an orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a decent serum. I like the lightweight feel and it does seem to improve the tone of my skin. But I much prefer a gel-based serum such as the Body Shop&#x27;s since gel smooths out the skin much better than this light-weight lotion. But if you&#x27;re looking for a light moisturizer, Vitamin C Vitality Facial Serum is certainly acceptable as it does provide some moisture and improves the look of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump bottle is okay - does take quite a few pumps to get anything to come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big turn-off though, is the scent. I really wish that this had a fresher citrus scent. It would make it much appealing to use.</li>
            <li> This product burned my face after about 5 days use. I don&#x27;t have any prior problems with my skin. I tan well and take care of my skin and use sunblock everyday. I didn&#x27;t use anything in conjunction with this product except face moisturizer and my face was peeling and burning with the touch of water on it after 5 days! Some might think of this as a cheap chemical peel at home but not me. I thought it sucked. And it freaked me out. Don&#x27;t use!</li>
            <li> I first bought this item early this year because it had such great reviews.  I loved it.  I liked everything about what it did to my face.  So I bought another one after I was done with the first one.  And... I didn&#x27;t get the same result. And then, when I looked at the latest person&#x27;s review, I kind of had to agree.  Did they change the ingredients?  I am still suspicious so I&#x27;m not buying it anymore.</li>
            <li> Only been using for a few days, but what a difference!&lt;br /&gt;My skin just drinks it up, feels wonderful and the smell is great!&lt;br /&gt;After use, my skin is so soft, not at all greasy, no shine!&lt;br /&gt;Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;Been using now for three months, this product has made such a difference in my 56 y/o skin. It is soft and smooth. So well hydrated I no longer have to wear face makeup, just a little light blush and I&#x27;m good to go!! Love it!!&lt;br /&gt;Skin looks dewey and fresh. Had lots of compliments on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Love this so much I&#x27;m ordering other Avalon products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the bottle just isn&#x27;t big enough!&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU AVALON FOR A WONDERFUL PRODUCT, THAT WORKS! AT A GREAT PRICE!!&lt;br /&gt;YOU HAVE A CUSTOMER FOR LIFE!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful Vitamin C product for the complexion.  I&#x27;ve decided that between this and Argan Oil, those&lt;br /&gt;are the only two products I will use on my skin (I am 60++), because the results are FANTASIC.  People notice me&lt;br /&gt;when I&#x27;m with my 40 y.o. daughter and can&#x27;t believe I am her MOTHER!!!!</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviews. The ingredients have changed and the product is not as good as it was. Very disappointing because I used to really like it, but not any more. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I was so happy with this product when I ordered it a couple times last year. I could tell it worked well &amp; even got a few compliments. Not sure if it was a combination of this vitamin c serum &amp; the hyaluronic acid I began using at same time. The most recent purchase smells rancid which is rough since it goes on my face. Looking for a replacement.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I&#x27;m one of the few adults who still gets acne. And whether I leave it alone or pop them (which I know is bad, but sometimes necessary) I get red marks that don&#x27;t go away for weeks, sometimes months. I was sick of this so I tried vitamin C, which helps with cell repair. This product is amazing! I notice a reduction in redness after one use--not drastic, but it&#x27;s still great. I read that straight vitamin C was better, rather than a lotion, so I bought a 20% vitamin C serum here on amazon. It didn&#x27;t work as well, and it gave me blackheads--something I never had before. Apparently it has something to do with oxidation. I returned to Avalon and am glad I did. Even with the new formula it works for me. I also use Juice Beauty green apple peel, which I think is helping with the ance, but I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so I can&#x27;t say for sure. I recommend this product for people who have red scarring on their faces. I also noticed a difference is my pore size.</li>
            <li> Service was great and fast . The product over all seems to work fine the only problem I have is the smell and texture I tested it in my hand and found that it was giving me a tingly sensation. I was afraid I might be allergic and was scared to put in on my face but I did and nothing happened just left my skin felling nice soft and refreshed. Only reason I have it a 4 was the smell was overwhelming</li>
            <li> Loved this, know it was for your face, but I use this on my hands when I go to bed at night.  I wake up with smoother hands and the wrinkles seem less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have bought much more expensive products that did not do anything they claimed, or worse, damaged my skin and I had to repair with expensive emergency treatments.  But this is a great serum.  I have combination and very sensitive skin.  Anything irritates and causes horrible breakouts and I have to discontinue use and end up feeling frustrated and abstaining from all cosmetics for a while.  I was so skeptical, but I decided to give this a try.  I am amazed with the results.  I am 50 years old, and this serum removed all my fine lines and brightened my skin visibly, leaving it with a golden glow.  It has a very faint, natural, pleasant citrus smell.  I hope that they don&#x27;t change the formulation, unless it is to improve the results, because this is one of the best products I ever used, and it works without hurting my skin in any way, so far.  No breakouts and no redness, itching, or burning.  The only thing is, be careful around your eyes, and don&#x27;t rub your eyes when tired if you have this product on your face.  It stings terribly if it gets in your eyes.  I totally recommend this.</li>
            <li> High quality face serum. Can see the results. Use under make- up. Does for the face what vitamin &amp;#34;c&amp;#34; does for the body.</li>
            <li> Good price! Great product!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this product very long and I don&#x27;t even use it every day but I can tell that it is working. My scarring is definitely getting lighter and it is improving my acne as well. I wish I would have taken &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; pictures because I do want to post &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; pictures or at least show progress. In addition to this serum, I&#x27;m also using a 10% benzol peroxide wash, a derma roller (both purchased from Amazon), as well as a face brush and fade cream. I see people mentioning the smell of it .While it doesn&#x27;t smell as citrusy as I would like it to , the smell does not last.</li>
            <li> This stuff is super smooth and silk.  Great citrus smell.  The first few minutes it might make your face red where you applied, and feel hot, but that goes away within a few minutes.  Sometimes too much comes out when you press down to squirt, no matter how lightly and delicately you press.</li>
            <li> Never got the correct item twice. Label on side of box didn&#x27;t match the front of the box.  Got eye cream twice.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed this product and will continue to reorder.  this item is exactly what i requested and i am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This product is bad for me ...  !. flushed my face ... I had to wash my face many times and apply moisturizer :(  bad</li>
            <li> I use alot of the Avalon products... mostly the face creams.. my skin just looks and feels so good with it.</li>
            <li> The Vitamin C Facial Serum 1 Ounces was received is as it was described. We would recommend this product for others.</li>
            <li> This product turned made my face have bright red blotches all over it and it Burns! Returning product. Disappointed with Avalon</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I could really see the difference in my sensitive, acne scarred skin after using it for a month. My complexion is smoother, even, bright and more supple. It has done an amazing job at keeping my face less oily without dry patches. Little goes a long way, so it will last you a long time. And order from Amazon, it beats any store price.</li>
            <li> Love this product after a day in the sun or whenever skin is irritated</li>
            <li> Excellent. Enjoyable.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, my skin stays moist throughout the day plus it helps on my wrinkles. I would but it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an Avalon Organics super fan.  I&#x27;ve loved every product I&#x27;ve ever used from them and this product is one of my favorites.  Initially I utilized this and thought that I hadn&#x27;t seen much improvement.  However, when I looked at pictures from before and after, I noticed there was a difference, so after about three months of not using, I repurchased.  I can see a distinct difference in the dark spots that I had in September and how they look now in February.  I took pictures at the beginning of each month from September when I started using again and now and there was a significant improvement each month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this in conjunction with the vitamin C cleansing milk, the vitamin C toner, and the vitamin C facial moisturizer.  Again, all Avalon Organics because I love their products.  I&#x27;m very comfortable and confident going out without makeup and I NEVER felt that way before.  I would recommend to any and everyone and will definitely be repurchasing for life.  It&#x27;s a staple in my product usage.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin look healthy.</li>
            <li> Bad smell, weird consistency and texture.</li>
            <li> In general, I like the product. Again though, this is titled as an organic prodict but it says ot is only 70% organic on the label, which I find misleading. Also, when you press/pump to dispense the serum, it is hard to control the amount that comes out.</li>
            <li> Do like this product. Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a satisfied customer of this serum for several years now.  Love it so much that I make sure I don&#x27;t run out and have to wait till I can get some.</li>
            <li> Recommended by a friend and couldnt be more impressed. Have only used it for a week and already my acne scars are fading. Little drying but only use it in the morning, not twice a day as recommended. Will purchase again</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product and only after a few short weeks the results are very noticeable. I have older skin and it&#x27;s looking younger and tighter more and more. Not a miracle, but a real improvement! I would recommend this product completely!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this before. It&#x27;s non greasy, organic and much cheaper than those other fancy labeled Vitamin C products. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product before.  They have since changed the packaging which I like better.  Pump works much better.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I had to review this product because I am blown away!  First it smells amazing, but I love citrus smell.  It glides right on and absorbs quickly.  I will warn you my face felt hot and my skin was a little red.  I put the cream on top and went to bed.  In the morning my skin looked brighter and more clear...beautiful!  Hydrated and some of the more faint pregnancy mask spots were lighter.  I love love it!  I have worked in skincare for 16 years and have sensitive skin: I get rashes and hives very easily.  The warmth and the redness were just the ingredients working.  You have to know your skin...know when it is truly an allergic reaction and when it is just active ingredients working.  Many great treatments you may feel a tingle etc. especially hydoxy acids or vitamin c products. They are working and it goes away shortly.  Serums/treatments tend to be stronger because they go deeper than creams.  I even wore it during the day under my moisturizer and makeup.  I was a little red at first but then it went away.  Did not disturb my makeup at all.  My skin was balanced and hydrated all day...very smooth and bright.  It feels warm when it is on, but only for a short while.  I am using the whole Avalon Vitamin C line and am in love!  I will probably only use the serum at night since it is so active and to not waste it.  I use the Cream, Milk cleanser, and toner too.  I am very very happy I bought this product and highly reccommend.</li>
            <li> This feels really good on my skin and absorbs well. I have not seen any dramatic improvement in appearance but I do like the way skin feels when I use it.</li>
            <li> I was considering byuing this serum, then i read one of the reviews saying this contains carcinogen for preservative. I went to Avalon website and got the full ingredient list:&lt;br /&gt;Aqua (Water), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice(1), Glycerin, Polyglyceryl-6 Distearate, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Oil(1), Cetyl Alcohol, Squalane, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter(1), Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Citrus Limon (Lemon) Peel Oil, Borago Officinalis Seed Oil(1), Linum Usitatissimum (Linseed) Seed Oil(1), Rosa Canina Fruit Oil(1), Arnica Montana Flower Extract(1), Calendula Officinalis Flower Extract(1), Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract(1), Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract(1), Citrus Limon (Lemon) Peel Extract*, Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender) Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract(1), Olea Europaea (Olive) Leaf Extract(1), Algin, Ascorbic Acid, Glyceryl Stearate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Xanthan Gum, Alcohol(1), Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, Citral, Limonene, Linalool&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then i looked up sodium benzoate and found this article from Spa From Scratch.com:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One known cancer danger exists related to sodium benzoate. If you combine ascorbic acid (vitamin C) with sodium benzoate and potassium benzoate (another preservative), you get benzene. Benzene is a known carcinogen. Most of the benzene exposure comes from the environment including cigarette smoke, car exhaust, industrial waste and service stations. Some benzene exposure can also come from contaminated food and water. Some soft drinks have been removed from the market when they were found to contain benzene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum exactly combines: ascorbic acid (vitamin C) with sodium benzoate and potassium benzoate</li>
            <li> SUCH A GOOD PRODUCT, BARELY ANY SMELL AND GOES ON LIGHT AND NOT GREASY AT ALL. GREAT FOR MIXING WITH YOU DAILY FACE LOTION AND UNDER YOUR FOUNDATION.. BRIGHTENS YOUR COMPLEXION AND SMOOTHS SKIN...BEEN USING FOR A FEW YEARS NOW AND VERY SATISFIED..MY MOTHER IS HOOKED ON THIS AS WELL WAS SHIPPED AND PACKAGED NICELY AND CAME IN A TIMELY MANNER  .</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the reviews I have read, well let me tell you that they are true, I totally love this stuff. I was a Sudden Change fan for a long time. But not any more. Bought the cleanser at Walmart cheaper and I love that too. Makes my skin smooth and I am noticing fine lines vanishing,, AND NO MORE CROWS FEET!!! ya hoo.. Will defintly buy again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product in conjunction with the Vitamin C facial moisturizer. It works really well. After about a week, I can see my skin start to heal. Especially if you have some damage from acne, it seems to lighten the scarring.</li>
            <li> Awful, had an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> Very much like this lotion.  I use it at night (no SPF for daytime use) as a light, clarifying moisturizer and love the way it refreshes, tones, and moistens my skin.  Not sure what all the fuss is here in these reviews regarding a change in ingredients; I find its current formula to be more than acceptable and very effective.</li>
            <li> I bought this from Fred Meyer and it cost me $24....I wish I came to Amazon first...Anyways, this product feels and smells great. I use this after my skin needle treatment. I see this as an effective serum for my treatment. I believe it is making the healing process faster. I definitely recommend this to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (11/7/11)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realized that using this everyday is causing minimal breakouts. I like the serum but I think I&#x27;ll be using this once or twice a week. I think it&#x27;s too much for my skin to handle from a daily use of this serum.</li>
            <li> excellent, received when stated</li>
            <li> I thought the price of $11.99 was great.  The fragrance was light and almost citrus.  The pump, however would only squirt out in so strong a stream that it splashed all over me and the sink when I wanted only a dab.</li>
            <li> I have severe hyper pigmentation, mostly around my eye area. I came across a few videos on Youtube praising the tone evening properties of Vitamin C. Been wanting to try it for months but never was able to get around to it until I did my most recent toiletry shopping at Target. I didnt go there looking for a Vitamin C serum, it just happen to be right there as I was making my way to the checkout. The display didnt have a price so I grabbed it anyway because my hyper pigmentation has gotten a lot worse lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually I am extremely fugal and have passed up opportunities to buy Vitamin C serums before but when I asked the cashier for the price, it was too late to turn back, so I bought it at a whooping $22.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took it home and tried it that first night and twice a day since then up until today, 3 weeks later and I do not regret plunking down that insane amount of money for a \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; product. The dark circles around my eyes have pretty much blended in with the rest of my skin tone which has taken on a brightened glow. I was amazed how fast this worked for me. I actually can go out in public without concealer, something I havent done in over a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am black American with a dark brown complexion, this reduced dramatically the appearance of my dull greyish hyper pigmentation. The trick is to use it consistently on a cleansed face. I highly recommend this product and once I am done with this bottle, I will be purchasing again here on Amazon for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> This stuff seems to plump up my forehead like Botox would. Wrinkles disappear instantly and it penetrates deeper than other moisturizers!</li>
            <li> I was not too happy to find out that bottle is much bigger than the contents; i was not able to see results as it ran out within a few days of the purchase. I used it according to the instructions; thus it was not due to misuse</li>
            <li> Smells ok, kind of like cooked down orange, not fresh orange. Smooth consistency that feels like it absorbs well.</li>
            <li> Nice stuff, not greasy but works well under my night cream</li>
            <li> We purchased for acne and it did not do well with that</li>
            <li> I read all the great reviews about this so I bought it. Every time I&#x27;ve used this product I&#x27;ve gotten headaches from it. This may be a good serum for lines and wrinkles but not at the cost of headaches. Its got to be from the scent of the vitamin c and maybe whatever else in there gives off that smell. Too bad because I was looking forward to using this.</li>
            <li> I bought this serum on a recommendation. I think the product works fine, but I&#x27;m not blown away by it. I think if I weren&#x27;t micro-needling with it probably wouldn&#x27;t do much for my skin. I also layer other products over it, so it&#x27;s really hard to say with any certainty. All I can say for certain is that I&#x27;ve had no problems with it. It&#x27;s just not fading my dark spots to my satisfaction. I noticed in other reviews it was pointed out that the formulation has changed; that may be why my results are slow, because I&#x27;ve been using this since October.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I will try another serum to see if I get better results. Not that this one was bad...it&#x27;s just I want to try and find something better.</li>
            <li> Once I started using it, I was hooked: in a month I saw the results and still keep getting questions what do I use on my face. Vitamin C is a perfect &amp;#34;fertilizer&amp;#34; for your skin. If you want to have that &amp;#34;morning glow&amp;#34; ,  you can count on this product.</li>
            <li> The product claims that it tones, improve the  texture and  clarity of your skin. I have oily-acne prone skin. I use it to get rid of my old and new acne scar.... i have been using this for three weeks or so now and I have to say it does lighten up my acne scar. usually my acne scars would not leave my face until a couple months later but the Vitamin C serum really help fasten up the process. It doesn&#x27;t make me break out in what I&#x27;ve seen. I am not really excited about the smell.. smells like a weird or rotting oranges... even my boyfriend said my face smells of orange when he kissed me (which i think its kinda funny but a little embarrassing, but i guess it&#x27;s better than having scars/ i use my moisturizer to cover this weird smell). The serum is a little sticky in my opinion.. not oily, doesn&#x27;t clog my pores,  i&#x27;m still using it.. I will use the whole product , as of right now I will be planning to purchase a new one once i am done with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got sent the wrong Avalon Organics Vitamin C facial serum, instead they sent me the eye serum instead... soo i wasn&#x27;t too happy about that. Other than that I do like this.</li>
            <li> costs way less than more expensive vit c cream but works really well. I can tell a diff when I run out and stop using for a few weeks. def recommend.</li>
            <li> My face is soft  and it smells nice and citrusy.</li>
            <li> Worked well for my skin.....ordered it many times...highly recommend...</li>
            <li> I was so happy to have found this line a couple of months ago, and am now so bummed that I have to walk away from it. The \\&quot;New Formula\\&quot; smells funny, leaves a greasy residue on my skin and doesn&#x27;t give me the bright, smooth texture that the old formula did. I truly felt like I&#x27;d found liquid gold when I started using the previous formula. Avalon, please bring back the old formula!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime... can anyone recommend a replacement for an organic vitamin c skin care line?</li>
            <li> Whether vitamins can truly penetrate the skin is something I&#x27;ll leave to the scientists.  That said, I really like this serum.  It absorbs quickly, does not have an obnoxious smell - and it makes my skin soft and dewy.  While a tad expensive, it seems to work for me.</li>
            <li> This is probably my 4th or 5th order of this product, I really like how it gives my skin a &amp;#34;smoother&amp;#34; base under a tinted moisturizer. I am 61 and have some wrinkling but not a lot, this helps smooth things out and makes my skin look smoother, plumper and more glowing. Plus it&#x27;s fairly organic. My skin is very sensitive too but I&#x27;ve never had any problems with this product.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that ive come back to use. with daily use, and you HAVE to keep up with it, my deep pitted acne marks start to become less noticeable in a month. It might leave your face a bit dry bc of the citrus acid in it so apply lotion after!</li>
            <li> I like it.  Good fragrance, good consistence, absortion,  I think is good for the skin,  I &amp;#34;believe&amp;#34; it can help, anyway for me its better than regular creams or expensive ones, which have caused irritation to my sking.</li>
            <li> I so love this product! My skin look amazing, and I believe its a combination of this product and red light therapy that is doing the trick. I&#x27;ve had compliments that I&#x27;ve never had before so clearly the results are amazing!</li>
            <li> First, the original serum was the BOMB!!! I used to purchase regularly. Second, they did change the formula to exclude several important antioxidant ingredients -Hyaluronic acid, green tea to name a few and they slim down on several ingredients as they are found at the bottom. One product they did include is sodium benzoate which combine with absorbic acid creates a carcinogen (toxic to the skin). The original product was the bomb and it was affordable. I did notice over the last 4 years they were steadily increasing the price and now this. Goodbye Avalon Organics - I will make my own ordering the original ingredients from Mtn Rose Herbs. To bad they were corrupted by corporate greed.</li>
            <li> This whole line of products is amazing! I have been using the toner, serum, and moisturizer for about 2 months now, and I must say my face looks more luminous and even! I have sun damage and acne marks, and with this regimen I am wearing less and less concealer. It&#x27;s also very gentle and nonirritating.  The serum absorbs welI and wears nicely under makeup. I highly recommend for people with dark spots, acne scars, and dull skin. This has helped me!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years.  Liked the original formula better.  Still, my face stays clear and smooth since I started using this. The scent is fresh and light.  It&#x27;s rather pricey. Amazon sells it for the best price I have been able to find.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; it because it didn&#x27;t do much for my facial lines. The serum is lightweight and does get into the skin with no residue which I liked. It did help with my cheek and chin rosacea (I don&#x27;t have severe rosacea.) It helped by fading it out some. I used it every day till it was gone. I do like it and may get more if I don&#x27;t find something else a little heavier for a little bit of glow because since this leaves no residue on surface of skin, it does leave your skin with a natural look. I was also hoping it would fade out sun spots but it did not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this a 3 star because there is no label telling the contents, from what I&#x27;ve read, they have change the contents.  I&#x27;ve read that the Vit C has changed and its almost at the bottom of the list. I don&#x27;t have a list?  I will call the company.I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of days now, so I can&#x27;t rate it otherwise. I will take off a star when I re-rate it because there is no label of contents.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been just a week since I&#x27;ve been using this product. My skin does look and feel a bit better already. The bottle is a wonderful dispenser - has a great pump that dispenses just a little bit of cream at a time which is usually enough to cover half the face, then I squeeze out another little bit for the other side. Will have to update this review when I&#x27;ve been using the product longer.</li>
            <li> The product packaging was okay. The main issue I have with the serum is the fact that the vitamin c amount is really low. What I was looking for in this product was the ascorbic acid, which contains the real vitamin c. Out of all the ingredients in this product, the ascorbic acid was all the way near the bottom. The other ingredients mostly included extracts of other organic stuff. I cant really say for sure if it has cured or resolved any acne or scars. The ascorbic acid is supposed to helo with that but since there is not a lot in it... i dont really know if it works well on acne prone skin. So, based on the reason that the content of ascorbic acid is low, I will not be repurchasing this again. However, it does leave my face very moisturized. I do not need to put a lot on since right now it is summer and humid outside. Maybe if it came with some SPF, I might consider purchasing another one as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Overall I think this product is very good.  I feel like my skin looks younger &amp; smoother.  Fine lines seem to be less noticeable.  For some reason, however, the product seemed a bit watered down compared to a same I tried in a local store.  I don&#x27;t know if the batches are different or if something happened in the shipping process, so I&#x27;m not sure that I would buy it online again, despite the great price.</li>
            <li> I like the product.  I like the way it made my skin feel tighter and it had a nice smell.  I only used it for 2 weeks so it didn&#x27;t make any noticeable difference to my skin in that amount of time.  I had to stop using it because it caused me to break out.  I never get pimples but about a week into using this they began to appear.  I tried to wait it out to see if my skin just needed to adjust to a new product but by the second week I was seeing mountains on my face.  Bummer, I think I would have loved this product.</li>
            <li> Beware!! I used this product at different times over a period of two years but got the same reaction, bright red raised skin that burned. I don&#x27;t know why this is maybe because after I had my child my chemical balance changed but after trying over many times to want the product to work it was just disappointing. I really did want this product to work for me and I used the product right after I bought it. I&#x27;m just very disappointed because this is supposed to be an organic product and there is no warning that reactions might occur. They need to do more research or maybe they did and are to selfish so that if they did not as many people would buy and just let the consumer buy without knowing until they find out for themselves. I&#x27;m just glad I cough title in time and was able to wipe it off. Every time I used it was the same reaction so I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s it is. I just hope that no one else has a worse reaction than I did and hopefully no trips to the hospital.</li>
            <li> Well I read one review that said they thought the formula had been changed and I do AGREE, it smells and feels and acts diffrent on my skin, I think the original version was better, this is a down grade if you ask me.</li>
            <li> A good buy, but it it&#x27;s SOO small, will not see much of it working because you need more of it. But I could see it would work. Need to Ordr 2 at a time. To see it work.</li>
            <li> Has a nice consistency and smell.  Doesn&#x27;t break out my very sensitive skin.  No noticeable improvement in complexion though.  I wish the bottle listed the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I did not notice much of a difference</li>
            <li> love this and good price. great customer service!!</li>
            <li> I use to use Avon skintrition but after 12+ years Avon stopped making it or they changed the formula because I cant find the same thing. So, I was on the search for another vitamin C product and came across this. I have been using this product for about 4 years now and I really like it and it it a lot like the other product. Im 50 and my skin is still nice and tight so I think it is in part to the vitamin C I have used on my face for so many years.  The smell is mild and I have never got pimples from using it.  If you have dry skin like me though you may want to use another moisturizer or a little Vaseline at night and use this in the day which is what I do.</li>
            <li> This made my skin break out badly.  I had to throw it away after the first use.  It didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> the product is awesome</li>
            <li> So, I received this but the bottle was busted and about 1/4 of the serum had leaked out. Not at all happy about this.</li>
            <li> I recently put this on my &#x27;wish list&#x27; on Amazon and my husband purchased it for me along with the Facial Cleansing Milk! I absolutely love both. They make my face soft, hydrated, and clean! This serum is a pump, which makes applying it very easy! I am very into fitness and healthy eating, and now I&#x27;m taking it further and taking care of my skin! I am moving away from harsh chemicals and I&#x27;m thankful I turned to Avalon Organics.</li>
            <li> Very good serum at a great price. Leaves my skin looking and feeling great.</li>
            <li> Good product.Leaves skin smooth.</li>
            <li> good all day moisturizer and 12 dollars cheaper than the store</li>
            <li> I ordered this one and was a bit skeptical because the price was quite abit less than most of the competition.  However, I have really liked this product.  It feels very moisturizing, it does have a bit of an oily texture for awhile, but I actually like that because I have such super dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like about it is the pump in the bottle.  No matter how many times I pumped the spray nozzle, it never worked, not even once.  So I use the stick inside to draw some out onto my hand first, then apply to my face, which is not something I&#x27;m crazy about.  Perhaps it was just a faulty spray bottle I got, and the others are not like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, because I like the product so much, I was reorder, even with the spray pump flaw.</li>
            <li> Am trying this product for 1 year to see if it makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;This is the 2cd time ordering this product through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Very fast shipment and the price is reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;So far I would recommend, will have a further analysis after a year.</li>
            <li> Not potent as it used to be. Too many oils and not enough Vitamin-C. The oils makes your skin feel soft but unfortunately, most users considering this product are seeking potent Vitamin-C.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of a lot of positive reviews, a good price relatively, and the organic factor. The texture is not great, but I would have tolerated it if it didn&#x27;t have known carcinogens in it for preservative purposes.  I understand that vitamin C serum has a short shelf life and to watch their bottom dollar this company has to do something to make sure their product has a good shelf life, but I think we should seriously have a discussion in this country about whether we should allow a company to use the word organic and contain carcinogens in their product, even if it is a small percentage.  I&#x27;m going to find a truly organic product next time.</li>
            <li> I had heard so many great reviews about this product so I decided to purchase it. Unfortunately target had it for about $25, I was slightly annoyed so I figured to look on amazon for a great deal. Of course I got one! It was only about $17, the product came in right on time and perfectly packaged. The serum itself makes your skin feel so soft and the smell is amazing. If you like citrus scents like I do then you will definitely love it. I also like that Avalon Organics are natural products. I think we as consumers need to be careful of the ingredients we are using on our face. Overall great product and an excellent deal!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product because of how it makes my skin feel. I won&#x27;t make any claims except it feels rejuvenating &amp; invigorating. The stores where I live charge WAY more than Amazon, so I hope Amazon continues to provide this product at the great prices they have been offering it!</li>
            <li> I will not use anything else my face. This is the best product. I regularly get facials and they told me I needed hydration in my skin. After using this product my skin therapist noticed right away. My skin never looked better. I love the whole line.</li>
            <li> This serum just can&#x27;t be beat.  It keeps my skin looking fresh and alive.  Standing next to it is a serum that cost almost four times more, which I&#x27;ll never order again.</li>
    </ol>
