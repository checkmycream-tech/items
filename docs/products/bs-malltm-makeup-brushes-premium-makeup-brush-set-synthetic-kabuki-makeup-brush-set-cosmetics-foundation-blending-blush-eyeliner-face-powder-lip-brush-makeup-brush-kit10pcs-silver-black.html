            <li>nice</li>

            <li>Nice brushes.</li>
            <li>I was not expecting much for what I paid, but I was extremely, extremely impressed.</li>
            <li>They arrived within 3 days and came nicely packaged in an envelope with bubble wrap.</li>

            <li>They were nice while they lasted.</li>
            <li>if I&#x27;ll be repurchasing these though, to be honest.</li>
            <li>Liked the bag they came in.</li>
            <li>Nice brushes, tip came off as soon as I opened them.</li>
            <li>They really help blend in your make up well and leave your skin looking flawless!</li>
            <li>These work well for many purposes, a good buy, i recommend</li>
            <li>and I really liked them</li>
            <li>I own costal scents brushes.</li>

            <li>Worth the price!!!</li>
            <li>Bought for my daughter, she is delighted with them and uses them every day, beautiful quality and affordable - very grateful</li>
            <li>the brushes have a very strong smell of chemicals (kind of like paint thinner and glue)</li>
            <li>I am very impressed they seem high end.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had my share of high end and inexpensive brushes and these are a perfect mix of both!</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re amazing :) they don&#x27;t look or feel cheap whatsoever!!</li>
            <li>Full Of Joy About My Makeup Brushes</li>
            <li>Good brush for cheap just don&#x27;t like how is  not labeled to what kind of brush</li>
            <li>wayyy more than what you need your brushes to be; this makes blending foundation or whatever much harder!!&lt;br /&gt;nevertheless, speaking about the price, they&#x27;re perfect and I will recommend it to my friends</li>
            <li>I loved the brush I read alot about the strong odor</li>
            <li>It did come with a fairly strong odor, but I just washed them really good</li>
            <li>Very soft nice quality!!!</li>
            <li>When they are opened they have a very strong factory smell.</li>
            <li>The box they came out of had a very STRONG paint smell, but the brushes themselves had no paint smell at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The odor was also very strong and nauseating.  </li>
            <li>but they do break very easily</li>
            <li>But when i got them in the mail I couldn&#x27;t have been more satisfied!</li>
            <li>They are pretty durable and seem to be good!</li>
            <li>When I first received the product, I absolutely loved it!</li>
            <li>I am very happy with my purchase so far!</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow brushes are a bit on the large side, but I find them ideal for blending across the lid.</li>
            <li>Absolutely so soft, durable, and priced greatly!</li>
            <li>but I liked them even more when I saw them.</li>
            <li>They are soft and perfect !</li>
            <li>They are soft and very very excellent for blending.</li>

            <li>The brushes once cleaned are so soft and the application is flawless!</li>
            <li>The brush heads are so soft and are cut perfectly.</li>
            <li>If they were shorter, they would be more compact and effective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a MAC Pro  and Licensed MUA and these are by far the best brushes on the market, and</li>
            <li>This brand is so adorable and just amazing.</li>
            <li>They feel amazingly soft and they are so awesome with any product.</li>

            <li>It is best to wash the brushes properly.</li>
            <li>They are okay, not sturdy at all.</li>
            <li>I prefer paying 10 bucks for each for a better quality brush.</li>
            <li>I think the bag was better quality then everything else.</li>
            <li>I Really Love These Brushes</li>

            <li>I love that this set so versatile</li>
            <li>and I can use it for many of my blending needs.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really satisfied</li>
            <li>Love these brushes.</li>
            <li>There are so many brushes in this set I&#x27;m still finding ways to use them all.</li>
            <li>Ok for the price, but they shed a ton.</li>
            <li>Have even promised to send me a better bag for storage of my brushes.  </li>

            <li>Ok quality brushes.</li>
            <li>the brushes are ok</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not 100% sure</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d be much better off buying a set with finer eye make up brushes.</li>
            <li>but I bought these for more of a travel set.</li>
            <li>Fantastic brushes!</li>
            <li>Love them ...</li>

            <li>I am impressed with them brushed .</li>
            <li>They also don&#x27;t feel cheap; they feel sturdy and they have a nice ergonomic handle.</li>
            <li>I love the shapes the face brushes come in.</li>
            <li>will say that I do prefer the face brushes much more than the eye brushes.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the brushes.</li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>

            <li>Fast shipping and great quality.</li>
            <li>Many times people wash their brushes and don&#x27;t handle them with care/properly.</li>
            <li>so the bristles are resting on a towel or buying a brush dryer rack).&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I love these brushes.</li>
            <li>No awful odor like some</li>
            <li>I love</li>

            <li>/&gt;The brushes did have a certain smell to them but that is good since I know they were steralized.</li>

            <li>Overall, this is a very good brush set</li>

            <li>They are soft and the make of them I can tell are great.</li>
            <li>Great product and got here early.</li>
            <li>Giving a 5 star rating because I received these brushes 2 days before the expected delivery date and also because they&#x27;re great brushes!</li>
            <li>I love how smooth my makeup goes on.</li>
            <li>I just LOVE these brushes, my first REALLY nice set.  </li>
            <li>The bristles and soft and cut well, great density.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft and I think that they&#x27;re great for the price.</li>
            <li>Brushes are great but do come apart but easily fixed with a glue gun</li>
            <li>These brushes are great so far.  </li>
            <li>They have held up great so far</li>
            <li>I have paid up to $30 for one makeup brush and the quality was not as good as this whole set.</li>
            <li>These brushes really are good.</li>
            <li>I really care about the tools and products I use when doing my makeup and these are just as good quality as the brush sets you can spend $70 on.</li>
            <li>my eyeshadow brushes were very flimsy and unproportion bristle wise</li>
            <li>They work great, I use them daily, but they break so easily!</li>
            <li>They work very well, and come with a nice variety, and they also clean up nicely.</li>
            <li>Got my brushes so far I love them !!</li>
            <li>Really soft and applies makeup very nicely.</li>
            <li>Brushes were very nice and soft.</li>
            <li>very nice and easy to use and will give you professional look</li>
            <li>Easy for apply any  make up product</li>
            <li>Arrived very quick.</li>
            <li>Even more happy that I think I saw only 1 bristle come out while I washed all the brushes.  </li>
            <li>Easy to wash and handle.</li>
            <li>The brushes are inexpensive for the quality and quantity, but keep in mind that they do shed and the handle breaks off easily.</li>
            <li>Synthetic makeup brushes are the best and for people who can&#x27;t afford the expensive brush sets this is a great choice.</li>
            <li>but mine wasn&#x27;t strong at all, a wash with some baby shampoo will take care of it.</li>
            <li>It does have a strong smell to it firs but after u wash it</li>
            <li>I washed them when I unpackaged because they smelt strongly of plastic.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong.</li>
            <li>the packaging smell was seriously strong even after I washed them.</li>
            <li>They do have a strong sense</li>
            <li>It does have a strong scent but wash them</li>
            <li>When I opened them I did notice a strong odor.</li>
            <li>I did however, jump away from the strong smell they had.</li>
            <li>But the quality in the bristles is just as good as buying the high priced ones.</li>
            <li>Just as good as any of my high end brushes.</li>
            <li>First off let me say these are just absolutely amazing brushes</li>
            <li>They are so soft and amazing at blending foundations, eye shadows, blushes, anything!</li>
            <li>They are full size brushes and I would recommend them :)</li>
            <li>Nice dupe for sigma but smells funny</li>
            <li>These were the first of the kind brushes</li>
            <li>and they wash up pretty nicely.  </li>
            <li>Hands down the best for applying bronzer, blush, highlighter, contour powers, creams, liquids.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>Amazing and most soft brushes I&#x27;ve ever used!!  </li>
            <li>then they&#x27;d be fine.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine..</li>
            <li>and it will be fine.  </li>
            <li>Mine shed before I washed them, but now they are fine.</li>
            <li>and you should be fine</li>
            <li>I use less foundation and powder and my makeup looks flawless!</li>
            <li>but after I washed them they smelt fine</li>
            <li>They are working well and fine when re-washed.</li>
            <li>I was super nervous about ordering these because they were so cheap!</li>
            <li>They work wonders and are super cute and affordable.</li>
            <li>quick delivery too!</li>
            <li>Great price and super soft.  </li>
            <li>They work wonderfully &amp; are very soft like u would expect from any professional brush.</li>
            <li>they are super easy to clean and I just love them</li>
            <li>Very soft, great brushes, very affordable love this brush set</li>
            <li>They are soft, great quality, don&#x27;t shed, and are almost exact dupes for the sigma brushes!</li>
            <li>the texture is awesome and shipping was way faster than expected!!!</li>
            <li>the bigger brushes are amazing, loved the way it applied my foundation, the skinny ones are alittle hard to work with on the eyes but they are perfect for blending out your under eye concealer and contouring your nose.</li>
            <li>So I was super excited to use them!</li>
            <li>LISTEN to the reviews they are CHEAPLY made the brush came apart from the silver part</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it, fantastic value!</li>
            <li>The smaller brushes were great for detailing and blending out concealer.</li>
            <li>Great makeup set for low price.</li>
            <li>easy to clean as well.</li>
            <li>They absorb all make up and are cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Smooth finish with make-up.</li>
            <li>Great buy for the price especially.</li>
            <li>no lie they are so smooth and they work wonders.</li>
            <li>I will rate these brushes based on my professional opinion as a makeup artist from 1- 5.... 1 being low and 5 being the best:  Softness: 3.8 Quality: 3 handles: 4 bristles: 3.8</li>
            <li>Overall I feel that they absorb a lot of product but for the price they are a great bargain.</li>
            <li>They are sturdy and easy to clean perfect for everyday use.</li>
            <li>Considering  I got 11 brushes (including the free eye liner brush) for $10</li>
            <li>Cheap if you want cheap because they are synthetic of course</li>
            <li>and I liked them so much</li>
            <li>Cheap brushes.</li>
            <li>They give a smooth coverage to my foundations, blushes and eye shadows.</li>
            <li>came fast , nice dense brushes .</li>
            <li>I still give it a 4 because these brushes are fantastic for the price.  </li>
            <li>The quality of these brushes are fantastic.</li>
            <li>Each individual brush was wrapped and were in great condition.</li>
            <li>They cleaned up very well with Dawn and warm water.</li>
            <li>Cheap price, cheap brushes.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t feel cheaply made or even look cheaply made in that matter.</li>
            <li>I told myself that wouldn&#x27;t bother me, because I have a fantastic brush cleaner.</li>
            <li>They clean without losing bristles and the handles are easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>but like I said so far so good</li>
            <li>There grate nice and soft love them</li>
            <li>These brushes are soft, dense and each brush top is finished off nicely for blending and applying product.  </li>
            <li>So far so good though.</li>

            <li>they smelled strong when i first got them but nothing that is overwhelming.</li>
            <li>:) They did arrive with a strong paint smell (the sterilizer) but after I washed them the first time, the smell vanished.</li>
            <li>But it came pretty darn close!!</li>
            <li>SOFT!&lt;br /&gt;~Provides very nice coverage when I used some liquid foundation on the back of my hand.&lt;br /&gt;~100</li>
            <li>Also, they were delivered so quickly and packaged super securely!</li>

            <li>No bad smell, Really fast shipping, Amazing quality.</li>
            <li>Love these brushes came super fast!!</li>
            <li>The brushes were very sot and didn&#x27;t have a very strong chemical smell for me, which is saying a lot since I get headaches just from spraying air fresheners.</li>
            <li>It was just amazing, really soft!!</li>
            <li>I ordered these brushes in January and 6 months later they&#x27;re still amazing!</li>
            <li>The best brushes out there for small amount of money.</li>
            <li>I could see the glue that originally held the brush</li>
            <li>I am excited to use and experiment with them.</li>
            <li>Worth the price!</li>

            <li>Such an amazing buy for an ultra cheap price!</li>
            <li>The smell of brushes wasn&#x27;t  great, I washed them with shampoo and let them air dry</li>
            <li>Once you clean them, the odor is gone.</li>
            <li>they work like brushes are supposed to work, very soft and nice feeling on my face.</li>

            <li>Shipping was easy and fast, brushes were well made, light weight with zero shedding.</li>
            <li>The first time I opened the package, it smelled strongly of glue.</li>
            <li>When I first opened them I did smell a strong type of a chemical smell, but I washed them in baby soap and the smell went away.</li>
            <li>She was super sweet and helpful.</li>
            <li>When I first got the brushes they had a strong scent.</li>
            <li>They have a strong smell when you first get them.</li>
            <li>Other than that I&#x27;m happy with them</li>
            <li>nothing that you can&#x27;t handle they smell like spray paint but other than that the brushes are wonderful for the price they&#x27;re very soft and they blend well.</li>
            <li>i received my brushes in pieces and no amount of super glue held them together, i bought two sets and both came un glued on arrival.</li>
            <li>They arrived super quickly and feel just like sigma brushes.</li>
            <li>The only thing that could make them better was if the handles had a better paint</li>
            <li>These brushes are sooo soft, apply product well, and WOW what a great bargain!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Brushes aren&#x27;t super dense but the bristles have stayed intact.</li>
            <li>I ordered mainly for the face brushes, and I love them.</li>
            <li>If you just want more foundation brushes these work but absolutely not a replacement for the finish and quality of the sigma sigmax ones, which I also own.</li>
            <li>Really like the brushes;  soft and durable, the weight of the handles feel good in my hand.  </li>
            <li>I have used many other brands of brushes and I have found these to be my favorite!</li>
            <li>They are extremely soft and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>My least favorite is probably the large pointed foundation brush, but even then its very good.</li>
            <li>Very Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>My favorite is the flat top kabuki‚ù§</li>
            <li>I love the flat top face brush for applying foundation or bb creams.</li>
            <li>Some are more domed, while others are more flat or angled.</li>
            <li>My favorite are the eye brushes and the flat top foundation buffing brush.</li>
            <li>I Love makeupe &amp; creating new looks all the time</li>

            <li>EXACTLY like Sigma!</li>
            <li>I love how soft they are!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve definitely had better brushes, but for the price you pay for these I can&#x27;t complain!</li>
            <li>Overall I am satisfied with my purchase but wish they included an angular eyeliner brush as well!</li>
            <li>These had a funny smell but after I washed them, it went away!</li>
            <li>The brushes are super soft and make a great gift thats under $20 definitely recommend!</li>
            <li>These are amazing for $10.00 really blend out and are super soft on the skin.</li>
            <li>They also wash beautifully and have little to no fall out !</li>
            <li>Great little set of brushes</li>
            <li>Nice little collection I love it</li>
            <li>they are great quality a little bit more smaller than expected but great</li>
            <li>I really wanted to enjoy these..</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use cheap stuff on your face like really just don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>fit the bill and for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Amazing brushes, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Amazing brushes only i hates was the smell it smelled funky</li>
            <li>I needed a set of brushes for everyday use, and this set works great.</li>
            <li>Kabuki feel and the fluffy, dense formation of the bristles make for great foundation application, blending, contouring etc.</li>
            <li>Soft bristles which I love</li>
            <li>Perfect for anyone who wants to try out being a makeup artist and then upgrading to a more expensive brand.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes, they are so soft just like my Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li>The return on this investment is WELL worth the money</li>
            <li>these are totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>I use one of the small brushes for my concealer and it blends beautifully.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t get the directions for the brushes in the package so the seller was kind enough to email them to me</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>honestly, the brushes are almost all the same type (kabuki style) and 2 already fell off the stem..</li>
            <li>Each brush comes in its own individual package.</li>
            <li>These are definitely worth the money</li>
            <li>You definitely get your moneys worth with these brushes, they came in extra fast, the hair does not shed , it feels nice on the face and does a good job .</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>love these brushes are so soft.</li>
            <li>it worth it.</li>
            <li>My favorite brushes so far.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t shed and stay soft and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>that say these are great and all, but I will say this these brushes aren&#x27;t anywhere near as big as I thought they&#x27;d be.</li>
            <li>These are worth it.</li>
            <li>Came in a really nice pouch and they came individually wrapped.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t care for the smaller eye shadow brushes but the bigger ones are awesome.</li>
            <li>Nice brushes, but I needed a larger one than they offered to put on powder.</li>
            <li>Well worth it for the value</li>
            <li>Love them so far</li>
            <li>They seem nice enough!</li>
            <li>I love love love them all and will buy a new set if these need replacing down the line.</li>
            <li>I love love love this brushes (especially the flat Kabuki brush).</li>
            <li>I did notice the chemical smell that others spoke of when I first opened them, but that quickly dissipated as soon as I had them out of the packaging.</li>
            <li>Smelled super funny</li>
            <li>Super soft!!!!</li>
            <li>I recommend this brushes to anyone looking for some high quality cheap brushes, these are definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>As soft as high priced brushes, nice dense bristles.</li>
            <li>but right when I took off the plastic covering all the fibers started coming out.</li>
            <li>The package came right away.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>Washing them will take this smell right out.</li>
            <li>I washed them right away</li>
            <li>Very good quality, tight bristles and soft to the touch!</li>
            <li>Absolutely Love all of the brushes in this sermon super soft yet dense enough to get a flawless finish on the skin.</li>
            <li>I hope the seller doesn&#x27;t up the price seeing all these positive reviews!</li>
            <li>but the bigger face brushes are pretty amazing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a good deal for these brushes since they are super soft and sturdy.</li>
            <li>Synthetic brushes do not fill up with too much product and are easier to clean.  </li>
            <li>They do have a very strong chemical smell when you open them.  </li>
            <li>These brushes are so amazing I&#x27;ve had them for about a week now and have been using them everyday since then and noticed how easily they apply makeup to my face.</li>
            <li>It took a few days after the estimated date to receive them.&lt;br /&gt;However, these brushes are amazing !</li>
            <li>Other than that 1 brush, the others hold pretty good, and did not shed even when I washed them.</li>
            <li>I guess they&#x27;re good if you&#x27;re too lazy to wash your brushes all the time you can always just grab a clean one..</li>
            <li>I washed them a few times with shampoo and warm water to get rid of the smell and now they&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li>They are very soft and easy to use, and made very well!</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t like cheap brushes because most of them they break easy or don&#x27;t work well</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and the bristles are durable, but the metal detaches from the handle VERY quickly.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised the material is nice and brushes are really soft.</li>
            <li>So far so good I only used like 2 or 3 of them</li>
            <li>I still think they are a great set of brushes for such a low price.  </li>
            <li>I still think they are a great set of brushes for such a low price.  </li>
            <li>They feel like my real techniques and sigma brushes but are super affordable.</li>
            <li>They are soft and bristles do not fall out easily</li>
            <li>I see many people have success with these brushes, I have read the countless reviews.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the only downside the brushes work great especially for contouring on the face.</li>
            <li>Overall they seem like a great deal for the low price!</li>
            <li>The flat top kabuki brush in this set is a exact dupe of the sigma f80 brush!</li>
            <li>Other than that I am very pleased</li>
            <li>so these came very fast in the mail.</li>
            <li>she likes them very much</li>
            <li>And very fast delivery time.</li>
            <li>They are super soft and good quality with minimal shedding and I can&#x27;t wait to try them out today.</li>
            <li>The reason for a 4 not 5 star is that the handles are gold instead of gray, some brushes may need a very light trim of the extra hairs, and it smells like glue (but you should always give brushes a wash before using them for the first time</li>
            <li>FAST SHIPPING!</li>
            <li>I love it no more words :)</li>
            <li>First impression:</li>
            <li>both liquid and powder foundation also love the way it picks up eyeshadow powder would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering several more sets.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always made sure to wash them properly.</li>
            <li>The brush was exactly as shown in the pictures.</li>
            <li>I think anybody that get this has to wash them first.</li>
            <li>no weird smell or any of the brush hairs falling off.</li>
            <li>I was absolutely amazed at the quality of these brushes!</li>
            <li>:) I definitely recommend them!</li>
            <li>My first set of &amp;#34;Real&amp;#34; makeup brushes.  </li>
            <li>I bought an extra set for my sister but haven&#x27;t been able to get them to her yet.  </li>
            <li>The brushes do have a smell when they first arrived</li>
            <li>First taking them out of the package, the smell horrible--like a spray paint smell.</li>
            <li>They did have a funny smell upon opening, but you should wash them anyway before using.</li>
            <li>but after I used it I was able to pull the silver part off the wooden handle.</li>
            <li>highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>The brushes and bag had a funny odor.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more products from them in the future now</li>
            <li>The bristles are falling out of most of the facial brushes</li>
            <li>They did smell like chemicals when I first receive them but one wash with some shampoo</li>
            <li>After only using them this morning, I can say they are a close second to my favorite brush set (my Morphe brushes are my number one favorite).</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and handle and comfortable.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying them!!</li>
            <li>Love these brushes,  I had to go back and buy another set for my daughter!!  </li>
            <li>First in didnt arrived in time!!&lt;br /&gt;Second or it should be</li>
            <li>I began to use another brush hoping it was just an error in the first brush.</li>
            <li>With that being said, I actually really like these brushes!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re dense and apply my powder/liquid foundations really well!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>away, these makeup brushes are my go-to, and the only makeup brushes I tell my clients to purchase. :)</li>
            <li>They are soft and free of shedding.</li>
            <li>I think the chemical smell is more from the packaging than the actual brush.</li>
            <li>, they were pretty dense</li>
            <li>There is so many different for your face if you are in to contouring</li>
            <li>First impression....</li>
            <li>Make sure to wash before use, definitely recommend!</li>
            <li>they are exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>I would definitely buy these again! :)</li>
            <li>Love how many I received for such a low price.</li>
            <li>when you first purchase (but do wash them anyway upon arrival)</li>
            <li>Been through tons of brushes expensive and not but these seem to be the best.</li>
            <li>Had a funny smell at first</li>
            <li>Just loved how the brushes started searching from the stems just a few weeks after I bought them.</li>
            <li>The handles of this set are heavy and a good length.</li>
            <li>After washing the brushes the plastic smell went away totally and all I was left with were super soft really great brushes.</li>
            <li>super soft and feel like sigma brushes!!</li>
            <li>They are so soft !!!!</li>
            <li>And they are so soft!!!!</li>
            <li>Wow!!!!</li>
            <li>I spent so much money on Mac and other brushes but these are the best brushes I had !!!!!</li>
            <li>Other than the fact the chemical smell is super (SUPER) strong.</li>
            <li>but they are super soft,  application is easy, and so far not fall out.</li>
            <li>As of today 2 of the large facial brushes are not use able.</li>
            <li>I have bought Kabuki brushes in the past and this product has such great reviews and it was so cheap that I decided to try it.</li>
            <li>I use the flat top one to apply my foundation and it looks like I used airbrush makeup.</li>
            <li>but it honestly didn&#x27;t bother me - I just paid $18 for one eyeliner brush at sephora the other day and</li>
            <li>but it honestly didn&#x27;t bother me - I just paid $18 for one eyeliner brush at sephora the other day and</li>
            <li>my sigma flat top kabuki and Sedona lace face brush set</li>
            <li>Had to wash them twice due to the smell but otherwise a really nice brush set.</li>
            <li>While the bristles are soft the brushes look pretty nice, the metal piece holding bristles is flimsy and too big for the bristles.  </li>
            <li>I try to clean more often with less cleaner</li>
            <li>The brushes were big, soft and did amazing work.</li>
            <li>So soft but nice and solid.</li>
            <li>These brushes are really nice, I expected them to smell really &amp;#34;chemically&amp;#34; but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>They are so dense I was surprised - they are far more dense than my Sephora set.</li>
            <li>The brushes look very nice, but there is a strong strong chemical smell that made me feel sick as soon as I opened the package.</li>
            <li>These brushes are great, but they are pretty similar to each other.  </li>
            <li>They feel flimsy,  although they are cheap and they do work fine the handles kind of break off after maybe 4 to 5 uses of it, if you&#x27;re a freelance makeup artist like myself and you are hesitant to buy expensive</li>
            <li>Their are two reasons why I only gave these brushes 4 stars: these did have a strong smell about them and one of my brushes broke after the first use.</li>
            <li>I washed these first with a gentle clarifying shampoo.</li>
            <li>I will likely be culling my flock of brushes and get rid of those older, scratchier brushes and replacing them with more of these.</li>
            <li>Shipped super fast, and the brushes are so soft!</li>
            <li>The length of the brush handle is easy to work with as well, some Kabuki brushes are too short.  </li>
            <li>With washing them, they didn&#x27;t shed at all and they stayed super soft.</li>
            <li>but they are super soft.</li>
            <li>Super soft.</li>
            <li>Super soft and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>All the pieces are there and the brushes are super soft.</li>
            <li>They are super soft.</li>
            <li>So I strongly recommend you wash them prior to using them!</li>
            <li>If they didn&#x27;t have such a strong chemical odor I would of kept them.</li>
            <li>They do have that strong chemical smell As soon as you open the bag</li>
            <li>The only thing is the plactic wrapper smells like strong plastic.</li>
            <li>I love every single brush from this kit.</li>
            <li>They are a bit on the large side, though.</li>
            <li>The brushes did have quite a strong smell when I took them out of the packaging (similar to paint/paint thinner) but the smell went away after I washed them with a little bit of shampoo and warm water.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very dense but super soft.</li>
            <li>They are fine for the price but too big to cover my eyes</li>
            <li>Once I glued them back on , they were fine.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend these brushes they work just as fine as my crown, mac, and sigma brushes.</li>
            <li>I came across the brushes while looking for a set that was decently priced as well as higher quality.</li>
            <li>They came with a very strong chemical smell, but I washed them with some soap and olive oil and let them dry over night and the smell was completely gone!</li>
            <li>I got a little shedding , but to be honest I got what I paid for (10) brushes for nine bucks</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t have expected better results with the whole product and process.</li>
            <li>Much better quality than expected.</li>
            <li>Blends foundation very well as well as the eyeshadows brushes.</li>
            <li>they dont shed at all and they blend very well.</li>
            <li>very well made..</li>
            <li>you really get what you paid for.</li>
            <li>While I was overall happy with my purchase, I am giving it 4 stars because two of the larger face brushes fell apart after the third time I washed them.</li>
            <li>She would rather pay the same amount and get one brush then these cheap things.</li>
            <li>shipping was really fas</li>
            <li>I really appreciate these brushes.</li>
            <li>haha.....</li>
            <li>you so much for all of your help</li>
            <li>It was what I really was expecting.</li>
            <li>and the thin ones are great for blending.</li>
            <li>I really like these brushes.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like them</li>
            <li>For synthetic bristles they are very soft.&lt;br /&gt;3)  </li>
            <li>very similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>REALLY LIKE</li>
            <li>very similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>REALLY LIKE</li>
            <li>and I am scared to buy brushes that have fallout or are rough, but I am glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li>The brushes are very sturdy and well made.</li>
            <li>did notice when I washed them that it took some time to work out the gentle shampoo I used.</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t have to put so much product on the brush.</li>
            <li>In all this may not be the product to buy if you don&#x27;t know much about makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>very  well.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t spend much on these</li>
            <li>Thanks BS-Mall&lt;br</li>
            <li>they apply makeup very well.</li>
            <li>Very comparable to</li>
            <li>I was very skeptic about orderiing these brushes.</li>

            <li>but it didn&#x27;t bother me too much.</li>

            <li>and I really like them.</li>

            <li>Amazon refunded 100%, so I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li>I have a whole sigma set which I bought for over $100</li>
            <li>I am returning and buying a set of real techniques brushes instead.</li>

            <li>Way better than I expected üôè</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really tried these yet.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Thanks  for your product</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>it came fast and well packaged</li>
            <li>absolutely love these, minimal shedding&lt;br /&gt;great value</li>
            <li>Shipment was fast.</li>
            <li>I was really hesitant to order them;</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it is a nice product if you just start exploring makeup or need something affordable for your everyday look.</li>
            <li>Really nice everyday brushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty new to this makeup thing</li>
            <li>Other then that love these brushes.</li>
            <li>Not exactly what I was expecting but just make sure you look closely at the pics.</li>
            <li>I may purchase a couple more sets to have on hand for my other classes..</li>
            <li>I am glad I read the other reviews and chose these.</li>
            <li>The smell is from the plastic idk why people keep getting mad they are so perfect and awsome price</li>
            <li>I like the different brushes but they are not as full and it don&#x27;t have as much depth as I would like</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and nice but there was a slight problem that really bothered me.</li>
            <li>The only thing that worries me is when I clean the eye brushes and one of them started shedding a lot.</li>
            <li>but it was easy to washout with dawn dish soap and air dry.</li>
            <li>they are super soft very dence and the bristle don&#x27;t shed so far</li>
            <li>I love these brushes but the funny thing is this is the exact same brush set I purchased from BH Cosmetics minus the BH name on the brush set.</li>
            <li>The brushes feel like a high quality Taklon but they absorb too much for that to be the case.</li>
            <li>Overall, are cheap and fit my minimal makeup needs</li>
            <li>First off, let me say I am a professional makeup artist.</li>
            <li>handy if i get too lazy to wash brushes</li>
            <li>At first I was quite alarmed that they smelled like paint, but as the card inside said, with one wash the smell was completely gone.</li>
            <li>The large brushes are very nice, but the small brushes are too long.</li>
            <li>So anyone complaining of a smell should wash them (as you should always wash new brushes)!</li>
            <li>Brushes are a very soft and very high quality.</li>
            <li>I needed some new brushes but really didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money.</li>
            <li>I was about to drop half a grand on a Sigma set</li>
            <li>Most of the smaller eye brushes are basically the same.</li>
            <li>These brushes are super, super soft, the handles and ferrules are sturdy, minimal to no shedding.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t super dense but dense enough to not eat up all your makeup like some brushes do, not ultra flimsy yet flexible.</li>
            <li>Decent makeup brushes for the price.</li>
            <li>Really soft brushes better than I expected</li>
            <li>(they are all pretty similar and aren&#x27;t exactly as the picture shows them to be).  </li>
            <li>every one said they were decent.</li>
            <li>They are smaller than I expected (compare to the ones that you can buy in drug or beauty supplies stores), but for $10 they are really nice.</li>
            <li>These brushes are really quite soft!</li>
            <li>Brushes are very soft and blend like a dream!  </li>
            <li>Very soft brushes!</li>
            <li>I have had to trim a few hairs on the flat brushes but other than that I am very happy with this purchase and will buy again!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re really soft but also kind of stiff.</li>
            <li>When I got them, fortunately none of the stems of the brushes were loose BUT as a precaution I took them apart anyway and superglued it.</li>
            <li>Absolutely NO shedding, no black color coming out, no nasty smell from glue!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brushes came quickly and we&#x27;re exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>High quality brushes ‚ù§</li>
            <li>I high recommend them.</li>
            <li>Who Need Those High Price Makeup Brushes</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>i highly recomend them.</li>
            <li>I refuse to pay the high price for sigma again,</li>
            <li>&amp; i didn&#x27;t expect that, I bought this more of an experiment to see if I could find quality for a lower price &amp;  so that I could give my other professional brushes a break.</li>
            <li>Lastly one of my flat top brushes came apart.</li>
            <li>As for the rest of the reviews, either I got the best set, or their brushes are shedding due to poor maintenance.</li>
            <li>Really soft brushes!!</li>
            <li>However, they&#x27;re too soft!!</li>
            <li>But there&#x27;s nothing a little wash can&#x27;t fix. :)</li>
            <li>Soft!!</li>
            <li>A great alternative to some of the expensive brushes out there.</li>
            <li>So far, I am really liking them.</li>
            <li>They are really dense and soft.</li>
            <li>They are very dense, soft brushes.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and quality is far beyond price point on these.</li>
            <li>These brushes are so soft and pick up color really well.</li>
            <li>They are soft, but dense and they pick up product very well.  </li>
            <li>They are extremely soft and apply makeup very well.</li>
            <li>Very dense, soft brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, they are so soft and look really well made.</li>
            <li>but when i got them i was really pleasently surprised.</li>
            <li>but they are very silky and soft.</li>
            <li>Overall, I think these are definitely worth it for the money.</li>
            <li>Wish they were more firm</li>
            <li>Brushes had a few bristles fall out at first but nothing after the primary wash/use of them.</li>
            <li>Depending on how heavy handed or light handed you are will effect your makeup application outcome, remember that!</li>
            <li>I use them everyday and love them.</li>
            <li>Nice and thick full-size brushes.  </li>
            <li>but the other ones are fine.</li>
            <li>but they work just fine other than that.</li>
            <li>/&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1)  See above about smell - though the smell did go away after washing them.&lt;br /&gt;2)  The brushes take a lot longer to dry than most any brushes I have used.  </li>
            <li>They are the same quality, but just don&#x27;t have quite the right shape or feel for what I like in eye brushes.</li>
            <li>I was going to buy a set of Kabukis from another seller here on Amazon and chose this set purely for the fact that they carried other brushes (not just the flat top Kabukis for foundation application.  </li>
            <li>I use most feels like its coming a tiny bit loose on the handle.</li>
            <li>They do have a slight smell when you first take them out of the package but that is gone quickly.</li>
            <li>Other people&#x27;s pictures on the reviews look huge.</li>
            <li>I have no complaints other than their cheaply made</li>
            <li>I bought them since they reminded me of other brushes that youtubers talk about and I enjoy these.</li>
            <li>It is not pressed tight onto the bristles leaving extra space for more bristles and making it more likely for the bristles to fall out in the future.</li>
            <li>U can smell how new they are</li>
            <li>My new favorites in my collection~</li>
            <li>I am new to makeup and wanted stronger brushes for an inexpensive price.</li>
            <li>but I think I will live.</li>
            <li>New faves</li>
            <li>They do smell like paint but to me that just shows they are brand new and sitting in plastic.</li>
            <li>Did not receive all of the brushes ,, missing one ,,, seem to be great quality but not as cut as shown they seem to all he basically round</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much when I purchased these, but WOW was I surprised when they arrived.</li>
            <li>Brushes are good but smelled terrible of chemicals...told my girls to wash them good before using them.</li>
            <li>These brushes are amazing, far better than what I expected, the only down fall is that they smell kind of weird but</li>
            <li>Very soft brushes.</li>
            <li>They are very soft and apply and pick up product well.</li>
            <li>Just as soft and durable as high ends.</li>
            <li>Very soft brushes.</li>
            <li>They are also very soft.</li>
            <li>They are very soft, and the density is to MY satisfaction.  </li>
            <li>Very soft..</li>
            <li>They are very soft.  </li>
            <li>There is a smell upon opening, and I am VERY sensitive to things that smell.  </li>
            <li>They are very soft.</li>
            <li>Very soft yet dense.</li>
            <li>They haven&#x27;t shed a lot and are very soft.</li>
            <li>They are very soft and well made.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The only downside was when I received them, they were drenched in the smell of paint but instructions were included to wash the brushes with shampoo if there was any strong paint scent caused from being encased too long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought numerous brushes from Sephora (and for 4x the price) and the quality of these are pretty comparable.  </li>
            <li>I was really surprised!</li>
            <li>Yes, they are soft!</li>
            <li>They are soft!</li>
            <li>Just make sure to use a small dot of cleanser when cleaning them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Soft and durable!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>-- When you first open them they do have scent to them, but it fades away soon after.</li>
            <li>These brushes are soft and carried no scent!</li>
            <li>They do smell funny once you open up the package but its</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft!</li>
            <li>The only downside to them is that when you first get them they do have a chemically smell.</li>
            <li>They are so soft!</li>
            <li>After washing, completely gone!</li>
            <li>Really soft!</li>
            <li>they are extremely soft and all in tact!</li>
            <li>and so far no shedding!</li>
            <li>the brushes are so soft!</li>
            <li>The only thing I had a problem with is they smelt like paint when I first got them</li>
            <li>They do have a chemical smell to them when u first open them but as soon as I  wash them the smell vanished.</li>
            <li>They distribute just enough product to your face and with these brushes the possibilities are endless, you can add more product for buildable coverage.</li>
            <li>I love the way they look, clean and expensive looking.</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is  the brushes were shedding after my first use of them &amp;  the  smell of the glue is super strong when you open the package.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5/5 is because the flat top kabuki brush handle came off of the actual silver part.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very soft and I&#x27;m really surprised at the quality.</li>
            <li>But not to worry, nothing a little super glue couldn&#x27;t fix!</li>
            <li>They are not bad other than that.</li>
            <li>They do have a slight smell to them upon arrival, but I always clean new brushes before use.</li>
            <li>but after washing them a few times they smell fine.</li>
            <li>I am certain they will last awhile.</li>
            <li>They are soooo soft, especially the large face brushes.</li>
            <li>I wish the eyeshadow brushes were a little more different.  </li>
            <li>EVERY time I washed it it would clean off the makeup and the water would turn blackish like the black dye was bleeding.  </li>
            <li>Soft.</li>
            <li>Also i don&#x27;t have to use as much to cover my problem areas because the brush gives extra coverage when you stipple them.</li>
            <li>Just got these brushes dilivered early witch</li>
            <li>The only brushes i have to compare them to are my real techniques brushes</li>
            <li>As far as shipping goes I got them in two</li>
            <li>so what I did is opened them aired them out and the odor went away</li>
            <li>These brushes are so soft.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing another set for my professional makeup kit as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised at the quality of these brushes.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re amazingly soft and sturdy.</li>
            <li>No shedding so far</li>
            <li>They are not so much for the total face, because they are so dense.</li>
            <li>I feel like a professional makeup artist when there&#x27;re in my hand.</li>
            <li>and they are so soft.</li>
            <li>BUT....after they were unpackaged an allowed to air out, the smell was completely gone within an hour.</li>
            <li>No problem with shedding so far.</li>
            <li>I read these reviews and was thinking - wow</li>
            <li>people are really sensitive, smell shmell.  </li>
            <li>Each brush was individually wrapped and I was astonished how much each one smelled IMMEDIATELY</li>
            <li>I was happily surprised that none of the handles popped off while washing them.&lt;br /&gt;2)  </li>
            <li>I was fairly surprised and contacted Amazon to see if there was any sort of price match thing</li>
            <li>and I went to hold them all and completely forgot</li>
            <li>I was fairly surprised and contacted Amazon to see if there was any sort of price match thing</li>
            <li>and I went to hold them all and completely forgot</li>
            <li>they have aired out and I don&#x27;t smell anything stinky on em anymore.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised.</li>
            <li>- only to really blend in concealer around my eyes and nose.</li>
            <li>They are so soft, and they make your makeup look soft and even.</li>
            <li>I am still using the same make-up, but the finished product I get with these brushes was a real surprise.  </li>
            <li>Almost professional quality.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fixed</li>
            <li>these brushes are so soft dense</li>
            <li>it came early</li>
            <li>They are soft.  </li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t put them near my face.</li>
            <li>Feels so soft on my face.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft and get the job done.</li>
            <li>They even hold their shape after frequent cleaning.</li>
            <li>Like how soft and how they apply</li>
            <li>They did have a strange smell at first</li>
            <li>Soft bristles</li>
            <li>So far no shedding.</li>
            <li>These brushes are amazingly soft.</li>
            <li>They are soft but not too soft so that they don&#x27;t hold your powders.</li>
            <li>The brushes are incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>But focusing on the brushes themselves, they&#x27;re soft and lightweight.</li>
            <li>Some brushes are soft but mine shade a lot.</li>
            <li>wow the price, I am buying these for gifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re dense but soft - not scratchy in the slightest.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just beginning to do makeup professionally and don&#x27;t want to invest a lot of money yet.....</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, the only downside to those brushes is that they tend to shed a lot.</li>
            <li>but I aired them out for about 4 minutes and it went away.</li>
            <li>Brushes are so soft and sleek.</li>
            <li>the sigma set sets you back $160; so in my opinion this is a much smater buy.</li>
            <li>It took a bit to get them but they came from far away.</li>
            <li>Really cheap- don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li>all of them except one so far...</li>
            <li>They are soft and durable.</li>
            <li>These brushes are soft and blends well.</li>
            <li>Threw out all my old brushes.</li>
            <li>The bristles are so soft but it is sturdy..</li>
            <li>Soft bristles and just what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li>Made of soft material and hold makeup well</li>
            <li>Soft and doesn&#x27;t have shed hairs.</li>
            <li>Def gonna purchase a few more sets for back ups</li>
            <li>/&gt;You get the idea, these brushes are awesome, I have put my Sigma, MAC and Technique (hate the handles of that brand)</li>
            <li>ill buy more cheap ones and more cheap ones until i feel im at the stage to get expensive brushes and their is a difference between expensive and cheap brushes.</li>
            <li>But it has good quality, just a little bit small.</li>
            <li>The big blush or powder brush when&#x27;s first open hair was falling off...</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is looking for an inexpensive, but decently made set of brushes.</li>
            <li>so I took it out and glued it back with some regular hot glue</li>
            <li>I was excited after reading the other reviews, but I seriously doubly their authenticity at this point.</li>
            <li>after that there was no more smell and my wife says the brushes or smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Sadly, my second brush started doing the same exact.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t replace my current brushes but I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>but I just put crazy glue on them and they are as good as new.</li>
            <li>They are also super soft, I use one to apply foundation, one for concealer, one as an eye shadow blender, highlighter, and you can use a few of them to contour along your nose, forehead, and cheeks</li>
            <li>Blends well, full and firm, picks up color</li>
            <li>A little super glue</li>
            <li>A little super glue</li>
            <li>I gently squeezed out the excess water and have them sitting brush-up in a cup on the window sill to dry.</li>
            <li>the big brushes are very bulky and the eye brushes are too big for my eyes.</li>
            <li>Good brushes the only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that it had a weird smell</li>
            <li>I did not notice any funny smell like stated in other reviews.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t anything major.</li>
            <li>major.</li>
            <li>I just purchased these brushes recently and they are so soft!</li>
            <li>Overall These brushes are great to practice makeup, some of them I would recommend for professional use, there are like 2 brushes that I was not a huge fan of, but they are not the worse thing I have ever held either.</li>
            <li>I purchased the ones with the black handle and white tip and after one use the white is stained by my foundation (yes even after washing) that isn&#x27;t huge however for me.</li>
            <li>However after the third cleaning of the brushes, my main foundation brush started shedding its hairs and also fell off its wooden stick.</li>
            <li>The brushes are nice but the bag that the brushes came in had a very strong (disgusting) odor.  </li>
            <li>A little hot glue fixed it though.</li>
            <li>The smaller, eyeshadow-type brushes are actually quite large and the face brushes are on the smaller side of what I am used to.  </li>
            <li>My only real gripe is the huge lettering on the handles its not attractive.</li>
            <li>i will definitely repurchase these as a gift for someone or even for myself to replace my old brushes.</li>
            <li>They have no smell after you wash them, and barely shed.</li>
            <li>After being washed it was barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast also, got them 4 days before expected arrival date.</li>
            <li>they are too puffy, pretty big, not delicate, not easy to work with</li>
            <li>/&gt;They do have a slight smell that you may want to wash off before your first use.</li>
            <li>Amazon LLC&lt;br /&gt;Delivered: 4 days after order dategreat, but they are pretty similar to each other.  </li>
            <li>The smaller brushes are also very dense and like mini kabukis which I find a little more difficult for eye make up - their just a bit too large for my taste.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t experience what other reviews said mines came 1 not broken 2 not smelly</li>
            <li>The picture to the right of the brushes with blush &amp; shadow on them is of the same 2 brushes just after wiping them off on a tissue with a little alcohol (not washed with soap &amp; water).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The picture to the right of the brushes with blush &amp; shadow on them is of the same 2 brushes just after wiping them off on a tissue with a little alcohol (not washed with soap &amp; water).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Looks just as expected &amp; very soft!</li>
            <li>nothing a little hot glue can&#x27;t fix.  </li>
            <li>When you wash them make sure to dry them with the bristles pointing down as water seeping down into the brush can loosen the glue</li>
            <li>The only thing is that I wish they were a little more firm</li>
            <li>When I first got them, they did smell like marker but after a few washes the smell went away.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised they did not dry over night even after squeezing them out with a dry bamboo paper towel.  </li>
            <li>The only complaints that I have is that when I did wash them it took them a long time to dry and they absorb quite a bit of your product but not too much.</li>
            <li>the delivery was less than 2 weeks and the brushes r very go quality</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to wait 2 days for a complete air dry which can be done over the weekends.</li>
            <li>The products are lack luster given in my first few weeks of use, 5 of the brushes broke given the adhesive holding the brush handle and brush tip is low quality.</li>
            <li>The smaller brushes are a little large for my eyes</li>

            <li> Seem to be nice but didn&#x27;t recieve the bag or eyeliner brush</li>
            <li> , it has held up nicely.</li>
            <li> They blend nicely.</li>
            <li> Nice deal for the feel.</li>
            <li> but they do feel nice.</li>
            <li> and I am loving them.</li>

            <li> and I&#x27;m really glad I purchased them!!&lt;br /&gt;The owner of the kit, Alice, even emailed to make sure I was happy</li>
            <li> nice</li>
            <li> it just smelled kind of like paint or plastic</li>
            <li> Nice brushes.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting much for what I paid, but I was extremely, extremely impressed.</li>
            <li> They arrived within 3 days and came nicely packaged in an envelope with bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> They are such a great quality for synthetic brushes and my makeup looks flawless when applying it with these brushes.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a VERY affordable brush set, without having to pay $$ for Morphe or Sigma, then these are your best bet.</li>
            <li> They did smell, kind of like paint, but I washed them and the smell was gone.</li>
            <li> They were nice while they lasted.</li>
            <li> if I&#x27;ll be repurchasing these though, to be honest.</li>
            <li> Liked the bag they came in.</li>
            <li> Nice brushes, tip came off as soon as I opened them.</li>
            <li> They really help blend in your make up well and leave your skin looking flawless!</li>
            <li> These work well for many purposes, a good buy, i recommend</li>
            <li> and I really liked them</li>
            <li> I own costal scents brushes.</li>
            <li> I washed them with warm water and some soap.</li>
            <li> Love love love!!</li>
            <li> Worth the price!!!</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter, she is delighted with them and uses them every day, beautiful quality and affordable - very grateful</li>
            <li> the brushes have a very strong smell of chemicals (kind of like paint thinner and glue)</li>
            <li> I am very impressed they seem high end.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had my share of high end and inexpensive brushes and these are a perfect mix of both!</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re amazing :) they don&#x27;t look or feel cheap whatsoever!!</li>
            <li> Full Of Joy About My Makeup Brushes</li>
            <li> Good brush for cheap just don&#x27;t like how is  not labeled to what kind of brush</li>
            <li> wayyy more than what you need your brushes to be; this makes blending foundation or whatever much harder!!&lt;br /&gt;nevertheless, speaking about the price, they&#x27;re perfect and I will recommend it to my friends</li>
            <li> I loved the brush I read alot about the strong odor</li>
            <li> It did come with a fairly strong odor, but I just washed them really good</li>
            <li> Very soft nice quality!!!</li>
            <li> When they are opened they have a very strong factory smell.</li>
            <li> The box they came out of had a very STRONG paint smell, but the brushes themselves had no paint smell at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The odor was also very strong and nauseating.  </li>
            <li> but they do break very easily</li>
            <li> But when i got them in the mail I couldn&#x27;t have been more satisfied!</li>
            <li> They are pretty durable and seem to be good!</li>
            <li> When I first received the product, I absolutely loved it!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase so far!</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow brushes are a bit on the large side, but I find them ideal for blending across the lid.</li>
            <li> Absolutely so soft, durable, and priced greatly!</li>
            <li> but I liked them even more when I saw them.</li>
            <li> They are soft and perfect !</li>
            <li> They are soft and very very excellent for blending.</li>
            <li> So soft and beautiful!</li>
            <li> These brushes are by far the best I&#x27;ve ever felt.</li>
            <li> They are extremely soft but will blend out your makeup flawlessly.</li>
            <li> brushes, so soft on the skin and applies wonderfully.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great fun using these brushes</li>
            <li> Soft great quality brushes!</li>
            <li> The brushes once cleaned are so soft and the application is flawless!</li>
            <li> The brush heads are so soft and are cut perfectly.</li>
            <li> If they were shorter, they would be more compact and effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a MAC Pro  and Licensed MUA and these are by far the best brushes on the market, and</li>
            <li> This brand is so adorable and just amazing.</li>
            <li> They feel amazingly soft and they are so awesome with any product.</li>
            <li> Before I purchased them I read the reviews and sound really good</li>
            <li> These brushes were falling apart right when I got them and the quality is not that great.</li>
            <li> These brushes are easy to work with!</li>
            <li> They come apart so easily &amp; end up titling ?!</li>
            <li> I can put make up on easily with the help of these babies!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>

            <li> and I can use it for many of my blending needs.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really satisfied</li>
            <li> Love these brushes.</li>
            <li> There are so many brushes in this set I&#x27;m still finding ways to use them all.</li>
            <li> Ok for the price, but they shed a ton.</li>

            <li> You&#x27;d be much better off buying a set with finer eye make up brushes.</li>

            <li> Fantastic brushes!</li>
            <li> Love them ...</li>

            <li> I am impressed with them brushed .</li>
            <li> They also don&#x27;t feel cheap; they feel sturdy and they have a nice ergonomic handle.</li>
            <li> I love the shapes the face brushes come in.</li>
            <li> will say that I do prefer the face brushes much more than the eye brushes.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the brushes.</li>
            <li> and I love them.</li>

            <li> For the cheap price, I was completely surprised by how great they are!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great quality.</li>
            <li> Many times people wash their brushes and don&#x27;t handle them with care/properly.</li>
            <li> so the bristles are resting on a towel or buying a brush dryer rack).&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I love these brushes.</li>
            <li> No awful odor like some</li>
            <li> I love</li>
            <li> Love it...</li>
            <li> I thought it was ok.</li>
            <li> Love them amazed with these brushes and the price</li>
            <li> Just bought these and love them</li>
            <li> No shedding, the smell is mostly gone from the bristles (although the handles still smell a bit).</li>
            <li> Love these brushes.</li>

            <li> /&gt;The brushes did have a certain smell to them but that is good since I know they were steralized.</li>
            <li> Very good product especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a very good brush set</li>
            <li> Love them got here very fast!!</li>
            <li> But other than they are good brushes better than elf!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are soft and feel great.</li>
            <li> They are soft and the make of them I can tell are great.</li>
            <li> Great product and got here early.</li>
            <li> Giving a 5 star rating because I received these brushes 2 days before the expected delivery date and also because they&#x27;re great brushes!</li>
            <li> I love how smooth my makeup goes on.</li>
            <li> I just LOVE these brushes, my first REALLY nice set.  </li>
            <li> The bristles and soft and cut well, great density.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft and I think that they&#x27;re great for the price.</li>
            <li> Brushes are great but do come apart but easily fixed with a glue gun</li>
            <li> These brushes are great so far.  </li>
            <li> They have held up great so far</li>
            <li> I have paid up to $30 for one makeup brush and the quality was not as good as this whole set.</li>
            <li> These brushes really are good.</li>
            <li> I really care about the tools and products I use when doing my makeup and these are just as good quality as the brush sets you can spend $70 on.</li>
            <li> my eyeshadow brushes were very flimsy and unproportion bristle wise</li>
            <li> They work great, I use them daily, but they break so easily!</li>
            <li> They work very well, and come with a nice variety, and they also clean up nicely.</li>
            <li> Got my brushes so far I love them !!</li>
            <li> Really soft and applies makeup very nicely.</li>
            <li> Brushes were very nice and soft.</li>
            <li> very nice and easy to use and will give you professional look</li>
            <li> Easy for apply any  make up product</li>
            <li> Arrived very quick.</li>
            <li> Even more happy that I think I saw only 1 bristle come out while I washed all the brushes.  </li>
            <li> Easy to wash and handle.</li>
            <li> The brushes are inexpensive for the quality and quantity, but keep in mind that they do shed and the handle breaks off easily.</li>
            <li> Synthetic makeup brushes are the best and for people who can&#x27;t afford the expensive brush sets this is a great choice.</li>
            <li> but mine wasn&#x27;t strong at all, a wash with some baby shampoo will take care of it.</li>
            <li> It does have a strong smell to it firs but after u wash it</li>
            <li> I washed them when I unpackaged because they smelt strongly of plastic.</li>
            <li> The smell is strong.</li>
            <li> the packaging smell was seriously strong even after I washed them.</li>
            <li> They do have a strong sense</li>
            <li> It does have a strong scent but wash them</li>
            <li> When I opened them I did notice a strong odor.</li>
            <li> I did however, jump away from the strong smell they had.</li>
            <li> But the quality in the bristles is just as good as buying the high priced ones.</li>
            <li> Just as good as any of my high end brushes.</li>
            <li> First off let me say these are just absolutely amazing brushes</li>
            <li> They are so soft and amazing at blending foundations, eye shadows, blushes, anything!</li>
            <li> They are full size brushes and I would recommend them :)</li>
            <li> Nice dupe for sigma but smells funny</li>
            <li> These were the first of the kind brushes</li>
            <li> and they wash up pretty nicely.  </li>
            <li> Hands down the best for applying bronzer, blush, highlighter, contour powers, creams, liquids.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> Amazing and most soft brushes I&#x27;ve ever used!!  </li>
            <li> then they&#x27;d be fine.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fine..</li>
            <li> and it will be fine.  </li>
            <li> Mine shed before I washed them, but now they are fine.</li>
            <li> and you should be fine</li>
            <li> I use less foundation and powder and my makeup looks flawless!</li>
            <li> but after I washed them they smelt fine</li>
            <li> They are working well and fine when re-washed.</li>
            <li> I was super nervous about ordering these because they were so cheap!</li>
            <li> They work wonders and are super cute and affordable.</li>
            <li> quick delivery too!</li>
            <li> Great price and super soft.  </li>
            <li> They work wonderfully &amp; are very soft like u would expect from any professional brush.</li>
            <li> they are super easy to clean and I just love them</li>
            <li> Very soft, great brushes, very affordable love this brush set</li>
            <li> They are soft, great quality, don&#x27;t shed, and are almost exact dupes for the sigma brushes!</li>
            <li> the texture is awesome and shipping was way faster than expected!!!</li>
            <li> the bigger brushes are amazing, loved the way it applied my foundation, the skinny ones are alittle hard to work with on the eyes but they are perfect for blending out your under eye concealer and contouring your nose.</li>
            <li> So I was super excited to use them!</li>
            <li> LISTEN to the reviews they are CHEAPLY made the brush came apart from the silver part</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it, fantastic value!</li>
            <li> The smaller brushes were great for detailing and blending out concealer.</li>
            <li> Great makeup set for low price.</li>
            <li> easy to clean as well.</li>
            <li> They absorb all make up and are cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Smooth finish with make-up.</li>
            <li> Great buy for the price especially.</li>
            <li> no lie they are so smooth and they work wonders.</li>
            <li> I will rate these brushes based on my professional opinion as a makeup artist from 1- 5.... 1 being low and 5 being the best:  Softness: 3.8 Quality: 3 handles: 4 bristles: 3.8</li>
            <li> Overall I feel that they absorb a lot of product but for the price they are a great bargain.</li>
            <li> They are sturdy and easy to clean perfect for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Considering  I got 11 brushes (including the free eye liner brush) for $10</li>
            <li> Cheap if you want cheap because they are synthetic of course</li>
            <li> and I liked them so much</li>
            <li> Cheap brushes.</li>
            <li> They give a smooth coverage to my foundations, blushes and eye shadows.</li>
            <li> came fast , nice dense brushes .</li>
            <li> I still give it a 4 because these brushes are fantastic for the price.  </li>
            <li> The quality of these brushes are fantastic.</li>
            <li> Each individual brush was wrapped and were in great condition.</li>
            <li> They cleaned up very well with Dawn and warm water.</li>
            <li> Cheap price, cheap brushes.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t feel cheaply made or even look cheaply made in that matter.</li>
            <li> I told myself that wouldn&#x27;t bother me, because I have a fantastic brush cleaner.</li>
            <li> They clean without losing bristles and the handles are easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> but like I said so far so good</li>
            <li> There grate nice and soft love them</li>
            <li> These brushes are soft, dense and each brush top is finished off nicely for blending and applying product.  </li>
            <li> So far so good though.</li>
            <li> They are so soft and do a good job of distributing product.</li>

            <li> they smelled strong when i first got them but nothing that is overwhelming.</li>
            <li> :) They did arrive with a strong paint smell (the sterilizer) but after I washed them the first time, the smell vanished.</li>
            <li> But it came pretty darn close!!</li>
            <li> SOFT!&lt;br /&gt;~Provides very nice coverage when I used some liquid foundation on the back of my hand.&lt;br /&gt;~100</li>
            <li> Also, they were delivered so quickly and packaged super securely!</li>
            <li> I love it there so soft and easy to work with . :)</li>

            <li> Love these brushes came super fast!!</li>
            <li> The brushes were very sot and didn&#x27;t have a very strong chemical smell for me, which is saying a lot since I get headaches just from spraying air fresheners.</li>
            <li> It was just amazing, really soft!!</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes in January and 6 months later they&#x27;re still amazing!</li>
            <li> The best brushes out there for small amount of money.</li>
            <li> I could see the glue that originally held the brush</li>
            <li> I am excited to use and experiment with them.</li>
            <li> Worth the price!</li>
            <li> i was so excited to try out these brushes</li>
            <li> Other than that they are good brushes!</li>

            <li> But overall, pretty good brushes!</li>
            <li> So glad we tried these before spending a fortune on higher priced brushes.</li>
            <li> Pretty decent quality bristle wise.</li>
            <li> the price this is absolutely amazing and i will definitely be repurchasing this :)</li>
            <li> Such an amazing buy for an ultra cheap price!</li>
            <li> The smell of brushes wasn&#x27;t  great, I washed them with shampoo and let them air dry</li>
            <li> Once you clean them, the odor is gone.</li>
            <li> they work like brushes are supposed to work, very soft and nice feeling on my face.</li>
            <li> very soft &amp; nice brushes</li>

            <li> The flat top kabuki type brushes are quite nice.</li>
            <li> right before they sent them out!</li>
            <li> ranking right up there with Sigma and Mac!</li>
            <li> is right!</li>
            <li> great soft and dense brushes, very comparable to higher end brands!</li>

            <li> Such a good dupe.</li>
            <li> Have paid more for one brush that I didn&#x27;t like as much.  </li>

            <li> I love them so much that I will order another set.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> I do use the bigger brushes for my foundation and for powder which work really really good.</li>
            <li> I ordered the gold set last month, and I just loved them, so I ordered these silver.</li>
            <li> Overall the brushes were good</li>
            <li> Love these got her fast</li>
            <li> so soft and nice for the price</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect them to be such good quality for that price</li>
            <li> Nice soft brushes.</li>
            <li> They are very nice especially for the price how ever I&#x27;m lost using them because idk what to use for different products they would be amazing to come with a reference sheet</li>
            <li> Shipping was easy and fast, brushes were well made, light weight with zero shedding.</li>
            <li> The first time I opened the package, it smelled strongly of glue.</li>
            <li> When I first opened them I did smell a strong type of a chemical smell, but I washed them in baby soap and the smell went away.</li>
            <li> She was super sweet and helpful.</li>
            <li> When I first got the brushes they had a strong scent.</li>
            <li> They have a strong smell when you first get them.</li>
            <li> Other than that I&#x27;m happy with them</li>
            <li> nothing that you can&#x27;t handle they smell like spray paint but other than that the brushes are wonderful for the price they&#x27;re very soft and they blend well.</li>
            <li> i received my brushes in pieces and no amount of super glue held them together, i bought two sets and both came un glued on arrival.</li>
            <li> They arrived super quickly and feel just like sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> The only thing that could make them better was if the handles had a better paint</li>
            <li> These brushes are sooo soft, apply product well, and WOW what a great bargain!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Brushes aren&#x27;t super dense but the bristles have stayed intact.</li>
            <li> I ordered mainly for the face brushes, and I love them.</li>
            <li> If you just want more foundation brushes these work but absolutely not a replacement for the finish and quality of the sigma sigmax ones, which I also own.</li>
            <li> Really like the brushes;  soft and durable, the weight of the handles feel good in my hand.  </li>
            <li> I have used many other brands of brushes and I have found these to be my favorite!</li>
            <li> They are extremely soft and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> My least favorite is probably the large pointed foundation brush, but even then its very good.</li>
            <li> Very Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> My favorite is the flat top kabuki‚ù§</li>
            <li> I love the flat top face brush for applying foundation or bb creams.</li>
            <li> Some are more domed, while others are more flat or angled.</li>
            <li> My favorite are the eye brushes and the flat top foundation buffing brush.</li>
            <li> I Love makeupe &amp; creating new looks all the time</li>
            <li> Totallly love this new set.</li>
            <li> I love my new makeup bmakeup thank you</li>
            <li> Overall pretty good brushes.</li>
            <li> I love all the face brushes, haven&#x27;t really tried the eye brushes yet but they seem promising!</li>
            <li> EXACTLY like Sigma!</li>
            <li> I love how soft they are!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve definitely had better brushes, but for the price you pay for these I can&#x27;t complain!</li>
            <li> Overall I am satisfied with my purchase but wish they included an angular eyeliner brush as well!</li>
            <li> These had a funny smell but after I washed them, it went away!</li>
            <li> The brushes are super soft and make a great gift thats under $20 definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> These are amazing for $10.00 really blend out and are super soft on the skin.</li>
            <li> They also wash beautifully and have little to no fall out !</li>
            <li> Great little set of brushes</li>
            <li> Nice little collection I love it</li>
            <li> they are great quality a little bit more smaller than expected but great</li>
            <li> I really wanted to enjoy these..</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use cheap stuff on your face like really just don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> fit the bill and for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Amazing brushes, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Amazing brushes only i hates was the smell it smelled funky</li>
            <li> I needed a set of brushes for everyday use, and this set works great.</li>
            <li> Kabuki feel and the fluffy, dense formation of the bristles make for great foundation application, blending, contouring etc.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles which I love</li>
            <li> Perfect for anyone who wants to try out being a makeup artist and then upgrading to a more expensive brand.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes, they are so soft just like my Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> The return on this investment is WELL worth the money</li>
            <li> these are totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> I use one of the small brushes for my concealer and it blends beautifully.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t get the directions for the brushes in the package so the seller was kind enough to email them to me</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> honestly, the brushes are almost all the same type (kabuki style) and 2 already fell off the stem..</li>
            <li> Each brush comes in its own individual package.</li>
            <li> These are definitely worth the money</li>
            <li> You definitely get your moneys worth with these brushes, they came in extra fast, the hair does not shed , it feels nice on the face and does a good job .</li>
            <li> Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> love these brushes are so soft.</li>
            <li> it worth it.</li>
            <li> My favorite brushes so far.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t shed and stay soft and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> that say these are great and all, but I will say this these brushes aren&#x27;t anywhere near as big as I thought they&#x27;d be.</li>
            <li> These are worth it.</li>
            <li> Came in a really nice pouch and they came individually wrapped.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t care for the smaller eye shadow brushes but the bigger ones are awesome.</li>
            <li> Nice brushes, but I needed a larger one than they offered to put on powder.</li>
            <li> Well worth it for the value</li>
            <li> Love them so far</li>
            <li> They seem nice enough!</li>
            <li> I love love love them all and will buy a new set if these need replacing down the line.</li>
            <li> I love love love this brushes (especially the flat Kabuki brush).</li>
            <li> I did notice the chemical smell that others spoke of when I first opened them, but that quickly dissipated as soon as I had them out of the packaging.</li>
            <li> Smelled super funny</li>
            <li> Super soft!!!!</li>
            <li> I recommend this brushes to anyone looking for some high quality cheap brushes, these are definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> As soft as high priced brushes, nice dense bristles.</li>
            <li> but right when I took off the plastic covering all the fibers started coming out.</li>
            <li> The package came right away.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> Washing them will take this smell right out.</li>
            <li> I washed them right away</li>
            <li> Very good quality, tight bristles and soft to the touch!</li>
            <li> Absolutely Love all of the brushes in this sermon super soft yet dense enough to get a flawless finish on the skin.</li>
            <li> I hope the seller doesn&#x27;t up the price seeing all these positive reviews!</li>
            <li> but the bigger face brushes are pretty amazing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a good deal for these brushes since they are super soft and sturdy.</li>
            <li> Synthetic brushes do not fill up with too much product and are easier to clean.  </li>
            <li> They do have a very strong chemical smell when you open them.  </li>
            <li> These brushes are so amazing I&#x27;ve had them for about a week now and have been using them everyday since then and noticed how easily they apply makeup to my face.</li>
            <li> It took a few days after the estimated date to receive them.&lt;br /&gt;However, these brushes are amazing !</li>
            <li> Other than that 1 brush, the others hold pretty good, and did not shed even when I washed them.</li>
            <li> I guess they&#x27;re good if you&#x27;re too lazy to wash your brushes all the time you can always just grab a clean one..</li>
            <li> I washed them a few times with shampoo and warm water to get rid of the smell and now they&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li> They are very soft and easy to use, and made very well!</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t like cheap brushes because most of them they break easy or don&#x27;t work well</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and the bristles are durable, but the metal detaches from the handle VERY quickly.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised the material is nice and brushes are really soft.</li>
            <li> So far so good I only used like 2 or 3 of them</li>
            <li> I still think they are a great set of brushes for such a low price.  </li>
            <li> I still think they are a great set of brushes for such a low price.  </li>
            <li> They feel like my real techniques and sigma brushes but are super affordable.</li>
            <li> They are soft and bristles do not fall out easily</li>
            <li> I see many people have success with these brushes, I have read the countless reviews.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the only downside the brushes work great especially for contouring on the face.</li>
            <li> Overall they seem like a great deal for the low price!</li>
            <li> The flat top kabuki brush in this set is a exact dupe of the sigma f80 brush!</li>
            <li> Other than that I am very pleased</li>
            <li> so these came very fast in the mail.</li>
            <li> she likes them very much</li>
            <li> And very fast delivery time.</li>
            <li> They are super soft and good quality with minimal shedding and I can&#x27;t wait to try them out today.</li>
            <li> The reason for a 4 not 5 star is that the handles are gold instead of gray, some brushes may need a very light trim of the extra hairs, and it smells like glue (but you should always give brushes a wash before using them for the first time</li>
            <li> FAST SHIPPING!</li>
            <li> I love it no more words :)</li>
            <li> First impression:</li>
            <li> both liquid and powder foundation also love the way it picks up eyeshadow powder would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Will be ordering several more sets.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always made sure to wash them properly.</li>
            <li> The brush was exactly as shown in the pictures.</li>
            <li> I think anybody that get this has to wash them first.</li>
            <li> no weird smell or any of the brush hairs falling off.</li>
            <li> I was absolutely amazed at the quality of these brushes!</li>
            <li> :) I definitely recommend them!</li>
            <li> My first set of &amp;#34;Real&amp;#34; makeup brushes.  </li>
            <li> I bought an extra set for my sister but haven&#x27;t been able to get them to her yet.  </li>
            <li> The brushes do have a smell when they first arrived</li>
            <li> First taking them out of the package, the smell horrible--like a spray paint smell.</li>
            <li> They did have a funny smell upon opening, but you should wash them anyway before using.</li>
            <li> but after I used it I was able to pull the silver part off the wooden handle.</li>
            <li> highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> The brushes and bag had a funny odor.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more products from them in the future now</li>
            <li> The bristles are falling out of most of the facial brushes</li>
            <li> They did smell like chemicals when I first receive them but one wash with some shampoo</li>
            <li> After only using them this morning, I can say they are a close second to my favorite brush set (my Morphe brushes are my number one favorite).</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and handle and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying them!!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes,  I had to go back and buy another set for my daughter!!  </li>
            <li> First in didnt arrived in time!!&lt;br /&gt;Second or it should be</li>
            <li> I began to use another brush hoping it was just an error in the first brush.</li>
            <li> With that being said, I actually really like these brushes!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re dense and apply my powder/liquid foundations really well!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> away, these makeup brushes are my go-to, and the only makeup brushes I tell my clients to purchase. :)</li>
            <li> They are soft and free of shedding.</li>
            <li> I think the chemical smell is more from the packaging than the actual brush.</li>
            <li> , they were pretty dense</li>
            <li> There is so many different for your face if you are in to contouring</li>
            <li> First impression....</li>
            <li> Make sure to wash before use, definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> they are exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy these again! :)</li>
            <li> Love how many I received for such a low price.</li>
            <li> when you first purchase (but do wash them anyway upon arrival)</li>
            <li> Been through tons of brushes expensive and not but these seem to be the best.</li>
            <li> Had a funny smell at first</li>
            <li> Just loved how the brushes started searching from the stems just a few weeks after I bought them.</li>
            <li> The handles of this set are heavy and a good length.</li>
            <li> After washing the brushes the plastic smell went away totally and all I was left with were super soft really great brushes.</li>
            <li> super soft and feel like sigma brushes!!</li>
            <li> They are so soft !!!!</li>
            <li> And they are so soft!!!!</li>
            <li> Wow!!!!</li>
            <li> I spent so much money on Mac and other brushes but these are the best brushes I had !!!!!</li>
            <li> Other than the fact the chemical smell is super (SUPER) strong.</li>
            <li> but they are super soft,  application is easy, and so far not fall out.</li>
            <li> As of today 2 of the large facial brushes are not use able.</li>
            <li> I have bought Kabuki brushes in the past and this product has such great reviews and it was so cheap that I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> I use the flat top one to apply my foundation and it looks like I used airbrush makeup.</li>
            <li> but it honestly didn&#x27;t bother me - I just paid $18 for one eyeliner brush at sephora the other day and</li>
            <li> but it honestly didn&#x27;t bother me - I just paid $18 for one eyeliner brush at sephora the other day and</li>
            <li> my sigma flat top kabuki and Sedona lace face brush set</li>
            <li> Had to wash them twice due to the smell but otherwise a really nice brush set.</li>
            <li> While the bristles are soft the brushes look pretty nice, the metal piece holding bristles is flimsy and too big for the bristles.  </li>
            <li> I try to clean more often with less cleaner</li>
            <li> The brushes were big, soft and did amazing work.</li>
            <li> So soft but nice and solid.</li>
            <li> These brushes are really nice, I expected them to smell really &amp;#34;chemically&amp;#34; but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> They are so dense I was surprised - they are far more dense than my Sephora set.</li>
            <li> The brushes look very nice, but there is a strong strong chemical smell that made me feel sick as soon as I opened the package.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great, but they are pretty similar to each other.  </li>
            <li> They feel flimsy,  although they are cheap and they do work fine the handles kind of break off after maybe 4 to 5 uses of it, if you&#x27;re a freelance makeup artist like myself and you are hesitant to buy expensive</li>
            <li> Their are two reasons why I only gave these brushes 4 stars: these did have a strong smell about them and one of my brushes broke after the first use.</li>
            <li> I washed these first with a gentle clarifying shampoo.</li>
            <li> I will likely be culling my flock of brushes and get rid of those older, scratchier brushes and replacing them with more of these.</li>
            <li> Shipped super fast, and the brushes are so soft!</li>
            <li> The length of the brush handle is easy to work with as well, some Kabuki brushes are too short.  </li>
            <li> With washing them, they didn&#x27;t shed at all and they stayed super soft.</li>
            <li> but they are super soft.</li>
            <li> Super soft.</li>
            <li> Super soft and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> All the pieces are there and the brushes are super soft.</li>
            <li> They are super soft.</li>
            <li> So I strongly recommend you wash them prior to using them!</li>
            <li> If they didn&#x27;t have such a strong chemical odor I would of kept them.</li>
            <li> They do have that strong chemical smell As soon as you open the bag</li>
            <li> The only thing is the plactic wrapper smells like strong plastic.</li>
            <li> I love every single brush from this kit.</li>
            <li> They are a bit on the large side, though.</li>
            <li> The brushes did have quite a strong smell when I took them out of the packaging (similar to paint/paint thinner) but the smell went away after I washed them with a little bit of shampoo and warm water.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very dense but super soft.</li>
            <li> They are fine for the price but too big to cover my eyes</li>
            <li> Once I glued them back on , they were fine.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend these brushes they work just as fine as my crown, mac, and sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> I came across the brushes while looking for a set that was decently priced as well as higher quality.</li>
            <li> They came with a very strong chemical smell, but I washed them with some soap and olive oil and let them dry over night and the smell was completely gone!</li>
            <li> I got a little shedding , but to be honest I got what I paid for (10) brushes for nine bucks</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t have expected better results with the whole product and process.</li>
            <li> Much better quality than expected.</li>
            <li> Blends foundation very well as well as the eyeshadows brushes.</li>
            <li> they dont shed at all and they blend very well.</li>
            <li> very well made..</li>
            <li> you really get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> While I was overall happy with my purchase, I am giving it 4 stars because two of the larger face brushes fell apart after the third time I washed them.</li>
            <li> She would rather pay the same amount and get one brush then these cheap things.</li>
            <li> shipping was really fas</li>
            <li> I really appreciate these brushes.</li>
            <li> haha.....</li>
            <li> you so much for all of your help</li>
            <li> It was what I really was expecting.</li>
            <li> and the thin ones are great for blending.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like them</li>
            <li> For synthetic bristles they are very soft.&lt;br /&gt;3)  </li>
            <li> very similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> REALLY LIKE</li>
            <li> very similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> REALLY LIKE</li>
            <li> and I am scared to buy brushes that have fallout or are rough, but I am glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very sturdy and well made.</li>
            <li> did notice when I washed them that it took some time to work out the gentle shampoo I used.</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t have to put so much product on the brush.</li>
            <li> In all this may not be the product to buy if you don&#x27;t know much about makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> very  well.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t spend much on these</li>

            <li> Very comparable to</li>
            <li> I was very skeptic about orderiing these brushes.</li>
            <li> Very well made for the price ...</li>
            <li> Received this brush set today and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t bother me too much.</li>
            <li> These brushes looked promising</li>
            <li> and I really like them.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes.  </li>
            <li> so you really don&#x27;t need to worry.</li>
            <li> Amazon refunded 100%, so I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li> I have a whole sigma set which I bought for over $100</li>
            <li> I am returning and buying a set of real techniques brushes instead.</li>
            <li> Very Helpful</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very versatile!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Absolutely looovveee these brushes, you would think they were sigma brushes</li>

            <li> Highly recommend these brushes!</li>
            <li> Way better than I expected üôè</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really tried these yet.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Thanks  for your product</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> it came fast and well packaged</li>
            <li> absolutely love these, minimal shedding&lt;br /&gt;great value</li>
            <li> Shipment was fast.</li>
            <li> I was really hesitant to order them;</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it is a nice product if you just start exploring makeup or need something affordable for your everyday look.</li>
            <li> Really nice everyday brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty new to this makeup thing</li>
            <li> Other then that love these brushes.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I was expecting but just make sure you look closely at the pics.</li>
            <li> I may purchase a couple more sets to have on hand for my other classes..</li>
            <li> I am glad I read the other reviews and chose these.</li>
            <li> The smell is from the plastic idk why people keep getting mad they are so perfect and awsome price</li>
            <li> I like the different brushes but they are not as full and it don&#x27;t have as much depth as I would like</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and nice but there was a slight problem that really bothered me.</li>
            <li> The only thing that worries me is when I clean the eye brushes and one of them started shedding a lot.</li>
            <li> but it was easy to washout with dawn dish soap and air dry.</li>
            <li> they are super soft very dence and the bristle don&#x27;t shed so far</li>
            <li> I love these brushes but the funny thing is this is the exact same brush set I purchased from BH Cosmetics minus the BH name on the brush set.</li>
            <li> The brushes feel like a high quality Taklon but they absorb too much for that to be the case.</li>
            <li> Overall, are cheap and fit my minimal makeup needs</li>
            <li> First off, let me say I am a professional makeup artist.</li>
            <li> handy if i get too lazy to wash brushes</li>
            <li> At first I was quite alarmed that they smelled like paint, but as the card inside said, with one wash the smell was completely gone.</li>
            <li> The large brushes are very nice, but the small brushes are too long.</li>
            <li> So anyone complaining of a smell should wash them (as you should always wash new brushes)!</li>
            <li> Brushes are a very soft and very high quality.</li>
            <li> I needed some new brushes but really didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money.</li>
            <li> I was about to drop half a grand on a Sigma set</li>
            <li> Most of the smaller eye brushes are basically the same.</li>
            <li> These brushes are super, super soft, the handles and ferrules are sturdy, minimal to no shedding.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t super dense but dense enough to not eat up all your makeup like some brushes do, not ultra flimsy yet flexible.</li>
            <li> Decent makeup brushes for the price.</li>
            <li> Really soft brushes better than I expected</li>
            <li> (they are all pretty similar and aren&#x27;t exactly as the picture shows them to be).  </li>
            <li> every one said they were decent.</li>
            <li> They are smaller than I expected (compare to the ones that you can buy in drug or beauty supplies stores), but for $10 they are really nice.</li>
            <li> These brushes are really quite soft!</li>
            <li> Brushes are very soft and blend like a dream!  </li>
            <li> Very soft brushes!</li>
            <li> I have had to trim a few hairs on the flat brushes but other than that I am very happy with this purchase and will buy again!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really soft but also kind of stiff.</li>
            <li> When I got them, fortunately none of the stems of the brushes were loose BUT as a precaution I took them apart anyway and superglued it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely NO shedding, no black color coming out, no nasty smell from glue!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brushes came quickly and we&#x27;re exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> High quality brushes ‚ù§</li>
            <li> I high recommend them.</li>
            <li> Who Need Those High Price Makeup Brushes</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> i highly recomend them.</li>
            <li> I refuse to pay the high price for sigma again,</li>
            <li> &amp; i didn&#x27;t expect that, I bought this more of an experiment to see if I could find quality for a lower price &amp;  so that I could give my other professional brushes a break.</li>
            <li> Lastly one of my flat top brushes came apart.</li>
            <li> As for the rest of the reviews, either I got the best set, or their brushes are shedding due to poor maintenance.</li>
            <li> Really soft brushes!!</li>
            <li> However, they&#x27;re too soft!!</li>
            <li> But there&#x27;s nothing a little wash can&#x27;t fix. :)</li>
            <li> Soft!!</li>
            <li> A great alternative to some of the expensive brushes out there.</li>
            <li> So far, I am really liking them.</li>
            <li> They are really dense and soft.</li>
            <li> They are very dense, soft brushes.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and quality is far beyond price point on these.</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft and pick up color really well.</li>
            <li> They are soft, but dense and they pick up product very well.  </li>
            <li> They are extremely soft and apply makeup very well.</li>
            <li> Very dense, soft brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, they are so soft and look really well made.</li>
            <li> but when i got them i was really pleasently surprised.</li>
            <li> but they are very silky and soft.</li>
            <li> Overall, I think these are definitely worth it for the money.</li>
            <li> Wish they were more firm</li>
            <li> Brushes had a few bristles fall out at first but nothing after the primary wash/use of them.</li>
            <li> Depending on how heavy handed or light handed you are will effect your makeup application outcome, remember that!</li>
            <li> I use them everyday and love them.</li>
            <li> Nice and thick full-size brushes.  </li>
            <li> but the other ones are fine.</li>
            <li> but they work just fine other than that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1)  See above about smell - though the smell did go away after washing them.&lt;br /&gt;2)  The brushes take a lot longer to dry than most any brushes I have used.  </li>
            <li> They are the same quality, but just don&#x27;t have quite the right shape or feel for what I like in eye brushes.</li>
            <li> I was going to buy a set of Kabukis from another seller here on Amazon and chose this set purely for the fact that they carried other brushes (not just the flat top Kabukis for foundation application.  </li>
            <li> I use most feels like its coming a tiny bit loose on the handle.</li>
            <li> They do have a slight smell when you first take them out of the package but that is gone quickly.</li>
            <li> Other people&#x27;s pictures on the reviews look huge.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints other than their cheaply made</li>
            <li> I bought them since they reminded me of other brushes that youtubers talk about and I enjoy these.</li>
            <li> It is not pressed tight onto the bristles leaving extra space for more bristles and making it more likely for the bristles to fall out in the future.</li>
            <li> U can smell how new they are</li>
            <li> My new favorites in my collection~</li>
            <li> I am new to makeup and wanted stronger brushes for an inexpensive price.</li>
            <li> but I think I will live.</li>
            <li> New faves</li>
            <li> They do smell like paint but to me that just shows they are brand new and sitting in plastic.</li>
            <li> Did not receive all of the brushes ,, missing one ,,, seem to be great quality but not as cut as shown they seem to all he basically round</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much when I purchased these, but WOW was I surprised when they arrived.</li>
            <li> Brushes are good but smelled terrible of chemicals...told my girls to wash them good before using them.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing, far better than what I expected, the only down fall is that they smell kind of weird but</li>
            <li> Very soft brushes.</li>
            <li> They are very soft and apply and pick up product well.</li>
            <li> Just as soft and durable as high ends.</li>
            <li> Very soft brushes.</li>
            <li> They are also very soft.</li>
            <li> They are very soft, and the density is to MY satisfaction.  </li>
            <li> Very soft..</li>
            <li> They are very soft.  </li>
            <li> There is a smell upon opening, and I am VERY sensitive to things that smell.  </li>
            <li> They are very soft.</li>
            <li> Very soft yet dense.</li>
            <li> They haven&#x27;t shed a lot and are very soft.</li>
            <li> They are very soft and well made.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The only downside was when I received them, they were drenched in the smell of paint but instructions were included to wash the brushes with shampoo if there was any strong paint scent caused from being encased too long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought numerous brushes from Sephora (and for 4x the price) and the quality of these are pretty comparable.  </li>
            <li> I was really surprised!</li>
            <li> Yes, they are soft!</li>
            <li> They are soft!</li>
            <li> Just make sure to use a small dot of cleanser when cleaning them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Soft and durable!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> -- When you first open them they do have scent to them, but it fades away soon after.</li>
            <li> These brushes are soft and carried no scent!</li>
            <li> They do smell funny once you open up the package but its</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft!</li>
            <li> The only downside to them is that when you first get them they do have a chemically smell.</li>
            <li> They are so soft!</li>
            <li> After washing, completely gone!</li>
            <li> Really soft!</li>
            <li> they are extremely soft and all in tact!</li>
            <li> and so far no shedding!</li>
            <li> the brushes are so soft!</li>
            <li> The only thing I had a problem with is they smelt like paint when I first got them</li>
            <li> They do have a chemical smell to them when u first open them but as soon as I  wash them the smell vanished.</li>
            <li> They distribute just enough product to your face and with these brushes the possibilities are endless, you can add more product for buildable coverage.</li>
            <li> I love the way they look, clean and expensive looking.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is  the brushes were shedding after my first use of them &amp;  the  smell of the glue is super strong when you open the package.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5/5 is because the flat top kabuki brush handle came off of the actual silver part.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very soft and I&#x27;m really surprised at the quality.</li>
            <li> But not to worry, nothing a little super glue couldn&#x27;t fix!</li>
            <li> They are not bad other than that.</li>
            <li> They do have a slight smell to them upon arrival, but I always clean new brushes before use.</li>
            <li> but after washing them a few times they smell fine.</li>
            <li> I am certain they will last awhile.</li>
            <li> They are soooo soft, especially the large face brushes.</li>
            <li> I wish the eyeshadow brushes were a little more different.  </li>
            <li> EVERY time I washed it it would clean off the makeup and the water would turn blackish like the black dye was bleeding.  </li>
            <li> Soft.</li>
            <li> Also i don&#x27;t have to use as much to cover my problem areas because the brush gives extra coverage when you stipple them.</li>
            <li> Just got these brushes dilivered early witch</li>
            <li> The only brushes i have to compare them to are my real techniques brushes</li>
            <li> As far as shipping goes I got them in two</li>
            <li> so what I did is opened them aired them out and the odor went away</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing another set for my professional makeup kit as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised at the quality of these brushes.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re amazingly soft and sturdy.</li>
            <li> No shedding so far</li>
            <li> They are not so much for the total face, because they are so dense.</li>
            <li> I feel like a professional makeup artist when there&#x27;re in my hand.</li>
            <li> and they are so soft.</li>
            <li> BUT....after they were unpackaged an allowed to air out, the smell was completely gone within an hour.</li>
            <li> No problem with shedding so far.</li>
            <li> I read these reviews and was thinking - wow</li>
            <li> people are really sensitive, smell shmell.  </li>
            <li> Each brush was individually wrapped and I was astonished how much each one smelled IMMEDIATELY</li>
            <li> I was happily surprised that none of the handles popped off while washing them.&lt;br /&gt;2)  </li>
            <li> I was fairly surprised and contacted Amazon to see if there was any sort of price match thing</li>
            <li> and I went to hold them all and completely forgot</li>
            <li> I was fairly surprised and contacted Amazon to see if there was any sort of price match thing</li>
            <li> and I went to hold them all and completely forgot</li>
            <li> they have aired out and I don&#x27;t smell anything stinky on em anymore.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised.</li>
            <li> - only to really blend in concealer around my eyes and nose.</li>
            <li> They are so soft, and they make your makeup look soft and even.</li>
            <li> I am still using the same make-up, but the finished product I get with these brushes was a real surprise.  </li>
            <li> Almost professional quality.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fixed</li>
            <li> these brushes are so soft dense</li>
            <li> it came early</li>
            <li> They are soft.  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t put them near my face.</li>
            <li> Feels so soft on my face.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re soft and get the job done.</li>
            <li> They even hold their shape after frequent cleaning.</li>
            <li> Like how soft and how they apply</li>
            <li> They did have a strange smell at first</li>
            <li> Soft bristles</li>
            <li> So far no shedding.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazingly soft.</li>
            <li> They are soft but not too soft so that they don&#x27;t hold your powders.</li>
            <li> The brushes are incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> But focusing on the brushes themselves, they&#x27;re soft and lightweight.</li>
            <li> Some brushes are soft but mine shade a lot.</li>
            <li> wow the price, I am buying these for gifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re dense but soft - not scratchy in the slightest.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just beginning to do makeup professionally and don&#x27;t want to invest a lot of money yet.....</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, the only downside to those brushes is that they tend to shed a lot.</li>
            <li> but I aired them out for about 4 minutes and it went away.</li>
            <li> Brushes are so soft and sleek.</li>
            <li> the sigma set sets you back $160; so in my opinion this is a much smater buy.</li>
            <li> It took a bit to get them but they came from far away.</li>
            <li> Really cheap- don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> all of them except one so far...</li>
            <li> They are soft and durable.</li>
            <li> These brushes are soft and blends well.</li>
            <li> Threw out all my old brushes.</li>
            <li> The bristles are so soft but it is sturdy..</li>
            <li> Soft bristles and just what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li> Made of soft material and hold makeup well</li>
            <li> Soft and doesn&#x27;t have shed hairs.</li>
            <li> Def gonna purchase a few more sets for back ups</li>
            <li> /&gt;You get the idea, these brushes are awesome, I have put my Sigma, MAC and Technique (hate the handles of that brand)</li>
            <li> ill buy more cheap ones and more cheap ones until i feel im at the stage to get expensive brushes and their is a difference between expensive and cheap brushes.</li>
            <li> But it has good quality, just a little bit small.</li>
            <li> The big blush or powder brush when&#x27;s first open hair was falling off...</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is looking for an inexpensive, but decently made set of brushes.</li>
            <li> so I took it out and glued it back with some regular hot glue</li>
            <li> I was excited after reading the other reviews, but I seriously doubly their authenticity at this point.</li>
            <li> after that there was no more smell and my wife says the brushes or smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Sadly, my second brush started doing the same exact.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t replace my current brushes but I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> but I just put crazy glue on them and they are as good as new.</li>
            <li> They are also super soft, I use one to apply foundation, one for concealer, one as an eye shadow blender, highlighter, and you can use a few of them to contour along your nose, forehead, and cheeks</li>
            <li> Blends well, full and firm, picks up color</li>
            <li> A little super glue</li>
            <li> A little super glue</li>
            <li> I gently squeezed out the excess water and have them sitting brush-up in a cup on the window sill to dry.</li>
            <li> the big brushes are very bulky and the eye brushes are too big for my eyes.</li>
            <li> Good brushes the only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that it had a weird smell</li>
            <li> I did not notice any funny smell like stated in other reviews.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t anything major.</li>
            <li> major.</li>
            <li> I just purchased these brushes recently and they are so soft!</li>
            <li> Overall These brushes are great to practice makeup, some of them I would recommend for professional use, there are like 2 brushes that I was not a huge fan of, but they are not the worse thing I have ever held either.</li>
            <li> I purchased the ones with the black handle and white tip and after one use the white is stained by my foundation (yes even after washing) that isn&#x27;t huge however for me.</li>
            <li> However after the third cleaning of the brushes, my main foundation brush started shedding its hairs and also fell off its wooden stick.</li>
            <li> The brushes are nice but the bag that the brushes came in had a very strong (disgusting) odor.  </li>
            <li> A little hot glue fixed it though.</li>
            <li> The smaller, eyeshadow-type brushes are actually quite large and the face brushes are on the smaller side of what I am used to.  </li>
            <li> My only real gripe is the huge lettering on the handles its not attractive.</li>
            <li> i will definitely repurchase these as a gift for someone or even for myself to replace my old brushes.</li>
            <li> They have no smell after you wash them, and barely shed.</li>
            <li> After being washed it was barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast also, got them 4 days before expected arrival date.</li>
            <li> they are too puffy, pretty big, not delicate, not easy to work with</li>
            <li> /&gt;They do have a slight smell that you may want to wash off before your first use.</li>
            <li> Amazon LLC&lt;br /&gt;Delivered: 4 days after order dategreat, but they are pretty similar to each other.  </li>
            <li> The smaller brushes are also very dense and like mini kabukis which I find a little more difficult for eye make up - their just a bit too large for my taste.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t experience what other reviews said mines came 1 not broken 2 not smelly</li>
            <li> The picture to the right of the brushes with blush &amp; shadow on them is of the same 2 brushes just after wiping them off on a tissue with a little alcohol (not washed with soap &amp; water).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The picture to the right of the brushes with blush &amp; shadow on them is of the same 2 brushes just after wiping them off on a tissue with a little alcohol (not washed with soap &amp; water).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Looks just as expected &amp; very soft!</li>
            <li> nothing a little hot glue can&#x27;t fix.  </li>
            <li> When you wash them make sure to dry them with the bristles pointing down as water seeping down into the brush can loosen the glue</li>
            <li> The only thing is that I wish they were a little more firm</li>
            <li> When I first got them, they did smell like marker but after a few washes the smell went away.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised they did not dry over night even after squeezing them out with a dry bamboo paper towel.  </li>
            <li> The only complaints that I have is that when I did wash them it took them a long time to dry and they absorb quite a bit of your product but not too much.</li>
            <li> the delivery was less than 2 weeks and the brushes r very go quality</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to wait 2 days for a complete air dry which can be done over the weekends.</li>
            <li> The products are lack luster given in my first few weeks of use, 5 of the brushes broke given the adhesive holding the brush handle and brush tip is low quality.</li>
            <li> The smaller brushes are a little large for my eyes</li>
            <li> Only reason it&#x27;s not 5 stars is because brushes had a very harsh smell when first opened bag.</li>
            <li> and I did notice a little tiny bit of shedding, and by shedding I mean I lost maybe 5 hairs (from the flat top kabuki) in the month</li>
            <li> May just be me but for the price it was right to at least try them.</li>
            <li> I only really like the large kabucki round and angled and from the small ones</li>
            <li> They are soft and do the job extremely well..</li>
            <li> Other than that, I was surprised by the quality.  </li>
            <li> When I opened my brushes last night, as many other consumers have written, they smelled pretty bad.</li>
            <li> The eye shadow brushes are a little larger for my liking but that is just my personal preference because I have smaller lids, but they are fantastic and the price is unbelievable!</li>
            <li> I usually purchase name brand brushes but these although they are so low in price really work well.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because they were so reasonably priced</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when ordering because I wanted a new set of brushes but wasnt willing to spend that much and</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft, yet firm enough to put on liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> I have not used these for an extended period of time, so I cannot speak on how long they last.  </li>
            <li> Havent stop using thw flat buffer brush since i got it for blending my foundation.</li>
            <li> Loved the brushes, my only complaint is that there is a weird powder that comes out.</li>
            <li> The big ones in this set are fine, but the finer four are completely useless.</li>
            <li> I had never used the flat brush or any of these size/type brushes up until now!  </li>
            <li> Really smelled alote like spray paint thats the only complaint i have</li>
            <li> I did not need expensive brushes to Instruct a course with, this was just what I needed, and they are even better than I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so soft yet firm enough for the job.  </li>
            <li> they are so soft but still firm enough to blend make out.</li>
            <li> The only downfall would be the handle keeps coming loose</li>
            <li> I was at Ulta a few days ago and spent some time at the IT cosmetics brush display, these brushes are so similar to those in quality that I would not be surprised if they are the same manufacturer.</li>
            <li> they are very well put together hardly any shedding</li>
            <li> This brushes are not good quality the come apart the first use</li>
            <li> Not as big as I expected.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before making my purchase and some customers described them as having a strange smell.</li>
            <li> And they came a day earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Strange smell</li>
            <li> and the size is a lot smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> firm yet soft bristles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the brushes for a month or less and there already falling apart, the brush head falling off the wooden handle.</li>
            <li> The small brushes are bigger than expected, but they are really soft</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had this happen before with other brushed.</li>
            <li> Overall, I do like the set as backup for when my other brushes are being wash.</li>
            <li> Only a little... Just wish that they came in different colors!</li>
            <li> I washed the brushes, let them dry, and the smell was gone.</li>
            <li> However, it is only a few types of brushes but multiples of the same one.  </li>
            <li> I even went so far as to hang them upside-down to make sure water wouldn&#x27;t sit in the metal base of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;3)  </li>
            <li> I have all MAC brushes but couldn&#x27;t afford to buy every single brush that I needed and decided to buy this as a backup.  </li>
            <li> Soft and firm eye brushes little bit big</li>
            <li> I feel like the small brushes are too soft for crease and brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush that broke felt loose upon opening it</li>
            <li> Handles came loose, ‚Äãbut</li>
            <li> The tops on some of them are loose.</li>
            <li> I just knocked off a star because the shapes of the brushes are barely different (except for the pointy one) and the eye brushes are a little too big and fluffy for my Asian eyes.</li>
            <li> turned the water or my white towels black while they were drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> days after I purchased these brushes, the price was $3.79 less than what I paid for them from the same seller.  </li>
            <li> days after I purchased these brushes, the price was $3.79 less than what I paid for them from the same seller.  </li>
            <li> I was wary at first because of the low price, but after reading the reviews I figured I would take a chance.</li>
            <li> The only thing is sometimes hair falls but not a lot just 3 strans or less.</li>
            <li> Only bad thing is the strong odor smells like spray paint had to wash them twice one with baking soda to get rid of the odor.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for a little over 2 months and use them daily.</li>
            <li> I do wish the smaller brushes were a little thicker and had some sort of writing on them</li>
            <li> The eye brushes seem a little big</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before I bought them and many people were saying how they smelled so bad until they were washed.</li>
            <li> These brushes have a strange smell and the small ones are too big for eye makeup and it flakes...</li>
            <li> I never really write a review</li>
            <li> I have wasted them and I will glue the handle back on.</li>
            <li> In addition, the item arrived faster than I had expected.</li>
            <li> The small brushes are just tiny version of the larger brushes and have been pretty useless for me.</li>
            <li> A few of them broke shortly after</li>
            <li> absolutely NO shedding.  </li>
            <li> After giving them a rough wash TWICE, the smell went away.</li>
            <li> As soon as I opened the package, one of the brushes had come apart at the center.</li>
            <li> A small artificial smell when you get them, but after use it goes away very quickly!</li>
            <li> A little trimming and grooming was necessary for some rogue hairs on the other brushes as well.</li>
            <li> There was a very faint smell when opening as each brush was individually wrapped but quickly disappeared.  </li>
            <li> Certainly not the case for me.</li>
            <li> but I expected a little more out of the smaller brushes :(</li>
            <li> Other than the handles ripping off I have nothing bad to say about these brushes :)</li>
            <li> I previously had been using a MAC stippling brush that was black with white tips like these and</li>
            <li> After washing it with liquid soap, I laid them down to dry and the smell went away.</li>
            <li> In any case, I&#x27;ve used quite a few brushes in my day, from high-priced to average, and these just simply ROCK!</li>
            <li> And for such a cheap price, you&#x27;d be crazy not to get these brushes!</li>
            <li> The small brushes are also weird shaped that aren&#x27;t very useful save for one.</li>
            <li> My only negative is that it takes forever to dry the face brushes.  </li>
            <li> so soft but...  not good quality</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical</li>
            <li> says since I&#x27;m a prime member not sure about regular shipping though.</li>
            <li> Other than that they&#x27;re just like the pictures.</li>
            <li> and although i have already gotten the Hang of it, it was a bit difficult at first.</li>
            <li> will agree with a lot of other reviews...there was an odor....reminded me of fingernail polish.</li>
            <li> I cleaned them anyway, prior to use, because that should be done with any brushes, but I&#x27;m not sure why some couldn&#x27;t rid them of the smell???</li>
            <li> I believe that is due to being stored in their plastic bag you receive them in.</li>
            <li> Other than that, no problems.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The brushes all perform extremely well and are well made.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t even touched my other brushes since purchasing these</li>
            <li> not exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Too big for eye make up, too small for face.</li>
            <li> I know there are other reviews on here</li>
            <li> Not sure what I&#x27;ll do with them since I already unwrapped them and hemmed and hawed about actually using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t have a odor like other reviewers had mentioned.</li>
            <li> I knew from reading other reviews that when they came in, they&#x27;d have a smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m the only one experiencing this issue but the handles are coming off my brushes..</li>
            <li> I did not have any problems with odors like you would find with other brushes and the price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered other brushes off of amazon</li>
            <li> The brushes came as expected however after washing it a few time to get the strong unpleasant smell .</li>
            <li> I do wish they came with a card telling you what to use what for, as I&#x27;m very inexperienced with makeup.</li>
            <li> Im sad that these didn&#x27;t work for me, they did a great job, just too frustrated with them breaking on me.</li>
            <li> but the bristles are not very full.</li>
            <li> Compared to other very high end expensive brushes I&#x27;ve gotten before, these work just as well.</li>
            <li> It uses way less product than my other brush.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush set in late December 2014, I haven&#x27;t used the brushes often since purchasing them and since the time of the purchase several of the brushes have had the handle fall off.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Not worth 15 dollars.</li>
            <li> I bought this set back in April and it is now late July</li>
            <li> They are so thick and soft that it doesn&#x27;t matter losing a few!</li>
            <li> The only thing that  sucks is they start breaking off the wood after a little while other</li>
            <li> Even laying your brushes down can cause that risk (I recommend standing them up against a wall</li>
            <li> As mentioned in other reviews, I was removing the plastic protector bags off of each brush when 2 of the brushes fell apart!  </li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft, so applying powder make-up is difficult as you have to push the brush harder on your skin to see the make-up applied.</li>
            <li> They do have a slight smell when you get them</li>
            <li> It took four washes to get the smell out, although they still have a slight odor.</li>
            <li> The types included are a bit odd.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see how these are any less quality.</li>
            <li> &amp;  I seriously use just about ever brush on a daily basis!!!!!</li>
            <li> Yes there was a slight chemical smell as well, nothing a wash couldn&#x27;t fix/nothing</li>
            <li> They come in a black faux leather bag.</li>
            <li> so I immediately washed them with half a cup of done and a table spoon of veggie oil.</li>
            <li> Immediately after receiving them all of the black ends came off of my brushes.</li>
            <li> They lost half of their bristles.</li>
            <li> hers is black and gold and mine</li>
            <li> are black and sliver.</li>
            <li> There were less brushes and a lot less</li>
            <li> The brush angles are also not very pronounced, so if you are looking for small brushes for intricate detail, I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Not cool.</li>
            <li> , I spent less than I would have on elf brushes!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are not built to last, I would not recommend these brushes and am disappointed in the quality of the product as a whole.</li>
            <li> The material doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, as some other brushes have in the past.</li>
            <li> Besides the powder face brush, I did lose maybe 3-5 little hairs.</li>
            <li> i like the little angled ones.</li>
            <li> the do come off the handle but a little glue</li>
            <li> Little to no shedding when I&#x27;ve washed these babies</li>
            <li> but once you wash them the glue becomes weak and the wooden shafts come off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had them for about a month now and little to no shedding.</li>
            <li> Received as promised, smelled a little</li>
            <li> Handle is a little shorter then what I am used to</li>
            <li> Its very hard to use the brushed without the ends on them.</li>
            <li> They are just plain black handles.</li>
            <li> As other reviews mentioned, they smell pretty badly, but after soaking them in shampoo and water, the smell disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased 4 sets already and they never let me down!</li>
            <li> They also arrived earlier than expected, but came with a weird smell..</li>
            <li> The price point is fantastic and frankly I was afraid they would be poor quality.</li>
            <li> but after soaking the handle for a few hours the smell went away...</li>
            <li> I use the round one for powder foundation.</li>
            <li> Had them for a few weeks and haven&#x27;t shedded yet.</li>
            <li> I have a heavy hand so for the price</li>
            <li> and I wash it every few days</li>
            <li> One of my smaller brushes arrived broken in two and the bristles are all bent up.</li>
            <li> They still maintain their shape after they dried.</li>
            <li> but I just let them air out of the package for a few days.</li>
            <li> but I noticed after two washes a few of them started shedding specifically the foundation brush</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it everyday since I get this.</li>
            <li> Honestly, these are awful!  </li>
            <li> I am donating them after a few uses, would not recommend at all.</li>
            <li> Was missing a brush.</li>
            <li> A few broke within days of receiving them</li>
            <li> They do have a slight smell, but they work almost as well as my MAC brushes!</li>
            <li> i use a bitt less foundation cause the brush works w. what their is !</li>
            <li> Took less than a week!</li>
            <li> But like I said, if you expected the smaller brushes to be smaller, they are not which really disappointed me.</li>
            <li> I would like a stiff angled brush.</li>
            <li> They are nothing like sigma and they SMELL so BAD that you can barely breathe when you open them.</li>
            <li> first and main thing is its STINKS do bad</li>
            <li> They smelled bad at first but after 2 days of airing them out the smell was gone.</li>
            <li> Forget about using the small ones for eye shadow, they&#x27;re too harsh and dint blend in the color</li>
            <li> The small ones are a little hard on my skin, they scratch sometimes.</li>
            <li> Very little shedding....</li>
            <li> I only wished I had seen these before I bought a set of expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not pleased.</li>
            <li> And I literally wash them everyday!</li>
            <li> I got them a few days late, along with some problems with the delivery.</li>
            <li> I usually buy sigma or Mac brushes</li>
            <li> Will update after a few uses!</li>
            <li> I am not sure if its the bristles or the handle - I washed them regardless.</li>
            <li> Compared to my first order these brushes disappointed me.</li>
            <li> Maybe I received a defective bunch, but I am not pleased at all.</li>
            <li> (small  brush  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re skeptical, just do it, they&#x27;re only $12!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a cosmotolgy major and sometimes finding brushes that aren&#x27;t extremely expensive but do the job at task are hard to find!</li>
            <li> I really was expecting to be somewhat disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Not one single thing wrong with these ...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to get a set of brushes from Sephora- but forking over $70-$100 was hard for me.</li>
            <li> Secondly , it&#x27;s hard for a makeup beginner to know which brush to use for application</li>
            <li> Not too hard not too soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> How hard would this have been to add...</li>
            <li> When the package arrived I noticed that at least 4 out of the 10makeup brushes were not glued.</li>
            <li> I gave this a four not because of the brushes but because of the late shipping.</li>
            <li> I will update this review if my impression changes negatively.</li>
            <li> so I washed them and air them out and that the smell slowly went away</li>
            <li> My wife bought these and as soon as she opened them a horrible and very powerful smell emerged from the brushes.  </li>
            <li> hairs started coming off but IDC its just for mean time</li>
            <li> I use them everyday!!</li>
            <li> They also don&#x27;t shed hairs like other inexpensive brushes tend to, nor do they have that weird chemical-y smell that some do.</li>
            <li> I really recomended , i was a little afraid of getting a bad quallity product.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t notice an unpleasant smell in reference to what quite a few of the other customer reviews have mentioned.</li>
            <li> The only thing is when i got it, i smells really bad... almost like spray paint..</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t smell bad, only the bag they came in smelled like paint.</li>
            <li> washed them one by one - and even turned the bathroom fan on in the process because I know the chemical fumes are not good to breathe</li>
            <li> Missing eyeliner brush and bag, I guess I&#x27;ve received a fake set as stated on the picture?</li>
            <li> Not good quality brakes apart</li>
            <li> I purchased these after seeing a You tube video from a girl raving about them and saying they were comparable if not superior to Sigma brushes.</li>
            <li> They are so soft &amp; look very expensive!</li>
            <li> but it is hard to tell the difference!</li>
            <li> They are starting to shed :(.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brushes are very thick</li>
            <li> The brushes are poor quality not dense at all.</li>
            <li> The smell of synthetic materials and disgusting plastic was a too much.</li>
            <li> na make her skin react or give her a rash or even something worse.</li>
            <li> Poorly made.</li>
            <li> Also, none of my handles have broken as a some people reported--</li>
            <li> I have not had any issues with any of them falling apart or leaving behind hairs.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers said they smelled bad.</li>
            <li> I seriously don&#x27;t apply my makeup without them!  </li>
            <li> For the price they did flake a little but not as bad as I thought they would.</li>
            <li> /&gt;YOU KNOW when the company puts a note in the packaging saying the brushes will smell like chemicals because they&#x27;ve been trapped in a ziplock bag that you&#x27;re nose is not exaggerating and that you didn&#x27;t just get a bad batch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If your looking for something to practice on and dont want to spend money on expensive brushes</li>
            <li> BUT not even as expensive.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong..</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had two brushes break within a week.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong purchasing this set.&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: Upon arrival, the brushes smelled like Sharpie markers.</li>
            <li> so im guessing they are fake</li>
            <li> Before ordering these I had purchased two expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with these brushes</li>
            <li> Brushes are poor quality!</li>
            <li> Was I wrong.  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately after using them for about 3 weeks they began to fall apart.</li>
            <li> That sort of turned me off and uncomfortable using them.  </li>
            <li> when we got them they did have a weird smell even after washing them</li>
            <li> Came with a weird smell but the sellers put a note saying to wash them and it will go away.</li>
            <li> For $11 how can you really go wrong?</li>
            <li> They feel so strange, the bristles are almost slimy and the smell is terrible.  </li>
            <li> : I would say the worst part about these brushes is the glue that holds the metal part to the black handle.</li>
            <li> Weak!!</li>
            <li> i am afraid of using them</li>
            <li> She never even tried them as she was afraid their gon</li>
            <li> Very poor quality, the bristles fall out, its just all around bad quality</li>
            <li> The scent was very faint, but I thought I&#x27;d add that I&#x27;m the review.</li>
            <li> These brushes smell like chemicals so bad that I have to return them.</li>
            <li> The smell wasn&#x27;t necessarily a bad smell</li>
            <li> They did however, smell just as bad as everyone said.</li>
            <li> Bag stinks so badly!  </li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was greatly disappointed</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in my brush set.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even use them anymore :(</li>
            <li> They just fall apart &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> it smells.. something very artificial.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing</li>
            <li> but these were so bad that I had to!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> ( Those are the worst )</li>
            <li> When I just got them the smell was horrible!</li>
            <li> Horrible brushes.</li>
            <li> and they are shedding horribly.</li>
            <li> Absolutely awful.</li>
            <li> Terrible, chemical smell.</li>
            <li> They have a terrible smell to them</li>
            <li> The smell of off gassing on the product is terrible.</li>
            <li> Worst brush set ever !</li>
            <li> The brushes smelled horrible like a chemical smell when I took them out of the bag.</li>
            <li> They do smell horrible from the paint</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Much better quality than expected.</li>
            <li> Very soft brushes. Blends foundation very well as well as the eyeshadows brushes. The only thing about these brushes they are almost all the same. There&#x27;s two foundation brushes, two eyeshadow brushes. They just look the same to me. I guess they&#x27;re good if you&#x27;re too lazy to wash your brushes all the time you can always just grab a clean one.. Other then that love these brushes. Plus cheap too!!</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and the bristles are durable, but the metal detaches from the handle VERY quickly. It&#x27;s nothing a bit of superglue won&#x27;t take care of, but I&#x27;ve had brushes for years that have never separated.</li>
            <li> the delivery was less than 2 weeks and the brushes r very go quality I will came back to do an update review in a month. thank you</li>
            <li> If your looking for something to practice on and dont want to spend money on expensive brushes just yet then this is what you buy ive had the brushes for about a week and one of them came apart! LISTEN to the reviews they are CHEAPLY made the brush came apart from the silver part and i could see inside it looks like a glob of gorrila glue inside! They are not bad other than that. they dont shed at all and they blend very well. I have no complaints other than their cheaply made and i know theyll give out within months and ill buy more cheap ones and more cheap ones until i feel im at the stage to get expensive brushes and their is a difference between expensive and cheap brushes.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought these. My foundation goes on flawlessly and looks a million times better than what I was doing before. Wish I&#x27;d bought these sooner actually. Quality is quite good.</li>
            <li> perfect quality and amazing price:-) Thank you</li>
            <li> The first time I opened the package, it smelled strongly of glue. After washing it with liquid soap, I laid them down to dry and the smell went away. Love these brushes!</li>
            <li> AMAZINNGGGG! FAST SHIPPING! OBBSESSED!</li>
            <li> These brushes are really quite soft! I am enjoying them a great deal. The eyeshadow brushes are a bit on the large side, but I find them ideal for blending across the lid. The material doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, as some other brushes have in the past. I will definitely be buying another set in the future. Thank you for an awesome product.</li>
            <li> i received my brushes in pieces and no amount of super glue held them together, i bought two sets and both came un glued on arrival.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes and the price is excellent</li>
            <li> got the brushes they had a real strong scent. make sure you wash them.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes I&#x27;ll be buying more as bday gifts. Soft bristles which I love I don&#x27;t like to scratch my face when applying make up bc it makes me break out. Learn what brush does what so you can truly see the benefits. Flawless application! A must buy!</li>
            <li> They. Are. So. Soft. and get the job done real good. Perfect for anyone who wants to try out being a makeup artist and then upgrading to a more expensive brand.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to receive these but right when I took off the plastic covering all the fibers started coming out. So disappointed. I really wanted to enjoy these..</li>
            <li> For this price, it&#x27;s really nice!!  I&#x27;ve bought numerous brushes from Sephora (and for 4x the price) and the quality of these are pretty comparable.  I&#x27;m not a make-up artist so these do the daily basic tricks that I need.</li>
            <li> Great quality for the money. Will buy over and over again!</li>
            <li> Really soft brushes!!</li>
            <li> OMG!!!!!! These brushes are so amazing I&#x27;ve had them for about a week now and have been using them everyday since then and noticed how easily they apply makeup to my face. Also i don&#x27;t have to use as much to cover my problem areas because the brush gives extra coverage when you stipple them. i haven&#x27;t had any issues with shedding hairs( Those are the worst ) especially when they get all over your face when applying foundation. These are very good quality brushes for the price they were sold for. i will definitely repurchase these as a gift for someone or even for myself to replace my old brushes.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes, they are so soft just like my Sigma brushes. Such a good dupe. At first I was skeptical but I&#x27;m so glad I decided to purchase  these . Will buy these again in the future.</li>
            <li> These are perfect. I&#x27;ve looked and looked for something for my daughters and these will be great gifts for them for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised! Very nice</li>
            <li> Love them! EXACTLY like Sigma! BUT not even as expensive. Love love love.</li>
            <li> They feel great and hold product well but they to do shed. However, for the price they&#x27;re a great buy.</li>
            <li> A perfect set of brushes to add to your makeup kit. The return on this investment is WELL worth the money lol Im not all about labels so I cant even tell you what brand these come from but it doesnt even matter...The set is very versatile in the shapes of the bristles and are very effective in helping you achieve your looks. Great buy! Thank You!!</li>
            <li> I love it no more words :)</li>
            <li> fab!! Just got these brushes dilivered early witch was even better tried them out straight away love!! Soft and firm eye brushes little bit big but I don&#x27;t mind I did get one or 2 hairs from the brushes but that was it  defo recommend these brushes.... Weak!!</li>
            <li> Great product. And great. Customer service, one of my brushes was damaged and when i emailed them i got an answer within hours and got the help i needed. Thank you. I will be buying another set soon for my sister:)</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased. For this price i really think you are getting what you pay for, which is a great deal. The only brushes i have to compare them to are my real techniques brushes and I&#x27;d definitely say they are comparable. The smaller brushes are a little large for my eyes but i have smaller hooded eyes. I imagine if you have larger eyes then they&#x27;d be fine. I do love all the brushes though. They do have a slight smell when you get them but mine wasn&#x27;t strong at all, a wash with some baby shampoo will take care of it. Overall I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Amazing!!! Great quality I even brought more as gifts.</li>
            <li> YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!! They do look like sigma kabuki brushes ALOT. However, they&#x27;re too soft!! wayyy more than what you need your brushes to be; this makes blending foundation or whatever much harder!!&lt;br /&gt;nevertheless, speaking about the price, they&#x27;re perfect and I will recommend it to my friends (:</li>
            <li> These are fantastic..love them..very well made..and they don&#x27;t shed</li>
            <li> These brushes are fantastic!!! The price is a total STEAL!!!!</li>
            <li> They arrived super quickly and feel just like sigma brushes. The reason for a 4 not 5 star is that the handles are gold instead of gray, some brushes may need a very light trim of the extra hairs, and it smells like glue (but you should always give brushes a wash before using them for the first time anyway).&lt;br /&gt;For the price this is absolutely amazing and i will definitely be repurchasing this :)</li>
            <li> you really get what you paid for. The brushes are poor quality not dense at all. They are beginning to shed and I haven&#x27;t even use them yet.</li>
            <li> Loveee this brush set. I was a little skeptical when ordering because I wanted a new set of brushes but wasnt willing to spend that much and these are totally worth the price. I was really surprised the material is nice and brushes are really soft. As far as shipping goes I got them in two says since I&#x27;m a prime member not sure about regular shipping though.</li>
            <li> the brushes have a very strong smell of chemicals (kind of like paint thinner and glue) i am afraid of using them i might have to wash them before i used them. they came from china which  i did not realized that until after i bought them.</li>
            <li> First impression: omg that plastic smell!&lt;br /&gt;A day later: Where have these brushes been all my life? After washing the brushes the plastic smell went away totally and all I was left with were super soft really great brushes. Definitely worth it, fantastic value! A great alternative to some of the expensive brushes out there.</li>
            <li> The quality is amazing!  Great dupe for anyone who was thinking of buying the Sigma brushes!  Definitely recommended</li>
            <li> They are fine for the price but too big to cover my eyes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for its price. l hoped that there is a bag with them.</li>
            <li> Awesome for the price</li>
            <li> These brushes are in my opinion the best u can get for the value. They are actually better than Mac brushes! I have paid up to $30 for one makeup brush and the quality was not as good as this whole set. I only wished I had seen these before I bought a set of expensive ones. I will only buy these from here on out.</li>
            <li> These are really great brushes. They have no smell after you wash them, and barely shed.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! Absolutely so soft, durable, and priced greatly!</li>
            <li> Im in love with these bruses</li>
            <li> Smell like paint. One brush had like glue stick in it. Other than that they&#x27;re just like the pictures.</li>
            <li> Totally loving these brushes!!!!!! Super soft!!!! The only thing is when i got it, i smells really bad... almost like spray paint.. but after soaking the handle for a few hours the smell went away... but overall these are awesome!!!</li>
            <li> So my make up instructor has her sigma brush collection. I compared mine with hers and guess what? There was no difference at all, except for the price that she paid for hers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love em!</li>
            <li> Love them I love how they apply both liquid and powder foundation also love the way it picks up eyeshadow powder would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful brushes! They didn&#x27;t smell bad, only the bag they came in smelled like paint. It&#x27;s such a good deal for these brushes since they are super soft and sturdy.</li>
            <li> When I recieved these, they did have somewhat of a paint smell, but it went away withing a day. They are very soft and apply and pick up product well. The smaller brushes were great for detailing and blending out concealer. While I was overall happy with my purchase, I am giving it 4 stars because two of the larger face brushes fell apart after the third time I washed them.</li>
            <li> I loved the brush I read alot about the strong odor so what I did is opened them aired them out and the odor went away I love them they are great quality a little bit more smaller than expected but great</li>
            <li> They are amazing. I used to judge coverage based on the quality or brand of the foundations but I was wrong.. It&#x27;s the application! These brushes do a flawless application. I use the round one for powder foundation. They are dense and don&#x27;t shed. The only thing that could make them better was if the handles had a better paint but it&#x27;s ok, it hasn&#x27;t chipped or anything. They also arrived in gold instead of silver but I liked them even more when I saw them.</li>
            <li> great soft and dense brushes, very comparable to higher end brands!</li>
            <li> Amazing amazing amazing . I used all these brushes but one !! They are soft and perfect ! I spent so much money on Mac and other brushes but these are the best brushes I had !!!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice brushes for the price def reccommend!!! the texture is awesome and shipping was way faster than expected!!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful quality brush but the handle came off. I had no shedding buy after 2 washes the handle came off. The shipping was also delayed. That&#x27;s why it got a 4 not 5.</li>
            <li> YOU NEED THESE amazing quality for the price perfect for foundation and the eye brushes are wonderful for blending eyeshadow i love em! Ive had them for a while and purchased the rosegold set for my sister</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft. When I first got them, they did smell like marker but after a few washes the smell went away. They remind me of some of the Sigma brushes but way more affordable!</li>
            <li> Perfect for blending creme foundations!!!! Will be ordering several more sets.</li>
            <li> Received them on time. They&#x27;re very dense but super soft. Other than the fact the chemical smell is super (SUPER) strong. It took four washes to get the smell out, although they still have a slight odor. Overall pretty good brushes. I&#x27;m still playing with them.  Update: As of today 2 of the large facial brushes are not use able. The heads came off. Two others are not stable. I&#x27;ve always made sure to wash them properly. I&#x27;ve never had this happen before with other brushed.</li>
            <li> These brushes are soft and feel great. I am very impressed they seem high end. Kuddos to this seller.</li>
            <li> Some of brushes for the face are great but the eye ones seem cheaper and are shaped funny</li>
            <li> I love love love this brushes (especially the flat Kabuki brush). I use it almost every day. The brush was exactly as shown in the pictures. They had a bit of a smell to them so I washed them before use.  No shedding after washing. They are soft and very very excellent for blending. I use the flat Kabuki brush in the stippling motion and my foundation is flawless. I will be purchasing another set for my professional makeup kit as well.</li>
            <li> They work great, I use them daily, but they break so easily!</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes in January and 6 months later they&#x27;re still amazing! These brushes are amazing for contour. it&#x27;s been 6 months and I&#x27;m still impressed. Such an amazing buy for an ultra cheap price!</li>
            <li> Have paid more for one brush that I didn&#x27;t like as much.  Great value and nice set.</li>
            <li> Not as big as I expected. It would still take you a while to use it with foundation. But it has good quality, just a little bit small.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised at the quality of these brushes.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  Excellent price and variety!</li>
            <li> They feel flimsy,  although they are cheap and they do work fine the handles kind of break off after maybe 4 to 5 uses of it, if you&#x27;re a freelance makeup artist like myself and you are hesitant to buy expensive make up brushes then this is a good product to use on your customers just like I do</li>
            <li> The best brushes I have bought. The brushes are very thick and I haven&#x27;t had any of the brissels fall out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the face brushes to blend my foundation, their not as dense as sigma but oh my! They blend my foundation soooo flawless for the price it&#x27;s a must have for anyone ... Haven&#x27;t washed them tho! So I dnt know how their performance with hold up after a bath...</li>
            <li> Very nice brushes for the price! Had them for a few weeks and haven&#x27;t shedded yet. The types included are a bit odd. Not exactly what I was expecting but just make sure you look closely at the pics.</li>
            <li> So so so so soooooo!!! Freaking happy with this purchase... I ordered another set just in case lol.. They have been washed 2 times already and still no shedding! üòçüòçüòçüòç definitely recommend.!!</li>
            <li> Blends well, full and firm, picks up color well... No wierd smell</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing , they&#x27;re so soft and i have no problem with shedding and thats good.</li>
            <li> THIS BRUSHES ARE AWESOME!!!!!! I being using this for over 2 months. When I just got them the smell was horrible! HO.RRI.BLE. I think anybody that get this has to wash them first. After a strong wash with baby soap they were great.</li>
            <li> item as described, blends and does its job</li>
            <li> The best brushes out there for small amount of money.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes....fast shipping, great quality. Already bought a second set for a gift.</li>
            <li> These brushes are so nice and soft. So far, I am really liking them. The package came right away.</li>
            <li> Really nice brushes. Really soft and applies makeup very nicely. It did come with a fairly strong odor, but I just washed them really good and it hasn&#x27;t been a problem at all. Good product for the price</li>
            <li> Great makeup set for low price. I got one for myself and one as a gift! easy to clean as well.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! I have been using them for about a month now and they have no disappointed me yet! Still trying to figure out the best ones for eye shadow but I always get tons of pigment no matter which ones I use. Great buy! Love them</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush set in late December 2014, I haven&#x27;t used the brushes often since purchasing them and since the time of the purchase several of the brushes have had the handle fall off.</li>
            <li> Amazing quality brushes. I&#x27;m a makeup artist and I&#x27;ve had my share of high end and inexpensive brushes and these are a perfect mix of both! The flat top kabuki brush in this set is a exact dupe of the sigma f80 brush! I get use out of every brush in this set ..I purchased 4 sets already and they never let me down! They also wash beautifully and have little to no fall out ! Perfect set to apply foundation and for cream contouring! Eyeshadow brushes beautiful as well. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Very soft, great brushes, very affordable love this brush set</li>
            <li> I have not used brushes yet but they seem very nice and good quality.</li>
            <li> The brushes are amazing! They are really dense and soft. Loved them!</li>
            <li> SO HAPPY I found these! They are awesome!!!&#x27;</li>
            <li> They fell apart instantly</li>
            <li> Good quality! perfect!</li>
            <li> these brushes work really great.</li>
            <li> U get what u pay for its good for a while&lt;br /&gt;The hairs started coming off but IDC its just for mean time</li>
            <li> I was super nervous about ordering these because they were so cheap! But when i got them in the mail I couldn&#x27;t have been more satisfied! They&#x27;re amazingly soft and sturdy. So happy i ordered them!</li>
            <li> Horrible brushes. I&#x27;ve had them for 2 days and have only used the 3 big brushes twice and they are shedding horribly. I wish I could return them!</li>
            <li> they work like brushes are supposed to work, very soft and nice feeling on my face. no weird smell or any of the brush hairs falling off. over all good brushes (:</li>
            <li> I was absolutely amazed at the quality of these brushes! They are very dense, soft brushes. They do have a slight smell to them upon arrival, but I always clean new brushes before use. And the price....how can you beat it! Very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Brushes are nice and sturdy. They are great.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect for this price but the brushes are great!  I did not notice any funny smell like stated in other reviews.  Brushes are very soft and blend like a dream!  Shipping was fast and quality is far beyond price point on these.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes but the funny thing is this is the exact same brush set I purchased from BH Cosmetics minus the BH name on the brush set.</li>
            <li> I love these. I did notice the chemical smell that others spoke of when I first opened them, but that quickly dissipated as soon as I had them out of the packaging. Each brush is gentle on the face but firm enough to do the job. No shedding so far and they&#x27;re a good weight. I would recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love these  brushes. Just as soft and durable as high ends.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!! They are so soft !!!! And my makeup is flawless after ! Will be ordering more !</li>
            <li> These brushes are so soft and pick up color really well. I&#x27;m so impressed!! Some of these are better than my $30 MAC brushes. Customer service is awesome too.</li>
            <li> Great little set of brushes, I just wish that the brushes came with instructions as to what each one is for. I&#x27;m pretty new to this makeup thing and although i have already gotten the Hang of it, it was a bit difficult at first.</li>
            <li> I never really write a review but these were so bad that I had to! My wife bought these and as soon as she opened them a horrible and very powerful smell emerged from the brushes.  I swear they smelled poisonous! The smell of synthetic materials and disgusting plastic was a too much. She never even tried them as she was afraid their gonna make her skin react or give her a rash or even something worse. Don&#x27;t use cheap stuff on your face like really just don&#x27;t. She would rather pay the same amount and get one brush then these cheap things.</li>
            <li> So far so good I only used like 2 or 3 of them but I didn&#x27;t experience what other reviews said mines came 1 not broken 2 not smelly but like I said so far so good in I have a heavy hand so for the price the are ggggrrrrrreeeeeaaaaattttttt</li>
            <li> They work very well and blend very nicely I love them</li>
            <li> One of the brushes fell apart just when I got it but the other ones are fine. It does have a strong smell to it firs but after u wash it it&#x27;s fine..I&#x27;m in they are good for that price..</li>
            <li> Easy for apply any  make up product</li>
            <li> Very soft brushes. Loved the price. Just what I needed.</li>
            <li> Really good kit. Good quality and finishing</li>
            <li> Great brushes but created an allergy reaction for me.  May just be me but for the price it was right to at least try them.</li>
            <li> Great brushes escpecially for the price.  I use them everyday!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these brushes! I am a cosmetologist/ makeup artist and they are every bit as good as the brushes from sephora, Mac etc!</li>
            <li> I love them!! shipping was really fas</li>
            <li> Yes, they are soft! Only good quality. They are nothing like sigma and they SMELL so BAD that you can barely breathe when you open them. It&#x27;s like the painted the handles right before they sent them out! They absorb all make up and are cheaply made. Definitely won&#x27;t be using these.</li>
            <li> These brushes are very good quality for the price! They are ideal for precision when contouring, highlighting, and applying blush. They are not so much for the total face, because they are so dense. They are also very soft. When I first opened them I did smell a strong type of a chemical smell, but I washed them in baby soap and the smell went away. They withstood the washing and I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these make up brushes! They came with a very strong chemical smell, but I washed them with some soap and olive oil and let them dry over night and the smell was completely gone! They are very soft and easy to use, and made very well! :) I definitely recommend them!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! I use the flat top one to apply my foundation and it looks like I used airbrush makeup. I use one of the small brushes for my concealer and it blends beautifully. I recommend this brushes to anyone looking for some high quality cheap brushes, these are definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate these brushes. I received them in one day. And the quality of these brushes are awesome. They are soft and the make of them I can tell are great. I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> The brushes smelled like paint when I took them out of the package and one of the handles fell off. I have wasted them and I will glue the handle back on. Not as happy as I&#x27;d like</li>
            <li> Extremely pleased with these brushes! They are soft! Also, the bristles are still intact. I had concern with them being so inexpensive, but they are perfect!</li>
            <li> These brushes smell like chemicals so bad that I have to return them. I cannot in good conscience use these on my face.</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes! They all work amazing! My least favorite is probably the large pointed foundation brush, but even then its very good. STOP WHAT YOU ARE DOING AND GO BUT THESE NOW!!! haha..... you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> These are really good brushes. These brushes impressed me. They&#x27;re very soft and I&#x27;m really surprised at the quality. Definitely recommend these.</li>
            <li> When they are opened they have a very strong factory smell. I washed them when I opened them. Just used my dove soap bar and warm water. The smell went away for the most part. They are full size brushes and I would recommend them :)</li>
            <li> I love these.  Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> All my friends are jealous of my brushes and the great rice I got them for! Mine were put together quite well and I love having brushes for all aspects of my makeup now!</li>
            <li> I have received the brushes, they were shipped in a timely manner and were packaged nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent quality brushes - a must have for your collection. I will order again.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t get the directions for the brushes in the package so the seller was kind enough to email them to me right away.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much for all of your help and I am looking forward to using my brushes :)&lt;br /&gt;SATISFIED CUSTOMER!!!</li>
            <li> I love the brushes the way it applys. The foundation i just get scared to wash them üòÅ</li>
            <li> These brushes were falling apart right when I got them and the quality is not that great.</li>
            <li> There grate nice and soft love them</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had two brushes break within a week. One broke the day after the product arrived.</li>
            <li> Very soft nice quality!!!</li>
            <li> These brushes have a strange smell and the small ones are too big for eye makeup and it flakes...</li>
            <li> These are great brushes! Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I did not need expensive brushes to Instruct a course with, this was just what I needed, and they are even better than I expected for the price. I may purchase a couple more sets to have on hand for my other classes..They are soft and do the job extremely well..Kabuki has always come through with their products, and if they are properly and taken care of I am certain they will last awhile.</li>
            <li> When I received my brushes one broke as soon as I grabbed it. I guess you do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Lots of brushes for an excellent price.</li>
            <li> My first set of &amp;#34;Real&amp;#34; makeup brushes.  I feel like a professional makeup artist when there&#x27;re in my hand. :).  I love it!!!</li>
            <li> honestly, the brushes are almost all the same type (kabuki style) and 2 already fell off the stem.. but it&#x27;s good quality of the bristles for the price</li>
            <li> These are great brushes. Very soft and great variety. Smooth finish with make-up.</li>
            <li> Awesome, if your on a budget like myself i would recommend these brushes. The best bang for your buck and they are so soft. I am glad I read the other reviews and chose these. The salon also sent a nice little note for a very personalized touch and then followed up with an email great customer service prompt delivery. I couldn&#x27;t have expected better results with the whole product and process. Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely awful. Within a week 4 of these brushes became detached from the handle. Poorly made.</li>
            <li> Love these make up brushes I would recommend them</li>
            <li> High quality brushes ‚ù§Ô∏è just used them for blending my liquid foundation and applying powder contour which was great!</li>
            <li> Love it!!!! It was what I really was expecting.</li>
            <li> Each brush comes in its own individual package. They are soooo soft, especially the large face brushes. All in all, amazing quality at an amazing price. You can&#x27;t go wrong purchasing this set.&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: Upon arrival, the brushes smelled like Sharpie markers. The scent was very faint, but I thought I&#x27;d add that I&#x27;m the review. But there&#x27;s nothing a little wash can&#x27;t fix. :)</li>
            <li> These are great! amazing product!! i use the larger brushes for my foundation, blush, bronze and still have a couple extra to keep in my to go back. and the thin ones are great for blending. I high recommend them.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes. The only thing is the handles seem to wiggle and need to be reglued. But the quality in the bristles is just as good as buying the high priced ones. I hate a make-up artist tell me they were great brushes.</li>
            <li> Just loved how the brushes started searching from the stems just a few weeks after I bought them.</li>
            <li> The brushes on the pic weren&#x27;t exactly elegant I revived. I didn&#x27;t get an angle brush</li>
            <li> Seem to be nice but didn&#x27;t recieve the bag or eyeliner brush so im guessing they are fake</li>
            <li> I love these make up brushes. They work well. Other reviewers said they smelled bad. I didn&#x27;t experience that. Before ordering these I had purchased two expensive brushes. I don&#x27;t see how these are any less quality.</li>
            <li> Very nice brushes for the price! Would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> These brushes are sooo soft, apply product well, and WOW what a great bargain!&lt;br /&gt;I will agree with a lot of other reviews...there was an odor....reminded me of fingernail polish. BUT....after they were unpackaged an allowed to air out, the smell was completely gone within an hour. I cleaned them anyway, prior to use, because that should be done with any brushes, but I&#x27;m not sure why some couldn&#x27;t rid them of the smell??? In any case, I&#x27;ve used quite a few brushes in my day, from high-priced to average, and these just simply ROCK! If you are even thinking about buying these, don&#x27;t hesitate one second longer! I am going to order a couple more sets for backups! These are definitely worth the money and then some!</li>
            <li> Extremely happy with these brushes.  Synthetic brushes do not fill up with too much product and are easier to clean.  These brushes are soft, dense and each brush top is finished off nicely for blending and applying product.  I would definitely recommend them.  I have not used these for an extended period of time, so I cannot speak on how long they last.  The length of the brush handle is easy to work with as well, some Kabuki brushes are too short.  The foundation brush has become my favorite and I use it almost every day and I wash it every few days, it has held up nicely.</li>
            <li> The big blush or powder brush when&#x27;s first open hair was falling off...</li>
            <li> Excellent - Item delivered on time, was as described, great customer service</li>
            <li> There are no markings on the brushes. I have no idea what to use for what. They don&#x27;t pick up product well at all. I really don&#x27;t like them but I&#x27;m not going to bother to return them.</li>
            <li> I had an issue with the brush separating from the handles but I just put crazy glue on them and they are as good as new. These brushes are perfect I use them to apply my foundation, blush and eye-shadow. My makeup looks  flawless when I use these brushes.</li>
            <li> Best makeup brushes  I&#x27;ve  ever had!!</li>
            <li> Price was great and they are nice. I am happy with the brushes.</li>
            <li> Arrived very quick. Brushes looked very nice an worked well. Only reason it&#x27;s not 5 stars is because brushes had a very harsh smell when first opened bag. But left out overnight and smell went away! Great buy for the price especially.</li>
            <li> Great product and got here early. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> They work good, k8nda upset it wasnt the colors shown</li>
            <li> The smaller, eyeshadow-type brushes are actually quite large and the face brushes are on the smaller side of what I am used to.  No problem with shedding so far.</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes because buying them separately would&#x27;ve been much more pricey.  They&#x27;ve been the best brushes, super great for applying makeup.  They&#x27;re so soft yet firm enough for the job.  I seriously don&#x27;t apply my makeup without them!  I bought an extra set for my sister but haven&#x27;t been able to get them to her yet.  But I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;ll love them too.  I totally recommend this set!</li>
            <li> Waste of money! They all look JUST ALIKE.</li>
            <li> I love love love these!!! they are really great brushes I will continue to buy when needed!</li>
            <li> The small brushes are bigger than expected, but they are really soft</li>
            <li> The brushes do have a smell when they first arrived but it doesn&#x27;t stay, I think  its just because they are in plastic to protect them. They blend nicely. I bought them since they reminded me of other brushes that youtubers talk about and I enjoy these.</li>
            <li> i loved this product for the price.My order came before it was scheduled.</li>
            <li> Great brushes! So soft but nice and solid.</li>
            <li> You definitely get your moneys worth with these brushes, they came in extra fast, the hair does not shed , it feels nice on the face and does a good job .</li>
            <li> Most of the smaller eye brushes are basically the same.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with these brushes</li>
            <li> They are very nice especially for the price how ever I&#x27;m lost using them because idk what to use for different products they would be amazing to come with a reference sheet</li>
            <li> The brushes came quickly and we&#x27;re exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Brush fell apart when I wash them</li>
            <li> I thought the weirdest thing people said about these brushes is that they smell chemicals.  I read these reviews and was thinking - wow people are really sensitive, smell shmell.  When I opened the ziplock bag these came in, I was TAKEN BACK by the waft of chemical smell.  Like a combination of acrylic nail liquid &amp; paint thinner.  Each brush was individually wrapped and I was astonished how much each one smelled IMMEDIATELY washed them one by one - and even turned the bathroom fan on in the process because I know the chemical fumes are not good to breathe in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YOU KNOW when the company puts a note in the packaging saying the brushes will smell like chemicals because they&#x27;ve been trapped in a ziplock bag that you&#x27;re nose is not exaggerating and that you didn&#x27;t just get a bad batch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1)  I was happily surprised that none of the handles popped off while washing them.&lt;br /&gt;2)  Even more happy that I think I saw only 1 bristle come out while I washed all the brushes.  I will say I like that the bristles are a very nice quality. For synthetic bristles they are very soft.&lt;br /&gt;3)  I previously had been using a MAC stippling brush that was black with white tips like these and EVERY time I washed it it would clean off the makeup and the water would turn blackish like the black dye was bleeding.  I assumed this would happen with these if that happened for years with my MAC brush and NONE of these turned the water or my white towels black while they were drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1)  See above about smell - though the smell did go away after washing them.&lt;br /&gt;2)  The brushes take a lot longer to dry than most any brushes I have used.  I was really surprised they did not dry over night even after squeezing them out with a dry bamboo paper towel.  I even went so far as to hang them upside-down to make sure water wouldn&#x27;t sit in the metal base of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;3)  I wish the eyeshadow brushes were a little more different.  These brushes are great, but they are pretty similar to each other.  They all look like different variations of brushes I would use to blend shadows - all very similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 days after I purchased these brushes, the price was $3.79 less than what I paid for them from the same seller.  I was fairly surprised and contacted Amazon to see if there was any sort of price match thing and they said anything fulfilled through Amazon has a price-match guarantee within 7 days after receiving your product. So I&#x27;m happy to say I was able to get it for the lower price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE*** w/ photos&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 handle came off but it honestly didn&#x27;t bother me - I just paid $18 for one eyeliner brush at sephora the other day and so even if a couple of these brushes had problems (which they don&#x27;t) I still think they are a great set of brushes for such a low price.  A little super glue and I went to hold them all and completely forgot which one I had just glued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****I REALLY LIKE how well you can see the amount of product on the brushes - see pic with product on brushes.  The picture to the right of the brushes with blush &amp; shadow on them is of the same 2 brushes just after wiping them off on a tissue with a little alcohol (not washed with soap &amp; water).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely purchase these brushes again or recommend them to friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sold by: Sunlion Shop&lt;br /&gt;Shipped by: Amazon LLC&lt;br /&gt;Delivered: 4 days after order dategreat, but they are pretty similar to each other.

            <li> The brushes come of the stick.</li>
            <li> They do have a slight smell, but they work almost as well as my MAC brushes!</li>
            <li> Bag stinks so badly!  Brushes are poor quality!</li>
            <li> the bag comes with a very strong smell, but the brushes are nice!</li>
            <li> I just wish they came with instructions, but I am happy with them.</li>
            <li> I like them.  For as inexpensive as they are I was expecting a rougher bristle.  These bristles are even softer than brushes I&#x27;ve paid a lot more for.  I will likely be culling my flock of brushes and get rid of those older, scratchier brushes and replacing them with more of these.</li>
            <li> When you see the picture of the product, you would expect to get a variety of different brushes.  However, it is only a few types of brushes but multiples of the same one.  The brushes are very soft, so applying powder make-up is difficult as you have to push the brush harder on your skin to see the make-up applied.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing !!! no lie they are so smooth and they work wonders. No lie I was scared to purchase these because I am a makeup junky and I am scared to buy brushes that have fallout or are rough, but I am glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> Giving a 5 star rating because I received these brushes 2 days before the expected delivery date and also because they&#x27;re great brushes! First taking them out of the package, the smell horrible--like a spray paint smell. I washed them a few times with shampoo and warm water to get rid of the smell and now they&#x27;re fine. With washing them, they didn&#x27;t shed at all and they stayed super soft. For 10 bucks and gettting 10 brushes, this is an amazing deal. They feel like my real techniques and sigma brushes but are super affordable. For 10 dollars, this is a great buy and the paint smell didn&#x27;t bother me much because it washed away. If you want to get yourself or someone some quality makeup brushes for cheap, this is great for you! :)</li>
            <li> Great set of brushes.Like that it included a cheat sheet of what each brush is used for.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t put them to use yet but they are super soft. Yea, they are a bit stinky but since I bought them a while back they have aired out and I don&#x27;t smell anything stinky on em anymore. Nice deal for the feel. Don&#x27;t know the quality just yet but they do feel nice.</li>
            <li> I love these. I bought two sets, for myself and for my mom and I am loving them. Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> So soft and beautiful!</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with the quality. The brushes are very sturdy and well made. They are soft, but dense and they pick up product very well.  They did have a funny smell upon opening, but you should wash them anyway before using. There was no shedding at all after washing them. I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is looking for an inexpensive, but decently made set of brushes.</li>
            <li> Very soft brushes! Definitely recommend for the price!</li>
            <li> This brushes are wonderful better then i expected.</li>
            <li> AWESOME brushes!!!  I cannot believe how lovely these are for the price!</li>
            <li> so these came very fast in the mail. the bigger brushes are amazing, loved the way it applied my foundation, the skinny ones are alittle hard to work with on the eyes but they are perfect for blending out your under eye concealer and contouring your nose. they smelled strong when i first got them but nothing that is overwhelming. love these brushes.</li>
            <li> This makeup brush kit works like a dream! I received them 2-3 days after ordering. I washed them when I unpackaged because they smelt strongly of plastic. I believe that is due to being stored in their plastic bag you receive them in. Other than that, no problems.&lt;br /&gt;I did notice when I washed them that it took some time to work out the gentle shampoo I used. This shows that they hold on and distribute products well. Just make sure to use a small dot of cleanser when cleaning them.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had them over 2 weeks and I haven&#x27;t lost any hairs! Besides the powder face brush, I did lose maybe 3-5 little hairs. It wasn&#x27;t anything major. They are so thick and soft that it doesn&#x27;t matter losing a few! When they apply product it&#x27;s so smooth! I was really surprised. I haven&#x27;t had any high-end makeup brushes before, only ones from the drug store. To name a few: Real Techniques, Elf, and Shine cosmetics brushes. But from what I felt and saw, it made a difference! I used to use a Beauty Blender sponge to apply my foundation but since receiving my kit I haven&#x27;t picked it up once! - only to really blend in concealer around my eyes and nose. I love every single brush from this kit. They are so nice and I&#x27;m really glad I purchased them!!&lt;br /&gt;The owner of the kit, Alice, even emailed to make sure I was happy and if I knew how to use the brushes. She was super sweet and helpful. If you have any questions, please don&#x27;t hesitate to ask! :)</li>
            <li> Eye brushes are way too big to be used for eye shadows. The face brushes are perfect! Soft and durable!</li>
            <li> Considering each brush only costs about a dollar, this is a really good deal. They&#x27;re really soft but also kind of stiff. They also arrived earlier than expected, but came with a weird smell.. Overall, I think these are definitely worth it for the money.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing, far better than what I expected, the only down fall is that they smell kind of weird but nothing that you can&#x27;t handle they smell like spray paint but other than that the brushes are wonderful for the price they&#x27;re very soft and they blend well.</li>
            <li> I freakin LOVE this makeup brush set!!!!! I Love makeupe &amp; creating new looks all the time &amp;  I seriously use just about ever brush on a daily basis!!!!! Would totally buy again!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to get a set of brushes from Sephora- but forking over $70-$100 was hard for me. So, instead (after reading reviews) I purchased these. And I love them! They are so soft, and they make your makeup look soft and even. These are such a great alternative to Sephora brushes!</li>
            <li> Everything falls apart... so soft but...  not good quality</li>
            <li> I am absolutely satisfied with my purchase. These brushes are seriously in my top 5 makeup products. They are extremely soft and apply makeup very well. The only thing is that I wish they were a little more firm so I wouldn&#x27;t have to put so much product on the brush. However, it is very great for applying makeup lightly; avoiding the cake face look. The service was great and I loved that they emailed me personally to get my feedback. Will order again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the brushes for a month or less and there already falling apart, the brush head falling off the wooden handle. Not the best quality.</li>
            <li> Great quality set with a nice selection of sizes for all your cosmetic needs.</li>
            <li> Nice dupe for sigma but smells funny</li>
            <li> they are too puffy, pretty big, not delicate, not easy to work with</li>
            <li> Absolutely Love all of the brushes in this sermon super soft yet dense enough to get a flawless finish on the skin. No fall out. The only thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that the silver part of the brush I use most feels like its coming a tiny bit loose on the handle. So far so good though. I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week now.</li>
            <li> they have a horrible smell to them butt after washing them they work perfect.</li>
            <li> nice I like them a lot.  Good quality for the price</li>
            <li> fit the bill and for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! U can smell how new they are i love them</li>
            <li> Good brush for cheap just don&#x27;t like how is  not labeled to what kind of brush they are what&#x27;s its use for no paper intruction.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great. Wish they were more firm but hey I like them! Definitely GREAT for the price.</li>
            <li> Brushes are good but smelled terrible of chemicals...told my girls to wash them good before using them.</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s great -- I like the way they feel on my skin. It doesn&#x27;t pick up mouse/cream foundation well however, it leave some residue, but the brush for blush/bronzer works great!  I love the way they look, clean and expensive looking.</li>
            <li> These brushes are by far the best I&#x27;ve ever felt. They are extremely soft but will blend out your makeup flawlessly. They arrived on time in great packaging. Each brush was individually wrapped and the box was packed with bubble wrap to ensure the brushes wouldn&#x27;t break in transport. Their are two reasons why I only gave these brushes 4 stars: these did have a strong smell about them and one of my brushes broke after the first use. The smell wasn&#x27;t necessarily a bad smell it just smelled kind of like paint or plastic but after washing them a few times they smell fine. The brush that broke felt loose upon opening it but after I used it I was able to pull the silver part off the wooden handle. I could see the glue that originally held the brush so I took it out and glued it back with some regular hot glue and it&#x27;s like it never happened. I still love these brushes because they work so well and are incredibly affordable. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my cousin and she loves them</li>
            <li> Super soft. Great deal</li>
            <li> They are really good!</li>
            <li> Love these! Great quality!</li>
            <li> I love my brushes... I love them so much that I will order another set. The only thing you will need to wash them when you get them. The smell is strong.</li>
            <li> I really was expecting to be somewhat disappointed.  Wow! Was I wrong.  I am still using the same make-up, but the finished product I get with these brushes was a real surprise.  They are very soft, and the density is to MY satisfaction.  The brushes arrived in perfect condition.  There was a smell, but the manufacturer addresses that with an insert.  I removed the brushes from their pouches and when I came back hours later, there wasn&#x27;t any smell at all.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this set.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about makeup brushes as an application method so I purchased these to test out what I would prefer. The brushes all perform extremely well and are well made. Great deal for the price.</li>
            <li> These are great brushes !!!!!</li>
            <li> The brushes came as expected however after washing it a few time to get the strong unpleasant smell . I have notice the hair on the brush are pulling out . Secondly , it&#x27;s hard for a makeup beginner to know which brush to use for application process.because they aren&#x27;t labeled .  In all this may not be the product to buy if you don&#x27;t know much about makeup brushes. I&#x27;m not pleased.</li>
            <li> greate price, awesome product</li>
            <li> Missing eyeliner brush and bag, I guess I&#x27;ve received a fake set as stated on the picture? Please advice.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! Haven&#x27;t even touched my other brushes since purchasing these</li>
            <li> The brushes are nice but the bag that the brushes came in had a very strong (disgusting) odor.  I was greatly disappointed bc now I have to find another bag to store my brishes.</li>
            <li> Not the best quality but for the price they serve the purpose. Bristles fall out just about every time I use anyone of them.</li>
            <li> I will rate these brushes based on my professional opinion as a makeup artist from 1- 5.... 1 being low and 5 being the best:  Softness: 3.8 Quality: 3 handles: 4 bristles: 3.8 how it applies makeup: 3.0  Overall These brushes are great to practice makeup, some of them I would recommend for professional use, there are like 2 brushes that I was not a huge fan of, but they are not the worse thing I have ever held either. Overall I feel that they absorb a lot of product but for the price they are a great bargain. Will definitely be using some of these on some of my clients.  -- When you first open them they do have scent to them, but it fades away soon after. Also, none of my handles have broken as a some people reported--</li>
            <li> These are ok brushes. The small ones are a little hard on my skin, they scratch sometimes. I only really like the large kabucki round and angled and from the small ones i like the little angled ones. Forget about using the small ones for eye shadow, they&#x27;re too harsh and dint blend in the color very  well.</li>
            <li> IN LOVE. Perfect price as well! I read some reviews saying that the brush hairs fell out, but I haven&#x27;t experienced that at all. These brushes are soft and carried no scent! Easy to wash and handle. I totally recommend these for anyone who applies makeup often; on themselves or others. Almost professional quality. Very satisfied!!</li>
            <li> These are a perfect compliment to my brush collection. I appreciate the different &#x27;shapes&#x27; and &#x27;contours&#x27;. I&#x27;ve only used them for about two weeks so I can&#x27;t give you a rating on how well they will last over time.</li>
            <li> Nice brushes. And I have hand washed, they loss no hair.</li>
            <li> Totallly love this new set. i use it daily now. smoth but not too smother where it doesnt blend.</li>
            <li> All the brush heads fell off the sticks.</li>
            <li> So great for the price the do come off the handle but a little glue and it&#x27;s fixed</li>
            <li> love these brushes are so soft. It makes putting on your  make up on a breeze!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! Just a generic brand of the &amp;#34;sigma&amp;#34; brushes . Awesome price , great quality ! :)</li>
            <li> I just got these in, I AM IN LOVE!!&lt;br /&gt;Perfect brushes, so soft on the skin and applies wonderfully. So impressed by these. Compared to other very high end expensive brushes I&#x27;ve gotten before, these work just as well. Love love love!!</li>
            <li> I love how soft they are! Can&#x27;t wait to try</li>
            <li> Love these brushes.  Super soft and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> The smell of brushes wasn&#x27;t  great, I washed them with shampoo and let them air dry I got a little shedding , but to be honest I got what I paid for (10) brushes for nine bucks it worth it.</li>
            <li> Great product and great experience</li>
            <li> Great brushes for the price I love them!!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are fantastic! I was wary at first because of the low price, but after reading the reviews I figured I would take a chance. They are sturdy and easy to clean perfect for everyday use.</li>
            <li> They all Work great reccomend this product great price too</li>
            <li> Great brushes! I love them! I&#x27;m going to order another set as a gift to my daughter.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing! They have a smell when I opened them but that means there sterile. They are super soft and work perfectly. One of the best makeup brushes I have ever used and are cheap!</li>
            <li> I really love these brushes. They work wonders and are super cute and affordable. The only downside was when I received them, they were drenched in the smell of paint but instructions were included to wash the brushes with shampoo if there was any strong paint scent caused from being encased too long. But besides that, I love them.</li>
            <li> Did not receive all of the brushes ,, missing one ,,, seem to be great quality but not as cut as shown they seem to all he basically round</li>
            <li> Amazing!!! And they are so soft!!!! Im extremely happy with my purchase!!! highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> Loved the brushes, my only complaint is that there is a weird powder that comes out. Definitely wash them before using. Other than that, I was surprised by the quality.  Good brushes for the price.</li>
            <li> Very Fast shipping! Great quality, even came with a free little gift :) happy customer</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! They smelled bad at first but after 2 days of airing them out the smell was gone. I love how smooth my makeup goes on.</li>
            <li> LOVE THESE BRUSHES!!!!! worth $10!! they&#x27;re amazing :) they don&#x27;t look or feel cheap whatsoever!! great quality</li>
            <li> love these! great quality for the price :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great fun using these brushes</li>
            <li> my daughter LOVES these. this is very happy with the purchase. They are soft and bristles do not fall out easily</li>
            <li> Amazing and most soft brushes I&#x27;ve ever used!!  Love how they feel on my skin.</li>
            <li> First off let me say these are just absolutely amazing brushes these brushes are so soft dense and I love the handles these are great quality but the shipping was not the best it had been delayed 2 times it didn&#x27;t come when it was supposed to but other than that I love them</li>
            <li> love this ! it came early i was excited ! i use some for my foundation &amp; it goes on 10x better . i use a bitt less foundation cause the brush works w. what their is ! i use some for eyeshadow &amp; it works good . love this .</li>
            <li> Very nice brushes-- and a good variety of shapes/sizes. Appreciate the prompt customer service and supportive response when I emailed them. Brushes a good quality and I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> Got my brushes so far I love them !! Five stars great price!</li>
            <li> Great brushes.  They do have a very strong chemical smell when you open them.  Let them air out and it will be fine.  They are soft.  They work great.</li>
            <li> Terrible, chemical smell. It won&#x27;t go away and I can&#x27;t put them near my face.</li>
            <li> First off, let me say I am a professional makeup artist. These brushes impressed me, and that is saying a lot, because it takes a lot to impress me. These brushes are super, super soft, the handles and ferrules are sturdy, minimal to no shedding. Excellent product, worth every penny. I was not expecting much for what I paid, but I was extremely, extremely impressed. In addition, the item arrived faster than I had expected. I read the reviews before making my purchase and some customers described them as having a strange smell. Personally, the sets that I received did not smell at all. In any case, you should be washing any brush prior to use anyway, so I imagine if some people received a &amp;#34;smelly&amp;#34; set of brushes, washing them should take care of that.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. Love. Bought two sets, one for my personal use, one for my kit.</li>
            <li> These brushes are easy to work with! Good product!</li>
            <li> great, my new favourites, very good quality</li>
            <li> The brushes and bag had a funny odor. Sent them back because i couldn&#x27;t stand the smell.</li>
            <li> The brushes were very sot and didn&#x27;t have a very strong chemical smell for me, which is saying a lot since I get headaches just from spraying air fresheners. They smelled clean and were in perfect condition. I would seriuosly consider getting these as a gift for my sister. Considering  I got 11 brushes (including the free eye liner brush) for $10, I spent less than I would have on elf brushes!!</li>
            <li> I like the different brushes but they are not as full and it don&#x27;t have as much depth as I would like</li>
            <li> Really enjoy these brushes and a great price!</li>
            <li> As described. Good quality considering the price. Did have a chemical smell that faded with time and one brush did come detached from the handle - but that can be glued back together. Brushes aren&#x27;t super dense but the bristles have stayed intact. The small brushes are just tiny version of the larger brushes and have been pretty useless for me. Overall, are cheap and fit my minimal makeup needs and I&#x27;d probably purchase again if necessary.</li>
            <li> Really great brushes I was very impressed with the quality for how cheap they were!! Soft great quality brushes!</li>
            <li> Love them, does not shead. And I literally wash them everyday! Great investment, don&#x27;t wait go buy!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve definitely had better brushes, but for the price you pay for these I can&#x27;t complain!</li>
            <li> Love these.  Didn&#x27;t spend much on these but they are really good.</li>
            <li> The only thing that  sucks is they start breaking off the wood after a little while other then that love them.</li>
            <li> Brushes had a few bristles fall out at first but nothing after the primary wash/use of them. Yes there was a slight chemical smell as well, nothing a wash couldn&#x27;t fix/nothing major. They work wonderfully &amp; are very soft like u would expect from any professional brush. They aren&#x27;t super dense but dense enough to not eat up all your makeup like some brushes do, not ultra flimsy yet flexible. Depending on how heavy handed or light handed you are will effect your makeup application outcome, remember that! Practice makes perfect so don&#x27;t be discouraged if these brushes don&#x27;t work for u right away, after all not all of us are makeup artists lol For me they worked well &amp; gave me the airbrush finish I was looking for &amp; i didn&#x27;t expect that, I bought this more of an experiment to see if I could find quality for a lower price &amp;  so that I could give my other professional brushes a break. Plus to have more brushes handy if i get too lazy to wash brushes I know I have backups with these &amp; I sure am glad I bought them. I will be purchasing more products from them in the future now that I know quality is just a fraction of dollars &amp; a click away. Thanks BS-Mall&lt;br /&gt;P.S. My only real gripe is the huge lettering on the handles its not attractive.</li>
            <li> The brushes are great! They really are soft and thick, no bristles have come out. They do smell funny once you open up the package but its okay the smell went away. They come in a black faux leather bag.</li>
            <li> The eye shadow brushes are kinda big for my eyes.</li>
            <li> They have a terrible smell to them</li>
            <li> I have a lot of brushes and these have become my favorite ones to use. Each brush can be used for multiple areas on the face when doing make-up.  No Dye runs when I washed them, the chemical smell from the plastic wrapping went away as soon as they were washed. I&#x27;m in LOVE</li>
            <li> I like these brushes a lot! The price is good too. The only thing is sometimes hair falls but not a lot just 3 strans or less.</li>
            <li> Glides the makeup on perfectly and not clumpy. And blends well. My favorite brushes so far. Soo happy I bought</li>
            <li> My brushes did not come the with the pleather bag or gift eyeliner brush, and they do not have the bs-mall label on the brush or package anywhere. This is obviously a knockoff... However my brushes are still in good condition so I may keep them.</li>
            <li> A few of them broke shortly after and I didn&#x27;t like the material</li>
            <li> I just LOVE these brushes, my first REALLY nice set.  Wonderful Price!!!! you must get these!!!!</li>
            <li> the brushes are great! they apply makeup very well. When I first got the brushes they had a strong scent. It is best to wash the brushes properly. When I did wash the brushes, the scent was still there. Lastly one of my flat top brushes came apart. I wish these brushes had labels.</li>
            <li> They lay the makeup on beautiful but the brushs are falling apart. Plus I did not receive any brochett explaining or a proper bag to store the brushs</li>
            <li> Pros: Very dense, soft brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I would say the worst part about these brushes is the glue that holds the metal part to the black handle. One of my smaller brushes arrived broken in two and the bristles are all bent up. A little trimming and grooming was necessary for some rogue hairs on the other brushes as well.The brushes did have quite a strong smell when I took them out of the packaging (similar to paint/paint thinner) but the smell went away after I washed them with a little bit of shampoo and warm water. The brush angles are also not very pronounced, so if you are looking for small brushes for intricate detail, I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works great for the price.</li>
            <li> They are okay, not sturdy at all. over all Meh..</li>
            <li> there was no guide or any information that came with these brushes..... the packaging smell was seriously strong even after I washed them.</li>
            <li> I have bought Kabuki brushes in the past and this product has such great reviews and it was so cheap that I decided to try it. Not worth it. Cheap if you want cheap because they are synthetic of course but the bristles are not very full. I prefer paying 10 bucks for each for a better quality brush. I think the bag was better quality then everything else.</li>
            <li> This brushes are not good quality the come apart the first use</li>
            <li> The bristles are falling out of most of the facial brushes</li>
            <li> Good Burshes and Great price!</li>
            <li> Full Of Joy About My Makeup Brushes I Really Love These Brushes They Make My Foundation Look Flawless. Who Need Those High Price Makeup Brushes</li>
            <li> They are so soft and do a good job of distributing product.</li>
            <li> Wow!!!! VERY impressed. They&#x27;re wonderful. My new favorites in my collection~</li>
            <li> Pretty good brushes for the price. Very comparable to my sigma flat top kabuki and Sedona lace face brush set</li>
            <li> The smell of off gassing on the product is terrible. I also did not receive all brushes shown.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptic about orderiing these brushes. I have to say after i used them, they are GREAT!! they are very well put together hardly any shedding and they just work great for even the price. I am going to order a second set for my Kit.</li>
            <li> I am new to makeup and wanted stronger brushes for an inexpensive price. Well I must say I love these brushes! üòÅI am excited to use and experiment with them. They are sturdy and has an awesome variety. Make sure to wash them before you use them!</li>
            <li> These are outstanding.</li>
            <li> I am pretty impressed with these brushes. I purchased them hoping they would come close to the sigma brushes and they do. I would say they are about 80% the same. They are not quite as dense and I did notice a little tiny bit of shedding, and by shedding I mean I lost maybe 5 hairs (from the flat top kabuki) in the month I have had and used them. They work very well, and come with a nice variety, and they also clean up nicely. Would definitely recommend to anyone wanting to try them out! Will repurchase in the future.</li>
            <li> very nice and easy to use and will give you professional look</li>
            <li> Love them! The brushes once cleaned are so soft and the application is flawless! Love love love</li>
            <li> These brushes are great.. Very soft.. I use them every day and I liked them so much I just bought this set for someone for christmas..  Love them</li>
            <li> I have used about every makeup brush there is!these compare to sigma without breaking your checkbook! I ordered three more sets. I hope the seller doesn&#x27;t up the price seeing all these positive reviews! I ordered on a saturday and got them on Monday morning. Will def purchase more!</li>
            <li> I was excited after reading the other reviews, but I seriously doubly their authenticity at this point. These brushes are cheap, flimsy and poor quality. The bristles are not even and fall out all over the place. Save your money!</li>
            <li> Smells like paint thinner???</li>
            <li> Cheap brushes. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great and quite reasonably priced.  Love them</li>
            <li> The quality of this brushes is amazing. There are even better than the ones I bought in Sephora. There was no shed when I pulled on the brittles. They do smell, but it has to do with the plastic bag they come in. Once you clean them, the odor is gone. There are great for contouring.</li>
            <li> Ordered these brushes because I am a makeup junkie . They arrived within 3 days and came nicely packaged in an envelope with bubble wrap. The quality of these brushes is amazing. There are no fallout bristles, and they blend out foundation like a dream! They did smell like chemicals when I first receive them but one wash with some shampoo and they were good to go . Would recommend to anyone who loves makeup brushes!</li>
            <li> Two of the brushes broke within a week. but they work just fine other than that.</li>
            <li> Perfect!!! I really love it!!!</li>
            <li> Very good product especially for the price. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for a little over 2 months and use them daily. The products are lack luster given in my first few weeks of use, 5 of the brushes broke given the adhesive holding the brush handle and brush tip is low quality. These brushes are not built to last, I would not recommend these brushes and am disappointed in the quality of the product as a whole.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes came super fast!!</li>
            <li> Work great for the price. Great for blending. Only bad thing is the strong odor smells like spray paint had to wash them twice one with baking soda to get rid of the odor. But like I said they work great for the price.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!!  Great blending brushes.</li>
            <li> On time delivery.... Can&#x27;t wait to test them out!!!!</li>
            <li> Loved the brushes! And they arrived even before it said they would! Would purchase again :)</li>
            <li> Very well made for the price ... Little to no shedding when I&#x27;ve washed these babies ... I use them all and can&#x27;t complain ... Not one single thing wrong with these ... So glad I purchased</li>
            <li> Bought these for my wife. The bag the brushes were in smelled horrid but the brushes did not smell. We removed them from the bag and left the bag outside overnight inside out. after that there was no more smell and my wife says the brushes or smooth and soft. she likes them very much</li>
            <li> These are good brushes to have</li>
            <li> Feels so soft on my face. I might get more.</li>
            <li> What an amazing price for the quality and amount of brushes! There are so many types of brushes in the set was an amazing cheap gift for a beginner/intermediate makeup user! The brushes are super soft and make a great gift thats under $20 definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! And they came a day earlier than expected. Yes, they do have a smell when you get them but a good wash will get it out. They&#x27;re soft and get the job done. Worth the price!</li>
            <li> Brushes delivered faster than I was expecting. Packaging was great, all brushes are amazing and hold product well.</li>
            <li> Bought these about a month ago. They are starting to shed :(.&lt;br /&gt;Wishing I had gotten different ones.</li>
            <li> These are great for the price. They even hold their shape after frequent cleaning.</li>
            <li> Like how soft and how they apply but once you wash them the glue becomes weak and the wooden shafts come off. üòï</li>
            <li> very soft &amp; nice brushes</li>
            <li> Nice little collection I love it</li>
            <li> 5 Stars because these brushes are WAY more than what I was expecting for the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FAST shipping. Only took 2 business days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the reviews said they were good brushes, but smelled like paint and shed a ton. Mine shed before I washed them, but now they are fine. The box they came out of had a very STRONG paint smell, but the brushes themselves had no paint smell at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They only thing that isn&#x27;t like the picture, is the fact that the brush handles do NOT have any writing on them. They are just plain black handles. Which doesn&#x27;t effect the way they apply makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT BRUSHES: ranking right up there with Sigma and Mac! Get these while you can people!</li>
            <li> I just ordered these brushes and received them yesterday. After only using them this morning, I can say they are a close second to my favorite brush set (my Morphe brushes are my number one favorite). They are such a great quality for synthetic brushes and my makeup looks flawless when applying it with these brushes. I printed out the guide picture on Amazon because the brushes are not labeled so the guide just makes it easier to know which brush to use when. If you&#x27;re looking for a VERY affordable brush set, without having to pay $$ for Morphe or Sigma, then these are your best bet.</li>
            <li> Received this brush set today and the shipping was fast. The brushes do have a paint/chemical smell but nothing a wash can&#x27;t fix. They are super soft and good quality with minimal shedding and I can&#x27;t wait to try them out today. Overall I am satisfied with my purchase but wish they included an angular eyeliner brush as well!</li>
            <li> Brushes are so soft, works so good!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and really good products for a good price</li>
            <li> The bristles on these brushes are smaller than I expected--not as full/dense as I thought they were going to be. I washed them after receiving them in the mail and did not notice any shedding. There was some chemical smell but that went away after I washed them. They still maintain their shape after they dried. I have not use them yet as I am still trying out another brush set. Overall, I do like the set as backup for when my other brushes are being wash.</li>
            <li> Amazing set! Must have!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes. They don&#x27;t shed at all and my makeup always comes out beautifully blended. The bristles and soft and cut well, great density.</li>
            <li> These are amazing!!! I love all the face brushes, haven&#x27;t really tried the eye brushes yet but they seem promising!</li>
            <li> Decent makeup brushes for the price.</li>
            <li> I am so impressed with these brushes! I was at Ulta a few days ago and spent some time at the IT cosmetics brush display, these brushes are so similar to those in quality that I would not be surprised if they are the same manufacturer. The brush heads are so soft and are cut perfectly. The eye shadow brushes are a little larger for my liking but that is just my personal preference because I have smaller lids, but they are fantastic and the price is unbelievable!</li>
            <li> Great starter brushes. They did have a strange smell at first but it didn&#x27;t bother me too much. After being washed it was barely noticeable. I use them everyday and love them.</li>
            <li> Great brushes. Soft bristles</li>
            <li> the produc is good and the brushes are soft...but they do have funky smell, but once you washed them they work perfect</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. I am just getting into makeup application and feel this is an awesome set of brushes.</li>
            <li> Awesome! For the price, you get a great variety AND they&#x27;re good quality! Can&#x27;t beat that! I was about to drop half a grand on a Sigma set but I&#x27;ll buy some shoes with that cash instead! You won&#x27;t be disappointed. I already washed them and there was NO FALLOUT!</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes for a great price! Shipping was fast also, got them 4 days before expected arrival date.</li>
            <li> These brushes are fantastic! They do have a slight smell when you first take them out of the package but that is gone quickly. The brushes are very soft, yet firm enough to put on liquid foundation. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I loved her&lt;br /&gt;And I loved the masterly packaging</li>
            <li> the foundation brush broke already, but otherwise they are amazing. I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> Really impressed with the quality of these brushes. I&#x27;ve had them for about a month now and little to no shedding. My favorite is the flat top kabuki‚ù§Ô∏è</li>
            <li> These brushes looked promising so I decided to give them a try. At first I was quite alarmed that they smelled like paint, but as the card inside said, with one wash the smell was completely gone. I was so impressed with these brushes. Not only do they perfectly apply and blend and product onto the skin almost flawlessly, but they are the softest brushes I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Brushes are pretty good, although 1 of the brushes in this pack was shredding non stop every time I use it so I had to throw it away. Other than that 1 brush, the others hold pretty good, and did not shed even when I washed them.</li>
            <li> These are a great value. Can&#x27;t beat the price and the quality is shockingly good. Def recommend in substitute for the sigma kabuki set.</li>
            <li> Good brushes. Great price! Love!!</li>
            <li> Good Quality---Bought for my daughter and she loves them!</li>
            <li> Very nice brushes! They arrived in perfect conition. They did smell, kind of like paint, but I washed them and the smell was gone. They&#x27;re soft and I think that they&#x27;re great for the price. Would definitely recommend them!</li>
            <li> i was so excited to try out these brushes but unfortunately after using them for about 3 weeks they began to fall apart. They were nice while they lasted.</li>
            <li> Received as promised, smelled a little but I just let them air out of the package for a few days. So far no shedding.</li>
            <li> I really recomended , i was a little afraid of getting a bad quallity product. But when i get it, i was so happy to see it was a really good product!</li>
            <li> Really soft brushes better than I expected</li>
            <li> One of THE best brushes I have ever used !!</li>
            <li> I just got these and I really like them. They do have a strong sense but it disappears once you wash them. Also, they are so soft and look really well made.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed by these brushes.  They&#x27;re very soft and blend my makeup so nicely.  I would purchase these again if needed to.  The only complaint I have is  the brushes were shedding after my first use of them &amp;  the  smell of the glue is super strong when you open the package.  But beside that they&#x27;re amazing.</li>
            <li> Great brushes for my girlfriend!</li>
            <li> So with these, I thought that I would have a bunch of awesome mini brushes in a bunch of different sizes and styles. So I was super excited to use them! The &amp;#34;small&amp;#34; brushes are much much bigger than I thought they would be. And I have really big eyes and it still just does not work the way I was expecting them to. I wanted to use them for my nails possibly too but like I said the smaller brushes were way too big. I do use the bigger brushes for my foundation and for powder which work really really good. They are pretty durable and seem to be good! The shipping time was also great! But like I said, if you expected the smaller brushes to be smaller, they are not which really disappointed me. Other than that they are good brushes!</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift. The brushes received weren&#x27;t silver/black., they were gold/back.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes so freaking much! They are incredibly dense and yet so soft! They make my makeup look flawless, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! And for such a cheap price, you&#x27;d be crazy not to get these brushes! Also, they were delivered so quickly and packaged super securely! A small artificial smell when you get them, but after use it goes away very quickly! LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
            <li> These brushes are really nice, I expected them to smell really &amp;#34;chemically&amp;#34; but it didn&#x27;t. The bristles are soft and handle and comfortable.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazingly soft. I can&#x27;t believe the value. I just knocked off a star because the shapes of the brushes are barely different (except for the pointy one) and the eye brushes are a little too big and fluffy for my Asian eyes. They work great as blending brushes though so now I basically have 4 of them! I don&#x27;t regret buying these though.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes.  They are very soft.  They are a bit on the large side, though.</li>
            <li> This is my second order! I ordered the gold set last month, and I just loved them, so I ordered these silver. They are so soft and beautiful for blending and applying my makeup. I am so happy with both my brush sets, and for the quality of these brushes (compared to MAC and Sigma), they are a steel for the price!!!!! Do not hesitate, you will not regret!!!!!</li>
            <li> Overall the brushes were good but I noticed after two washes a few of them started shedding specifically the foundation brush</li>
            <li> I looked through lots of reviews before deciding to give this set a try and I&#x27;m gad I did.  I have all MAC brushes but couldn&#x27;t afford to buy every single brush that I needed and decided to buy this as a backup.  I love that this set so versatile and I can use it for many of my blending needs.  It doesn&#x27;t replace my current brushes but I highly recommend it.  They didn&#x27;t shed and stay soft and easy to clean.  My only negative is that it takes forever to dry the face brushes.  I try to clean more often with less cleaner so I don&#x27;t have to wait 2 days for a complete air dry which can be done over the weekends.</li>
            <li> it smells.. something very artificial. but it goes away after washing. so you really don&#x27;t need to worry. quality is good. I&#x27;m using it everyday since I get this. They&#x27;re soft! I&#x27;m really satisfied</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. Although their hair is falling off a bit they get the job done.</li>
            <li> I love my brushes, they came with a very strong factory smell so I immediately washed them with half a cup of done and a table spoon of veggie oil. The bag never lost its scent so I threw it away. They are great quality and work fantastic!!</li>
            <li> There are so many brushes in this set I&#x27;m still finding ways to use them all. They are soft but not too soft so that they don&#x27;t hold your powders. They give a smooth coverage to my foundations, blushes and eye shadows. I highly recommend trying them!!</li>
            <li> Love these got her fast I would buy these brushes again</li>
            <li> These brushes really are good. I ordered mainly for the face brushes, and I love them. The only downside to them is that when you first get them they do have a chemically smell. Washing them will take this smell right out. The brushes are incredibly soft. I love the flat top face brush for applying foundation or bb creams. The tapered face brush is awesome for setting with powder. Overall, this is a very good brush set and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes worth every penny... Strange smell but I can get over that</li>
            <li> Ok for the price, but they shed a ton. The small brushes are also weird shaped that aren&#x27;t very useful save for one. If you just want more foundation brushes these work but absolutely not a replacement for the finish and quality of the sigma sigmax ones, which I also own.</li>
            <li> Honestly, these are awful!  They feel so strange, the bristles are almost slimy and the smell is terrible.  I am donating them after a few uses, would not recommend at all.</li>
            <li> Very nice to deal with.  Have even promised to send me a better bag for storage of my brushes.  Great experience!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushs they are super soft very dence and the bristle don&#x27;t shed so far they are super easy to clean and I just love them</li>
            <li> They are so soft! I love them!</li>
            <li> It does have a strong scent but wash them and you should be fine came fast , nice dense brushes . Good quality for the cost .</li>
            <li> Amazing brushes, especially for the price. I love love love them all and will buy a new set if these need replacing down the line.</li>
            <li> I had never used the flat brush or any of these size/type brushes up until now!  I am in loooove!!!  I did not experience any of the bristles falling out and I have washed them and still 0!!  I use less foundation and powder and my makeup looks flawless!</li>
            <li> Ok quality brushes. Won&#x27;t buy again.I guess beginners would have a good use out of it</li>
            <li> Was missing a brush. Amazon refunded 100%, so I can&#x27;t complain too much. Aside from that, seems to be good quality.</li>
            <li> Had to wash them twice due to the smell but otherwise a really nice brush set.</li>
            <li> I give it a four star because one of the brushes came and the handle was detached from the bristles. It was obviously not glued properly because all the handle glue is at the bristles. I still give it a 4 because these brushes are fantastic for the price.  Update: I&#x27;ve been using these for a month now and I wanted to replace the set because three of the brushes fell off the handle but I missed the window by three days. Very disappointing but you get what you pay for, I guess. If you don&#x27;t want brushes that fall apart in the middle of your makeup, skip on these. (No, I didn&#x27;t get water into the handle)</li>
            <li> Love these brushes,  I had to go back and buy another set for my daughter!!  absolutely NO shedding.  Even after numerous washes!!  Highly recommend.  PS.... There is a smell upon opening, and I am VERY sensitive to things that smell.  After washing, completely gone!</li>
            <li> First in didnt arrived in time!!&lt;br /&gt;Second or it should be first and main thing is its STINKS do bad i already wash them twice with baby shampoo its still is smelly!! But other than they are good brushes better than elf!!</li>
            <li> Really smelled alote like spray paint thats the only complaint i have the brushes are ok</li>
            <li> When I first received the product, I absolutely loved it! The brushes were big, soft and did amazing work. However after the third cleaning of the brushes, my main foundation brush started shedding its hairs and also fell off its wooden stick. I began to use another brush hoping it was just an error in the first brush. Sadly, my second brush started doing the same exact. I see many people have success with these brushes, I have read the countless reviews. Im sad that these didn&#x27;t work for me, they did a great job, just too frustrated with them breaking on me.</li>
            <li> I wish each had a description.  I had to go on the Sigma website to see what each were specifically for.  I bought this for a friend.  I will buy again for myself. . I have a whole sigma set which I bought for over $100 these brushes are awesome for the price</li>
            <li> Very happy with these brushes. Amazing.</li>
            <li> They seem very good. But the smell is intense.&lt;br /&gt;I also tought they were going to come witha carry bag, as shown un the pictures, but they didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Amazing makeup brushes!!! so soft and nice for the price</li>
            <li> Very good brushes for the money</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great thank you seller üòç</li>
            <li> I ordered and received these brushes on the same day (ordered at 7am on August 5, 2015 and received around 4:30pm). Love that!!!  When I opened my brushes last night, as many other consumers have written, they smelled pretty bad. It was to the point where I even got a headache from the chemicals when I was washing them.  With that being said, I actually really like these brushes! I was going to buy a set of Kabukis from another seller here on Amazon and chose this set purely for the fact that they carried other brushes (not just the flat top Kabukis for foundation application.  I do wish the smaller brushes were a little thicker and had some sort of writing on them so I could differentiate them (they are all pretty similar and aren&#x27;t exactly as the picture shows them to be).  The flat top kabuki type brushes are quite nice. I&#x27;ve already fallen in love with them! They&#x27;re dense and apply my powder/liquid foundations really well! The angled flat one is great for contouring!  I&#x27;m not 100% sure if I&#x27;ll be repurchasing these though, to be honest. The price is great but I expected a little more out of the smaller brushes :(</li>
            <li> Great brushes for the price! Would buy them again, and suggest to friends.</li>
            <li> Worst brush set ever ! They come apart so easily &amp; end up titling ?! Don&#x27;t buy these</li>
            <li> I got them a few days late, along with some problems with the delivery. But focusing on the brushes themselves, they&#x27;re soft and lightweight. Some of them are perfect, but some of them are not as dense as I would like.  and the size is a lot smaller than I expected. I put up some photos. For the price it&#x27;s GREAT but still not exactly what I was looking for. But it came pretty darn close!! If I had to choose, I would purchase them again. Very good brushes.&lt;br /&gt;BTW. the smell is a good thing. It means they&#x27;ve been sterilized!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money on brushes. I read over the reviews and overall every one said they were decent. I was super impressed with the product. They did however, smell just as bad as everyone said. But after letting them air out, the smell went away. Liked the bag they came in. And they worked perfectly. Didn&#x27;t even have any bristles fall off!! Would definitely recommend, if you are not trying to spend a lot on a makeup brush.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d be much better off buying a set with finer eye make up brushes. The big ones in this set are fine, but the finer four are completely useless. Too big for eye make up, too small for face.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE!!!!! couldnt ask for a better make up brush set and price is very great ill be back to buy more!!!</li>
            <li> I know there are other reviews on here that say these are great and all, but I will say this these brushes aren&#x27;t anywhere near as big as I thought they&#x27;d be. Other people&#x27;s pictures on the reviews look huge. Certainly not the case for me. Although they are good brush set to get started with.</li>
            <li> For being so cheap they are great. I usually buy sigma or Mac brushes but I bought these for more of a travel set. They work just as well.</li>
            <li> Fantastic brushes! Love them! They are so soft &amp; look very expensive!</li>
            <li> Great brushes, use them all the time. I have not had a problem with bristle shedding at all. The metal has stayed in place and the paint on the handles has not chipped. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Bought this in June and its August ,the heads of the brushes already comes disconnected from stick. Ive used it maybe 5 times.</li>
            <li> Not worth 15 dollars. Some brushes are soft but mine shade a lot. I am returning and buying a set of real techniques brushes instead.</li>
            <li> Items are as described, great Sigma dupes.</li>
            <li> Really like the brushes;  soft and durable, the weight of the handles feel good in my hand.  The powder brushes give great coverage without looking cake-y.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Very Helpful but I wish that they came with the butterfly one! Other than that I&#x27;m happy with them</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THEM !!! The smell is from the plastic idk why people keep getting mad they are so perfect and awsome price</li>
            <li> Nice brushes, tip came off as soon as I opened them. A little hot glue fixed it though.</li>
            <li> Item just as described, great quality - although one brush is practically falling apart (it happens).</li>
            <li> Love these brushes!!!! Super soft and silky very good eye shadow brushes!!! Definitely will reorder these from time to time or as gifts! If your a makeup junkie definitely buy these!!!</li>
            <li> Really soft! Best bang for your buck!</li>
            <li> Love them ... Great buy</li>
            <li> The large brushes are very nice, but the small brushes are too long. If they were shorter, they would be more compact and effective. However they are functional, and do the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a MAC Pro  and Licensed MUA and these are by far the best brushes on the market, and wow the price, I am buying these for gifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. These Makeup Brushes are great for applying liquid, cream, and powder foundation, see videos by Goss. (can I say that, well I am)&lt;br /&gt;2.  Perfect for applying cream, power, and liquid eye liner, eye shadow, pigments, etc.&lt;br /&gt;3. Hands down the best for applying bronzer, blush, highlighter, contour powers, creams, liquids.&lt;br /&gt;4. Best for applying Pressed or loose powders, mineral powders.&lt;br /&gt;5. Absolutely NO shedding, no black color coming out, no nasty smell from glue!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get the idea, these brushes are awesome, I have put my Sigma, MAC and Technique (hate the handles of that brand) away, these makeup brushes are my go-to, and the only makeup brushes I tell my clients to purchase. :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE BRUSHES!! I do my makeup and others and i have bought so many types or brushes. This brand is so adorable and just amazing. They dont shed, fall apart and,just work wonderfully. Id have 2 sets of these and,wwould buy again</li>
            <li> Amazing brushes for their price! Perfect sigma dupes, I&#x27;m very impressed</li>
            <li> I love it there so soft and easy to work with . :)</li>
            <li> Love them.. quick delivery too!</li>
            <li> I just purchased these brushes recently and they are so soft! I love them! They really help blend in your make up well and leave your skin looking flawless! Make sure you wash them on arrival, however, like you would with any brushes!</li>
            <li> Amazing brushes and great price! I love these!!</li>
            <li> I love theses brushes. They came in perfect condition. I have used them numerous of times. I have washed them and do not shed. I am impressed with them brushed . The only downfall would be the handle keeps coming loose but some glue can take care of that. Other than that I am very pleased</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and nice but there was a slight problem that really bothered me. When the package arrived I noticed that at least 4 out of the 10makeup brushes were not glued. Regardless of them all I had to do was push it in hopefully they stay like that way. Brushes are great and soft love them either way.</li>
            <li> The quality of these brushes are fantastic. I bought a set for a friend for Christmas, and then ended up getting a set for myself as well.&lt;br /&gt;The price point for this set is a great value and the shipping time was very reasonable too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re dense but soft - not scratchy in the slightest. They also don&#x27;t shed hairs like other inexpensive brushes tend to, nor do they have that weird chemical-y smell that some do. They also don&#x27;t feel cheap; they feel sturdy and they have a nice ergonomic handle. I love the shapes the face brushes come in. Some are more domed, while others are more flat or angled. So you can use them for foundation, blush, powder, whatever. Liquid, powder, cream, they work with it all. They&#x27;re very versatile!&lt;br /&gt;I will say that I do prefer the face brushes much more than the eye brushes. They are the same quality, but just don&#x27;t have quite the right shape or feel for what I like in eye brushes. I do still use them though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, awesome set. As I said, I&#x27;ve purchased two sets already and wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy again as a gift or replacement.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the brushes. I didn&#x27;t expect them to be such good quality for that price but when i got them i was really pleasently surprised. they&#x27;re perfect for my every day makeup and I love them.</li>
            <li> I gave this a four not because of the brushes but because of the late shipping. It took a few days after the estimated date to receive them.&lt;br /&gt;However, these brushes are amazing ! they are extremely soft and all in tact! Each individual brush was wrapped and were in great condition. Love it!</li>
            <li> Amazing brushes and awesome price. Very good quality, tight bristles and soft to the touch!</li>
            <li> These are really good brushes....I&#x27;m just beginning to do makeup professionally and don&#x27;t want to invest a lot of money yet.....this brush set is affordable and have been great to use...</li>
            <li> These work well for many purposes, a good buy, i recommend</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, the only downside to those brushes is that they tend to shed a lot. I was in the middle of applying foundation to my client and all of a sudden about 20 hairs fell out on her face. Not cool. But overall, pretty good brushes!</li>
            <li> The brushes are inexpensive for the quality and quantity, but keep in mind that they do shed and the handle breaks off easily. My favorite are the eye brushes and the flat top foundation buffing brush. They do the trick! I was very pleased with them. Other than the handles ripping off I have nothing bad to say about these brushes :)</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! They are soft and free of shedding. I do wish a fan brush had been included. But I love these. Recommended!!!</li>
            <li> for how cheap they work AMAZING. great product and I love them. I usually don&#x27;t like cheap brushes because most of them they break easy or don&#x27;t work well but these work amazing.</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than expected. Took less than a week! All the pieces are there and the brushes are super soft. They have a tiiinnnnnyyy tinge of a chemical smell but I aired them out for about 4 minutes and it went away. I think the chemical smell is more from the packaging than the actual brush. I&#x27;ve used everything from Mac brushes to elf brushes, these are closer to Mac. I would recommend them to anyone!</li>
            <li> Love!!! Great, inexpensive dupe for Sigma</li>
            <li> Amazing brushes for the quality and the price!</li>
            <li> Good quality and very great price</li>
            <li> Absolutely looovveee these brushes, you would think they were sigma brushes haha. The quality is insane and it does the job perfectly. TWO THUMBS UP!!!</li>
            <li> These were the first of the kind brushes I bought.&lt;br /&gt;1. They have a strong smell when you first get them. So take them out the protective plastic sleeves and air them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. They are good brushes. Not too hard not too soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. For the price they did flake a little but not as bad as I thought they would. Great first brushes.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes, do not think twice about your purchase! The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5/5 is because the flat top kabuki brush handle came off of the actual silver part. But not to worry, nothing a little super glue couldn&#x27;t fix! Now all is well and working perfectly!</li>
            <li> Very good for the price</li>
            <li> I love these brushes!! I saw the pic someome put o the bristles coming out and was spectical about ordering but i still did because come on, they are $8. Im sure glad i did because they work awesome and so far no shedding!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m So happy with these brushes. They feel amazingly soft and they are so awesome with any product. The only thing that worries me is when I clean the eye brushes and one of them started shedding a lot. Everything is awesome besides that though.</li>
            <li> the big brushes are very bulky and the eye brushes are too big for my eyes. My set did not even come with a piece of paper to tell me what is for what. How hard would this have been to add...come on...I am disappointed in my brush set.  Some of my big brushes does not look like the brushed in the picture</li>
            <li> Brushes are great but do come apart but easily fixed with a glue gun</li>
            <li> Amazing brushes only i hates was the smell it smelled funky</li>
            <li> I really care about the tools and products I use when doing my makeup and these are just as good quality as the brush sets you can spend $70 on. GET THESE. If you have any doubts, forget them. These are worth it.</li>
            <li> I love my brushes! They are very soft. I can put make up on easily with the help of these babies! They are good on powders and liquids. Blending is easy with them too! :)</li>
            <li> Does not have a concealer brush</li>
            <li> Thanks for delivering products on time. it&#x27;s good quality as it should be.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the value. So many choices, sizes textures</li>
            <li> I love my new makeup bmakeup thank you</li>
            <li> Very nice for the price good quality.</li>
            <li> I had never used make up brushes before but after having a session at Sephora and seeing how they work, I decided to purchase these. They are extremely soft and very easy to use. I wanted to wait until I washed them before giving a review, which I did today. They cleaned up very well with Dawn and warm water. I gently squeezed out the excess water and have them sitting brush-up in a cup on the window sill to dry. Highly recommend these brushes!</li>
            <li> They work great package came quick and no damage,  there was a strong smell but it was the bag not the brushes no shedding during the wash, they were pretty dense I&#x27;d expect for them to be fuller but the application is great and they pick up a good amount of product</li>
            <li> They came in a fancy bag. The brushes smelled horrible like a chemical smell when I took them out of the bag. That&#x27;s the only downside the brushes work great especially for contouring on the face.</li>
            <li> Smelled super funny I had let it sit by the window. I hope the smell goes away and that I don&#x27;t get an allergy.</li>
            <li> Not good quality brakes apart</li>
            <li> Got these yesterday and they came today. Came in a really nice pouch and they came individually wrapped. They do smell horrible from the paint but there was a card with advice on how to get rid of the smell which is super nice! Brushes are so soft and sleek. Handle is a little shorter then what I am used to but I think I will live. Will update after a few uses!</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. I&#x27;m a brush snob and am a frequenter of UD brushes. Thought i&#x27;d try these as fillers. Good for beginners.</li>
            <li> Does the job of what I need it to do, but you can feel the quality difference.</li>
            <li> DUPE of the Sigma Sigmax¬Æ Essential Kit 10 Brushes, may not be 100% sigma quality but it is hard to tell the difference! Brushes are a very soft and very high quality. can&#x27;t beat the price- the sigma set sets you back $160; so in my opinion this is a much smater buy.</li>
            <li> Nice and thick full-size brushes.  Do shed a bit.  Worth the price!!!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! They work great, and for a great price!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! Great price and super soft.  There was a very faint smell when opening as each brush was individually wrapped but quickly disappeared.  I use the brushes for foundation, contouring and eye shadow and they work great and no shedding!</li>
            <li> Great quality brushes! And very fast delivery time. Would definitely recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Dense brushes! love this!</li>
            <li> Way better than I expected üôè the brushes are so soft! Definitely would recommend them!</li>
            <li> I purchased these after seeing a You tube video from a girl raving about them and saying they were comparable if not superior to Sigma brushes. The price point is fantastic and frankly I was afraid they would be poor quality. BUT they are actually well made. It took a bit to get them but they came from far away. When I opened them I did notice a strong odor. I am not sure if its the bristles or the handle - I washed them regardless. The brushes washed well and didn&#x27;t bleed or shed - like at all - which is amazing considering that I have a Sephora set that is $60 and it sheds like it is their job. The handles of this set are heavy and a good length. They are so dense I was surprised - they are far more dense than my Sephora set. They are a great kabuki set. There is so many different for your face if you are in to contouring I think that this would be great for that. The only complaints that I have is that when I did wash them it took them a long time to dry and they absorb quite a bit of your product but not too much. The brushes feel like a high quality Taklon but they absorb too much for that to be the case. I purchased the ones with the black handle and white tip and after one use the white is stained by my foundation (yes even after washing) that isn&#x27;t huge however for me. The smaller brushes are also very dense and like mini kabukis which I find a little more difficult for eye make up - their just a bit too large for my taste. I would however defiantly buy these they are a GREAT brush set.</li>
            <li> I came across the brushes while looking for a set that was decently priced as well as higher quality. I didn&#x27;t expect much when I purchased these, but WOW was I surprised when they arrived. AMAZING quality. They do have somewhat of a chemical smell to them, but it went away after a day of airing them out. I even bought a second set in gold to give to my sister as a gift.</li>
            <li> These brushes were bought on a whim.  I really don&#x27;t care for the smaller eye shadow brushes but the bigger ones are awesome.</li>
            <li> I would like a stiff angled brush. I feel like the small brushes are too soft for crease and brows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used them. Not sure what I&#x27;ll do with them since I already unwrapped them and hemmed and hawed about actually using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now ordered a different set.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! They are my go to for foundation and concealer application!</li>
            <li> First impression....these are awesome brushes! Very soft yet dense. They didn&#x27;t have a odor like other reviewers had mentioned. I will update this review if my impression changes negatively.</li>
            <li> Very good brushes, though one of my brushes were bent... But it works</li>
            <li> While the bristles are soft the brushes look pretty nice, the metal piece holding bristles is flimsy and too big for the bristles.  You can squeeze it and it will bend in you fingers. It is not pressed tight onto the bristles leaving extra space for more bristles and making it more likely for the bristles to fall out in the future. One brush&#x27;s bristles was in the brush crooked. I guess you get what you pay for. Cheap price, cheap brushes.</li>
            <li> Great cheap brushes! Make sure to wash before use, definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> First off, in all honesty, I think these brushes are good for the price you pay. They don&#x27;t feel cheaply made or even look cheaply made in that matter. I did however, jump away from the strong smell they had. After giving them a rough wash TWICE, the smell went away. So I strongly recommend you wash them prior to using them! As you should be anyways! Overall, these brushes deserve 4 stars. I recommend them to add to your collection.</li>
            <li> A few broke within days of receiving them</li>
            <li> Very poor quality, the bristles fall out, its just all around bad quality but you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> OMG I LOVE THESE!!!!!!! Just got these. AMAZING. No bad smell, Really fast shipping, Amazing quality. Not alot of shedding when I washed... Only a little... Just wish that they came in different colors! Soooo happy with my purchase, They also came with a bag and a paper showing the purpose of each brush. was not expecting this quality for this price!&lt;br /&gt; PROS:&lt;br /&gt;~SOOOOO SOFT!&lt;br /&gt;~Provides very nice coverage when I used some liquid foundation on the back of my hand.&lt;br /&gt;~100% Quality brushes.&lt;br /&gt;~Super dense.&lt;br /&gt;~Great for beginners.&lt;br /&gt;~Extreme dupe for Sigma brushes or crown brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None!</li>
            <li> I have ordered similar brushes to these and I really liked them so I ordered this brush set because it had more of them in in. Immediately after receiving them all of the black ends came off of my brushes. Its very hard to use the brushed without the ends on them. Compared to my first order these brushes disappointed me.</li>
            <li> I needed a set of brushes for everyday use, and this set works great. They are smaller than I expected (compare to the ones that you can buy in drug or beauty supplies stores), but for $10 they are really nice. As other reviews mentioned, they smell pretty badly, but after soaking them in shampoo and water, the smell disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a nice product if you just start exploring makeup or need something affordable for your everyday look. But definitely do not expect a prefossional quality.</li>
            <li> AWESOME BRUSHES! had a small smell when they first came but i washed them, works WELL!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really tried these yet.  As mentioned in other reviews, I was removing the plastic protector bags off of each brush when 2 of the brushes fell apart!  The odor was also very strong and nauseating.  It was a chemical like odor, not anything I have ever smelled before.  That sort of turned me off and uncomfortable using them.  I guess if I want quality I need to dig deeper into my pocket.</li>
            <li> Fell apart after only a week of use. Really cheap- don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Nice brushes, but I needed a larger one than they offered to put on powder.</li>
            <li> good quality and service</li>
            <li> Beautiful well made brushes. Highly recommend. As soft as high priced brushes, nice dense bristles. So glad we tried these before spending a fortune on higher priced brushes.</li>
            <li> really good! super soft and feel like sigma brushes!! i highly recomend them. but they do break very easily</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t express how upset I am about these brushes. I knew from reading other reviews that when they came in, they&#x27;d have a smell. I told myself that wouldn&#x27;t bother me, because I have a fantastic brush cleaner. I washed these first with a gentle clarifying shampoo. They lost half of their bristles. I never even got to try them for makeup application. It&#x27;s a shame, because they look well made. Maybe I received a defective bunch, but I am not pleased at all.</li>
            <li> Soft!! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> my sister and I both have this set of brushes and we love them hers is black and gold and mine are black and sliver. when we got them they did have a weird smell even after washing them but it did go away after a bit. they are so soft but still firm enough to blend make out.</li>
            <li> Some of the brush heads came off!  Once I glued them back on , they were fine.</li>
            <li> Amazing brushes with great price !!</li>
            <li> they are perfect and inexpensive. thank you amazon !</li>
            <li> These are amazing quality for such a great price. Very happy with my purchase!(:</li>
            <li> I really love these brushes. They don&#x27;t shed at all..they are exactly as pictured. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m the only one experiencing this issue but the handles are coming off my brushes..all of them except one so far...I can&#x27;t even use them anymore :(</li>
            <li> LOVED this brushes, great quality</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes! I refuse to pay the high price for sigma again, not when I can get the same quality in these for waaaaay cheaper. I use these every day.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love, these brushes. Great dupes for my sigma brushes. Very little shedding.... firm yet soft bristles. Good buy.</li>
            <li> Pretty decent quality bristle wise. I had to glue the brush heads though to the handles bc they kept falling off. But you get what you pay for. I get a flawless complexion using these and they wash up pretty nicely.  Def gonna purchase a few more sets for back ups they do the job use the same as the sigma set imo</li>
            <li> Looks just as expected &amp; very soft! The only thing I had a problem with is they smelt like paint when I first got them but after I washed them they smelt fine</li>
            <li> Handles came loose, ‚Äãbut nothing a little hot glue can&#x27;t fix.  They haven&#x27;t shed a lot and are very soft. Good deal.</li>
            <li> Love this set!!! Great price!! And quality!!</li>
            <li> I would give it zero stars if I could. The brushes look very nice, but there is a strong strong chemical smell that made me feel sick as soon as I opened the package. So I am returning them. If they didn&#x27;t have such a strong chemical odor I would of kept them.</li>
            <li> Great quality brushes for a great price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do have a slight smell that you may want to wash off before your first use.</li>
            <li> Quite chemical smell, ....</li>
            <li> Thank you! Good product and price</li>
            <li> Brushes were very nice and soft. I read the reviews before I bought them and many people were saying how they smelled so bad until they were washed. I mentioned this to my boyfriend and he said they have a chemical smell so bugs don&#x27;t get into them when they are transported. That makes sense. He moves furniture for a living, so he would know about things like shipping products. The brushes arrived on time and I am sure I will order some more from this company.</li>
            <li> I have not used the brushes yet which is why I&#x27;m¬†rating the products a 4 but they are very silky and soft. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the smell on them so I would recommend washing them before using them on your face.</li>
            <li> These are amazing for $10.00 really blend out and are super soft on the skin. I will be buying these again!</li>
            <li> Best brushes for the price.</li>
            <li> Thanks  for your product I&#x27;m happy  with it still  until  now  I&#x27;m  not  using the brush.  But I feel I will enjoy when I but it the makeup because  the hair of brush  very  good  quality üíúüëç&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But aske me whay give the brush  only  3 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because  I received  without  BAAAAAGüò¢üò¢&lt;br /&gt;And no gift  (small  brush  for eylinerüò¢üò¢üò®)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hop  can you send the things not receiveüò¢üíî&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Madawi from saudi Arabia&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;madawi53@gmail.com</li>
            <li> they will work for extra brushes...</li>
            <li> Shipping was easy and fast, brushes were well made, light weight with zero shedding. They blend both ny powder and cream products out beautifully.</li>
            <li> Good price. Some shedding. Eye brushes are big.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these brushes! They are soft and durable. I have not had any issues with any of them falling apart or leaving behind hairs. I even bought a second one for my friend. I did not have any problems with odors like you would find with other brushes and the price is right! I have used many other brands of brushes and I have found these to be my favorite!</li>
            <li> Just received my brushes and I love them! They do have a chemical smell to them when u first open them but as soon as I  wash them the smell vanished. They blend and work beautifully! Would definitely recommend to a friend</li>
            <li> 100% recommend these! They are soft, great quality, don&#x27;t shed, and are almost exact dupes for the sigma brushes! For the cheap price, I was completely surprised by how great they are! New faves :) They did arrive with a strong paint smell (the sterilizer) but after I washed them the first time, the smell vanished. If you&#x27;re looking for a cheap but great alternative to higher end brushes like sigma, try these!!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Shipped super fast, and the brushes are so soft! I&#x27;m a cosmotolgy major and sometimes finding brushes that aren&#x27;t extremely expensive but do the job at task are hard to find! These are amazing. I&#x27;ve ordered other brushes off of amazon but they had a lot of fallout when it came to apply powder and the hairs on the brushes would be all over my face at times. These had a funny smell but after I washed them, it went away! So anyone complaining of a smell should wash them (as you should always wash new brushes)! I would definitely buy these again! :)</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great quality. The only con about the product is the smell of the brushes but after I wash it the smell went away.</li>
            <li> I bought this set back in April and it is now late July and I STILL use them. They are a great set for the price** (all the brushes are not pictured because one of them I kept in my bag). When I got them, fortunately none of the stems of the brushes were loose BUT as a precaution I took them apart anyway and superglued it. Only one of my brushes has begun to shed. As for the rest of the reviews, either I got the best set, or their brushes are shedding due to poor maintenance. Many times people wash their brushes and don&#x27;t handle them with care/properly. When you wash them make sure to dry them with the bristles pointing down as water seeping down into the brush can loosen the glue that&#x27;s binding the bristles together and cauSe your brush to shed. Even laying your brushes down can cause that risk (I recommend standing them up against a wall so the bristles are resting on a towel or buying a brush dryer rack).&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I love these brushes. Kabuki feel and the fluffy, dense formation of the bristles make for great foundation application, blending, contouring etc. would def buy again</li>
            <li> They finally came in today! They came in a day before they were supposed to so I&#x27;m really happy about that. They&#x27;re so soft and feel like good quality brushes. They do have that strong chemical smell As soon as you open the bag but all you have to do is wash them! They came with an extra brush so there is 11 pcs. So excited to use them!</li>
            <li> Came with a weird smell but the sellers put a note saying to wash them and it will go away.</li>
            <li> Love how many I received for such a low price. The tops on some of them are loose. I am still figuring what brush is used for which type of makeup the brushes could be labeled it would be a lot easier.</li>
            <li> Good brushes the only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that it had a weird smell so I washed them and air them out and that the smell slowly went away</li>
            <li> These brushes are soft and blends well.</li>
            <li> came in on time and im very happy a bit smelly but just let them air out and its all good thank you</li>
            <li> these brushes are the s***. Would by a million times over.</li>
            <li> They do smell like paint haha but they work well and that smell does go away....it came fast and well packaged</li>
            <li> my eyeshadow brushes were very flimsy and unproportion bristle wise but the bigger face brushes are pretty amazing</li>
            <li> Nice soft brushes. Well worth it for the value</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat these brushes for the price! They are very soft and well made. I have had to trim a few hairs on the flat brushes but other than that I am very happy with this purchase and will buy again! I also didn&#x27;t notice an unpleasant smell in reference to what quite a few of the other customer reviews have mentioned.</li>
            <li> absolutely love these, minimal shedding&lt;br /&gt;great value</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter, she is delighted with them and uses them every day, beautiful quality and affordable - very grateful</li>
            <li> These brushes are great so far.  No awful odor like some when you first purchase (but do wash them anyway upon arrival) They are working well and fine when re-washed.</li>
            <li> I love it!!!....but yhe product said that comes with a extta brush for eyeliner gift and there&#x27;s not comming üò¢üò¢üò¢</li>
            <li> Really nice everyday brushes. I use them all the time. They are really easy to clean and great quality. Shipment was fast. I would buy them again in the future.</li>
            <li> Love it... For ten dollars this is a steal... Synthetic makeup brushes are the best and for people who can&#x27;t afford the expensive brush sets this is a great choice. Threw out all my old brushes. I&#x27;m even thinking of giving these as gifts for Xmas. They do smell like paint but to me that just shows they are brand new and sitting in plastic.</li>
            <li> Amazing quality for the price!</li>
            <li> These brushes are AWESOME. I was really hesitant to order them; 10 brushes for $11? Sounded too good to be true. They are so soft and amazing at blending foundations, eye shadows, blushes, anything! Just as good as any of my high end brushes. GET THESE.</li>
            <li> Havent stop using thw flat buffer brush since i got it for blending my foundation. It uses way less product than my other brush. Love them so far</li>
            <li> These brushes are seriously amazing. I usually purchase name brand brushes but these although they are so low in price really work well. I would definitely recommend these brushes they work just as fine as my crown, mac, and sigma brushes. If you&#x27;re skeptical, just do it, they&#x27;re only $12! Won&#x27;t regret it I promise.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. The big brushes weren&#x27;t glued correctly. Before I purchased them I read the reviews and sound really good but I regretted . They just fall apart &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> very good !! All as expected&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still getting used to using these  brushes but I am loving them! I was skeptical at first because they were so reasonably priced but they are super soft,  application is easy, and so far not fall out. I love the way my foundation looks flawless after each application. They&#x27;re very easy to clean which is always a plus. They distribute just enough product to your face and with these brushes the possibilities are endless, you can add more product for buildable coverage. I am very happy with my purchase so far!</li>
            <li> It was just amazing, really soft!!</li>
            <li> The bristles are so soft but it is sturdy.. I love these brushes and they are not that expensive..</li>
            <li> Soft bristles and just what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li> I LOOOoVe them !!! They are super soft. Hold makeup on the brushes well. Great for blending.  I own costal scents brushes. Urban decay brushes , bh cosmetics brushes and elf brushes. And my elf brushes started shedding... The only thing is the plactic wrapper smells like strong plastic. But brushes don&#x27;t smell. And your face won&#x27;t smell. I absolutely love them will be buying again!  Before I bought I read all the reviews. I will be buying again !!!!</li>
            <li> Been through tons of brushes expensive and not but these seem to be the best. They clean without losing bristles and the handles are easy to hold.  I think they are great!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy another set. I thought it was ok.</li>
            <li> I got what I paid for on these. As soon as I opened the package, one of the brushes had come apart at the center. They smell like gasoline so I had to wash them but once all of that is taken care of they seem alright. Made of soft material and hold makeup well</li>
            <li> Very good quality brushes, love how you get so many in a package!</li>
            <li> Came in gold, not silver. But I still like them</li>
            <li> Had a funny smell at first but it was easy to washout with dawn dish soap and air dry. They have held up great so far I have had them for 2 months now.</li>
            <li> Love them amazed with these brushes and the price</li>
            <li> Love them got here very fast!!</li>
            <li> Great deal for the price. I washed them right away and they have been working great, no smell. They are also super soft, I use one to apply foundation, one for concealer, one as an eye shadow blender, highlighter, and you can use a few of them to contour along your nose, forehead, and cheeks</li>
            <li> Just bought these and love them</li>
            <li> They seem nice enough! The eye brushes seem a little big but I may wind up using them for foundation around my eyes/nose and one for my eyebrows. Make SURE you wash them before you use them (or even touch the bristles in my case!) I have very sensitive skin and I stupidly brushed one of the brushes against my hand and my hand started burning a bit! I washed them with warm water and some soap. No shedding, the smell is mostly gone from the bristles (although the handles still smell a bit). I do wish they came with a card telling you what to use what for, as I&#x27;m very inexperienced with makeup. Overall they seem like a great deal for the low price!</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. Soft and doesn&#x27;t have shed hairs.</li>
            <li> I needed some new brushes but really didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money. I read the reviews about how sturdy they are and the reviews were spot on. I have a lot of sephora brushes and these are honestly better. My sephora brushes were purchased back at the end of December 2012 and I got them on SALE for $50.00. There were less brushes and a lot less sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes did have a certain smell to them but that is good since I know they were steralized. I washed the brushes, let them dry, and the smell was gone. For $11 how can you really go wrong?</li>
