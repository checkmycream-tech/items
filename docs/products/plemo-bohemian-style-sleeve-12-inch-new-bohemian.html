            <li> The colors look pinkish in the photos but are actually yellowish.  The product is in good quality, though.  It fits my Thinkpad X240 perfectly.</li>
            <li> Great case and great design.</li>
            <li> Great price, quick service. Product and service exceeded my expectations.  12&amp;#34; is a great fit for my 11&amp;#34; computer.  Canvas is great quality and pattern is very cute! Inside of bag is soft and plush to protect computer.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This is a great cover.  The design is eye-catching with lots of colors but not too overbearing.  I received a compliment on it the first time I brought it to church to use with the kids, where I volunteer.</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly for a hard to find size. Most cases I found were not attractive, but this one is super cute!</li>

            <li> I ordered the 12-12.5 in case to fit my 11 inch Lenovo Yoga laptop.  I had previously ordered the 11in case but it wouldn&#x27;t zip closed because of the rounded edges of the case.  The 12-12.5 in case fits the laptop well and does not feel too big!  There is just enough room to put the cord in the case with my laptop.  Love the colors!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  I use it while traveling.  Print on cover makes this easy to locate in luggage/carry on bag.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend this highly to anyone looking for a lightweight protective case.</li>

            <li> Nicely made product, speedy delivery, and the perfect fit for my newest netbook computer. What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> I like the design and the material on the outside and inside of the case/sleeve. The inside material is fleece-like and very soft. However the case/sleeve has two zippers and one of the zippers broke on like the third day of me using this product. Luckily the other zipper works and I can still zip up the case.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 11.5 inch asus laptop and LOVE IT!!! The inside is super soft and I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on it including one from a total stranger who stopped me in the library to ask who made it! Protects my laptop from scratches and getting all beaten up. Would recommend this!!!</li>

            <li> Exactly as pictured, worked perfectly for my needs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so cute and really protective for my laptop! I could have bought a smaller size because I have a 11.5&amp;#34; and I bought a 12&amp;#34; case just to make sure it fit but now it fits my laptop and my charger so it all works out!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter&#x27;s new Asus X205TA 11.6&amp;#34; laptop.  It fits perfectly with a little extra room to spare.  The cord also fits in, no problem.  The outside of the case is an adorable fabric print.  The inside could use more padding...I&#x27;m not sure it would completely protect the computer in the even of a drop.</li>
            <li> Very attractive and after a month of use it still holds up really well access to the laptop is easy and we have received many compliments from friends.</li>
