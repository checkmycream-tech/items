            <li>Amazing how the best technology is not always the newest!</li>
            <li>As luck would have it I found a great buy on a razor which included a package of Shark blades (I did not know anything about them</li>

            <li>My dad loved it.</li>
            <li>Good quality and value.</li>
            <li>I bought a ton of these, and good thing, they work well.  </li>
            <li>Good blades do the job.</li>
            <li>Which is surprising because they are the cheapest.</li>
            <li>Believe it or not, this is a good thing.</li>
            <li>Believe it or not, this is a good thing.</li>
            <li>good quantity for the price</li>

            <li>gives good shave.</li>
            <li>Good value blade.</li>
            <li>Thought I was getting a good deal</li>
            <li>They are a good blade an I will continue to buy them at this price point.</li>
            <li>Good trade off.</li>
            <li>These blades do their job, and the price is good, but</li>
            <li>gave a 4 start rating because as I said, they do their job, and the price is good, but it doesn&#x27;t come with anything to dispose of the blades.  </li>
            <li>Work good for my course beard.</li>
            <li>good every day blades</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re good for 1 or 2 shaves then you will need to replace them.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the shark &amp;#34;super chrome&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get the good shave I used to get.  </li>
            <li>I was a barber for 40 years, so I think I can judge a good blade when I use one, and these are a good blade, at a good price.</li>
            <li>The Shark came with a Parker razor I bought and gave me a wonderful shave the very first time.  </li>
            <li>Great price for a very comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>Sure makes kissing much more enjoyable!!!</li>
            <li>I have smooth skin and this of ideal quality and economy.</li>
            <li>A top notch product!</li>
            <li>Perfect for my straight razor!</li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>Exactly what was described and works great according to my husband also great value for the quantity</li>
            <li>amazing value, and quality blades.</li>
            <li>These blades are great for me, so smooth that it feels like there isn&#x27;t a blade in my razor.</li>
            <li>Amazing price</li>
            <li>Amazing amounts of blades for the price.</li>
            <li>However, it wasn&#x27;t the amazing bargain that I had hoped it would be.</li>
            <li>This is just my opinion, but these are seriously amazing.</li>
            <li>make a  real comfortable shave,not jaws at all</li>
            <li>I like the razor blades sent, I get a nice shave &amp;</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the absolute best for everyone but based on my uses of it</li>
            <li>To be honest when I saw &#x27;Made in Egypt&#x27;</li>
            <li>Think of shaving as a time to meditate and learn your own body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Think of shaving as a time to meditate and learn your own body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Paired nicely with my vintage gillette fat boy.</li>
            <li>we like the product and honest mistakes</li>
            <li>Nicely packaged.</li>
            <li>I bought these blades because, like most people who probably come across this on Amazon, it was too good of a bargain to pass up.</li>
            <li>They give a nice close shave.</li>
            <li>feathers are much much better, astra blades almost as good.</li>
            <li>Not a bad deal 10 cents for a great shave.</li>
            <li>Shark is probably the best bang for the buck because they cost the least of the three brands I like best.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m fine with switching them out to keep a good shave.</li>
            <li>I saw a review for Shark, and noticed how someone stated they glided quite nicely and were sharper than most.  </li>
            <li>I have tried others but these are the best for me so far.</li>
            <li>In my Parker razor handle they are the best by far.</li>
            <li>Incredible product, i love it so much.</li>
            <li>a much closer shave good product good price</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect a super premium close shave like you would with Feather or Merkur blades!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many many blades in my razor over the years, these are almost the best so far, as with most blades, they work well in one razor, but not all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying many blades, and Shark Super Stainless are the best for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;These razors give a really great, very close shave.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite blades.</li>
            <li>It comes as a store display so you can hang it on your wall, which I greatly enjoyed.</li>
            <li>Much better than the name brand disposables.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and I&#x27;m glad I purchased these.</li>
            <li>2 shaves from bottom to top before it gets close to needing to be changed.</li>
            <li>I bought his because I love mine</li>
            <li>These are OK.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth a test run for anyone looking for a good blade.</li>
            <li>The shark blades are awesome when used properly</li>
            <li>though - might try these in Platinum coat if you&#x27;re looking for a more &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried all of the most popular blades, but none of them really fit.  </li>
            <li>But, in the &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; category these are my favorite.</li>
            <li>Their face will look like Swiss cheese after, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>The feathers are sharper and cost more.</li>
            <li>I have used over 18 different razors and sharks are the best in my book</li>
            <li>In my opinion, the Astra blades are much better.</li>
            <li>I love them.  </li>
            <li>theres better, not consistant in the sharpness.</li>
            <li>then I strop them to get 3-5 more.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite blades.</li>
            <li>happen :)</li>
            <li>I bought a tester pack with many brands of DE razors and these were probably the dullest ones in the pack.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many double edged blades and these work best for me.</li>
            <li>I have placed these in the backup blade bin, in case I run out of my favorite, which is the Trig blade.</li>
            <li>I have two more packages of these, but am throwing them out.  </li>
            <li>I have used the and l am satisfied with results.</li>
            <li>I love these.  </li>
            <li>I have found nothing works better than the shark.</li>
            <li>great product fast shipping</li>
            <li>Check out more clearance shaving supplies at.</li>
            <li>Love the Shark razor, stays sharper longer.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t snap easily, but a tin snips cuts through them very easily.</li>
            <li>gives nice clean cuts...</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have high hopes, but these blades have given me consistently great</li>
            <li>I use them in a microtouch one razor with pretty good results.  </li>
            <li>These are a good price, give me a good shave, and last longer than Feathers.</li>
            <li>These blades are pretty cool my son uses them to shave hes happy with them</li>
            <li>Overall I would say they&#x27;re a good buy and are good quality.</li>
            <li>I recently started using the DE razors and found these to be very good blades for me.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why they come free with most razors.</li>
            <li>I also use Shark singles in my Parker disposable blade straight razor about once a week, and it is also good.</li>
            <li>Sharp, shaves close, excellent shave with no nicks or irritation.  </li>
            <li>Plenty sharp, and the price is awesome.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a number of blades with my other razors and these are some of the best.  </li>
            <li>can easily make 4 shaves out of each blade.</li>
            <li>these blades are cheap but outstanding quality and provide an close, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>I shave about 5-6 days a week, and it&#x27;s easy for me to get 2 weeks out of a blade.</li>
            <li>Hot water, good lather, and a good sharp blade like the &amp;#34;shark&amp;#34; makes for a good, clean comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>great others are dull but none of them are good for more than one shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am very pleased with the Shark Stainless Steel blades.  </li>
            <li>Some great Blades for and old but great grooming standard</li>
            <li>The packaging these blades came in was pretty nice.  </li>
            <li>Of the many brands I&#x27;ve tried now, these have been the most consistent and sharpest.  </li>
            <li>They worked fine</li>
            <li>They seem to work fine.</li>
            <li>and I would definitely reccomend a variety package first to find what works best for you.</li>
            <li>for the price, fine....</li>
            <li>Super close shave, without slicing up my face!</li>
            <li>They fit my razor and they cut my beard fine.</li>
            <li>Accurately described on website.  </li>
            <li>I would buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped fast &amp; combined shipping was nice.</li>
            <li>I bought this superpack as I really enjoy the shark brand blades for my DE razor.  </li>
            <li>These work great for me, but every face is going to shave different.</li>
            <li>Always provides a smooth shave every time</li>
            <li>With my wet shave combination of merkur razor armed with these shark razors,  proraso pre-shave cream, Truefitt &amp; Hill shaving cream, and Geo F Trumper skin food; my morning shave experience is simply incredible.</li>
            <li>I have a coarse beard, and these blades are great for the price.</li>
            <li>These blades work great for one time use only.</li>
            <li>this is the one for me,  The 100 blades should last me for about two years so not having to worry about buying blades will be great.</li>
            <li>Cheap, but don&#x27;t hold an edge.</li>
            <li>(Thus there is no \\&quot;confirmed</li>
            <li>And as for the product, Shark is a great brand for blades according to my husband,he uses them regularly.</li>
            <li>I went through a variety pack of DE blades, so I have sampled just about all the brands available.  </li>
            <li>This was a fantastic buy.</li>
            <li>, I bought this 100 pack of blades so that I wouldnt run out for a while and as far as the quality of the product they cut just as good as the blades I buy in a 5 pack at cvs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far for me this and the Astra Superior Platinum are my favorites.</li>
            <li>The blades work excellent as expected and for 100 blades the price was right</li>
            <li>I will return to using Feathers, but these are a very good value for someone who does not like &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; sharp blades.</li>
            <li>This blade seemed to be giving me a very smooth shave and felt great when I was using it, but once I wiped the lather off my neck I could feel just how much of the stubble was left.</li>
            <li>These are not as good in my Shaving factory razor as they are in a vintage brass Gillette, Feather blades are best overall, but these are a very close second, and for the price, you can&#x27;t complain!</li>
            <li>I would suggest to those new to safety razors to buy a variety pack of different blades to figure out which works best for your skin and beard type.</li>
            <li>No surprises here for me, first used these blades in a sampler pack and love them.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that many of the people here reviewing this product, are first time users.</li>
            <li>Not the original shark blades.  </li>
            <li>They still give a close clean shave around them without changing pressure or having to shave around them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Gillette Silver Blue, Wilkinson Sword (Wal-Mart), Merkur and these are by far the best.</li>
            <li>I just bought a large supply because I am so satisfied with this blade.</li>
            <li>on my first shave i experienced seven deep gashes on my face and neck.</li>
            <li>cool  </li>
            <li>Works very well :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these Shark blades for over two years now and they shave perfectly for my thick beard.</li>
            <li>The blade does a good job of clearing out the foliage without multiple passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The next day he came to work and told me &amp;#34;I had forgotten what it was like to get a good shave&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting strictly on the Shark stainless blades - there are too many variables.  </li>
            <li>They refunded the full amount, so there was no problem with the seller in that area.</li>
            <li>This is as opposed to the Feathers that tested a full 40% sharper.</li>
            <li>No they are not bad.</li>
            <li>they were not bad at all, and i will keep them for backups.</li>
            <li>Not bad buts</li>
            <li>Great price and super sharp.</li>
            <li>Very sharp, very cheap, very pleased.  </li>
            <li>Shark Super Chrome blades came with my Parker razor.</li>
            <li>face is different, so finding the perfect blade is definitely trial and error.  </li>
            <li>These are the best double edge blades that I have personally used.  </li>
            <li>If I come up with a good edge durability test I may be back because I&#x27;m just having to much fun with all this testing.</li>
            <li>I cannot get more than 5 on the Feather blades that are so highly rated.</li>
            <li>they are very effective the giving extremely close shave</li>
            <li>I consistently get baby smooth shaves.</li>
            <li>This razor is a mid to high range razor that is for experienced shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Atra and Derby, which were fine; however, Shark has been the most consistent so far.</li>
            <li>100 razors that will last me a year or more for the price!</li>
            <li>Wow!!!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The one thing that could be better is the packaging, instead of coming in a plastic box with a neat little slot to insert used blades, they come in a cardboard box which isn&#x27;t as handy, I wrap the used blade in the wax paper and toss it in the garbage rather than inserting it into the slot on the cardboard box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I get more than a week&#x27;s worth of shaves out of these and as long as they&#x27;re kept clean they give a smooth, close shave</li>
            <li>This mixed with a good lather is great although I would not recommend then to new comers because they are really sharp.</li>
            <li>The company that sells the sharpness tester (my instrument is the one designed to test straight edge razors) says that they are going to make additional test media available on Amazon</li>
            <li>Practically a year&#x27;s worth of shaving blades for $10.</li>
            <li>Personal preference is probably important when choosing your &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; or favorite blade</li>
            <li>It worked, it works and it does so economically.</li>
            <li>well worth what i paid.</li>
            <li>After using the Shark blades, I still believe that I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>I have an extremely wiry/coarse beard and, after testing out about 10 different blades, these are the ones which cut the best with the fewest nicks/irritation.</li>
            <li>I mistakenly purchased these -- Super Stainless -- blades, not noticing that they differ from the Super Chrome.</li>
            <li>, this goes for both the super stainless and super chrome shark blades.</li>
            <li>Overall they&#x27;re good decent blades for what i paid for.</li>
            <li>Super sharp and super cheap, what more could an hairy man like myself want?</li>
            <li>a good price, however they are not as sharp as the feather blades I have.</li>
            <li>blades are a good value they are sharp and well made</li>
            <li>These felt smoother right away</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting feather&#x27;s, astro&#x27;s, silver blues, and others that pull right out of the packaging</li>
            <li>they are also priced right so that you can use them for one or two shaves.</li>
            <li>that isn&#x27;t right for the blade.</li>
            <li>Right out of the package it hurts to shave with them.  </li>
            <li>At the time I bought these, they were about half the price of a similar quantity of Feathers, making them an excellent value.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was fast and the display board the 5 packs are mounted on is cool.</li>
            <li>I use these in a Edwin Jagger DE87 and a Feather popular (long handle, for my head).</li>
            <li>Good place for the price seem pretty sharp</li>
            <li>I really liked these Shark DE blades and plan to stick with them for the long hall.</li>
            <li>Very sharp give a good close shave.</li>
            <li>Good blades, very sharp</li>
            <li>Very little irritation post clearing, and a very nice shave.</li>
            <li>I love these for my straight edge razor and for my husband&#x27;s old school razor.</li>
            <li>I would recommend their Shark&#x27;s Chrome blades over their Super Stainless any day.</li>
            <li>Price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>Every morning he spent more than a couple of minutes carefully maneuvering his blade around his face to result a nice clean shave that left a tad bit more stubble than a disposable razor.</li>
            <li>They probably would have gotten a higher rating...</li>
            <li>These are my favorite double edged blades.</li>
            <li>So try a bunch of different blades to find your favorite one.</li>
            <li>They shaved the hair on my face pretty well</li>
            <li>Exactly as describe</li>
            <li>just like the shave from a different blade better</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve saved so much money!</li>
            <li>Shark double edge razor blades are my favorite blades to shave.  </li>
            <li>It takes me an extra pass or two on the neck to get a perfect shave than usual but they don&#x27;t nick me up or leave me with a bunch of razor burn.</li>
            <li>The first shave was so much better then the Merkur blades (remember all blades react differently to everyone).</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>About the only ones better are, I believe, Feather.</li>
            <li>I will start with the most obvious: this is a bargain blade.</li>
            <li>The longer the cream stays on your face, the longer you hover over a hot basin of water; the longer the smell of your shaving cream will stick around.</li>
            <li>I will admit, when I first started using these I tried to get three or four shaves out of them.</li>
            <li>The longer the cream stays on your face, the longer you hover over a hot basin of water; the longer the smell of your shaving cream will stick around.</li>
            <li>I will admit, when I first started using these I tried to get three or four shaves out of them.</li>
            <li>Even when first taken from wrapper you can till no expense was incurred by the manufacturer in making this blade.</li>
            <li>I received better results from a Wal-Mart multi-bladed \\&quot;red dot\\&quot; razor.  </li>
            <li>but evidently these are for reselling on a retail level and not just buying in bulk</li>
            <li>These blades are great and last long.</li>
            <li>i will definitely buy more if i ever run out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of blades these are among my top 3 preferences, can&#x27;t beat $10 for what will probably last me close to 2 years.</li>
            <li>I can get a few good shaves out of each one.</li>
            <li>very clean shave, blades last about 5 days</li>
            <li>The Blade is nice and sharp.</li>
            <li>Nice and sharp.  </li>
            <li>These blades came with the stainless steel double edge razor I bought here on Amazon (can&#x27;t find them in the drugs stores any more)</li>
            <li>, I have to change them far more frequently than I did my Feather blades</li>
            <li>I switched back to the Astra blades and was back to a very comfortable, smooth, and close shave.  </li>
            <li>I really recommend these blades because this is the first time in my life I can shave without irritation.</li>
            <li>You can usually get 100 packs of them for a good price.</li>
            <li>The super stainless are superior and well worth the extra few dollars.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a tangent of the first thing and taking shorter more careful strokes, it will take a longer time to shave.</li>
            <li>As a tangent of the first thing and taking shorter more careful strokes, it will take a longer time to shave.</li>
            <li>Most are single use blades.</li>
            <li>Try an Astra Stainless Steel blade and you will realize how comfortable a shave can actually be.</li>
            <li>Depending on how much you shave and how often you change out your blades...</li>
            <li>Compare that to how much you&#x27;d spend on disposable or cartridge razors...</li>
            <li>the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li>really like.</li>
            <li>They just didn&#x27;t cut very well for me.</li>
            <li>I can only get one smooth shave from them without replacement.</li>
            <li>Plus, at the cost per blade, it&#x27;s very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>This is why I love wet shaving.</li>
            <li>This stainless blades made by shark</li>
            <li>The lettering is very blurry on both the packaging and the blades.</li>
            <li>and I really hope these are knock-offs.</li>
            <li>I really feel if you haven&#x27;t been shaving with safety razors for a while then you shouldn&#x27;t be reviewing.</li>
            <li>I get a much closer, cleaner, even shave out of the Astra brand over the Shark brand.</li>
            <li>I have not used them yet, but will very soon.  </li>
            <li>I ended up throwing them straight in the garbage.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like the Personna&#x27;s because they are made in the US.</li>
            <li>Cuts really well</li>
            <li>This blade is very inconsistent.  </li>
            <li>And very inexpensive compared to the newer razors.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>all you really have to do is let the razor do the work.</li>
            <li>Stainless steel.</li>
            <li>However the blades for the Wal-Mart razor are considerably more expensive and the razor itself does not have as nice a feel as the Merkur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since</li>
            <li>I get a good 1-2 weeks out of one blade and have a thick beard.</li>
            <li>They are not nearly as sharp or durable as the Super Chrome.</li>
            <li>Sharp, very smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Shaving with a safety razor in Egypt is considered high class, its often a rite of passage for business men to receive a high end brush from their father when they get their first job.</li>
            <li>Shaving with a safety razor in Egypt is considered high class, its often a rite of passage for business men to receive a high end brush from their father when they get their first job.</li>
            <li>I originally used Feathers but after not noticing the shipping time on a recent order I need some blades in a hurry.</li>
            <li>and they seem to stay sharper than many of the other brands of DE blades.</li>
            <li>sharp, anti-rust, and there&#x27;s so many of them in the package that it&#x27;ll be a year or so until i need to worry about pricing again.</li>
            <li>I deduced that these blades did, in fact, cut quite more uniformly and smoothly due to the lack of skin irritation and abrasions that would be susceptible to my aftershave.</li>
            <li>However I cannot give more than 4 stars due to the packaging of the blades and the fact that I am getting some pulling from the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you do - - feel free to go to Art of Shaving at your local high end mall and pay 5$ for a blade.shorter pulls.</li>

            <li>Had forgotten how clean, smootha double edged system could be.</li>
            <li>These are long lasting and really nice.</li>
            <li>Superior in their consistency, I&#x27;m thankful to find a blade that can survive two shaves and not have to pay a ridiculous price.</li>
            <li>I love the way these blades cut, however i&#x27;m not a fan of how quickly they dull.</li>
            <li>These blades are very sharp, and do a good job in my (Double Edge) razors.</li>
            <li>Great price hard to find locally</li>
            <li>Bought a 25 blade verity pack and have many bad shaves and a couple good ones.</li>
            <li>They seem to have less &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; than the Personna and give a better shave.</li>
            <li>These blades are less than OK.  </li>
            <li>Sharks are decent.</li>
            <li>Spend the extra 2-cents per blade and buy the Super Chrome.</li>
            <li>Decent blades.  </li>
            <li>The Sharks are decent blades.</li>
            <li>I just went back to using a double edge razor after many years.</li>
            <li>These are decent.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Super Stainless\\&quot; Shark Double Edge Razor Blades (pack of 100) that I received as a gift.  </li>
            <li>but I have to go pretty high on my face and pretty low on my neck.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend giving these blades a try to see if they are for you</li>
            <li>These are high quality Egyptian blades.</li>
            <li>The blade catches and pulls way too much compared to a carbon steel blade, I stay away like they&#x27;re rusty old hack jobs</li>
            <li>I have a fairly heavy beard, and these blades work better for me than the Shark Chrome.</li>
            <li>but lately I was thinking about the great shave I used to get with my old double edge butterfly safety razor.  </li>
            <li>I will not have to buy any more blades for a few years.</li>
            <li>I would rate these just below the Feather blades for my face overall but worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>In fact, the somewhat anecdotal  preliminary tests I have conducted indicate that the superior edge on a Feather goes away very rapidly and much more rapidly than that of the less expensive brands but don&#x27;t chisel that in stone just yet.  </li>
            <li>Excellent, very sharp, smooth, and long lasting saving a lot of money by not buying the super expensive multi blade refills.</li>
            <li>There is a slight amount of tug, but not as much as another cheap</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smaller boxes (5 blades each) are easy to open to extract a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other competitors like Wilkinson Sword and the Van Der Hagen Ice-Tempered \\&quot;Blitz\\&quot; blades last many shaves, and perform very well.</li>
            <li>I know every face is different and requires the right blade</li>
            <li>They are sharp and cheap.  </li>
            <li>To say that I have spent more than a few minutes reading through the reviews for this blade would be an embarrassing statement, however it would be true.</li>
            <li>Sharp, cheap and they cut off the hair on my face.</li>
            <li>SMOOTH, SHARP, NO PULL</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say anything bad about these blades they give ME a very good shave.  </li>
            <li>If youre new to the safety razor world, def.</li>
            <li>have a light-to-medium beard, and use shaving cream from an aerosol can (I received shaving soap and a brush along with the gift but am using up existing supplies of aerosol before using the new soap).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but with 90 blades to go in this pack, I&#x27;m throwing them out in favor of a new pack of Merkur.</li>
            <li>Have to be careful , but gives clean shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m starting to see inconsistencies in even the feather blades that so many recommend.  </li>
            <li>Broke out some very old Personna blades and used them.</li>
            <li>Initially they seem to be as good as the German Merkur, but they don&#x27;t seem to last as long.</li>
            <li>For the price, I toss them after three shaves and grab a new one, but I have a pretty coarse beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Shark Super Stainless though cut cleanly, smoothly and last through at least 5 shaves for me.  </li>
            <li>After only 3 shaves the first blade was already giving me problems.  </li>
            <li>Old school shaving is the way to go!</li>
            <li>I was tempted to pull it out right after I shaved, but thought that perhaps I hadn&#x27;t let my beard soften in the foam as long as I believed; I really waited longer than normal the next shave with exactly the same results!  </li>
            <li>THESE BLADES ARE VERY SHARP AND PROVIDE A SMOOTH SHAVE.</li>
            <li>My Merkur 180 came with a a Merkur blade, after my first shave I wasn&#x27;t 100% sold on the whole art of wet shaving.</li>
            <li>The first time you use it, if you are stepping down from a &#x27;higher quality&#x27; blade (one that has been &#x27;electromagnetically tested&#x27;)</li>
            <li>Yes they are sharp &amp; they are named for a really cool fish.</li>
            <li>I get at most 2-3 shaves before the blade is noticeably dull.  </li>
            <li>Not quite as sharp as the Shark carbon steel blades but also not as quick to cut.</li>
            <li>Bright, flashy packaging, but</li>
            <li>While these blades were not my absolute favorites, every face is different.</li>
            <li>I get from shaving has almost completely gone away.</li>
            <li>I am very concerned about using a product, that could potentially cut my skin, knowing that it was not sealed, let alone sterilized.  </li>
            <li>As nearly every one of these reviews will tell you...</li>
            <li>i am 88 years old and have been shaving since i was sixteen, butneve thad an experience like this.</li>
            <li>far as longevity of the blade goes, seems to me</li>
            <li>All I can really say is that after trying lots of different blades</li>
            <li>so it is important to note that I can only give an opinion as to the effectiveness of this razor-and-blade combination; a different razor might give different results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>what works really well for one guy might not for the next.</li>
            <li>so this pack will last a whole year.</li>
            <li>B009CCFW14 TRIG Silver Edge Stainless Double Edge Razor Blades (100)]]</li>
            <li>Remember shaving with the old Gillette blades?  </li>
            <li>These by far give me the closest shave.</li>
            <li>Old fashion can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>These came out near the bottom for me.  </li>
            <li>These blades are much sharper than the ones I was buying at my local store, and they stay sharper for longer as well.  </li>
            <li>Nice thin blades.  </li>
            <li>Okay, so I guess that mean&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I tried them out, and did find them to be quite prone to gliding all over and cutting very nicely.  </li>
            <li>The first is that your pulls will drag and nick if you go too far, the solution to this is to take shorter pulls.</li>
            <li>A few hours later my face feels great with hardly any razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I normally use wilkinson sword razor blades and just assumed all blades were the same.</li>
            <li>Only was able to shave one side of my face before blade started to dull.</li>
            <li>Anyone new to double edge shaving needs to know that no blade works well with every skin and beard type.</li>
            <li>every face is different so a sampler pack is a must when experimenting with new razors.</li>
            <li>A new blade will pull and tear at my face and it hurts to shave my upper lip.  </li>
            <li>Not sharp.</li>
            <li>pretty sharp and flexible.</li>
            <li>There are other Shark vendors in Amazon that market their product as Shark Super Chrome (not super stainless) and</li>
            <li>I have also tried the more expensive Shark Super Chrome blades and they aren&#x27;t bad, but the Super Stainless cut just a little more</li>
            <li>I laugh every time I put a new one in my razor thinking of all the suckers paying $2.50 for the Mach7 blades that are far inferior.</li>
            <li>I generally use them for 2-3 days/blade but as always YMMV</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m barely getting any nicks at all.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat the price on these blades, far cheaper than the Gillette Sensor blades I formerly used.</li>
            <li>If your old enough, you will remember when your father would come home with a 15 pack of Gillette Razors and a can of shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Shark blades pull a bit on my skin and require multiple passes to get a complete shave; this may be a function of the Merkur 180 razor in combination with these blades, or it may just be that the Shark blades don&#x27;t work as well as I would like on my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have only gone though 2 of them so far.</li>
            <li>I switched back to the old time  shaving method  </li>
            <li>Barely got 2 shaves from a razor</li>
            <li>If you feel you know the curves and contours of your face and have spent a decent amount of time learning your way around a safety razor, but don&#x27;t want to push out the 1$/blade average higher end stuff can cost - - these blades are for you.</li>
            <li>Sharp but not too much, never get a cut or nick with them.</li>
            <li>but these are plenty sharp, I&#x27;ll probably use the whole 100 pack before trying anything else.</li>
            <li>They are effective on my tough beard with minimal skin irritation.  </li>
            <li>Background: I have coarse facial hair with mildly sensitive skin, I used a homemade pre shave oil and Proraso shaving cream.</li>
            <li>this was a big disappointment to my husband who had loved this type of razor years ago.</li>
            <li>I find these are not nearly sharp enough and, as a result</li>
            <li>After a long bout of suffering the multi blade blues, I decided to return to the old way of shaving.</li>
            <li>When I say first time user, I mean someone who has gone out on a whim and bought a safety razor, brush, bowl, and some blades and gone at their face like they normally would with a traditional razor.</li>
            <li>They seem to dull faster than the Israeli blades, but they&#x27;re half the cost and are better initially, so these will be my new bladse of choice as long as they don&#x27;t change.</li>
            <li>Has perforated ends so that you can snap in half to use with a straight razor that accepts them.</li>
            <li>Now, these Shark blades cost me about half as much</li>
            <li>It was time to order some new blades, I&#x27;ve used about 300 7 AMs, and several different (overpriced) drugstore offerings of no particular label.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several different double edged blades, some were very expensive, and these were as good as any I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>These blades are very sharp and they last pretty long before they need to be changed out.</li>
            <li>facial hair isn&#x27;t super dense, but the hairs themselves are thick and coarse.</li>
            <li>The package is slightly banged up but the small razor boxes are fine.</li>

            <li> That being said, these blades work best for me.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Con: probably not the best if you are prone to razor bumps.</li>
            <li> These are the best razors.</li>
            <li> Best bang for the buck!  </li>
            <li> Great quality!!!</li>
            <li> I will stick with feather blades as they are the best I have found after 4 years of using a safety razor.</li>
            <li> But for the price these are a great buy!</li>
            <li> I use them in conjunction with the Parker 99R and have gotten the best shave ever.  </li>

            <li> great price</li>
            <li> /&gt;You may ask yourself, how does one know if they are an experienced shaver?</li>
            <li> Amazing how the best technology is not always the newest!</li>
            <li> As luck would have it I found a great buy on a razor which included a package of Shark blades (I did not know anything about them</li>
            <li> lol.</li>
            <li> Excellent shave at an astounding price.  </li>
            <li> both make great creams.  </li>
            <li> PRODUCT AT A GREAT PRICE.</li>
            <li> Great cut.</li>
            <li> Great price.</li>

            <li> GREAT BLADES</li>
            <li> These are some great razor blades.</li>
            <li> Great.</li>
            <li> This is a great bargain at a good price.</li>
            <li> Great blades and good price</li>
            <li> Price is good.</li>
            <li> My dad loved it.</li>
            <li> Good quality and value.</li>
            <li> I bought a ton of these, and good thing, they work well.  </li>
            <li> Good blades do the job.</li>
            <li> Which is surprising because they are the cheapest.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, this is a good thing.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, this is a good thing.</li>
            <li> good quantity for the price</li>
            <li> Good Price and good blades</li>
            <li> gives good shave.</li>
            <li> Good value blade.</li>
            <li> Thought I was getting a good deal</li>
            <li> They are a good blade an I will continue to buy them at this price point.</li>
            <li> Good trade off.</li>
            <li> These blades do their job, and the price is good, but</li>
            <li> gave a 4 start rating because as I said, they do their job, and the price is good, but it doesn&#x27;t come with anything to dispose of the blades.  </li>
            <li> Work good for my course beard.</li>
            <li> good every day blades</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re good for 1 or 2 shaves then you will need to replace them.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the shark &amp;#34;super chrome&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get the good shave I used to get.  </li>
            <li> I was a barber for 40 years, so I think I can judge a good blade when I use one, and these are a good blade, at a good price.</li>
            <li> The Shark came with a Parker razor I bought and gave me a wonderful shave the very first time.  </li>
            <li> Great price for a very comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> Sure makes kissing much more enjoyable!!!</li>
            <li> I have smooth skin and this of ideal quality and economy.</li>
            <li> A top notch product!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my straight razor!</li>
            <li> Love them!</li>
            <li> Exactly what was described and works great according to my husband also great value for the quantity</li>
            <li> amazing value, and quality blades.</li>
            <li> These blades are great for me, so smooth that it feels like there isn&#x27;t a blade in my razor.</li>
            <li> Amazing price</li>
            <li> Amazing amounts of blades for the price.</li>
            <li> However, it wasn&#x27;t the amazing bargain that I had hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> This is just my opinion, but these are seriously amazing.</li>
            <li> make a  real comfortable shave,not jaws at all</li>
            <li> I like the razor blades sent, I get a nice shave &amp;</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the absolute best for everyone but based on my uses of it</li>
            <li> To be honest when I saw &#x27;Made in Egypt&#x27;</li>
            <li> Think of shaving as a time to meditate and learn your own body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Think of shaving as a time to meditate and learn your own body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Paired nicely with my vintage gillette fat boy.</li>
            <li> we like the product and honest mistakes</li>
            <li> Nicely packaged.</li>
            <li> I bought these blades because, like most people who probably come across this on Amazon, it was too good of a bargain to pass up.</li>
            <li> They give a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> feathers are much much better, astra blades almost as good.</li>
            <li> Not a bad deal 10 cents for a great shave.</li>
            <li> Shark is probably the best bang for the buck because they cost the least of the three brands I like best.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m fine with switching them out to keep a good shave.</li>
            <li> I saw a review for Shark, and noticed how someone stated they glided quite nicely and were sharper than most.  </li>
            <li> I have tried others but these are the best for me so far.</li>
            <li> In my Parker razor handle they are the best by far.</li>
            <li> Incredible product, i love it so much.</li>
            <li> a much closer shave good product good price</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect a super premium close shave like you would with Feather or Merkur blades!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many many blades in my razor over the years, these are almost the best so far, as with most blades, they work well in one razor, but not all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying many blades, and Shark Super Stainless are the best for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;These razors give a really great, very close shave.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite blades.</li>
            <li> It comes as a store display so you can hang it on your wall, which I greatly enjoyed.</li>
            <li> Much better than the name brand disposables.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and I&#x27;m glad I purchased these.</li>
            <li> 2 shaves from bottom to top before it gets close to needing to be changed.</li>
            <li> I bought his because I love mine</li>
            <li> These are OK.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth a test run for anyone looking for a good blade.</li>
            <li> The shark blades are awesome when used properly</li>
            <li> though - might try these in Platinum coat if you&#x27;re looking for a more &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried all of the most popular blades, but none of them really fit.  </li>
            <li> But, in the &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; category these are my favorite.</li>
            <li> Their face will look like Swiss cheese after, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> The feathers are sharper and cost more.</li>
            <li> I have used over 18 different razors and sharks are the best in my book</li>
            <li> In my opinion, the Astra blades are much better.</li>
            <li> I love them.  </li>
            <li> theres better, not consistant in the sharpness.</li>
            <li> then I strop them to get 3-5 more.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite blades.</li>
            <li> happen :)</li>
            <li> I bought a tester pack with many brands of DE razors and these were probably the dullest ones in the pack.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many double edged blades and these work best for me.</li>
            <li> I have placed these in the backup blade bin, in case I run out of my favorite, which is the Trig blade.</li>
            <li> I have two more packages of these, but am throwing them out.  </li>
            <li> I have used the and l am satisfied with results.</li>
            <li> I love these.  </li>
            <li> I have found nothing works better than the shark.</li>
            <li> great product fast shipping</li>
            <li> Check out more clearance shaving supplies at.</li>
            <li> Love the Shark razor, stays sharper longer.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t snap easily, but a tin snips cuts through them very easily.</li>
            <li> gives nice clean cuts...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high hopes, but these blades have given me consistently great</li>
            <li> I use them in a microtouch one razor with pretty good results.  </li>
            <li> These are a good price, give me a good shave, and last longer than Feathers.</li>
            <li> These blades are pretty cool my son uses them to shave hes happy with them</li>
            <li> Overall I would say they&#x27;re a good buy and are good quality.</li>
            <li> I recently started using the DE razors and found these to be very good blades for me.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why they come free with most razors.</li>
            <li> I also use Shark singles in my Parker disposable blade straight razor about once a week, and it is also good.</li>
            <li> Sharp, shaves close, excellent shave with no nicks or irritation.  </li>
            <li> Plenty sharp, and the price is awesome.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of blades with my other razors and these are some of the best.  </li>
            <li> can easily make 4 shaves out of each blade.</li>
            <li> these blades are cheap but outstanding quality and provide an close, comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I shave about 5-6 days a week, and it&#x27;s easy for me to get 2 weeks out of a blade.</li>
            <li> Hot water, good lather, and a good sharp blade like the &amp;#34;shark&amp;#34; makes for a good, clean comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> great others are dull but none of them are good for more than one shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am very pleased with the Shark Stainless Steel blades.  </li>
            <li> Some great Blades for and old but great grooming standard</li>
            <li> The packaging these blades came in was pretty nice.  </li>
            <li> Of the many brands I&#x27;ve tried now, these have been the most consistent and sharpest.  </li>
            <li> They worked fine</li>
            <li> They seem to work fine.</li>
            <li> and I would definitely reccomend a variety package first to find what works best for you.</li>
            <li> for the price, fine....</li>
            <li> Super close shave, without slicing up my face!</li>
            <li> They fit my razor and they cut my beard fine.</li>
            <li> Accurately described on website.  </li>
            <li> I would buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped fast &amp; combined shipping was nice.</li>
            <li> I bought this superpack as I really enjoy the shark brand blades for my DE razor.  </li>
            <li> These work great for me, but every face is going to shave different.</li>
            <li> Always provides a smooth shave every time</li>
            <li> With my wet shave combination of merkur razor armed with these shark razors,  proraso pre-shave cream, Truefitt &amp; Hill shaving cream, and Geo F Trumper skin food; my morning shave experience is simply incredible.</li>
            <li> I have a coarse beard, and these blades are great for the price.</li>
            <li> These blades work great for one time use only.</li>
            <li> this is the one for me,  The 100 blades should last me for about two years so not having to worry about buying blades will be great.</li>
            <li> Cheap, but don&#x27;t hold an edge.</li>
            <li> (Thus there is no \\&quot;confirmed</li>
            <li> And as for the product, Shark is a great brand for blades according to my husband,he uses them regularly.</li>
            <li> I went through a variety pack of DE blades, so I have sampled just about all the brands available.  </li>
            <li> This was a fantastic buy.</li>
            <li> , I bought this 100 pack of blades so that I wouldnt run out for a while and as far as the quality of the product they cut just as good as the blades I buy in a 5 pack at cvs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far for me this and the Astra Superior Platinum are my favorites.</li>
            <li> The blades work excellent as expected and for 100 blades the price was right</li>
            <li> I will return to using Feathers, but these are a very good value for someone who does not like &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; sharp blades.</li>
            <li> This blade seemed to be giving me a very smooth shave and felt great when I was using it, but once I wiped the lather off my neck I could feel just how much of the stubble was left.</li>
            <li> These are not as good in my Shaving factory razor as they are in a vintage brass Gillette, Feather blades are best overall, but these are a very close second, and for the price, you can&#x27;t complain!</li>
            <li> I would suggest to those new to safety razors to buy a variety pack of different blades to figure out which works best for your skin and beard type.</li>
            <li> No surprises here for me, first used these blades in a sampler pack and love them.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that many of the people here reviewing this product, are first time users.</li>
            <li> Not the original shark blades.  </li>
            <li> They still give a close clean shave around them without changing pressure or having to shave around them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Gillette Silver Blue, Wilkinson Sword (Wal-Mart), Merkur and these are by far the best.</li>
            <li> I just bought a large supply because I am so satisfied with this blade.</li>
            <li> on my first shave i experienced seven deep gashes on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> cool  </li>
            <li> Works very well :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these Shark blades for over two years now and they shave perfectly for my thick beard.</li>
            <li> The blade does a good job of clearing out the foliage without multiple passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The next day he came to work and told me &amp;#34;I had forgotten what it was like to get a good shave&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting strictly on the Shark stainless blades - there are too many variables.  </li>
            <li> They refunded the full amount, so there was no problem with the seller in that area.</li>
            <li> This is as opposed to the Feathers that tested a full 40% sharper.</li>
            <li> No they are not bad.</li>
            <li> they were not bad at all, and i will keep them for backups.</li>
            <li> Not bad buts</li>
            <li> Great price and super sharp.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, very cheap, very pleased.  </li>
            <li> Shark Super Chrome blades came with my Parker razor.</li>
            <li> face is different, so finding the perfect blade is definitely trial and error.  </li>
            <li> These are the best double edge blades that I have personally used.  </li>
            <li> If I come up with a good edge durability test I may be back because I&#x27;m just having to much fun with all this testing.</li>
            <li> I cannot get more than 5 on the Feather blades that are so highly rated.</li>
            <li> they are very effective the giving extremely close shave</li>
            <li> I consistently get baby smooth shaves.</li>
            <li> This razor is a mid to high range razor that is for experienced shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Atra and Derby, which were fine; however, Shark has been the most consistent so far.</li>
            <li> 100 razors that will last me a year or more for the price!</li>
            <li> Wow!!!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The one thing that could be better is the packaging, instead of coming in a plastic box with a neat little slot to insert used blades, they come in a cardboard box which isn&#x27;t as handy, I wrap the used blade in the wax paper and toss it in the garbage rather than inserting it into the slot on the cardboard box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I get more than a week&#x27;s worth of shaves out of these and as long as they&#x27;re kept clean they give a smooth, close shave</li>
            <li> This mixed with a good lather is great although I would not recommend then to new comers because they are really sharp.</li>
            <li> The company that sells the sharpness tester (my instrument is the one designed to test straight edge razors) says that they are going to make additional test media available on Amazon</li>
            <li> Practically a year&#x27;s worth of shaving blades for $10.</li>
            <li> Personal preference is probably important when choosing your &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; or favorite blade</li>
            <li> It worked, it works and it does so economically.</li>
            <li> well worth what i paid.</li>
            <li> After using the Shark blades, I still believe that I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> I have an extremely wiry/coarse beard and, after testing out about 10 different blades, these are the ones which cut the best with the fewest nicks/irritation.</li>
            <li> I mistakenly purchased these -- Super Stainless -- blades, not noticing that they differ from the Super Chrome.</li>
            <li> , this goes for both the super stainless and super chrome shark blades.</li>
            <li> Overall they&#x27;re good decent blades for what i paid for.</li>
            <li> Super sharp and super cheap, what more could an hairy man like myself want?</li>
            <li> a good price, however they are not as sharp as the feather blades I have.</li>
            <li> blades are a good value they are sharp and well made</li>
            <li> These felt smoother right away</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting feather&#x27;s, astro&#x27;s, silver blues, and others that pull right out of the packaging</li>
            <li> they are also priced right so that you can use them for one or two shaves.</li>
            <li> that isn&#x27;t right for the blade.</li>
            <li> Right out of the package it hurts to shave with them.  </li>
            <li> At the time I bought these, they were about half the price of a similar quantity of Feathers, making them an excellent value.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was fast and the display board the 5 packs are mounted on is cool.</li>
            <li> I use these in a Edwin Jagger DE87 and a Feather popular (long handle, for my head).</li>
            <li> Good place for the price seem pretty sharp</li>
            <li> I really liked these Shark DE blades and plan to stick with them for the long hall.</li>
            <li> Very sharp give a good close shave.</li>
            <li> Good blades, very sharp</li>
            <li> Very little irritation post clearing, and a very nice shave.</li>
            <li> I love these for my straight edge razor and for my husband&#x27;s old school razor.</li>
            <li> I would recommend their Shark&#x27;s Chrome blades over their Super Stainless any day.</li>
            <li> Price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Every morning he spent more than a couple of minutes carefully maneuvering his blade around his face to result a nice clean shave that left a tad bit more stubble than a disposable razor.</li>
            <li> They probably would have gotten a higher rating...</li>
            <li> These are my favorite double edged blades.</li>
            <li> So try a bunch of different blades to find your favorite one.</li>
            <li> They shaved the hair on my face pretty well</li>
            <li> Exactly as describe</li>
            <li> just like the shave from a different blade better</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve saved so much money!</li>
            <li> Shark double edge razor blades are my favorite blades to shave.  </li>
            <li> It takes me an extra pass or two on the neck to get a perfect shave than usual but they don&#x27;t nick me up or leave me with a bunch of razor burn.</li>
            <li> The first shave was so much better then the Merkur blades (remember all blades react differently to everyone).</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> About the only ones better are, I believe, Feather.</li>
            <li> I will start with the most obvious: this is a bargain blade.</li>
            <li> The longer the cream stays on your face, the longer you hover over a hot basin of water; the longer the smell of your shaving cream will stick around.</li>
            <li> I will admit, when I first started using these I tried to get three or four shaves out of them.</li>
            <li> The longer the cream stays on your face, the longer you hover over a hot basin of water; the longer the smell of your shaving cream will stick around.</li>
            <li> I will admit, when I first started using these I tried to get three or four shaves out of them.</li>
            <li> Even when first taken from wrapper you can till no expense was incurred by the manufacturer in making this blade.</li>
            <li> I received better results from a Wal-Mart multi-bladed \\&quot;red dot\\&quot; razor.  </li>
            <li> but evidently these are for reselling on a retail level and not just buying in bulk</li>
            <li> These blades are great and last long.</li>
            <li> i will definitely buy more if i ever run out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of blades these are among my top 3 preferences, can&#x27;t beat $10 for what will probably last me close to 2 years.</li>
            <li> I can get a few good shaves out of each one.</li>
            <li> very clean shave, blades last about 5 days</li>
            <li> The Blade is nice and sharp.</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp.  </li>
            <li> These blades came with the stainless steel double edge razor I bought here on Amazon (can&#x27;t find them in the drugs stores any more)</li>
            <li> , I have to change them far more frequently than I did my Feather blades</li>
            <li> I switched back to the Astra blades and was back to a very comfortable, smooth, and close shave.  </li>
            <li> I really recommend these blades because this is the first time in my life I can shave without irritation.</li>
            <li> You can usually get 100 packs of them for a good price.</li>
            <li> The super stainless are superior and well worth the extra few dollars.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a tangent of the first thing and taking shorter more careful strokes, it will take a longer time to shave.</li>
            <li> As a tangent of the first thing and taking shorter more careful strokes, it will take a longer time to shave.</li>
            <li> Most are single use blades.</li>
            <li> Try an Astra Stainless Steel blade and you will realize how comfortable a shave can actually be.</li>
            <li> Depending on how much you shave and how often you change out your blades...</li>
            <li> Compare that to how much you&#x27;d spend on disposable or cartridge razors...</li>
            <li> the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> really like.</li>
            <li> They just didn&#x27;t cut very well for me.</li>
            <li> I can only get one smooth shave from them without replacement.</li>
            <li> Plus, at the cost per blade, it&#x27;s very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> This is why I love wet shaving.</li>
            <li> This stainless blades made by shark</li>
            <li> The lettering is very blurry on both the packaging and the blades.</li>
            <li> and I really hope these are knock-offs.</li>
            <li> I really feel if you haven&#x27;t been shaving with safety razors for a while then you shouldn&#x27;t be reviewing.</li>
            <li> I get a much closer, cleaner, even shave out of the Astra brand over the Shark brand.</li>
            <li> I have not used them yet, but will very soon.  </li>
            <li> I ended up throwing them straight in the garbage.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like the Personna&#x27;s because they are made in the US.</li>
            <li> Cuts really well</li>
            <li> This blade is very inconsistent.  </li>
            <li> And very inexpensive compared to the newer razors.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> all you really have to do is let the razor do the work.</li>
            <li> Stainless steel.</li>
            <li> However the blades for the Wal-Mart razor are considerably more expensive and the razor itself does not have as nice a feel as the Merkur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since</li>
            <li> I get a good 1-2 weeks out of one blade and have a thick beard.</li>
            <li> They are not nearly as sharp or durable as the Super Chrome.</li>
            <li> Sharp, very smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Shaving with a safety razor in Egypt is considered high class, its often a rite of passage for business men to receive a high end brush from their father when they get their first job.</li>
            <li> Shaving with a safety razor in Egypt is considered high class, its often a rite of passage for business men to receive a high end brush from their father when they get their first job.</li>
            <li> I originally used Feathers but after not noticing the shipping time on a recent order I need some blades in a hurry.</li>
            <li> and they seem to stay sharper than many of the other brands of DE blades.</li>
            <li> sharp, anti-rust, and there&#x27;s so many of them in the package that it&#x27;ll be a year or so until i need to worry about pricing again.</li>
            <li> I deduced that these blades did, in fact, cut quite more uniformly and smoothly due to the lack of skin irritation and abrasions that would be susceptible to my aftershave.</li>
            <li> However I cannot give more than 4 stars due to the packaging of the blades and the fact that I am getting some pulling from the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you do - - feel free to go to Art of Shaving at your local high end mall and pay 5$ for a blade.shorter pulls.</li>

            <li> Had forgotten how clean, smootha double edged system could be.</li>
            <li> These are long lasting and really nice.</li>
            <li> Superior in their consistency, I&#x27;m thankful to find a blade that can survive two shaves and not have to pay a ridiculous price.</li>
            <li> I love the way these blades cut, however i&#x27;m not a fan of how quickly they dull.</li>
            <li> These blades are very sharp, and do a good job in my (Double Edge) razors.</li>
            <li> Great price hard to find locally</li>
            <li> Bought a 25 blade verity pack and have many bad shaves and a couple good ones.</li>
            <li> They seem to have less &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; than the Personna and give a better shave.</li>
            <li> These blades are less than OK.  </li>
            <li> Sharks are decent.</li>
            <li> Spend the extra 2-cents per blade and buy the Super Chrome.</li>
            <li> Decent blades.  </li>
            <li> The Sharks are decent blades.</li>
            <li> I just went back to using a double edge razor after many years.</li>
            <li> These are decent.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Super Stainless\\&quot; Shark Double Edge Razor Blades (pack of 100) that I received as a gift.  </li>
            <li> but I have to go pretty high on my face and pretty low on my neck.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend giving these blades a try to see if they are for you</li>
            <li> These are high quality Egyptian blades.</li>
            <li> The blade catches and pulls way too much compared to a carbon steel blade, I stay away like they&#x27;re rusty old hack jobs</li>
            <li> I have a fairly heavy beard, and these blades work better for me than the Shark Chrome.</li>
            <li> but lately I was thinking about the great shave I used to get with my old double edge butterfly safety razor.  </li>
            <li> I will not have to buy any more blades for a few years.</li>
            <li> I would rate these just below the Feather blades for my face overall but worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> In fact, the somewhat anecdotal  preliminary tests I have conducted indicate that the superior edge on a Feather goes away very rapidly and much more rapidly than that of the less expensive brands but don&#x27;t chisel that in stone just yet.  </li>
            <li> Excellent, very sharp, smooth, and long lasting saving a lot of money by not buying the super expensive multi blade refills.</li>
            <li> There is a slight amount of tug, but not as much as another cheap</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smaller boxes (5 blades each) are easy to open to extract a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other competitors like Wilkinson Sword and the Van Der Hagen Ice-Tempered \\&quot;Blitz\\&quot; blades last many shaves, and perform very well.</li>
            <li> I know every face is different and requires the right blade</li>
            <li> They are sharp and cheap.  </li>
            <li> To say that I have spent more than a few minutes reading through the reviews for this blade would be an embarrassing statement, however it would be true.</li>
            <li> Sharp, cheap and they cut off the hair on my face.</li>
            <li> SMOOTH, SHARP, NO PULL</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say anything bad about these blades they give ME a very good shave.  </li>
            <li> If youre new to the safety razor world, def.</li>
            <li> have a light-to-medium beard, and use shaving cream from an aerosol can (I received shaving soap and a brush along with the gift but am using up existing supplies of aerosol before using the new soap).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but with 90 blades to go in this pack, I&#x27;m throwing them out in favor of a new pack of Merkur.</li>
            <li> Have to be careful , but gives clean shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to see inconsistencies in even the feather blades that so many recommend.  </li>
            <li> Broke out some very old Personna blades and used them.</li>
            <li> Initially they seem to be as good as the German Merkur, but they don&#x27;t seem to last as long.</li>
            <li> For the price, I toss them after three shaves and grab a new one, but I have a pretty coarse beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Shark Super Stainless though cut cleanly, smoothly and last through at least 5 shaves for me.  </li>
            <li> After only 3 shaves the first blade was already giving me problems.  </li>
            <li> Old school shaving is the way to go!</li>
            <li> I was tempted to pull it out right after I shaved, but thought that perhaps I hadn&#x27;t let my beard soften in the foam as long as I believed; I really waited longer than normal the next shave with exactly the same results!  </li>
            <li> THESE BLADES ARE VERY SHARP AND PROVIDE A SMOOTH SHAVE.</li>
            <li> My Merkur 180 came with a a Merkur blade, after my first shave I wasn&#x27;t 100% sold on the whole art of wet shaving.</li>
            <li> The first time you use it, if you are stepping down from a &#x27;higher quality&#x27; blade (one that has been &#x27;electromagnetically tested&#x27;)</li>
            <li> Yes they are sharp &amp; they are named for a really cool fish.</li>
            <li> I get at most 2-3 shaves before the blade is noticeably dull.  </li>
            <li> Not quite as sharp as the Shark carbon steel blades but also not as quick to cut.</li>
            <li> Bright, flashy packaging, but</li>
            <li> While these blades were not my absolute favorites, every face is different.</li>
            <li> I get from shaving has almost completely gone away.</li>
            <li> I am very concerned about using a product, that could potentially cut my skin, knowing that it was not sealed, let alone sterilized.  </li>
            <li> As nearly every one of these reviews will tell you...</li>
            <li> i am 88 years old and have been shaving since i was sixteen, butneve thad an experience like this.</li>
            <li> far as longevity of the blade goes, seems to me</li>
            <li> All I can really say is that after trying lots of different blades</li>
            <li> so it is important to note that I can only give an opinion as to the effectiveness of this razor-and-blade combination; a different razor might give different results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> what works really well for one guy might not for the next.</li>
            <li> so this pack will last a whole year.</li>
            <li> B009CCFW14 TRIG Silver Edge Stainless Double Edge Razor Blades (100)]]</li>
            <li> Remember shaving with the old Gillette blades?  </li>
            <li> These by far give me the closest shave.</li>
            <li> Old fashion can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> These came out near the bottom for me.  </li>
            <li> These blades are much sharper than the ones I was buying at my local store, and they stay sharper for longer as well.  </li>
            <li> Nice thin blades.  </li>
            <li> Okay, so I guess that mean&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I tried them out, and did find them to be quite prone to gliding all over and cutting very nicely.  </li>
            <li> The first is that your pulls will drag and nick if you go too far, the solution to this is to take shorter pulls.</li>
            <li> A few hours later my face feels great with hardly any razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I normally use wilkinson sword razor blades and just assumed all blades were the same.</li>
            <li> Only was able to shave one side of my face before blade started to dull.</li>
            <li> Anyone new to double edge shaving needs to know that no blade works well with every skin and beard type.</li>
            <li> every face is different so a sampler pack is a must when experimenting with new razors.</li>
            <li> A new blade will pull and tear at my face and it hurts to shave my upper lip.  </li>
            <li> Not sharp.</li>
            <li> pretty sharp and flexible.</li>
            <li> There are other Shark vendors in Amazon that market their product as Shark Super Chrome (not super stainless) and</li>
            <li> I have also tried the more expensive Shark Super Chrome blades and they aren&#x27;t bad, but the Super Stainless cut just a little more</li>
            <li> I laugh every time I put a new one in my razor thinking of all the suckers paying $2.50 for the Mach7 blades that are far inferior.</li>
            <li> I generally use them for 2-3 days/blade but as always YMMV</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m barely getting any nicks at all.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price on these blades, far cheaper than the Gillette Sensor blades I formerly used.</li>
            <li> If your old enough, you will remember when your father would come home with a 15 pack of Gillette Razors and a can of shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Shark blades pull a bit on my skin and require multiple passes to get a complete shave; this may be a function of the Merkur 180 razor in combination with these blades, or it may just be that the Shark blades don&#x27;t work as well as I would like on my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have only gone though 2 of them so far.</li>
            <li> I switched back to the old time  shaving method  </li>
            <li> Barely got 2 shaves from a razor</li>
            <li> If you feel you know the curves and contours of your face and have spent a decent amount of time learning your way around a safety razor, but don&#x27;t want to push out the 1$/blade average higher end stuff can cost - - these blades are for you.</li>
            <li> Sharp but not too much, never get a cut or nick with them.</li>
            <li> but these are plenty sharp, I&#x27;ll probably use the whole 100 pack before trying anything else.</li>
            <li> They are effective on my tough beard with minimal skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> Background: I have coarse facial hair with mildly sensitive skin, I used a homemade pre shave oil and Proraso shaving cream.</li>
            <li> this was a big disappointment to my husband who had loved this type of razor years ago.</li>
            <li> I find these are not nearly sharp enough and, as a result</li>
            <li> After a long bout of suffering the multi blade blues, I decided to return to the old way of shaving.</li>
            <li> When I say first time user, I mean someone who has gone out on a whim and bought a safety razor, brush, bowl, and some blades and gone at their face like they normally would with a traditional razor.</li>
            <li> They seem to dull faster than the Israeli blades, but they&#x27;re half the cost and are better initially, so these will be my new bladse of choice as long as they don&#x27;t change.</li>
            <li> Has perforated ends so that you can snap in half to use with a straight razor that accepts them.</li>
            <li> Now, these Shark blades cost me about half as much</li>
            <li> It was time to order some new blades, I&#x27;ve used about 300 7 AMs, and several different (overpriced) drugstore offerings of no particular label.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different double edged blades, some were very expensive, and these were as good as any I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> These blades are very sharp and they last pretty long before they need to be changed out.</li>
            <li> facial hair isn&#x27;t super dense, but the hairs themselves are thick and coarse.</li>
            <li> The package is slightly banged up but the small razor boxes are fine.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and a thick, fast growing beard.</li>
            <li> If your face is sensitive when shaving try another option as this blade will make you swear off of this type of shaving if you do not have other experience to fall back on.</li>
            <li> Favorites so far out of the dozen or so other brands sampled.</li>
            <li> I used to by blades from walgrees in packs of 7 did not have a name on them, but when when shaving with the blades from walgreens much less discomfort compared to the new ones from shark.</li>
            <li> but I have pretty thick facial hair.</li>
            <li> and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather buy these blades than spend $20 on gillette cartridges that dont last as long and that irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Please keep in mind also that I tested only one product of each brand so it is possible that other models within the same brand might be sharper (or duller).</li>
            <li> But none the less, I want to clear up some misconceptions these novices have noticed about the blade.</li>
            <li> Not to be confused with the Shark super chrome.  </li>
            <li> If you switched over to three or five blades razor, then dont go back to single blade.</li>
            <li> Not as sharp as more expensive blades</li>
            <li> These are a decent blade, they&#x27;ll do the job, though it might take an extra pass or so, they are sharp and will retain their edge for a few shaves and don&#x27;t rust so long as you take care of them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m putting my blades into a situation where they&#x27;re going to go dull fast anyways.</li>
            <li> I have saved a HUGE amount of money by switching to safety razors from the expensive multi-blade disposables.</li>
            <li> but I would, to do over, spend a bit more time cutting through the securing tape so as not to rip</li>
            <li> Long Handled Safety Razor]].</li>
            <li> it will end up being a lot cheaper than disposables and replacing blades for a Gillette in the long run and you can get</li>
            <li> I use them for a week / blade, and they seem to keep their edge that long.</li>
            <li> Long Handle</li>
            <li> I could describe the test procedure I used and make this review long and drawn out but won&#x27;t bore you with the details.  </li>
            <li> I have a very tough beard and these get the job comfortably.  </li>
            <li> My previous blades, Merkurs and Kinney Drug generic blades, will last me about a week.</li>
            <li> and I was plagued with small cuts and pulls from new blades.</li>
            <li> These blades are sharp and last a long time.</li>
            <li> I think the key word here is sharp....really really sharp</li>
            <li> The only other brand I&#x27;ve used since I decided to try a safety razor again is Derby.</li>
            <li> They are sharp and cut my facial hair.</li>
            <li> These are the only blades that I use due to the fact that I almost never nick myself with these</li>
            <li> Extremely sharp and stand up for about 5 shaves, tried another brand and only got 3 shaves.</li>
            <li> Blades come 5 to a pack, which are individually wrapped, and sharp.  </li>
            <li> and I prefer them they are sharp and do not pull and last a week for me.</li>
            <li> My main complaint is that they have inconsistent levels of sharpness.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t feathers, so don&#x27;t expect baby-bottom smoothness, but they can tackle a decent beard without nicking your neck to death (even if you are a little careless first thing in the morning).</li>
            <li> These razors aren&#x27;t very sharp and don&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> As a side note my facial hair is not very thick but by no means thin, also I used these blades in my Dovo Shavette and not a standard safety razor.</li>
            <li> Glide right over my skin, felling all hair unfortunate enough to be growing there.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch, but the blades are sharp for the first shave and then dull very quickly, by the third shave it feels like I&#x27;m trying to scrape the hairs out.</li>
            <li> they are sharp, but apparently no coating or something.</li>
            <li> I think these may be sharper, not nearly any drag even if I don&#x27;t shave in the morning.</li>
            <li> It is very sharp and also last longer.</li>
            <li> I do several passes in different directions and have had very little irritation from these.  </li>
            <li> In a nut shell ;  while there appears to be some very small differences between these  various brands  in initial sharpness levels there isn&#x27;t enough to write about.</li>
            <li> The blades also look different compared to my previous blades.</li>
            <li> I finish up with Jack Black moisturizing lotion and occasionally coconut oil.</li>
            <li> The 100-pack should last me one and a half years</li>
            <li> Just be careful when using, and brush and dry them off for longer use.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure why I&#x27;m getting such a different experience.</li>
            <li> They are sharp and hold their edge for a long time.  </li>
            <li> These blades are as sharp new as the Astra blades are when they get dull.  </li>
            <li> Very few are sharp enough for a second shave.</li>
            <li> No complaints on the pennies I spent.</li>
            <li> As I always stress with wet shaving products...</li>
            <li> I guess there are a few types of shark blade that they offer and all of them being of different sharpness.</li>
            <li> I was intrigued, and found these cheaper than the brand I expected to order.  </li>
            <li> But the very telling aspect was after the shave was completed and I applied my Bay Rum; there was a markedly decreased stinging in the application.  </li>
            <li> I started using a safety razor a few months ago after not having used one since the 70&#x27;s, initially went with the Derby blades because they were $9 for 100 of them.  </li>
            <li> However the larger box came taped closed with something akin to clear packaging tape (as would be seen on a UPS box or some such); it made opening the box a bit tedious.  </li>
            <li> In the process I managed to tear the cardboard of the box rendering it incapable of being securely closed again.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using an empty vitamin bottle for now</li>
            <li> Same razor burn, same poor shave, and same discomfort.  </li>
            <li> these shave well, last 3 or 4 shaves and don&#x27;t give me any trouble.</li>
            <li> Arrived well packaged, on time, and as expected.</li>
            <li> My only issue is that I only get about 3 shaves from the blade, but I have thick hairs</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to think there&#x27;s no personal &amp;#34;style&amp;#34; that will make a  knife sharp to one person and dull to another.  </li>
            <li> I even changed to a new Shark blade and tried again on the off-chance that the first one was just a bad blade.  </li>
            <li> For being the cheapest there are certainly no complaints from me.</li>
            <li> Not sharp enough for my tough beard.</li>
            <li> Had to work a bit harder for a truly close shave as these blades are not as sharp as others I have gotten in the  [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I decided to try the Shark Stainless Steel first, and I&#x27;m a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> I will keep trying other brands till I find one that i like</li>
            <li> Sharp is sharp, just like when you&#x27;re using a  knife.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re razor sharp.</li>
            <li> These razors are some of the cheaper blades and they do not shave as close and stay as sharp as Astra platinum blades.</li>
            <li> Not as sharp as some others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Not as sharp as the newer ones however.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The blades come in small boxes of 5 blades each, with 20 of the boxes ensconced in a larger box.  </li>
            <li> I tried Shark-brand blades and find them incredibly sharp and my shaving experiences cut-free.</li>
            <li> shaves from the other guys.</li>
            <li> I got these to shave my head; Feather blades are just too sharp for my skull.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands that are too sharp and nick me a lot but</li>
            <li> They are sharp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Excellent performance from 6 individual  blades in past two months  </li>
            <li> For my needs, they are sharp, but forgiving.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sharp but &amp;#34;grabby&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other brands and even consulted a well viewed shaving blog for recommendations.</li>
            <li> Stays sharp throughout the shave and from start to finish - no nicks.</li>
            <li> razor blades are so very individualistic (what works fine for me might be terrible for you) and are so reliant upon the type of razor used I would not place the lack of performance</li>
            <li> The blade is very forgiving and is actually quite sharp, but for some reason does a horrible job with the very course hair on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> getting hard to find regular blades in stores for shaving!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> These things are so dull in my razor that every time I&#x27;ve tried one (and I&#x27;ve given them multiple chances), I&#x27;ve immediately pulled it out and thrown it away.</li>
            <li> Blades were so dull I had to replace on same shave, I have read the reviews on this blade</li>
            <li> works for the average man</li>
            <li> These are not worth the price.</li>
            <li> than I expected given that the blades are not readily available in the U.S., I got my blades within a week.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no way to make sure that won&#x27;t happen even if I bought something from America or England but still, as a consumer, I feel like an idiot for buying from Egypt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I refuse to believe Shark&#x27;s quality has gone down the drain</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what this comes down to.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and sharp!</li>
            <li> there was 1 blade damaged due to some package damage, but one blade is nothing when i paid this little for a quality shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a beginner with DE shaving, so this is going to be a steep (and very sharp) learning</li>
            <li> Very sharp, lasts a week for me.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp.</li>
            <li> But when I got it, they were 120 half blades.</li>
            <li> I use them with a Merkur razor, a Jack Black brush, and Jack Black Supreme Cream.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After two weeks with the Shark blades, I have found that my average number of nicks per shave is &amp;#34;none.&amp;#34;  I have a fairly heavy beard, I don&#x27;t have to shave my cheekbones</li>
            <li> and now they are in tool box not good enough to shave with</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried at least 20 other brands since returning to the wet shave  </li>
            <li> These blades are not coated, they tend to go dull and pull during and after the first shave, and I have a thin beard!  </li>
            <li> The Merkur blade the razor came with wasn&#x27;t very sharp and nicked me a few times, so I got the sampler to try and find a blade I do</li>
            <li> /&gt;Blades are very sharp but only stay that way for 1-3 shaves before tugging and feeling like they are irritating my neck.  </li>
            <li> Purchased these for my straight razor, so cutting each blade in half is required.  </li>
            <li> One box of 5 was missing.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on these blades.</li>
            <li> I was getting tired of spending big bucks for replacement heads for the Mach3, takes getting used to.</li>
            <li> you will notice a few things.</li>
            <li> If Esau had had a few packs of these babies his dad never would have been tricked by that rascally brother of his.</li>
            <li> I shave my head and face everyday.</li>
            <li> My buddy uses the Astra brand and I have used a few of them myself.</li>
            <li> I shave my head every few days</li>
            <li> Just lather well and shave slowly and carefully.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to reorder in a few years, but you get the idea.</li>
            <li> I can get a few shaves out of them</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing until I used a friends Astra Blades.</li>
            <li> when a blade pulls, it&#x27;s dull, when it&#x27;s sharp, it scrapes along and cuts.  </li>
            <li> Compared to the other blades I&#x27;ve shaved with, these blades go dull quicker.</li>
            <li> So sharp and hold their edge for at least a week of shaving.</li>
            <li> and there is very little shadow</li>
            <li> I say I might have gotten a bad batch because I think i&#x27;ve used these blades before and didn&#x27;t have as much of an issue.</li>
            <li> and I can usually get</li>
            <li> so one man&#x27;s mediocre shave might be another&#x27;s daily comfort.</li>
            <li> but I did usually manage to nick myself once or twice with each shave.  </li>
            <li> but there was a spot or two of blood, usually around the chin or neck</li>
            <li> American Made you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> No more trying others for me - this is my preference.</li>
            <li> Just not a very good blade.</li>
            <li> The Sharks go dull after maybe three days.</li>
            <li> Hard to beat at $0.10 a blade.  </li>
            <li> they are razor blades, duh.</li>
            <li> Useless for me as I have a rough beard.</li>
            <li> but it was slightly unpleasant because they were not very sharp</li>
            <li> Nothing serious</li>
            <li> However, I am unhappy with this vendor&#x27;s product packaging, because every single razor box is not sealed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll either try the Astra blades or the Feathers since I hear they are CRAZY sharp.</li>
            <li> The get dull after 2-3 usage, but you can&#x27;t complain with the price!</li>
            <li> Razor blades not needed since razor was not good and the shave was poor.</li>
            <li> Very dull and poor quality.  </li>
            <li> I have a VERY thick beard, and shave with two passes.  </li>
            <li> No they are not great.</li>
            <li> The blade seem too thin and wimpy.  </li>
            <li> WRONG.</li>
            <li> Contacted seller thru email, they asked for my order #, I gave it to them, they checked and come to find out they are out of the item I ordered and it was advertised wrong.</li>
            <li> Bad news: I can&#x27;t go one shave without cutting myself, usually around the knee.</li>
            <li> Horrible not worth the cost.</li>
            <li> They seem to just bounce over the bumps on my neck rather than cutting them.</li>
            <li> I would rate them around a 3 out of 10 on cutting ability and longevity about a 2.</li>
            <li> NEEDED THIS FOR HOME HAIR CUTTING UNIT.</li>
            <li> Started using DE blades with the Wilkinson Sword blades from the store but they were bad for my face (cutting, irritation, etc)</li>
            <li> Very sorry I bought these.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s bad, it&#x27;s your face</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad batch</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Shark blades exclusively, but the box I received has a very bad print job.</li>
            <li> These are the worst.</li>
            <li> Terrible.  </li>
            <li> Worst shave I have ever had.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> excellent!!!! even came in ad display case! cool  getting hard to find regular blades in stores for shaving!!!!!!!!!!! only disposal or electric!!!! couldnt even find blades at walmart!!!!</li>
            <li> These Shark blades works great for me. I think it depends on the shaver and the type of skin a person has, they give me a close shave without a bunch of cuts and nicks. My only issue is that I only get about 3 shaves from the blade, but I have thick hairs so I&#x27;m fine with switching them out to keep a good shave.</li>
            <li> They are sharp and cheap.  I throw out after two uses max.  Has perforated ends so that you can snap in half to use with a straight razor that accepts them.</li>
            <li> Sharks are decent. Price is good. I get 4 to 5 shaves on a blade. I cannot get more than 5 on the Feather blades that are so highly rated. So I think that they are a very good deal. I only got 95 blades though. One box of 5 was missing. Hmmm...</li>
            <li> Razor Blades... they work fine.&lt;br /&gt;Dang, they want 20 words to describe the product and repeated words dont count.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I bought this 100 pack of blades so that I wouldnt run out for a while and as far as the quality of the product they cut just as good as the blades I buy in a 5 pack at cvs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are razor blades. They fit my razor and they cut my beard fine.</li>
            <li> Shark Super Chrome blades came with my Parker razor. They are great blades. I mistakenly purchased these -- Super Stainless -- blades, not noticing that they differ from the Super Chrome. They are not nearly as sharp or durable as the Super Chrome. Spend the extra 2-cents per blade and buy the Super Chrome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a beginner with DE shaving, so this is going to be a steep (and very sharp) learning curve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These razors give a really great, very close shave. Bad news: I can&#x27;t go one shave without cutting myself, usually around the knee. I had better luck with Feathers; I only cut myself when I was being careless. I&#x27;m gonna stick this one out... or find a way to trade with someone later.</li>
            <li> My main complaint is that they have inconsistent levels of sharpness. Most are single use blades. Very few are sharp enough for a second shave.</li>
            <li> I used to by blades from walgrees in packs of 7 did not have a name on them, but when when shaving with the blades from walgreens much less discomfort compared to the new ones from shark. I will keep trying other brands till I find one that i like</li>
            <li> They probably would have gotten a higher rating...had I not gotten some Feathers.</li>
            <li> I think the key word here is sharp....really really sharp</li>
            <li> Great blades. Depending on how much you shave and how often you change out your blades... Practically a year&#x27;s worth of shaving blades for $10. Compare that to how much you&#x27;d spend on disposable or cartridge razors...</li>
            <li> I like the razor blades sent, I get a nice shave &amp; the price was reasonable. I would buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped fast &amp; combined shipping was nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give this product a five.  Sharp, shaves close, excellent shave with no nicks or irritation.  Excellent value as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used a shaving product, blade or razor, made by Lord out of Egypt, that I did not appreciate insofar as functionality, quality and price.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite double edged blades.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite blades. They seem to just bounce over the bumps on my neck rather than cutting them. They still give a close clean shave around them without changing pressure or having to shave around them. One swipe is all you need. Perfect.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and sharp!</li>
            <li> The only other brand I&#x27;ve used since I decided to try a safety razor again is Derby. These felt smoother right away and I&#x27;m barely getting any nicks at all.</li>
            <li> Tried these out and they just don&#x27;t seem to cut it (no pun intended). I would rate them around a 3 out of 10 on cutting ability and longevity about a 2. Moving on to the next brand.</li>
            <li> Favorites so far out of the dozen or so other brands sampled.</li>
            <li> Accurately described on website.  Great price and super sharp.</li>
            <li> Bright, flashy packaging, but i&#x27;ve never used a shark blade that didnt manage to cut me.</li>
            <li> It comes as a store display so you can hang it on your wall, which I greatly enjoyed. They hang in my office and whenever anyone comes in they ask about them.</li>
            <li> I got these blades as part of the [[ASIN:B0038KA5RC Double Edge Safety Razor Blade Variety Pack - 100 Blades!]] sampler to use with my [[ASIN:B000NL0T1G Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor]]. The Merkur blade the razor came with wasn&#x27;t very sharp and nicked me a few times, so I got the sampler to try and find a blade I do really like. I decided to try the Shark Stainless Steel first, and I&#x27;m a little disappointed. The blade is very forgiving and is actually quite sharp, but for some reason does a horrible job with the very course hair on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My facial hair isn&#x27;t super dense, but the hairs themselves are thick and coarse. This blade seemed to be giving me a very smooth shave and felt great when I was using it, but once I wiped the lather off my neck I could feel just how much of the stubble was left. I think if you have thinner hair, these blades would work great for you. Like I said, they felt great. No cuts and no irritation. They just didn&#x27;t cut very well for me.</li>
            <li> Decent blades.  I can get about 4 shaves out of each blade.  Much better than the name brand disposables.</li>
            <li> Incredible product, i love it so much. It is very sharp and also last longer. I am very happy with this product. Works very well :)</li>
            <li> These are my perfect sharpness. I get a week of use out of each. Great value.</li>
            <li> These are the best razors for my skin type. I originally used Feathers but after not noticing the shipping time on a recent order I need some blades in a hurry. I read the reviews and I&#x27;m glad I purchased these. Give them a try, for the price you can&#x27;t lose! I use these in a Edwin Jagger DE87 and a Feather popular (long handle, for my head).</li>
            <li> Husband likes them. They last for a couple shaves. I&#x27;ve shaved my legs with them and I can usually get 2 shaves from bottom to top before it gets close to needing to be changed.</li>
            <li> they are razor blades, duh.</li>
            <li> amazing value, and quality blades. there was 1 blade damaged due to some package damage, but one blade is nothing when i paid this little for a quality shave.</li>
            <li> My dad loved it. I bought his because I love mine</li>
            <li> These are OK. No they are not bad. No they are not great. I can only get one smooth shave from them without replacement.</li>
            <li> What can I say. They are sharp and cut my facial hair. I do have to replace once a week but I have pretty thick facial hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this superpack as I really enjoy the shark brand blades for my DE razor.  These are the only blades that I use due to the fact that I almost never nick myself with these and they seem to stay sharper than many of the other brands of DE blades.</li>
            <li> Killer deal.  Solid product.</li>
            <li> These work great for me, but every face is going to shave different. So try a bunch of different blades to find your favorite one.</li>
            <li> While these blades were not my absolute favorites, every face is different. they were not bad at all, and i will keep them for backups.</li>
            <li> Utube has tons of clips comparing DE razor brands.....  The Shark came with a Parker razor I bought and gave me a wonderful shave the very first time.  Personal preference is probably important when choosing your &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; or favorite blade so I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the absolute best for everyone but based on my uses of it it&#x27;s worth a test run for anyone looking for a good blade.</li>
            <li> They shaved the hair on my face pretty well but it was slightly unpleasant because they were not very sharp, this goes for both the super stainless and super chrome shark blades. As a side note my facial hair is not very thick but by no means thin, also I used these blades in my Dovo Shavette and not a standard safety razor.</li>
            <li> These blades are very sharp and they last pretty long before they need to be changed out. I have saved a HUGE amount of money by switching to safety razors from the expensive multi-blade disposables. I must also note that since I started using a safety razor the razor burn and discomfort I get from shaving has almost completely gone away. This is definitely the way to go for me from now on.</li>
            <li> Of the many brands I&#x27;ve tried now, these have been the most consistent and sharpest.  I&#x27;m starting to see inconsistencies in even the feather blades that so many recommend.  when a blade pulls, it&#x27;s dull, when it&#x27;s sharp, it scrapes along and cuts.  Sharp is sharp, just like when you&#x27;re using a  knife.  I&#x27;m starting to think there&#x27;s no personal &amp;#34;style&amp;#34; that will make a  knife sharp to one person and dull to another.  I&#x27;m getting feather&#x27;s, astro&#x27;s, silver blues, and others that pull right out of the packaging but i have not seen that with Sharks and i&#x27;ve just about gone through 200 of them.</li>
            <li> I know that blades can be a personal preference.  These blades treat my face great. Plenty sharp, and the price is awesome.  I have a VERY thick beard, and shave with two passes.  I can get several shaves from one blade, compared to sometimes just one with a disposable.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful blades. Very sharp, lasts a week for me. Great price for a great product.</li>
            <li> Anyone new to double edge shaving needs to know that no blade works well with every skin and beard type. That being said, these blades work best for me. Good quality and value. I would suggest to those new to safety razors to buy a variety pack of different blades to figure out which works best for your skin and beard type.</li>
            <li> The Sharks are decent blades. For being the cheapest there are certainly no complaints from me. I Used to toss my safety razors after two days but friends told me to use them for longer. I&#x27;m getting about 4-6 days on a shark. No complaints on the pennies I spent.</li>
            <li> What can I say? They&#x27;re razor sharp. There&#x27;s 5 of them. Exactly as describe</li>
            <li> These blades are great for me, so smooth that it feels like there isn&#x27;t a blade in my razor. I generally use them for 2-3 days/blade but as always YMMV</li>
            <li> i can switch them from razor to razor with no problems at all. Always provides a smooth shave every time</li>
            <li> No surprises here for me, first used these blades in a sampler pack and love them. As I always stress with wet shaving products... every face is different so a sampler pack is a must when experimenting with new razors. With my wet shave combination of merkur razor armed with these shark razors,  proraso pre-shave cream, Truefitt &amp; Hill shaving cream, and Geo F Trumper skin food; my morning shave experience is simply incredible. I consistently get baby smooth shaves. I would highly recommend giving these blades a try to see if they are for you</li>
            <li> Bought blades for my husband.  He is getting ten shaves from a blade. Not a bad deal 10 cents for a great shave. At this rate he could shave for three years with one purchase!!!! Wow!!!!!</li>
            <li> The Blade is nice and sharp. gives nice clean cuts...&lt;br /&gt;Con: probably not the best if you are prone to razor bumps.</li>
            <li> These are the best razors. I feel like I have had a proper strieght razor shave afterwards. they are also priced right so that you can use them for one or two shaves.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price on these blades, far cheaper than the Gillette Sensor blades I formerly used. This is a no-brainer!</li>
            <li> These are the worst. I normally use wilkinson sword razor blades and just assumed all blades were the same. WRONG. Since purchasing these blades I have grown a beard just so I don&#x27;t have to use them.</li>
            <li> Good place for the price seem pretty sharp</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these Shark blades for over two years now and they shave perfectly for my thick beard. They aren&#x27;t feathers, so don&#x27;t expect baby-bottom smoothness, but they can tackle a decent beard without nicking your neck to death (even if you are a little careless first thing in the morning). After using a &amp;#34;sample pack&amp;#34; to try out different blades I&#x27;ve stuck with these guys. Plus, at the cost per blade, it&#x27;s very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> The shark blades are awesome when used properly they are very effective the giving extremely close shave I recommend. Amazing price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just entering the world of DE shaving and I&#x27;ve bought a lot of different blades to try, Feathers, Wilkinson, Bic, Shark, etc.  The Shark is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> Not the best blades out there but great price; use once or twice and then change the blade.</li>
            <li> These are a decent blade, they&#x27;ll do the job, though it might take an extra pass or so, they are sharp and will retain their edge for a few shaves and don&#x27;t rust so long as you take care of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just like the shave from a different blade better though - might try these in Platinum coat if you&#x27;re looking for a more &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; shave.  but everyone&#x27;s different so one man&#x27;s mediocre shave might be another&#x27;s daily comfort.</li>
            <li> I have a coarse beard, and these blades are great for the price. I prefer Feather blades, but they tend to be much more expensive. These are a must buy for anyone using a safety razor.</li>
            <li> To be honest when I saw &#x27;Made in Egypt&#x27; I didn&#x27;t have high hopes, but these blades have given me consistently great shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s face is different, so finding the perfect blade is definitely trial and error.  I bought a Gillette Slim Adjustable off of Ebay and the seller threw in a 5 pack of these blades and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I have also tried the more expensive Shark Super Chrome blades and they aren&#x27;t bad, but the Super Stainless cut just a little more smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried all of the most popular blades, but none of them really fit.  The Shark Super Stainless though cut cleanly, smoothly and last through at least 5 shaves for me.  And at a price that can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Amazing amounts of blades for the price. This is why I love wet shaving. this amount of blades will last me for literally years.</li>
            <li> I just went back to using a double edge razor after many years. These blades came with the stainless steel double edge razor I bought here on Amazon (can&#x27;t find them in the drugs stores any more) so I tried them out. I get more than a week&#x27;s worth of shaves out of these and as long as they&#x27;re kept clean they give a smooth, close shave every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 100 blade package will definitely last you more than a year and the money saved by not buying the expensive cartridge types pays for them over and over again.</li>
            <li> I bought a ton of these, and good thing, they work well.  Does&#x27;t hurt my skin. I can use it 4-6 times no problem.</li>
            <li> These blades did not work well for me&lt;br /&gt;I had to constantly change them, like almost after every shave&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, I would not recommend them</li>
            <li> I just started shaving my legs with a de safety razor. These razors are some of the cheaper blades and they do not shave as close and stay as sharp as Astra platinum blades. I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on these blades. One shave use with these. That&#x27;s why they come free with most razors.</li>
            <li> Horrible not worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Best bang for the buck!  Great quality!!!</li>
            <li> These are long lasting and really nice. I love these for my straight edge razor and for my husband&#x27;s old school razor. We&#x27;ve saved so much money!</li>
            <li> After a long bout of suffering the multi blade blues, I decided to return to the old way of shaving. It worked, it works and it does so economically. Good blades do the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying many blades, and Shark Super Stainless are the best for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I can easily make 4 shaves out of each blade. Sharp but not too much, never get a cut or nick with them.</li>
            <li> sharp, anti-rust, and there&#x27;s so many of them in the package that it&#x27;ll be a year or so until i need to worry about pricing again.</li>
            <li> Shark double edge razor blades are my favorite blades to shave.  However, I am unhappy with this vendor&#x27;s product packaging, because every single razor box is not sealed.  I am very concerned about using a product, that could potentially cut my skin, knowing that it was not sealed, let alone sterilized.  There are other Shark vendors in Amazon that market their product as Shark Super Chrome (not super stainless) and every one of their boxes containing razors is sealed.  I would never buy this product again from this vendor, and since it is not returnable, I may consider disposing it.</li>
            <li> I was getting tired of spending big bucks for replacement heads for the Mach3, takes getting used to. Have to be careful , but gives clean shave.</li>
            <li> This stainless blades made by shark I don&#x27;t like, however I like shark iridium.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think we will ever have to buy another blade! This is a great bargain at a good price.</li>
            <li> These are the best double edge blades that I have personally used.  Everyone is different though and will get varying quality shaves from different blades.</li>
            <li> Nice thin blades.  Don&#x27;t irritate the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Shark blades exclusively, but the box I received has a very bad print job. The blades also look different compared to my previous blades. The lettering is very blurry on both the packaging and the blades. After only 3 shaves the first blade was already giving me problems.  I refuse to believe Shark&#x27;s quality has gone down the drain and I really hope these are knock-offs.</li>
            <li> As nearly every one of these reviews will tell you... it&#x27;s not the blade that&#x27;s bad, it&#x27;s your face that isn&#x27;t right for the blade. These blades, I&#x27;m happy to say, are the ones for me. Glide right over my skin, felling all hair unfortunate enough to be growing there. Very little irritation post clearing, and a very nice shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many many blades in my razor over the years, these are almost the best so far, as with most blades, they work well in one razor, but not all. These are not as good in my Shaving factory razor as they are in a vintage brass Gillette, Feather blades are best overall, but these are a very close second, and for the price, you can&#x27;t complain!</li>
            <li> There razor blades, what do you want to know? Yes they are sharp &amp; they are named for a really cool fish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Gillette Silver Blue, Wilkinson Sword (Wal-Mart), Merkur and these are by far the best. Which is surprising because they are the cheapest. Background: I have coarse facial hair with mildly sensitive skin, I used a homemade pre shave oil and Proraso shaving cream. I finish up with Jack Black moisturizing lotion and occasionally coconut oil. I use a 3 pass method with a 1960s Gillette Butterfly Razor. A few hours later my face feels great with hardly any razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*General Tip: I suggest coating them with mineral oil to preserve the blade.</li>
            <li> I have a fairly heavy beard, and these blades work better for me than the Shark Chrome. I think these may be sharper, not nearly any drag even if I don&#x27;t shave in the morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different double edged blades, some were very expensive, and these were as good as any I&#x27;ve tried.I get 3 shaves out of each blade.I was a barber for 40 years, so I think I can judge a good blade when I use one, and these are a good blade, at a good price.</li>
            <li> These are decent. Not as sharp as some others I&#x27;ve used. But, in the &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; category these are my favorite. It takes me an extra pass or two on the neck to get a perfect shave than usual but they don&#x27;t nick me up or leave me with a bunch of razor burn. For cheapies I like them. There is a slight amount of tug, but not as much as another cheap I tried!</li>
            <li> Not sharp. My local grocery store brand (western family) double edge razors are sharper than these.</li>
            <li> I just started shaving with DE razors. My Merkur 180 came with a a Merkur blade, after my first shave I wasn&#x27;t 100% sold on the whole art of wet shaving. I bought these Shark blades and thought I would give it a try. The first shave was so much better then the Merkur blades (remember all blades react differently to everyone). I really recommend these blades because this is the first time in my life I can shave without irritation.</li>
            <li> The blades work excellent as expected and for 100 blades the price was right it will end up being a lot cheaper than disposables and replacing blades for a Gillette in the long run and you can get a much closer shave good product good price</li>
            <li> Extremely sharp and stand up for about 5 shaves, tried another brand and only got 3 shaves. Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> These blades are very sharp, and do a good job in my (Double Edge) razors. About the only ones better are, I believe, Feather. At the time I bought these, they were about half the price of a similar quantity of Feathers, making them an excellent value.</li>
            <li> works well for me, use several brands and like this too. great price and will last a long time. I get a good 1-2 weeks out of one blade and have a thick beard.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these blades because of the low price on how well they shave. You can get up to 7 shaves using1 blade.</li>
            <li> Very sharp give a good close shave.</li>
            <li> very clean shave, blades last about 5 days</li>
            <li> on my first shave i experienced seven deep gashes on my face and neck. i am 88 years old and have been shaving since i was sixteen, butneve thad an experience like this.</li>
            <li> Good blades, very sharp</li>
            <li> To say that I have spent more than a few minutes reading through the reviews for this blade would be an embarrassing statement, however it would be true. I have noticed that many of the people here reviewing this product, are first time users. When I say first time user, I mean someone who has gone out on a whim and bought a safety razor, brush, bowl, and some blades and gone at their face like they normally would with a traditional razor. You may wonder, what ends up happening to these people? Their face will look like Swiss cheese after, that&#x27;s for sure. I really feel if you haven&#x27;t been shaving with safety razors for a while then you shouldn&#x27;t be reviewing. But none the less, I want to clear up some misconceptions these novices have noticed about the blade. I will start with the most obvious: this is a bargain blade. If your old enough, you will remember when your father would come home with a 15 pack of Gillette Razors and a can of shaving cream. Every morning he spent more than a couple of minutes carefully maneuvering his blade around his face to result a nice clean shave that left a tad bit more stubble than a disposable razor. This razor draws parallels with that package of Gillette razors. This razor is a mid to high range razor that is for experienced shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may ask yourself, how does one know if they are an experienced shaver? Let me just say, if you truly know the curves of your face, you could shave yourself with a steak knife and some butter. If you feel you know the curves and contours of your face and have spent a decent amount of time learning your way around a safety razor, but don&#x27;t want to push out the 1$/blade average higher end stuff can cost - - these blades are for you. The first time you use it, if you are stepping down from a &#x27;higher quality&#x27; blade (one that has been &#x27;electromagnetically tested&#x27;) you will notice a few things. The first is that your pulls will drag and nick if you go too far, the solution to this is to take shorter pulls. As a tangent of the first thing and taking shorter more careful strokes, it will take a longer time to shave. Believe it or not, this is a good thing. The longer the cream stays on your face, the longer you hover over a hot basin of water; the longer the smell of your shaving cream will stick around. Think of shaving as a time to meditate and learn your own body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the current price, you are paying just over .10$ a blade. Why am I bringing this up? Well, you aren&#x27;t going to get but one or two shaves out of each blade. I will admit, when I first started using these I tried to get three or four shaves out of them. Let me save you some nicks and tell you it isn&#x27;t going to happen, please learn from my mistakes. I feel the bottom line on these blades are, is that they work if you know what your doing. If you dig deep on shaving forums, you will see countless posts about people complaining about using Egyptian blades. Shaving with a safety razor in Egypt is considered high class, its often a rite of passage for business men to receive a high end brush from their father when they get their first job. I&#x27;m going to put it all on the line and say I have no problem with Egyptian blades, I don&#x27;t care about tacky packaging/branding. If you do - - feel free to go to Art of Shaving at your local high end mall and pay 5$ for a blade.shorter pulls.

            <li> Lobe these razors! If youre new to the safety razor world, def. Try a pack of these.</li>
            <li> I guess there are a few types of shark blade that they offer and all of them being of different sharpness. These were duller then another bundle of shark blades that I bought. Useless for me as I have a rough beard.</li>
            <li> works for the average man</li>
            <li> It was time to order some new blades, I&#x27;ve used about 300 7 AMs, and several different (overpriced) drugstore offerings of no particular label.  I saw a review for Shark, and noticed how someone stated they glided quite nicely and were sharper than most.  I was intrigued, and found these cheaper than the brand I expected to order.  I tried them out, and did find them to be quite prone to gliding all over and cutting very nicely.  But the very telling aspect was after the shave was completed and I applied my Bay Rum; there was a markedly decreased stinging in the application.  I deduced that these blades did, in fact, cut quite more uniformly and smoothly due to the lack of skin irritation and abrasions that would be susceptible to my aftershave.</li>
            <li> Super sharp and super cheap, what more could an hairy man like myself want? If Esau had had a few packs of these babies his dad never would have been tricked by that rascally brother of his.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like the shave. cut myself when I never cut myself before using van der hagen blades. they are sharp, but apparently no coating or something. good quantity for the price but I won&#x27;t be buying again. I may even have to sell 95 of them.</li>
            <li> a good price, however they are not as sharp as the feather blades I have.</li>
            <li> Best razors and good price. The feathers are sharper and cost more. The sharks last longer. I shave my head and face everyday. A feather will only last one shave. Sharks last four days. I have used over 18 different razors and sharks are the best in my book</li>
            <li> cant beat it for the price.</li>
            <li> Not the original shark blades.  Very dull and poor quality.  I will stick with feather blades as they are the best I have found after 4 years of using a safety razor.</li>
            <li> Good Price and good blades</li>
            <li> These blades work great for one time use only. Getting two shaves out of one blade is not recommended by me. But that&#x27;s not a reason to not order these blades. In my opinion, the Astra blades are much better. My buddy uses the Astra brand and I have used a few of them myself. I get a much closer, cleaner, even shave out of the Astra brand over the Shark brand. But for the price these are a great buy!</li>
            <li> Got these as a Christmas present.  I love them.  I use them in conjunction with the Parker 99R and have gotten the best shave ever.  I&#x27;ve used a number of blades with my other razors and these are some of the best.  I do several passes in different directions and have had very little irritation from these.  A top notch product!</li>
            <li> well worth what i paid. gives good shave.</li>
            <li> I recently started using the DE razors and found these to be very good blades for me.  I have a very tough beard and these get the job comfortably.  I have tried others but these are the best for me so far.</li>
            <li> These are not worth the price. Only was able to shave one side of my face before blade started to dull. Broke out some very old Personna blades and used them. I would give this 0 stars if I could. Just not a very good blade. Even when first taken from wrapper you can till no expense was incurred by the manufacturer in making this blade.</li>
            <li> Excellent, very sharp, smooth, and long lasting saving a lot of money by not buying the super expensive multi blade refills.</li>
            <li> Good value blade. I get about 4 shaves per blade. Paired nicely with my vintage gillette fat boy.</li>
            <li> These blades are sharp and last a long time.</li>
            <li> 100 Blades that don&#x27;t suck. That&#x27;s what this comes down to. I knew that these worked for me so I bought them in bulk. They may not work for you so do yourself a favor and buy a blade sampler pack before you but 100 blades that you may not like.</li>
            <li> Not bad buts theres better, not consistant in the sharpness.</li>
            <li> Very happy, Thank you</li>
            <li> Work well. Great value!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat these blades. I laugh every time I put a new one in my razor thinking of all the suckers paying $2.50 for the Mach7 blades that are far inferior. Amazing how the best technology is not always the newest!</li>
            <li> Great price hard to find locally</li>
            <li> Not as sharp as the newer ones however. it save you a ton of money.</li>
            <li> Blades come 5 to a pack, which are individually wrapped, and sharp.  Thought I was getting a good deal but you get what you pay for. These blades are not coated, they tend to go dull and pull during and after the first shave, and I have a thin beard!  Also got a lot of nicks from these blades. Other competitors like Wilkinson Sword and the Van Der Hagen Ice-Tempered \\&quot;Blitz\\&quot; blades last many shaves, and perform very well.</li>
            <li> I just got these in the mail today and tried one out tonight. The blade cuts well with no tugging or skipping. I use a 4 pass routine WTG, XTG, ATG, WTG, for BBS. They are a good blade an I will continue to buy them at this price point. I get 3-5 shaves a blade then I strop them to get 3-5 more. A hundred blades is a two year supply for me.</li>
            <li> Wish they were Sharper</li>
            <li> I started using a safety razor a few months ago after not having used one since the 70&#x27;s, initially went with the Derby blades because they were $9 for 100 of them.  They worked fine but I did usually manage to nick myself once or twice with each shave.  Nothing serious but there was a spot or two of blood, usually around the chin or neck (Adam&#x27;s apple every day at first).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two weeks with the Shark blades, I have found that my average number of nicks per shave is &amp;#34;none.&amp;#34;  I have a fairly heavy beard, I don&#x27;t have to shave my cheekbones but I have to go pretty high on my face and pretty low on my neck.  The blade does a good job of clearing out the foliage without multiple passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the shave tends to &amp;#34;last&amp;#34; longer, it&#x27;s 6 pm and there is very little shadow, so I&#x27;m probably getting a closer shave too.  I&#x27;ve very happy with the Shark blades, and with the seller.  The delivery was quicker than I expected given that the blades are not readily available in the U.S., I got my blades within a week.  I bought them in the 100 blade quantity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as longevity of the blade goes, seems to me it&#x27;s about the same as the Derby blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that could be better is the packaging, instead of coming in a plastic box with a neat little slot to insert used blades, they come in a cardboard box which isn&#x27;t as handy, I wrap the used blade in the wax paper and toss it in the garbage rather than inserting it into the slot on the cardboard box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been thinking about buying the Japanese blades that people rave about but these are plenty sharp, I&#x27;ll probably use the whole 100 pack before trying anything else.</li>
            <li> I use them in a microtouch one razor with pretty good results.  The best blade for me in that razor.  I understand that different people get very different reactions with different blade and razor combos.  All I can really say is that after trying lots of different blades this is the one for me,  The 100 blades should last me for about two years so not having to worry about buying blades will be great.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite blades. Super close shave, without slicing up my face! I use them for a week / blade, and they seem to keep their edge that long.</li>
            <li> Started using DE blades with the Wilkinson Sword blades from the store but they were bad for my face (cutting, irritation, etc) so I tried these based on reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blades are very sharp but only stay that way for 1-3 shaves before tugging and feeling like they are irritating my neck.  Having said that, I rarely actually end up with any real irritation, just the sensation of it while shaving after a few uses of the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very pleased with the Shark Stainless Steel blades.  For the price, I toss them after three shaves and grab a new one, but I have a pretty coarse beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast and the display board the 5 packs are mounted on is cool.</li>
            <li> If you switched over to three or five blades razor, then dont go back to single blade. It doesn&#x27;t work, or atleast it didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> Perfect for my straight razor!</li>
            <li> Exactly what was described and works great according to my husband also great value for the quantity</li>
            <li> Not as sharp as more expensive blades but it does the job</li>
            <li> Great value, blades seem to be very good quality.  I have not used them yet, but will very soon.  Update then.</li>
            <li> Razor blades not needed since razor was not good and the shave was poor. this was a big disappointment to my husband who had loved this type of razor years ago.</li>
            <li> Its a razor....they didn&#x27;t screw it up.</li>
            <li> Razor blades are going to be a personal preference item.  I find these are not nearly sharp enough and, as a result, I have to change them far more frequently than I did my Feather blades and I find I miss stubble on my chin even after multiple passes when I never had that problem before.  I will return to using Feathers, but these are a very good value for someone who does not like &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; sharp blades.</li>
            <li> Cheap, but don&#x27;t hold an edge. I only get 2-3 shaves per blade.</li>
            <li> I had been using disposable razors (twin blade and tri blade) but lately I was thinking about the great shave I used to get with my old double edge butterfly safety razor.  I started looking around in stores and could not find one and had just about given up when my wife suggested I go online and look for them.  As luck would have it I found a great buy on a razor which included a package of Shark blades (I did not know anything about them but I decided to order and extra hundred of them.  Best blade I have ever used.  I was so impressed with them I gave a package to a friend of mine.  The next day he came to work and told me &amp;#34;I had forgotten what it was like to get a good shave&amp;#34;.  He then asked me for the site address where I ordered them and said he was going to order him some.</li>
            <li> This review is for a package of \\&quot;Super Stainless\\&quot; Shark Double Edge Razor Blades (pack of 100) that I received as a gift.  (Thus there is no \\&quot;confirmed buyer\\&quot; tag on this review.  But the gift was purchased on Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades and packaging are made in Egypt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades come in small boxes of 5 blades each, with 20 of the boxes ensconced in a larger box.  However the larger box came taped closed with something akin to clear packaging tape (as would be seen on a UPS box or some such); it made opening the box a bit tedious.  In the process I managed to tear the cardboard of the box rendering it incapable of being securely closed again.  Not a big deal but I would, to do over, spend a bit more time cutting through the securing tape so as not to rip the cardboard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smaller boxes (5 blades each) are easy to open to extract a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no provision for blade disposal in the boxes; that is, there is no \\&quot;slot\\&quot; in which to place used blades.  Not unexpected in a pack of 100 blades but worth noting that blade disposal will be a consideration - especially if one has small children around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mount the blades in a Merkur Model 180 Long Handle razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Different razor designs may have differing blade edge angles, amount of blade showing, etc. so it is important to note that I can only give an opinion as to the effectiveness of this razor-and-blade combination; a different razor might give different results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a light-to-medium beard, and use shaving cream from an aerosol can (I received shaving soap and a brush along with the gift but am using up existing supplies of aerosol before using the new soap).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shark blades pull a bit on my skin and require multiple passes to get a complete shave; this may be a function of the Merkur 180 razor in combination with these blades, or it may just be that the Shark blades don&#x27;t work as well as I would like on my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would equate the quality of the shave with that of using a \\&quot;Gillette disposable\\&quot; razor - acceptable but not terrific.  I received better results from a Wal-Mart multi-bladed \\&quot;red dot\\&quot; razor.  However the blades for the Wal-Mart razor are considerably more expensive and the razor itself does not have as nice a feel as the Merkur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since razor blades are so very individualistic (what works fine for me might be terrible for you) and are so reliant upon the type of razor used I would not place the lack of performance I&#x27;m getting strictly on the Shark stainless blades - there are too many variables.  However I cannot give more than 4 stars due to the packaging of the blades and the fact that I am getting some pulling from the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend that these blades be tried in a \\&quot;trial\\&quot; size package rather than a purchase of 100 blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using double edge blades with vintage &#x27;50s Gillette razors for quite some time now. These are a good price, give me a good shave, and last longer than Feathers.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think there could be varying degrees in quality in razors, but there is a difference. Store-brand double edge razor blades are the only option in my area and I was plagued with small cuts and pulls from new blades. I tried Shark-brand blades and find them incredibly sharp and my shaving experiences cut-free. The 100-pack should last me one and a half years or so (I don&#x27;t have a lot of facial hair, but shave every day so it doesn&#x27;t look like mange has set in...).</li>
            <li> When I ordered this it was advertised as pictured. But when I got it, they were 120 half blades. Which I needed the double edge. Contacted seller thru email, they asked for my order #, I gave it to them, they checked and come to find out they are out of the item I ordered and it was advertised wrong. They refunded the full amount, so there was no problem with the seller in that area. And as for the product, Shark is a great brand for blades according to my husband,he uses them regularly. I will try back soon to see if I can get the actual product lol. And I rate this 4 stars because this is a product review ...we like the product and honest mistakes happen :)</li>
            <li> Why would you join some club. Been shaving with a double edge for multiple decades. The razor is a big part of the procedure. These work Excellent!</li>
            <li> Excellent shave at an astounding price.  I get 2 barber shop quality ultra-close shaves with ZERO burn or irritation.  I could probably get 3 or maybe even 4, but at 9 cents per blade, why bother....  A proper brush and shave cream are essential as well...  Proraso and Musgo. both make great creams.  YMMV....what works really well for one guy might not for the next.</li>
            <li> TRYING TO LOCATE SIMPLE DOUBLE EDGE BLADES, IN A BULK PACKAGE, HERE IN THE MIDWEST, IS LIKE TRYING TO FIND A GLACIER IN MIAMI. NEEDED THIS FOR HOME HAIR CUTTING UNIT. SAVING A TON OF MONEY WITH THESE. THEY LAST SEVERAL TRIMMINGS.&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRODUCT AT A GREAT PRICE.</li>
            <li> Great cut. Great price.</li>
            <li> I bought a tester pack with many brands of DE razors and these were probably the dullest ones in the pack. Right out of the package it hurts to shave with them.  I ended up throwing them straight in the garbage.  The best ones I&#x27;ve found are Astra Superior Platinum.  They are sharp and hold their edge for a long time.  You can usually get 100 packs of them for a good price.</li>
            <li> Excellent Value. Great blades. I never get nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, very cheap, very pleased.  These cost about 5% of what a multi-blade cartridge does, and they work about 90% as well.  Good trade off.</li>
            <li> Do what they were ment to do. Bought 100 for 9 bucks.</li>
            <li> Works as designed. Nicely packaged.</li>
            <li> Very impressed with this blade! I know every face is different and requires the right blade but this one stands out for me. Bought a 25 blade verity pack and have many bad shaves and a couple good ones. So far for me this and the Astra Superior Platinum are my favorites.</li>
            <li> I love the way these blades cut, however i&#x27;m not a fan of how quickly they dull. I shave my head every few days and i need to use 2 blades to get the proper cut and closeness. Can&#x27;t beat the price though. I won&#x27;t have to buy blades for a 8-10 months.</li>
            <li> These blades do their job, and the price is good, but at the risk of sounding paranoid if I had known these were made in Egypt I would have bought another brand.  I&#x27;m American and I don&#x27;t want to accidentally provide money that could possibly end up going to some terrorist group.  There&#x27;s no way to make sure that won&#x27;t happen even if I bought something from America or England but still, as a consumer, I feel like an idiot for buying from Egypt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave a 4 start rating because as I said, they do their job, and the price is good, but it doesn&#x27;t come with anything to dispose of the blades.  I&#x27;m using an empty vitamin bottle for now but evidently these are for reselling on a retail level and not just buying in bulk so you only have to buy once a year.</li>
            <li> These blades are great and last long. I can get a few good shaves out of each one. The amount of blades you get for the $ is a no brainer. I will not have to buy any more blades for a few years.</li>
            <li> Very sorry I bought these.  I get at most 2-3 shaves before the blade is noticeably dull.  I went back to one of the Merkur blades i had been using and it was night and day compared to these.  Maybe I got a bad batch but with 90 blades to go in this pack, I&#x27;m throwing them out in favor of a new pack of Merkur.</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp.  Purchased these for my straight razor, so cutting each blade in half is required.  They don&#x27;t snap easily, but a tin snips cuts through them very easily.</li>
            <li> Terrible.  These razors aren&#x27;t very sharp and don&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> Razors. Sharp, cheap and they cut off the hair on my face. Zero complaints.</li>
            <li> Some great Blades for and old but great grooming standard</li>
            <li> I bought these blades because, like most people who probably come across this on Amazon, it was too good of a bargain to pass up. After using the Shark blades, I still believe that I got my money&#x27;s worth. However, it wasn&#x27;t the amazing bargain that I had hoped it would be. Compared to the other blades I&#x27;ve shaved with, these blades go dull quicker. I shave in the shower and I leave my razor in the shower, so I&#x27;m putting my blades into a situation where they&#x27;re going to go dull fast anyways. The Sharks go dull after maybe three days. My previous blades, Merkurs and Kinney Drug generic blades, will last me about a week. I can get two shaves out of the Sharks as opposed to 3-4 shaves from the other guys. Now, these Shark blades cost me about half as much so I&#x27;m not complaining, but it&#x27;s no miracle blade.</li>
            <li> pretty sharp and flexible. I like them. plus you cant beat getting 100. I have only gone though 2 of them so far.</li>
            <li> I switched back to the old time  shaving method  these blades are cheap but outstanding quality and provide an close, comfortable shave. Just lather well and shave slowly and carefully.  They are very sharp. Do not use if you have bumpy skin or acne or you will cut yourself. I have smooth skin and this of ideal quality and economy.</li>
            <li> Very good DE blade. They give a nice close shave. Try them in a sampler and if you like them then come here and buy in bulk.</li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t beat these. I feel like I will never need to buy blades again given that these last about a week each. Okay, so I guess that mean&#x27;s I&#x27;ll have to reorder in a few years, but you get the idea.</li>
            <li> These are the only razors I use.  So sharp and hold their edge for at least a week of shaving.</li>
            <li> They seem to work fine. Initially they seem to be as good as the German Merkur, but they don&#x27;t seem to last as long. Maybe 1/2 the life of the Merkur, but they cost 1/10 of the price. They seem to have less &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; than the Personna and give a better shave. I really wanted to like the Personna&#x27;s because they are made in the US. The Sharks are made in Egypt.</li>
            <li> Great blades and good price</li>
            <li> These are high quality Egyptian blades. i will definitely buy more if i ever run out. this is a great money saver as well. I&#x27;d rather buy these blades than spend $20 on gillette cartridges that dont last as long and that irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Great price for a very comfortable shave.  Not as aggressive as others I have tried but NO nicks or cuts!  Hard to beat at $0.10 a blade.  I change mine twice a week so this pack will last a whole year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many double edged blades and these work best for me. However, it is often personal preference and I would definitely reccomend a variety package first to find what works best for you.</li>
            <li> A forgiving blade, held up for two days of shaving. (WTG, XTG, ATG) no weepers or burn. Had to work a bit harder for a truly close shave as these blades are not as sharp as others I have gotten in the  [[ASIN:B002Z6YXIW 125 BEST Blade Sampler FEATHER SHARK ASTRA BLUEBIRD NACET BIC LORD 7 O&#x27;Clock]]. I have placed these in the backup blade bin, in case I run out of my favorite, which is the Trig blade. [[ASIN:B009CCFW14 TRIG Silver Edge Stainless Double Edge Razor Blades (100)]]</li>
            <li> I got these to shave my head; Feather blades are just too sharp for my skull. They work great. I&#x27;ll definitely buy them again.</li>
            <li> didnt like them at all, had astra blades and feather blades. feathers are much much better, astra blades almost as good. i used maybe 4 of them and now they are in tool box not good enough to shave with</li>
            <li> GREAT BLADES SMOOTH, SHARP, NO PULL THATS WHAT MY BOY FRIEND SAYS ABOUT THESE BLADES.</li>
            <li> Blades have performed well and are as advertised. Price is very reasonable. Would recommend for purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought a Merkur razor about 6 months ago, and also bought a 100 pack of assorted blades at the same time.  I have been using Astra for several months and couldn&#x27;t be happier with their sharpness and longevity.  I decided to try one of the Shark blades last week and could not believe the difference in comfort and closeness.  The Shark does indeed have teeth and that is what it felt like when shaving.  Yes, I always let my beard soften in the shaving cream, no I have not changed shaving cream, and it was just one day&#x27;s growth.  I was tempted to pull it out right after I shaved, but thought that perhaps I hadn&#x27;t let my beard soften in the foam as long as I believed; I really waited longer than normal the next shave with exactly the same results!  I even changed to a new Shark blade and tried again on the off-chance that the first one was just a bad blade.  Same razor burn, same poor shave, and same discomfort.  I switched back to the Astra blades and was back to a very comfortable, smooth, and close shave.  I have two more packages of these, but am throwing them out.  Remember shaving with the old Gillette blades?  That is what Shark blades remind me of, scraping off the beard.  Try an Astra Stainless Steel blade and you will realize how comfortable a shave can actually be.</li>
            <li> Received the product in a timely fashion. I have used the and l am satisfied with results.</li>
            <li> Not quite as sharp as the Shark carbon steel blades but also not as quick to cut. Work good for my course beard.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say anything bad about these blades they give ME a very good shave.  I would rate these just below the Feather blades for my face overall but worth every penny.  These also seem to last a shave or two longer than the Feathers.</li>
            <li> They arrived as described.</li>
            <li> i prefer the dorco, but for the price for shave cant beat it.</li>
            <li> I love these.  I use them to shave my legs and they work well.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands that are too sharp and nick me a lot but these shave well, last 3 or 4 shaves and don&#x27;t give me any trouble.</li>
            <li> This blade pulls a bit for me. I can get a few shaves out of them but they are not my choice. I have also used the Derby brand and I prefer them they are sharp and do not pull and last a week for me. I will have to use the Sharks because I have them now , I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husbands birthday. He says he has never had a closer shave. I also got the w tea blades. Sure makes kissing much more enjoyable!!!</li>
            <li> I have an extremely wiry/coarse beard and, after testing out about 10 different blades, these are the ones which cut the best with the fewest nicks/irritation.</li>
            <li> Best razors for the money. Cuts really well</li>
            <li> Sharp, very smooth shave. Just be careful when using, and brush and dry them off for longer use. Love them!</li>
            <li> They are sharp. I&#x27;m a man that doesn&#x27;t have a lot of facial hair. Barely got 2 shaves from a razor</li>
            <li> Superior in their consistency, I&#x27;m thankful to find a blade that can survive two shaves and not have to pay a ridiculous price. I&#x27;ve tried Atra and Derby, which were fine; however, Shark has been the most consistent so far. I also use Shark singles in my Parker disposable blade straight razor about once a week, and it is also good.</li>
            <li> Shaving experts say to shop around take time selecting your blade at this point I have found nothing works better than the shark. I&#x27;ve tried at least 20 other brands since returning to the wet shave  No nics&lt;br /&gt;Excellent performance from 6 individual  blades in past two months  I got 6 shaves from one blade once I have found a soap /blade combination that suited my skin</li>
            <li> Not to be confused with the Shark super chrome.  The super stainless are superior and well worth the extra few dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find these to be smoother and sharper initially than &amp;#34;Israeli Personna&amp;#34; / red box / Platinum+/ Crystals.  They give a perfect shave with no irritation of multiblade razors.  They seem to dull faster than the Israeli blades, but they&#x27;re half the cost and are better initially, so these will be my new bladse of choice as long as they don&#x27;t change.</li>
            <li> great product fast shipping</li>
            <li> for the price, fine....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch, but the blades are sharp for the first shave and then dull very quickly, by the third shave it feels like I&#x27;m trying to scrape the hairs out. I say I might have gotten a bad batch because I think i&#x27;ve used these blades before and didn&#x27;t have as much of an issue. But for this batch, two stars.</li>
            <li> This blade is very inconsistent.  Some work great others are dull but none of them are good for more than one shave.  I had to go another direction because they scraped my face rather than shaved my face.  If your face is sensitive when shaving try another option as this blade will make you swear off of this type of shaving if you do not have other experience to fall back on.</li>
            <li> blades are a good value they are sharp and well made</li>
            <li> good every day blades</li>
            <li> These are some great razor blades. These by far give me the closest shave. This is just my opinion, but these are seriously amazing. Definitely try them out. Check out more clearance shaving supplies at. http://rewardgalaxy.com/?ref&#x3D;698372</li>
            <li> Best razor I&#x27;ve ever used. Had forgotten how clean, smootha double edged system could be. And very inexpensive compared to the newer razors. I&#x27;ll never go back.. Thanks</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re awesome for the money! 100 blades for 10 bucks!!!!!! They&#x27;re good for 1 or 2 shaves then you will need to replace them. Overall they&#x27;re good decent blades for what i paid for. Don&#x27;t expect a super premium close shave like you would with Feather or Merkur blades!! These blades just get the job done with a couple of passes.</li>
            <li> make a  real comfortable shave,not jaws at all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of blades these are among my top 3 preferences, can&#x27;t beat $10 for what will probably last me close to 2 years.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the quality or the price of the Shark razor blades. Old school shaving is the way to go!</li>
            <li> I like the shark brand blades, and I don&#x27;t want to run out of them. Close, comfort shaves.... I shave about 5-6 days a week, and it&#x27;s easy for me to get 2 weeks out of a blade. Hot water, good lather, and a good sharp blade like the &amp;#34;shark&amp;#34; makes for a good, clean comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I started out with a variety pack of blades from Amazon, and I decided that Shark, Merkur and Feather are my favorites.  They are effective on my tough beard with minimal skin irritation.  I use them with a Merkur razor, a Jack Black brush, and Jack Black Supreme Cream.  Shark is probably the best bang for the buck because they cost the least of the three brands I like best.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the shark &amp;#34;super chrome&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> These are the best blades for my face the perfect combination of sharpness and forgiving qualities. This mixed with a good lather is great although I would not recommend then to new comers because they are really sharp. all you really have to do is let the razor do the work.</li>
            <li> In my Parker razor handle they are the best by far. Tried Feather and Gillette but went back to the Sharks after one shave each. Recommended them to a friend and he had the same experience. Your experience may vary but in my hands they are the go to blade.</li>
            <li> Worst shave I have ever had.</li>
            <li> Getting closer shaves on the cheaper side of disposable brands. Shave five to six times per blade. Old fashion can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I am making up shave kits for all of my groomsmen.  The package is slightly banged up but the small razor boxes are fine.</li>
            <li> excellent product !!!</li>
            <li> Deal of the century. This pack will last me two years!</li>
            <li> I went through a variety pack of DE blades, so I have sampled just about all the brands available.  For my needs, they are sharp, but forgiving.  I get a very close shave with few cuts.  If they work for you, you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Love the Shark razor, stays sharper longer. This was a fantastic buy.</li>
            <li> The get dull after 2-3 usage, but you can&#x27;t complain with the price!</li>
            <li> I bought a sampler of razor blades (10 each of 7 different brands/styles).  These came out near the bottom for me.  They&#x27;re sharp but &amp;#34;grabby&amp;#34;.  I would recommend their Shark&#x27;s Chrome blades over their Super Stainless any day.</li>
            <li> Well I guess I&#x27;m just having a blast. I tested the sharpness level of and reviewed  Feather double edge razor blades last week and then turned around and ordered Dorcos,  Derbies, Sharks, Personnas and Gillette Silver Blues.  I already had Astras and Wilkinson Swords on hand so didn&#x27;t need to order them again. I tested again with the same edge sharpness instrument that I had used to test the Feathers. The company that sells the sharpness tester (my instrument is the one designed to test straight edge razors) says that they are going to make additional test media available on Amazon and I may need it if I keep this up. I could describe the test procedure I used and make this review long and drawn out but won&#x27;t bore you with the details.  In a nut shell ;  while there appears to be some very small differences between these  various brands  in initial sharpness levels there isn&#x27;t enough to write about. This is as opposed to the Feathers that tested a full 40% sharper. Please don&#x27;t shoot the messenger!  I am not a Feather salesman. In fact, the somewhat anecdotal  preliminary tests I have conducted indicate that the superior edge on a Feather goes away very rapidly and much more rapidly than that of the less expensive brands but don&#x27;t chisel that in stone just yet.  Please keep in mind also that I tested only one product of each brand so it is possible that other models within the same brand might be sharper (or duller). If I come up with a good edge durability test I may be back because I&#x27;m just having to much fun with all this testing.</li>
            <li> These things are so dull in my razor that every time I&#x27;ve tried one (and I&#x27;ve given them multiple chances), I&#x27;ve immediately pulled it out and thrown it away. The blade catches and pulls way too much compared to a carbon steel blade, I stay away like they&#x27;re rusty old hack jobs</li>
            <li> These blades are pretty cool my son uses them to shave hes happy with them I definitely recommend this purchase</li>
            <li> Blades were so dull I had to replace on same shave, I have read the reviews on this blade and I&#x27;m not sure why I&#x27;m getting such a different experience. I went back to Personna it is quite arguably the best blade out there. American Made you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> These blades are less than OK.  I shaved with them for a while now (since I bought the 100) pack and I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing until I used a friends Astra Blades. These blades are as sharp new as the Astra blades are when they get dull.  I&#x27;m not going to be buying these guys again.  A new blade will pull and tear at my face and it hurts to shave my upper lip.  I&#x27;ll either try the Astra blades or the Feathers since I hear they are CRAZY sharp.</li>
            <li> Best blades I&#x27;ve ever used. I have tried other brands and even consulted a well viewed shaving blog for recommendations. I tried several ones but none have compared to this blade. I have sensitive skin and a thick, fast growing beard. It cuts through my beard with ease. Stays sharp throughout the shave and from start to finish - no nicks. I just bought a large supply because I am so satisfied with this blade. No more trying others for me - this is my preference. Arrived well packaged, on time, and as expected. Would buy again, no doubt.</li>
            <li> THESE BLADES ARE VERY SHARP AND PROVIDE A SMOOTH SHAVE.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get the good shave I used to get.  The blade seem too thin and wimpy.  Maybe it&#x27;s the razor.</li>
            <li> I recently tried a mixed batch of blades in a trial package.  I really liked these Shark DE blades and plan to stick with them for the long hall.</li>
            <li> Not sharp enough for my tough beard.</li>
            <li> 100 razors that will last me a year or more for the price!</li>
            <li> Great. Its a blade. Stainless steel. Haven&#x27;t sliced my face yet.  100 PCs should last me 2 years.</li>
            <li> These blades are much sharper than the ones I was buying at my local store, and they stay sharper for longer as well.  The packaging these blades came in was pretty nice.  After unfolding it you can see it was meant as a store display, for individual sales of the boxes.  The blades are made in Egypt.  Overall I would say they&#x27;re a good buy and are good quality.</li>
