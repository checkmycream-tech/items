            <li>They are comfortable on my eyes and feel just smooth.</li>

            <li>This mask is comfortable to wear and the ear plugs</li>
            <li>Such a great bonus.</li>
            <li>I have a hubby and 3 kids who often do not understand that mommy is a light sleeper.</li>
            <li>and sometimes my light wakes him.</li>
            <li>They fit comfortably on your face.</li>
            <li>Straps are elastic and have velcro to securely tighten.  </li>
            <li>It was quite comfortable to sleep in</li>
            <li>Aside from the fact that there&#x27;s 2, they&#x27;re designed with a neat flap to block light coming in from under your nose.</li>
            <li>They are comfortable even while sleeping on the side of your head.</li>
            <li>This Mask is amazingly comfortable to sleep in.  </li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t.the Velcro laid really smooth against my head .  </li>
            <li>These do not shut out all the light you can see light from the bottom.</li>
            <li>I have severe migraines and have been told by my doctor to try a sleep mask to darken out all light and to place ear plugs in for the noise when I have the severe ones.</li>
            <li>which were neither comfortable nor held up well.</li>
            <li>This mask is comfortable and lightweight however, it does let some light in under the nose.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t see any light at all.</li>
            <li>I have purchased those cheap drug store eye masks and used them when I travel by air.</li>
            <li>I needed an eye mask that would fit under my cpap and not interfere with my breathing.</li>
            <li>These helped keep out light while I&#x27;m trying to sleep.</li>
            <li>They also helped when I have a headache and trying to keep out the light.</li>
            <li>The ear plugs are nice, too and come in handy when I need some extra sleep.</li>
            <li>Many masks i have used dont fit right or light still sneaks in the bottom.  </li>
            <li>Earplugs included, which I never need but, gladly, don&#x27;t bother me - they are attached right to the headband.  </li>
            <li>I love the bonus earplugs attached right to the strap so they won&#x27;t get lost.</li>
            <li>I love that there is a place to keep the earplugs right on the strap of the mask.</li>
            <li>This comes in a very nice satin bag for storage and to my surprise there were actually 2 sleeping masks in the bag!!</li>
            <li>They do a very good job in blocking out the light and are comfortable, allowing me to still blink without being too tight against my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited to get this product to review.</li>
            <li>I am excited to use this when we go on trips as well, since I am always wanting to go to sleep before the rest of my family</li>
            <li>The elastic is nice &amp; wide and most importantly, adjustable!</li>
            <li>No complaint of any kind.</li>
            <li>I have used sleep masks for many years and can attest to the fact YOU WILL SLEEP more soundly and restfully when you sleep in complete darkness.  </li>
            <li>This is super comfortable.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s super comfy and it keeps the light out.</li>
            <li>It is nice, made well, and very soft on the inside.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The ear plugs fit right into your ears and block out all sound around</li>
            <li>The foam earplugs are too hard and hurt my ears, but the masks themselves are great!  </li>
            <li>The ear plugs worked well when he traveled for work and stayed in a hotel - he slept much deeper and had a better quality of sleep than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice and soft on your face.</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite mask .  </li>
            <li>Very convenient though :)</li>
            <li>Such a good value for 2 pairs of masks plus 2 pair of earplugs.  </li>
            <li>There were two sleep masks in the bag, and my five year old daughter immediately swiped one for her own use.  </li>
            <li>I liked the earplugs too because they were soft and conformed to the inside of my ears</li>
            <li>Not a bad mask.</li>
            <li>It fits very comfortably, the adjustable strap is a fabulous addition, and the material is soft and lightweight.</li>
            <li>The masks (2) are very comfortable and when adjusted properly completely blot out any light from getting to my eyes.</li>
            <li>The strap in the back are not itchy and these sleep masks fit nicely.</li>
            <li>My children quickly stole one for themselves and my son even slept with it that night.  </li>
            <li>Not sure first post went thru-- perfect mask for me and getting two was a blessing..</li>
            <li>I received my Evatex Sleep Mask quickly and with no damage during shipping.  </li>
            <li>Pretty comfortable.</li>
            <li>These are pretty snazzy!</li>
            <li>This sleeping mask is exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use ear plus regularly, but when I do need them, it&#x27;s nice to have quick access to them.</li>
            <li>Great little pack - two included.  </li>
            <li>With the mask and the ear plugs on I am basically sound proof against my wife when she wakes and wants to turn the tv on at 6 am.</li>
            <li>I really like how it has a piece of fabric that covers the bridge of my nose to help keep all the light out of my eyes.  </li>
            <li>The earplugs would have been nice, but I can always get smaller ones elsewhere.</li>
            <li>The ear plugs are useful thru the day when you want to block out the bickering of two preteen boys.    </li>
            <li>If I put them above my ears, to be more comfortable, they slip off at night.</li>
            <li>Even though her face is smaller, she says that it still blocks out most of the light.  </li>
            <li>so it cuts into the top of your ears, it does not block light unless you pull it right enough that the eye padding collapses onto your eyes.</li>
            <li>the a very handy feature is that the ear plugs have a little holder on the mask&#x27;s strap.  </li>
            <li>It fits right on my head</li>
            <li>Comes in nice little bag for travel or easy storage.</li>
            <li>Very soft, easily adjustable.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even tell you how many nights (prior to having this mask) that I would go to get my ear plugs out of my nightstand and only be able to find one!</li>
            <li>Super soft fabric and blocks out all light.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s not ideal for me, still looking for a perfect sleep mask...</li>
            <li>I have found I prefer the black to brightly colored &amp;#34;feminine&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and really blocks out any amount of light.</li>
            <li>I love my soft sleep mask and these gentle ear plugs.</li>
            <li>Only wish they had the gel inserts, but overall great bang for buck.</li>
            <li>The mask is very soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li>They are very soft and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>, it is overall very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Keeps all the light out, more than my other masks.</li>
            <li>He really likes the complimentary ear plugs to deafen out the surrounding sounds to help him stay asleep.</li>
            <li>It never fails that the owner lets them out around 9am every morning.</li>
            <li>Since they come in a set of 2, both me and my fiancé get peaceful rest.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not too hot to,sleep in.</li>
            <li>Returned the first day I got it.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a product like this for quite a while, I love this one because it doesn&#x27;t only have the mask to keep you asleep</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s a double set - one to use, one to keep in overnight bag.</li>
            <li>and she really loves hers!</li>
            <li>With the sleeping mask for the last week I have been able to sleep undisturbed.  </li>
            <li>I recently had surgery and it allows me to rest fully, something I would not be able to do with this family.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>I will only buy this brand from now on as it has become my favorite.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very happy with this small addition to my arsenal of &amp;#34;good nights sleep&amp;#34; weapons.</li>
            <li>I work night shift and it has been an absolute God send!</li>
            <li>Very well made, it is not going to fall apart!  </li>
            <li>and the migraine goes away much sooner!</li>
            <li>The first night using the mask</li>
            <li>The second night was a much better sleep.</li>
            <li>I decided to keep it for those hot summer nights when  a lightweight mask is preferable.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The mask is so soft but blocks out any type of light you may have</li>
            <li>They are made of soft light weight satin.</li>
            <li>The mask blocks light completely.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to adjust, it&#x27;s soft/comfortable enough to not bother me while I try to sleep, and them little bonus earplugs that coem with it just make it work even better :)</li>
            <li>Really helps when I get a migraine, I am very sensitive to light and sounds and this does the trick.</li>
            <li>They are very convenient because there are your plugs right there in the head in the eye mask</li>
            <li>The band is thick and doesn&#x27;t dig into your ears which is definitely the best part!!</li>
            <li>The band is thick and doesn&#x27;t dig into your ears which is definitely the best part!</li>
            <li>I put 4 instead of 5 stars because the earplugs are pretty large.  </li>
            <li>I have no affiliation with the company at all, and I am not required to leave a positive review.</li>
            <li>The fabric against your face is soft and comfortable and the flap over the nose helps keep out as much light as possible.</li>
            <li>Super soft sleeping masks.</li>
            <li>Recently moved to 3rd shift so these are a necessity and was very pleased with the price and that 2 masks come in the package.  </li>
            <li>Super soft and comfy sleeping masks.</li>
            <li>The masks themselves were super soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I have a pretty big head and no issue with fit.</li>
            <li>These masks are uber soft and have a nice extra strip of fabric over the bridge of the nose (where light normally gets in) to keep you in almost total darkness.</li>
            <li>but they were a nice little bonus.</li>
            <li>The mask creates a total blackout effect for him and helps him sleep soundly.</li>
            <li>It covers very well.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to go looking for them when I really need them.</li>
            <li>, they drop out and do not cancel much noise anyway</li>
            <li>then her pink frilly one :)</li>
            <li>This is the real deal.</li>
            <li>so this makes it so much easier to find at bedtime.</li>
            <li>And even though I was given this produst to review,i like them so much I ain&#x27;t sharing even one of them</li>
            <li>WHATSOEVER providing Total darkness and comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a speedy delivery.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the bonus earplugs that go with the masks and the satin pouch.</li>
            <li>It keeps the light out, it&#x27;s super soft and so unbelievable comfortable.</li>
            <li>The adjustable strap is wide and generous in length to ensure the right  fit for anyone.  </li>
            <li>Of course my room would be right across from the bathroom which means, nightly I hear slamming doors, and get a flood of light into my room even with the door closed from the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>The extra piece by the nose really keeps all the light out, more than my other masks.</li>
            <li>Other than that I really enjoyed this item.</li>
            <li>This more or less functions as expected, however I couldn&#x27;t bear to leave it on my face for more than a minute.</li>
            <li>The wish the mask itself was a little thicker, but it&#x27;s still nice, made well, and very soft on the inside.</li>
            <li>I have these two huge fenced in dogs that live next to me</li>
            <li>You have an extra for someone special.</li>
            <li>On my side of the bed I have two baby monitors with bright lights and my husband has been working odd hours, which may have him sleeping later in the mornings.  </li>
            <li>The included bag makes storing them anywhere easy and the ear buds go right into little holders on the straps</li>
            <li>To my surprise I was not able to feel it at all and the ability to adjust for a looser/tighter feel was a nice feature.</li>
            <li>The mask is so comfortable to wear and the ear plugs will come in handy when they sit outside late night and talk.</li>
            <li>But, overall the eye mask is soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li>so I highly recommend getting these 💺✈️</li>
            <li>Being able to store them with my mask helps me keep track of those sneaky little rascals.</li>
            <li>and he wants one to says it feels so soft on his skin.</li>
            <li>This sleep mask is good, not great.</li>
            <li>This model also has a little flap that hugs your nose and gives you a better &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34;, not letting in as much light as some other types.</li>
            <li>This is not tight so it doesn&#x27;t bother me really.</li>
            <li>The quality of my sleep has been improved too ; its much less disruptive -with noise blocked out by the ear plugs and the gentle eye mask blocking out light.  </li>
            <li>When I did wake up I went right back to sleep because I didn&#x27;t look around because I had the mask on.</li>
            <li>I picked this one out as it looked a little more masculine</li>
            <li>and it came out of the dryer still looking brand new.</li>
            <li>I washed my mask and it came out of the dryer still looking brand new.</li>
            <li>Now I have to try new ones because I was just diagnosed with stage one kidney disease and can not just take anything anymore.</li>
            <li>I work rotating shifts as a nurse, so when I come off a night shift I need something covering my eyes to help me sleep during the day without having to purchase new window treatments.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion these are very soft against the face/eye area allowing the process of sleep soothing and something new to look forward to.</li>
            <li>As a person who works different shifts and sometimes has to sleep during the day, these improved my sleep very much.</li>
            <li>My husband wakes up very early and his snoring drives me nuts when I am trying to sleep.</li>
            <li>From time to time I will work very early</li>
            <li>It secures easily and efficiently without being too tight, and is fully adjustable.</li>
            <li>I was also surprised that 2 came in the mail instead of one!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft!</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>These have been an amazing help in my sleep quality lately!</li>
            <li>The strap was not too tight and allowed for a comfortable nights sleep.  </li>
            <li>Mask is soft and silky, the straps are elastic and have velcro to adjust for a tight fit.</li>
            <li>This sleep mask was so soft against my face.  </li>
            <li>Both my husband and I like sleeping in complete darkness.  </li>
            <li>The out side is satin and the side that lays against your face is a soft fleece type cotton.</li>
            <li>Sleep mask feels soft.</li>
            <li>they are so soft on he side towards the eyes.</li>
            <li>The out side is satin and the side that lays against your face is a soft fleece type cotton.</li>
            <li>Mask is soft and silky.</li>
            <li>it helps me sleep in complete darkness with these soft ear plugs</li>
            <li>It is soft and does not rub as others I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Until now I was only able to buy thin fabric masks locally which were comfortable, but didn&#x27;t hold up well, and molded ones purchased online</li>
            <li>So I stopped wearing them completely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and lightweight.</li>
            <li>It is very soft and fits comfortably but is too small for me.</li>
            <li>The nose piece extends down further, so it blocks out almost ALL light.  </li>
            <li>Window blinds and shades just don&#x27;t cut out the light enough and it makes it very difficult to fall asleep, with the sleep mask I am able to block out all the daylight and feel like I am sleeping at night like a normal person.</li>
            <li>When I tried them, there was a small bit of light I couldn&#x27;t get rid.  </li>
            <li>A small amount of light gets in around the mask bottom by my nose.</li>
            <li>Eye mask does not fit snugly enough to prevent light from coming in around nostirls.</li>
            <li>The mask that wins the 5 star rating from me was the Lewis n Clark 505 black mask.  </li>
            <li>This thing is majorly comfy and stays in place.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when I saw that you actually get 2 sleeping masks.</li>
            <li>the ear plugs are soft enough to where they do not hurt when you switch sides.</li>
            <li>I could barely see out the bottom at all.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone who suffers from good sleep.</li>
            <li>Recently my optometrist asked if I slept with my eyes slightly open, since the lower eye and lid were considerably dryer than the rest.</li>
            <li>This would be great for other folks out there working those crazy shifts and pulling all nighters.</li>
            <li>I was worried that the masks would be uncomfortable and constricting, but they&#x27;re adjustable and feel very light on the face.  </li>
            <li>I have a weird schedule for working, where I have to go to bed when it is still very light outside, and everyone else in the house is still awake.  </li>
            <li>I really like that there are little pocket-like spots sewn in the strap to keep track of the earplugs.  </li>

            <li> A bit too warm for hotter weather but great deal and work like they should</li>

            <li> I really like that it came with the bonus earplugs they were a nice touch.</li>

            <li> Such a great bonus.</li>
            <li> I have a hubby and 3 kids who often do not understand that mommy is a light sleeper.</li>
            <li> and sometimes my light wakes him.</li>
            <li> They fit comfortably on your face.</li>
            <li> Straps are elastic and have velcro to securely tighten.  </li>
            <li> It was quite comfortable to sleep in</li>
            <li> Aside from the fact that there&#x27;s 2, they&#x27;re designed with a neat flap to block light coming in from under your nose.</li>
            <li> They are comfortable even while sleeping on the side of your head.</li>
            <li> This Mask is amazingly comfortable to sleep in.  </li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t.the Velcro laid really smooth against my head .  </li>
            <li> These do not shut out all the light you can see light from the bottom.</li>
            <li> I have severe migraines and have been told by my doctor to try a sleep mask to darken out all light and to place ear plugs in for the noise when I have the severe ones.</li>
            <li> which were neither comfortable nor held up well.</li>
            <li> This mask is comfortable and lightweight however, it does let some light in under the nose.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t see any light at all.</li>
            <li> I have purchased those cheap drug store eye masks and used them when I travel by air.</li>
            <li> I needed an eye mask that would fit under my cpap and not interfere with my breathing.</li>
            <li> These helped keep out light while I&#x27;m trying to sleep.</li>
            <li> They also helped when I have a headache and trying to keep out the light.</li>
            <li> The ear plugs are nice, too and come in handy when I need some extra sleep.</li>
            <li> Many masks i have used dont fit right or light still sneaks in the bottom.  </li>
            <li> Earplugs included, which I never need but, gladly, don&#x27;t bother me - they are attached right to the headband.  </li>
            <li> I love the bonus earplugs attached right to the strap so they won&#x27;t get lost.</li>
            <li> I love that there is a place to keep the earplugs right on the strap of the mask.</li>
            <li> This comes in a very nice satin bag for storage and to my surprise there were actually 2 sleeping masks in the bag!!</li>
            <li> They do a very good job in blocking out the light and are comfortable, allowing me to still blink without being too tight against my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this product to review.</li>
            <li> I am excited to use this when we go on trips as well, since I am always wanting to go to sleep before the rest of my family</li>
            <li> The elastic is nice &amp; wide and most importantly, adjustable!</li>
            <li> No complaint of any kind.</li>
            <li> I have used sleep masks for many years and can attest to the fact YOU WILL SLEEP more soundly and restfully when you sleep in complete darkness.  </li>
            <li> This is super comfortable.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s super comfy and it keeps the light out.</li>
            <li> It is nice, made well, and very soft on the inside.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The ear plugs fit right into your ears and block out all sound around</li>
            <li> The foam earplugs are too hard and hurt my ears, but the masks themselves are great!  </li>
            <li> The ear plugs worked well when he traveled for work and stayed in a hotel - he slept much deeper and had a better quality of sleep than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice and soft on your face.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite mask .  </li>
            <li> Very convenient though :)</li>
            <li> Such a good value for 2 pairs of masks plus 2 pair of earplugs.  </li>
            <li> There were two sleep masks in the bag, and my five year old daughter immediately swiped one for her own use.  </li>
            <li> I liked the earplugs too because they were soft and conformed to the inside of my ears</li>
            <li> Not a bad mask.</li>
            <li> It fits very comfortably, the adjustable strap is a fabulous addition, and the material is soft and lightweight.</li>
            <li> The masks (2) are very comfortable and when adjusted properly completely blot out any light from getting to my eyes.</li>
            <li> The strap in the back are not itchy and these sleep masks fit nicely.</li>
            <li> My children quickly stole one for themselves and my son even slept with it that night.  </li>
            <li> Not sure first post went thru-- perfect mask for me and getting two was a blessing..</li>
            <li> I received my Evatex Sleep Mask quickly and with no damage during shipping.  </li>
            <li> Pretty comfortable.</li>
            <li> These are pretty snazzy!</li>
            <li> This sleeping mask is exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use ear plus regularly, but when I do need them, it&#x27;s nice to have quick access to them.</li>
            <li> Great little pack - two included.  </li>
            <li> With the mask and the ear plugs on I am basically sound proof against my wife when she wakes and wants to turn the tv on at 6 am.</li>
            <li> I really like how it has a piece of fabric that covers the bridge of my nose to help keep all the light out of my eyes.  </li>
            <li> The earplugs would have been nice, but I can always get smaller ones elsewhere.</li>
            <li> The ear plugs are useful thru the day when you want to block out the bickering of two preteen boys.    </li>
            <li> If I put them above my ears, to be more comfortable, they slip off at night.</li>
            <li> Even though her face is smaller, she says that it still blocks out most of the light.  </li>
            <li> so it cuts into the top of your ears, it does not block light unless you pull it right enough that the eye padding collapses onto your eyes.</li>
            <li> the a very handy feature is that the ear plugs have a little holder on the mask&#x27;s strap.  </li>
            <li> It fits right on my head</li>
            <li> Comes in nice little bag for travel or easy storage.</li>
            <li> Very soft, easily adjustable.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even tell you how many nights (prior to having this mask) that I would go to get my ear plugs out of my nightstand and only be able to find one!</li>
            <li> Super soft fabric and blocks out all light.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s not ideal for me, still looking for a perfect sleep mask...</li>
            <li> I have found I prefer the black to brightly colored &amp;#34;feminine&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and really blocks out any amount of light.</li>
            <li> I love my soft sleep mask and these gentle ear plugs.</li>
            <li> Only wish they had the gel inserts, but overall great bang for buck.</li>
            <li> The mask is very soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li> They are very soft and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> , it is overall very comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Keeps all the light out, more than my other masks.</li>
            <li> He really likes the complimentary ear plugs to deafen out the surrounding sounds to help him stay asleep.</li>
            <li> It never fails that the owner lets them out around 9am every morning.</li>
            <li> Since they come in a set of 2, both me and my fiancé get peaceful rest.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not too hot to,sleep in.</li>
            <li> Returned the first day I got it.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product like this for quite a while, I love this one because it doesn&#x27;t only have the mask to keep you asleep</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s a double set - one to use, one to keep in overnight bag.</li>
            <li> and she really loves hers!</li>
            <li> With the sleeping mask for the last week I have been able to sleep undisturbed.  </li>
            <li> I recently had surgery and it allows me to rest fully, something I would not be able to do with this family.  </li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> I will only buy this brand from now on as it has become my favorite.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very happy with this small addition to my arsenal of &amp;#34;good nights sleep&amp;#34; weapons.</li>
            <li> I work night shift and it has been an absolute God send!</li>
            <li> Very well made, it is not going to fall apart!  </li>
            <li> and the migraine goes away much sooner!</li>
            <li> The first night using the mask</li>
            <li> The second night was a much better sleep.</li>
            <li> I decided to keep it for those hot summer nights when  a lightweight mask is preferable.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The mask is so soft but blocks out any type of light you may have</li>
            <li> They are made of soft light weight satin.</li>
            <li> The mask blocks light completely.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to adjust, it&#x27;s soft/comfortable enough to not bother me while I try to sleep, and them little bonus earplugs that coem with it just make it work even better :)</li>
            <li> Really helps when I get a migraine, I am very sensitive to light and sounds and this does the trick.</li>
            <li> They are very convenient because there are your plugs right there in the head in the eye mask</li>
            <li> The band is thick and doesn&#x27;t dig into your ears which is definitely the best part!!</li>
            <li> The band is thick and doesn&#x27;t dig into your ears which is definitely the best part!</li>
            <li> I put 4 instead of 5 stars because the earplugs are pretty large.  </li>
            <li> I have no affiliation with the company at all, and I am not required to leave a positive review.</li>
            <li> The fabric against your face is soft and comfortable and the flap over the nose helps keep out as much light as possible.</li>
            <li> Super soft sleeping masks.</li>
            <li> Recently moved to 3rd shift so these are a necessity and was very pleased with the price and that 2 masks come in the package.  </li>
            <li> Super soft and comfy sleeping masks.</li>
            <li> The masks themselves were super soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty big head and no issue with fit.</li>
            <li> These masks are uber soft and have a nice extra strip of fabric over the bridge of the nose (where light normally gets in) to keep you in almost total darkness.</li>
            <li> but they were a nice little bonus.</li>
            <li> The mask creates a total blackout effect for him and helps him sleep soundly.</li>
            <li> It covers very well.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to go looking for them when I really need them.</li>
            <li> , they drop out and do not cancel much noise anyway</li>
            <li> then her pink frilly one :)</li>
            <li> This is the real deal.</li>
            <li> so this makes it so much easier to find at bedtime.</li>
            <li> And even though I was given this produst to review,i like them so much I ain&#x27;t sharing even one of them</li>
            <li> WHATSOEVER providing Total darkness and comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the bonus earplugs that go with the masks and the satin pouch.</li>
            <li> It keeps the light out, it&#x27;s super soft and so unbelievable comfortable.</li>
            <li> The adjustable strap is wide and generous in length to ensure the right  fit for anyone.  </li>
            <li> Of course my room would be right across from the bathroom which means, nightly I hear slamming doors, and get a flood of light into my room even with the door closed from the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> The extra piece by the nose really keeps all the light out, more than my other masks.</li>
            <li> Other than that I really enjoyed this item.</li>
            <li> This more or less functions as expected, however I couldn&#x27;t bear to leave it on my face for more than a minute.</li>
            <li> The wish the mask itself was a little thicker, but it&#x27;s still nice, made well, and very soft on the inside.</li>
            <li> I have these two huge fenced in dogs that live next to me</li>
            <li> You have an extra for someone special.</li>
            <li> On my side of the bed I have two baby monitors with bright lights and my husband has been working odd hours, which may have him sleeping later in the mornings.  </li>
            <li> The included bag makes storing them anywhere easy and the ear buds go right into little holders on the straps</li>
            <li> To my surprise I was not able to feel it at all and the ability to adjust for a looser/tighter feel was a nice feature.</li>
            <li> The mask is so comfortable to wear and the ear plugs will come in handy when they sit outside late night and talk.</li>
            <li> But, overall the eye mask is soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li> so I highly recommend getting these 💺✈️</li>
            <li> Being able to store them with my mask helps me keep track of those sneaky little rascals.</li>
            <li> and he wants one to says it feels so soft on his skin.</li>
            <li> This sleep mask is good, not great.</li>
            <li> This model also has a little flap that hugs your nose and gives you a better &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34;, not letting in as much light as some other types.</li>
            <li> This is not tight so it doesn&#x27;t bother me really.</li>
            <li> The quality of my sleep has been improved too ; its much less disruptive -with noise blocked out by the ear plugs and the gentle eye mask blocking out light.  </li>
            <li> When I did wake up I went right back to sleep because I didn&#x27;t look around because I had the mask on.</li>
            <li> I picked this one out as it looked a little more masculine</li>
            <li> and it came out of the dryer still looking brand new.</li>
            <li> I washed my mask and it came out of the dryer still looking brand new.</li>
            <li> Now I have to try new ones because I was just diagnosed with stage one kidney disease and can not just take anything anymore.</li>
            <li> I work rotating shifts as a nurse, so when I come off a night shift I need something covering my eyes to help me sleep during the day without having to purchase new window treatments.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion these are very soft against the face/eye area allowing the process of sleep soothing and something new to look forward to.</li>
            <li> As a person who works different shifts and sometimes has to sleep during the day, these improved my sleep very much.</li>
            <li> My husband wakes up very early and his snoring drives me nuts when I am trying to sleep.</li>
            <li> From time to time I will work very early</li>
            <li> It secures easily and efficiently without being too tight, and is fully adjustable.</li>
            <li> I was also surprised that 2 came in the mail instead of one!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft!</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> These have been an amazing help in my sleep quality lately!</li>
            <li> The strap was not too tight and allowed for a comfortable nights sleep.  </li>
            <li> Mask is soft and silky, the straps are elastic and have velcro to adjust for a tight fit.</li>
            <li> This sleep mask was so soft against my face.  </li>
            <li> Both my husband and I like sleeping in complete darkness.  </li>
            <li> The out side is satin and the side that lays against your face is a soft fleece type cotton.</li>
            <li> Sleep mask feels soft.</li>
            <li> they are so soft on he side towards the eyes.</li>
            <li> The out side is satin and the side that lays against your face is a soft fleece type cotton.</li>
            <li> Mask is soft and silky.</li>
            <li> it helps me sleep in complete darkness with these soft ear plugs</li>
            <li> It is soft and does not rub as others I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Until now I was only able to buy thin fabric masks locally which were comfortable, but didn&#x27;t hold up well, and molded ones purchased online</li>
            <li> So I stopped wearing them completely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and lightweight.</li>
            <li> It is very soft and fits comfortably but is too small for me.</li>
            <li> The nose piece extends down further, so it blocks out almost ALL light.  </li>
            <li> Window blinds and shades just don&#x27;t cut out the light enough and it makes it very difficult to fall asleep, with the sleep mask I am able to block out all the daylight and feel like I am sleeping at night like a normal person.</li>
            <li> When I tried them, there was a small bit of light I couldn&#x27;t get rid.  </li>
            <li> A small amount of light gets in around the mask bottom by my nose.</li>
            <li> Eye mask does not fit snugly enough to prevent light from coming in around nostirls.</li>
            <li> The mask that wins the 5 star rating from me was the Lewis n Clark 505 black mask.  </li>
            <li> This thing is majorly comfy and stays in place.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I saw that you actually get 2 sleeping masks.</li>
            <li> the ear plugs are soft enough to where they do not hurt when you switch sides.</li>
            <li> I could barely see out the bottom at all.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who suffers from good sleep.</li>
            <li> Recently my optometrist asked if I slept with my eyes slightly open, since the lower eye and lid were considerably dryer than the rest.</li>
            <li> This would be great for other folks out there working those crazy shifts and pulling all nighters.</li>
            <li> I was worried that the masks would be uncomfortable and constricting, but they&#x27;re adjustable and feel very light on the face.  </li>
            <li> I have a weird schedule for working, where I have to go to bed when it is still very light outside, and everyone else in the house is still awake.  </li>
            <li> I really like that there are little pocket-like spots sewn in the strap to keep track of the earplugs.  </li>
            <li> The straps feels a bit uncomfortable, but other than that everything else is nice</li>
            <li> The least amount of light in a dark room</li>
            <li> I wanted this mask because my husband got a similar one not too long ago</li>
            <li> And I didn&#x27;t feel a bump when I laid down which surprised me.</li>
            <li> I tried a few of those cheap generic sleep masks you get at like CVS or a similar store, but they didn&#x27;t really do the job, either not fitting my head well, or just being overall an uncomfortable annoyance.</li>
            <li> Well, the answer for your houseguest is a soft little eye mask that makes up for all the shortcomings of your guest room.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased dollar store sleep masks before &amp; they use very thin elastic that gets stretched out very quickly.</li>
            <li> I look forward to wearing this mask to bed for a long time and getting some restful sleep.  </li>
            <li> I know I close my eyes when I sleep, but I&#x27;m thinking now maybe I don&#x27;t close them completely since after sleeping with the mask on for a few weeks</li>
            <li> Also, I find it a bit difficult to tell which way is up and down; if I wear it the wrong way, it&#x27;s just off center enough to not be comfortable, plus the flap to keep extra light from getting in.</li>
            <li> i was looking for something with a wide band because I&#x27;ve purchased sleep masks before &amp; if they use very thin elastic that gets stretched out very quickly.</li>
            <li> I have needed this for a long time!</li>
            <li> I would suggest washing them before use as right out of the package they do have a slight smell - not a particularly strong or foul smell, just odd.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had improvement to my chronic dry eye condition.</li>
            <li> The only down side was that one of them was damaged, the Velcro had already come off upon taking it out of the package.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to others who are looking for a sleep mask for napping, traveling, or pretending not to stare their children down.</li>
            <li> So, I lied, I&#x27;m not really a fan of sleep masks, per se, but I am a fan of sleeping, and that sometimes needs to happen during daytime</li>
            <li> so I have to be careful with elastic bands on my skin</li>
            <li> I like the wide elastic Velcro strap because it makes it adjustable to your face.</li>
            <li> No fraying or discoloration or any other issues.</li>
            <li> As with anything else elastic, it is starting to stretch a small amount but not affecting the ability to use.</li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t always get to sleep in the spare room we have because it is used for other reasons, so</li>
            <li> so his and hers so that we can both not be bothered by each other.</li>
            <li> I was not sure initially if the velcro on the strap was going to irritate me while I slept or not.</li>
            <li> I keep one mask in my travel bag and the other on my night stand.  </li>
            <li> I got these masks because I have a new house that was built seven feet behind my bedroom and</li>
            <li> and I sometimes have to sleep before the sun goes down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight fabric and neutral in black.</li>
            <li> As for the velcro on both brands, I have long hair and usually braid it at night, therefore, I do not have any trouble with the velcro.</li>
            <li> Not shaped comofrtably, and strap is tight.</li>
            <li> And they were a little itchy.</li>
            <li> It comes with a nifty little case for storage and a set of earplugs.</li>
            <li> It comes in a slinky little bag of mystery.</li>
            <li> The little piece they say conforms around you nose does nothing to help.</li>
            <li> I will try and wash it to see if it softens up a little.</li>
            <li> The only problem is the earplugs are exposed and if you don&#x27;t use them they are likely to get dirty.</li>
            <li> No light sneaks through and it doesn&#x27;t shift around during the night.</li>
            <li> Fits snug and firm.</li>
            <li> Works well, no light comes in</li>
            <li> so no light can get through.</li>
            <li> Forgot I was wearing it a few times and</li>
            <li> I did still wake up a few times that night.</li>
            <li> I needed a few nights to get used to wearing the masks</li>
            <li> no light sneaking in under around the nose.  </li>
            <li> NO LIGHT</li>
            <li> but I think it is too stiff and does not conform well to my face.</li>
            <li> Plus it comes with 2 sleep masks and two sets of earplugs in a convenient little pouch!  </li>
            <li> I have worn masks in the past that woke me just because I was wearing them.  </li>
            <li> We bought these for our trip and found them to be way too  small for us.  </li>
            <li> even for my small ears (I can never find ear buds or plugs that fit--and stay in--well.</li>
            <li> Not exactly the worst sleep mask ever made, but pretty comparable to the ones you get from airlines.</li>
            <li> These masks are so lightweight, I hardly know I&#x27;m wearing them - no kidding.  </li>
            <li> My husband likes to watch tv late at night when I am trying to sleep.  </li>
            <li> Leave me alone, your product sucks.</li>
            <li> My husband stays up late watching tv</li>
            <li> I went through ear plugs at a ridiculous rate.</li>
            <li> and it is very hard when you are all in one room together.  </li>
            <li> The strap is tough</li>
            <li> Thin curtains?</li>
            <li> It is so annoying when you are trying to sleep on a long night flight and your neighbors have their reading lights on.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, that doesn&#x27;t seem to happen.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with these sleeping masks.</li>
            <li> I use them for nap time because the sun is always in my eyes making it difficult for me to sleep during the day.</li>
            <li> The problem with these masks is that they are so uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> They are very thin and scratchy to my eyes.</li>
            <li> Ugly wall paint?</li>
            <li> I bought this for my fiancé who suffers from sleeping problems, and he loves it!</li>
            <li> but hate that I lose them.</li>
            <li> It smells terrible and seems to be off-gassing VOCs something fierce.</li>
            <li> My mother has terrible headaches,  </li>
            <li> The worst part about this mask is that my hair gets tangled in the velcro if I pull it out from under the mask.</li>

            <li> Not exactly the worst sleep mask ever made, but pretty comparable to the ones you get from airlines. It&#x27;s cheaply made, but again.. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> smells like 99cents store stuff</li>
            <li> This sleep mask was so soft against my face.  The strap was not too tight and allowed for a comfortable nights sleep.  I the a very handy feature is that the ear plugs have a little holder on the mask&#x27;s strap.  An added bonus is that it comes as a two pack, so I gave a set to my friend and we are both sleeping better.</li>
            <li> My husband tried these out in a very bright sunlit room and they cut out every bit of the light.  When I tried them, there was a small bit of light I couldn&#x27;t get rid.  My guess is it&#x27;s the different shape of my face or nose!  Anyway, he&#x27;s sold, and we&#x27;re both happy!  It&#x27;s also nice that you get two separate masks when you order these.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my fiancé who suffers from sleeping problems, and he loves it! The mask creates a total blackout effect for him and helps him sleep soundly. He really likes the complimentary ear plugs to deafen out the surrounding sounds to help him stay asleep. The mask is very soft and comfortable. Great quality!</li>
            <li> I wanted this mask because my husband got a similar one not too long ago and I was quite jealous. It fits very comfortably, the adjustable strap is a fabulous addition, and the material is soft and lightweight. It covers very well. No light sneaks through and it doesn&#x27;t shift around during the night. I love that it comes with ear plugs and the built in pouch is great. I can&#x27;t even tell you how many nights (prior to having this mask) that I would go to get my ear plugs out of my nightstand and only be able to find one! I went through ear plugs at a ridiculous rate. Being able to store them with my mask helps me keep track of those sneaky little rascals. The quality is great - I washed my mask over the weekend and it came out of the dryer still looking brand new. No fraying or discoloration or any other issues. I look forward to wearing this mask to bed for a long time and getting some restful sleep.  Disclosure: I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review.

            <li> Both my husband and I like sleeping in complete darkness.  Unfortunately, that doesn&#x27;t seem to happen.  On my side of the bed I have two baby monitors with bright lights and my husband has been working odd hours, which may have him sleeping later in the mornings.  He also travels for work, which means hotel stays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally ordered for me, but my husband saw it on the dresser, used it that night, and it has been his ever since!  That says a lot for the quality of it, because he can be rather picky about things.  He says it&#x27;s very comfortable, stays in place well, and helps him sleep deeper.  The ear plugs worked well when he traveled for work and stayed in a hotel - he slept much deeper and had a better quality of sleep than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A rested husband &#x3D; a happy husband &#x3D; a happy me!  :)</li>
            <li> I can sleep again!! I have these two huge fenced in dogs that live next to me and I work nights. It never fails that the owner lets them out around 9am every morning. I have a big Lab that also barks, so I can never bring myself to complain about it! I have found my solution and could not be happier! The face mask is adjustable to fit almost any face, so I bought one for my boyfriend as well. The ear plugs mold to fit your ears and make everything mute and dreamy again! I could almost cry about how happy I am that I finally found something that didn&#x27;t cost an arm and leg and WORKS!!!</li>
            <li> I love that you get two in one, such a great value. The extra piece by the nose really keeps all the light out, more than my other masks. The wish the mask itself was a little thicker, but it&#x27;s still nice, made well, and very soft on the inside. The band is thick and doesn&#x27;t dig into your ears which is definitely the best part!!</li>
            <li> Good mask but the ear plugs are a bit large and do not stay in my ears.  No problems with hair caught up in velcro though and I have managed to immediately lose the carrying case!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this product to review. I really like that it came with the bonus earplugs they were a nice touch. I think they do a really good job of blocking out the light and fit very comfortably. I would suggest washing them before use as right out of the package they do have a slight smell - not a particularly strong or foul smell, just odd. And they were a little itchy. Other than that I really enjoyed this item. The straps have velcro and can be adjusted to size. As a person who works different shifts and sometimes has to sleep during the day, these improved my sleep very much.</li>
            <li> Love this pair of masks. The earplugs have a snug spot on the band and that is genius. I love using ear plugs but hate that I lose them. The masks are nice and soft and fit perfect. Great product. They would be a great stocking stuffer!!!</li>
            <li> I have worn masks in the past that woke me just because I was wearing them.  These masks are so lightweight, I hardly know I&#x27;m wearing them - no kidding.  They are very soft and comfortable.  The adjustable strap is wide and generous in length to ensure the right  fit for anyone.  Great, great masks.  I received a discount for this product.  This discount did not influence my review, which is based solely on my personal use and assessment of these sleeping masks by Multitex.</li>
            <li> I have a weird schedule for working, where I have to go to bed when it is still very light outside, and everyone else in the house is still awake.  This sleeping mask is perfect to help block out the light and the bonus earplugs are excellent in blocking out the noise from the family.  It is made of very comfortable material and the straps did not bother the tops of my ears at all, it is overall very comfortable.  I am excited to use this when we go on trips as well, since I am always wanting to go to sleep before the rest of my family and it is very hard when you are all in one room together.  I would definitely recommend the Evatex Sleep Mask.</li>
            <li> Oh, these things are life savers. They are comfortable on my eyes and feel just smooth. The ear plugs are great addition as I can finally tune all the noise out and get some good rest when I take a nap. Since they come in a set of 2, both me and my fiancé get peaceful rest. The strap in the back are not itchy and these sleep masks fit nicely.</li>
            <li> Nice and soft on your face.</li>
            <li> Super soft sleeping masks. The elastic is nice &amp; wide and most importantly, adjustable! I&#x27;ve purchased dollar store sleep masks before &amp; they use very thin elastic that gets stretched out very quickly. The out side is satin and the side that lays against your face is a soft fleece type cotton. I don&#x27;t use ear plus regularly, but when I do need them, it&#x27;s nice to have quick access to them. When you&#x27;re not using them, you can&#x27;t tell that they are there if you leave them in the holder. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw that you actually get 2 sleeping masks. I didn&#x27;t notice that in the description.</li>
            <li> I work nights and my daughter is a light sleeper. These masks with the ear plugs are the perfect solution for us! These masks are uber soft and have a nice extra strip of fabric over the bridge of the nose (where light normally gets in) to keep you in almost total darkness. The ear plugs are the great and super squishy. These have been an amazing help in my sleep quality lately! I would definitely get this again- I need one for travel too!!</li>
            <li> I love the sleep mask, you can sleep with all the lights on and you won&#x27;t be bothered by then once you put your mask on.</li>
            <li> Pretty nice masks.  I really like that there are little pocket-like spots sewn in the strap to keep track of the earplugs.  I put 4 instead of 5 stars because the earplugs are pretty large.  I can&#x27;t use them or squish them enough to get them to stay put.  The mask itself is comfortable and came in handy when I was trying to sleep while traveling in the car.  The earplugs would have been nice, but I can always get smaller ones elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I love that you get two masks in this one, such a great deal! Keeps all the light out, more than my other masks. It is nice, made well, and very soft on the inside. The band is thick and doesn&#x27;t dig into your ears which is definitely the best part!</li>
            <li> I use this every night. It&#x27;s comfortable, it doesn&#x27;t cut into my head and it&#x27;s not too hot to,sleep in.</li>
            <li> A bit too warm for hotter weather but great deal and work like they should</li>
            <li> I enjoyed reading the copious amount of great reviews and was excited when my masks arrived.  However, this mask design seemed to have no form-fitting design to it.  The elastic band creates tension across the fabric which leads a feeling of wearing a band across your eyes/eyebrows (depending on where you place it).  Even worse, the tension then causes the fabric to lift off my face and let light in everywhere.  Maybe this is a good mask for others, but not at all for me.  Returned the first day I got it.</li>
            <li> Nice to include two eyemasks! The foam earplugs are too hard and hurt my ears, but the masks themselves are great!  Nice carrying case, too! They stay on just fine at night and they block plenty of light.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite mask .  I just never got around to putting on curtains and the sun comes in so strong..Many masks i have used dont fit right or light still sneaks in the bottom.  these are great because it has that extra flap</li>
            <li> These are pretty snazzy! The eye mask feels good on, and the earplugs make it a perfect combo for when my honey is watching tv in bed. These would be great for travel as well, going to try it out on my next adventure to aid in catching some sleep. I like the case, the feel, the color, and the earplugs attached to the mask on the strap.</li>
            <li> The Evatex Sleep Mask is a really great sleep mask.  My husband likes to watch tv late at night when I am trying to sleep.  Before it was always a problem because the light from the TV would bother me.  With this sleep mask I don&#x27;t have that problem anymore.  This sleep mask is comfortable, fits well, and blocks out the light making it easier for me to sleep.  This sleep mask is very nicely made and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it.  Plus it comes with 2 sleep masks and two sets of earplugs in a convenient little pouch!  Great value!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and helpful review.  This review is 100% my own opinion of the item.</li>
            <li> Love the storage for the earplugs, and the bag it comes in. Nice to have the Velcro to adjust the tightness of the strap. Keeps light out well. Pretty comfortable.</li>
            <li> This is so silky and smooth, I love the way it feels. Blocks out the light my husband keeps on and the earplugs block the tv sound. I have needed this for a long time!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product like this for quite a while, I love this one because it doesn&#x27;t only have the mask to keep you asleep but it came with ear plugs! What an awesome combination!</li>
            <li> This more or less functions as expected, however I couldn&#x27;t bear to leave it on my face for more than a minute. It smells terrible and seems to be off-gassing VOCs something fierce.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable mask, strap doesn&#x27;t snag hair.  This mask is comfortable to wear and the ear plugs help.&lt;br /&gt;nice feature - having a place to keep ear plugs. Love that it&#x27;s a double set - one to use, one to keep in overnight bag. Very happy with this.</li>
            <li> This mask comes with a set of two and is comfortable and does a great job of blocking out the light. With the mask and the ear plugs on I am basically sound proof against my wife when she wakes and wants to turn the tv on at 6 am.</li>
            <li> Eye mask does not fit snugly enough to prevent light from coming in around nostirls. Not shaped comofrtably, and strap is tight. Thermapedic night shade is infinitely better!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experienced the greatness of sleep masks before and when I saw these being offered as a promotion, with an amazing price I knew I had to get them. In my opinion these are very soft against the face/eye area allowing the process of sleep soothing and something new to look forward to. I especially love the design allowing for space for the ear plugs. No longer do I have to search and wonder where they are when it&#x27;s time to sleep. Such a great bonus.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for an international flight from Los Angeles to Australia. They are great! The fabric against your face is soft and comfortable and the flap over the nose helps keep out as much light as possible. Having the ear plugs attached to the side made it so easy to keep everything together and easy to find in my carry on. I am really happy with them and have continued to use them after my trip. Great purchase!</li>
            <li> Best sleep mask I have ever used. Fits snug and firm. I love it.</li>
            <li> Recently moved to 3rd shift so these are a necessity and was very pleased with the price and that 2 masks come in the package.  They do a very good job in blocking out the light and are comfortable, allowing me to still blink without being too tight against my eyes.  As with anything else elastic, it is starting to stretch a small amount but not affecting the ability to use. All in all a great purchase.</li>
            <li> Excellent Sleep mask! When they arrived, I was very happy to get the two of these that were inside a very wonderful pouch to keep them nice and safe and clean. I love how they adjust with a bit of velcro and the awesome earplug holder built into the strap so I don&#x27;t have to go looking for them when I really need them. They block out the light wonderfully and are very comfortable to wear. I actually gave one away to my mom who travels a lot and she really loves hers!</li>
            <li> Sleep mask feels soft. I don&#x27;t usally place anything on my face when sleeping because it gives me anxiety. This is not tight so it doesn&#x27;t bother me really. It has helped me get some sleep since the sun decides to shine in my window at freaking 6:00 am every morning. I let my boyfriend try it and he wants one to says it feels so soft on his skin. I also use it when I have my cooling eye pads on to keep it in place.</li>
            <li> I have a hubby and 3 kids who often do not understand that mommy is a light sleeper. The least amount of light in a dark room and I am awake. Of course my room would be right across from the bathroom which means, nightly I hear slamming doors, and get a flood of light into my room even with the door closed from the bathroom.  With the sleeping mask for the last week I have been able to sleep undisturbed.  I recently had surgery and it allows me to rest fully, something I would not be able to do with this family.  The ear plugs are useful thru the day when you want to block out the bickering of two preteen boys.    Disclosure: I have received this item free or at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Great item. Fits Great. no discomfort. Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> Great product. It is superb quality and comfortable, and most importantly WORKS to keep the light out while sleeping without twisting around your head.I love them and sleep like a baby! IT has ear plugs if needed...simply we&#x27;ll engineered.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the Velcro strap. Gets caught in hair and wrinkles. But, overall the eye mask is soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li> strong chemical smell even after 2 months.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best sleep mask I have ever puchased. It keeps the light out, it&#x27;s super soft and so unbelievable comfortable. I was also surprised that 2 came in the mail instead of one! The only down side was that one of them was damaged, the Velcro had already come off upon taking it out of the package. I use the one and it is perfect! I will only buy this brand from now on as it has become my favorite.</li>
            <li> Well let&#x27;s see how do I start this.  This product is Great!!!!  Very very comfortable and form fitting.  Great quality material.  Have been getting good night sleeps since I got this</li>
            <li> This is a great sleep mask that is comfortable and works well.  We have a few of these and need them because my husband works late shifts and has to sleep during the daytime during most days.  He doesn&#x27;t always get to sleep in the spare room we have because it is used for other reasons, so having a sleep mask handy helps him sleep better and longer.  It also comes with ear plugs and holder so you can also block out any noise.  This would be great for other folks out there working those crazy shifts and pulling all nighters. The velcro keeps it from falling off unlike elastic that can lose its stretch over time.</li>
            <li> Works well, no light comes in</li>
            <li> I got this product for discount for the purpose of review. I was so happy to try this. My husband wakes up very early and his snoring drives me nuts when I am trying to sleep. I got to give this a test out that it worked so good. He didn&#x27;t bother me at all when he got out of bed. These masks are great they are so soft on he side towards the eyes. I love that they have an adjustable strap. That was a big plus. I also loved that this was a two set so his and hers so that we can both not be bothered by each other. I come to bed last and sometimes my light wakes him. He had no issue with being bothered by me. Life might begin to get a lot better for us in sleep wise.</li>
            <li> I have slept much better with them... they are comfortable and keep out all the light, they are very good for the prize. The ear plugs do not work well though, they drop out and do not cancel much noise anyway, I don´t use them.. Good product and service. Thank you</li>
            <li> My wife was telling me how nice her sleep mask was and I thought that I would give one a try. From time to time I will work very early and I sometimes have to sleep before the sun goes down. I picked this one out as it looked a little more masculine then her pink frilly one :) I was not sure initially if the velcro on the strap was going to irritate me while I slept or not. To my surprise I was not able to feel it at all and the ability to adjust for a looser/tighter feel was a nice feature. This model also has a little flap that hugs your nose and gives you a better &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34;, not letting in as much light as some other types. I have yet to use the earplugs but they were a nice little bonus. The carrying case keeps everything tidy and keeps the velcro from grabbing onto stuff in your luggage bags. Overall I am very happy with this small addition to my arsenal of &amp;#34;good nights sleep&amp;#34; weapons.</li>
            <li> When I received this double sleep mask in the mail, I forgot what a great find this was!  Not only do you get 1 mask with ear plugs, but you get 2 masks and 2 sets of ear plugs.  My children quickly stole one for themselves and my son even slept with it that night.  This is super comfortable.  I really like how it has a piece of fabric that covers the bridge of my nose to help keep all the light out of my eyes.  Easily adjustable as well.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of sleep masks because....well, I&#x27;m a mom. So, I lied, I&#x27;m not really a fan of sleep masks, per se, but I am a fan of sleeping, and that sometimes needs to happen during daytime hours- soooo, sleep masks are in! This thing is majorly comfy and stays in place. It secures easily and efficiently without being too tight, and is fully adjustable.It&#x27;s lightweight fabric and neutral in black. I have found I prefer the black to brightly colored &amp;#34;feminine&amp;#34; masks- it&#x27;s not a beauty pageant. It&#x27;s about getting good sleep. This is the real deal. I am a big fan! I would definitely recommend this to others who are looking for a sleep mask for napping, traveling, or pretending not to stare their children down.</li>
            <li> Super soft fabric and blocks out all light. The ear plugs are nice, too and come in handy when I need some extra sleep. I would recommend this especially for anyone who works nights and needs the peace and quiet that these masks provide!</li>
            <li> I love this sleep mask!!! I work night shift and it has been an absolute God send!</li>
            <li> Great little pack - two included.  Very comfortable and secure.  Earplugs included, which I never need but, gladly, don&#x27;t bother me - they are attached right to the headband.  I sleep better, longer and my eyes stay moister -</li>
            <li> Super soft and comfy sleeping masks. i was looking for something with a wide band because I&#x27;ve purchased sleep masks before &amp; if they use very thin elastic that gets stretched out very quickly. I have a LATEX allergy so I have to be careful with elastic bands on my skin becuase I will break out and starting having breathing problems if the elastic band is not covered enough, I have had no issues with this band. The out side is satin and the side that lays against your face is a soft fleece type cotton. The ear plus are nice as well and fits in my ears well and are comfortable. This comes in a very nice satin bag for storage and to my surprise there were actually 2 sleeping masks in the bag!!</li>
            <li> I work 3rd shift and trying to sleep during the day is a struggle! Window blinds and shades just don&#x27;t cut out the light enough and it makes it very difficult to fall asleep, with the sleep mask I am able to block out all the daylight and feel like I am sleeping at night like a normal person. Great product! Wake up feeling refreshed!</li>
            <li> I love how comfortable this sleep mask is the silky feeling prevents any sweat and the plus side the ear plugs are soft enough to where they do not hurt when you switch sides. I recommend this mask.</li>
            <li> The product works well, but the color rubs off onto the pillow case.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you wash it once or twice before using.</li>
            <li> I was so excited that this came with not ONE mask but TWO! Sometimes I move around at night and lose my eye mask, but now I can keep the 2nd one on my night stand and replace as needed! Multitex sent this to me for review, and I&#x27;ve found that they fit comfortably over my eyes and really do a great job of blocking out the light. The ear plugs are a great added bonus! Love!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful value for the price. The earbuds are great. The sleeping masks are even better. Very sturdy and really blocks out any amount of light. They fit comfortably on your face. The straps have Velcro so you can have the perfect fit. The included bag makes storing them anywhere easy and the ear buds go right into little holders on the straps so you won&#x27;t lose them.</li>
            <li> My husband is enjoying it! No complaint of any kind.</li>
            <li> As described. Works great.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Great product.</li>
            <li> Not sure first post went thru-- perfect mask for me and getting two was a blessing.. I have recently gotten bells palsy and my eye doesn&#x27;t shut and waters alot.. This is so much better than the pirate eye patch! And i can hand wash one and use one.... Thank you for your prompt delivery!</li>
            <li> Not a bad mask. It works great, i just didn&#x27;t like how the straps go over my ears. If I put them above my ears, to be more comfortable, they slip off at night. They are nice, just not for me</li>
            <li> I love these! I have gas sleep over about once a week because I am in a business that has a lot of people traveling through my house. And they love them as well. They are very convenient because there are your plugs right there in the head in the eye mask so I never lose them which was always a problem before! And the bottom line is they block out the sun and they block out any kind of light so I highly recommend getting these 💺✈️</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll bleed dye all over your pillow case.</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel. I used the earplugs and the mask on the plane. The only problem is the earplugs are exposed and if you don&#x27;t use them they are likely to get dirty. Very convenient though :)</li>
            <li> I am so excited about these!  Such a good value for 2 pairs of masks plus 2 pair of earplugs.  Best part is there are holders on the strap for the ear plugs so they always remain together when not in use.  Brilliant! Mask is soft and silky. Straps are elastic and have velcro to securely tighten.  Extra fabric for nose so no light can get through. Comes in a nice pouch.</li>
            <li> Evatex sleep mask are great. Good price, made with good material,  and they&#x27;re two. You have an extra for someone special. My mother has terrible headaches,  so I gave her one and she started to get a headache so she put one of these Evatex masks on and the headache  started to reside. I have problems sleeping so I tried it and it was the best sleep I have had in a long while.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this. I can&#x27;t sleep with any lights on, even the alarm clock is too bright for me.  These are perfect for getting a good night sleep.</li>
            <li> My mother has sleeping problems just like I do, and she suggested I try a sleeping mask, because it worked for her. I tried a few of those cheap generic sleep masks you get at like CVS or a similar store, but they didn&#x27;t really do the job, either not fitting my head well, or just being overall an uncomfortable annoyance. I recently bought this, and man, it actually worked! It fits right on my head and it&#x27;s easy to adjust, it&#x27;s soft/comfortable enough to not bother me while I try to sleep, and them little bonus earplugs that coem with it just make it work even better :)</li>
            <li> Love this set! Yes, TWO for one! One to stay on the night stand, and one to take with me on my travels! Very soft, easily adjustable. Very well made, it is not going to fall apart!  Does a great job of blocking out the light and letting me get my rest!</li>
            <li> Mask is soft and silky, the straps are elastic and have velcro to adjust for a tight fit. They come in a set of two with a nice pouch and 2 pair of earplugs. Great value, best part is there are holders on the strap for the ear plugs so they can remain together when not in use. Very comfortable and does block out the light.</li>
            <li> I love this! It does everything it&#x27;s supposed to do - it&#x27;s super comfy and it keeps the light out. This is a well made product that will last. It comes with a nifty little case for storage and a set of earplugs. Really helps when I get a migraine, I am very sensitive to light and sounds and this does the trick. Lets me get some peace and quiet and the migraine goes away much sooner!</li>
            <li> It comes in a slinky little bag of mystery. WHAT COULD IT BE? What?!!! Well, the answer for your houseguest is a soft little eye mask that makes up for all the shortcomings of your guest room. Thin curtains? No problem. Ugly wall paint? Can&#x27;t see it! You walking around in your skivvies? Put on some damn pants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It must do the job because our guest has been in her room sleeping for like four days. Wait. Maybe I should call the cops. brb</li>
            <li> These masks are perfect for taking on the road. I love the bonus earplugs attached right to the strap so they won&#x27;t get lost. The mask is comfortable and has good coverage too. I could barely see out the bottom at all. The set of two is nice so I could give one to my husband. Comes in nice little bag for travel or easy storage.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to help with sleep over our holiday travels, and it was perfect.  There were two sleep masks in the bag, and my five year old daughter immediately swiped one for her own use.  Even though her face is smaller, she says that it still blocks out most of the light.  There is a nice extended cover piece around the nose area, which helps keep light from coming in around the nose.  It was quite comfortable to sleep in and I have no complaints on performance.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t need to use ear plugs for this visit, but I am looking forward to using the earplugs on an upcoming flight.  I love that there is a place to keep the earplugs right on the strap of the mask. They are held quite securely and are still easy to get to.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with these sleeping masks. Aside from the fact that there&#x27;s 2, they&#x27;re designed with a neat flap to block light coming in from under your nose. They are comfortable even while sleeping on the side of your head. Forgot I was wearing it a few times and that&#x27;s when I knew it was a solid purchase.</li>
            <li> Recently my optometrist asked if I slept with my eyes slightly open, since the lower eye and lid were considerably dryer than the rest. I know I close my eyes when I sleep, but I&#x27;m thinking now maybe I don&#x27;t close them completely since after sleeping with the mask on for a few weeks I&#x27;ve had improvement to my chronic dry eye condition. Its amazing! So for me the mask has been beyond wonderful. The quality of my sleep has been improved too ; its much less disruptive -with noise blocked out by the ear plugs and the gentle eye mask blocking out light.  I was surprised to see the package came with 2 sets of masks, but delighted of course! Nice to keep one with me when I travel and then have one as a bedside staple at home. I was able to try out this product for a discounted price and unbiased review.  Its definitely 5 stars - great product at a most excellent value!</li>
            <li> This Mask is amazingly comfortable to sleep in.  I love the fact that for the price you get 2 masks and 2 sets of earplugs are included.  With adjustment of the velcro strap I was able to block out 99% of the light in a well lit room and 100% in the room at night.  I will be using this product nightly and recommending it to my friends and family.  What a great find.</li>
            <li> I received my sleep masks very quickly. Excellent Sleep mask! When they arrived I was very happy to get the two of these that had a soft wonderful pouch to keep them nice and safe and clean. The masks themselves were super soft and silky. I have been having a lot of problems sleeping for some time now. The first night using the mask I was not used to it. I did still wake up a few times that night. The second night was a much better sleep. When I did wake up I went right back to sleep because I didn&#x27;t look around because I had the mask on. The next few nights I slept very well. I needed a few nights to get used to wearing the masks but it has improved my sleep habits dramatically.&lt;br /&gt;The quality is great - I washed my mask and it came out of the dryer still looking brand new. I did not use the ear plugs. My home is quiet and I would need to hear at night just in case of something. I recommend this to anyone who suffers from good sleep.</li>
            <li> VERY nice set, adjustable, comfy. Use it daily. I have a pretty big head and no issue with fit. Recommended.</li>
            <li> We bought these for our trip and found them to be way too  small for us.  I gave them to my nieces.</li>
            <li> I liked these more than I thought I would.i thought the Velcro would bother me because I don&#x27;t like pressure on my head but it didn&#x27;t.the Velcro laid really smooth against my head .  And I didn&#x27;t feel a bump when I laid down which surprised me.I liked the earplugs too because they were soft and conformed to the inside of my ears and I didn&#x27;t feel any pressure from them.and the carrier bag that comes with it is awesome.I lose things a lot so this makes it so much easier to find at bedtime.And even though I was given this produst to review,i like them so much I ain&#x27;t sharing even one of them</li>
            <li> The straps feels a bit uncomfortable, but other than that everything else is nice</li>
            <li> OMG! This sleeping mask is amazing. it helps me sleep in complete darkness with these soft ear plugs and and I cant hear anything with them on. I use them for nap time because the sun is always in my eyes making it difficult for me to sleep during the day. I love my soft sleep mask and these gentle ear plugs.</li>
            <li> These do not shut out all the light you can see light from the bottom. The little piece they say conforms around you nose does nothing to help.</li>
            <li> I received my Evatex Sleep Mask quickly and with no damage during shipping.  I have severe migraines and have been told by my doctor to try a sleep mask to darken out all light and to place ear plugs in for the noise when I have the severe ones. What a blessing I found this promotion that allowed me to try not just the mask but had the ear plugs as a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;When I get a migraine it just takes over, there is nothing  I can do, it just does it&#x27;s thing. I am on meds , and tried all different meds. Now I have to try new ones because I was just diagnosed with stage one kidney disease and can not just take anything anymore. The mask does block out all light and is very light weight. It is soft and does not rub as others I have tried.  I received this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review  and all thoughts reflected in this review are solely my own.</li>
            <li> Until now I was only able to buy thin fabric masks locally which were comfortable, but didn&#x27;t hold up well, and molded ones purchased online which were neither comfortable nor held up well. Evatex solved those problems. These masked are comfy, well made and a good value for the price. Some may find the elastic a bit short, risking hair tangles if extended. I don&#x27;t use the included earplugs, removed them for side-sleeping comfort. I would recommend to all who seek the pleasure of a great night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li> Great value! Low price for two masks that work great at keeping out the light.</li>
            <li> I sent then back within 5 minutes of opening. The strap is tough so it cuts into the top of your ears, it does not block light unless you pull it right enough that the eye padding collapses onto your eyes. I have recieved 6 emails asking me to review this product this week. Leave me alone, your product sucks.</li>
            <li> Comfortable,  easy to adjust. Blocks out all distracting lights and sounds.</li>
            <li> This seem to be a good buy getting two masks plus 2 sets of ear plugs. The mask itself is made well but I think it is too stiff and does not conform well to my face. A small amount of light gets in around the mask bottom by my nose. I will try and wash it to see if it softens up a little. Also it will take some getting used to because of the stiffness. The velcro straps work well.</li>
            <li> I have used sleep masks for many years and can attest to the fact YOU WILL SLEEP more soundly and restfully when you sleep in complete darkness.  Therefore my criteria in a sleep mask is that it provides TOTAL darkness....no light sneaking in under around the nose.  This mask is comfortable and lightweight however, it does let some light in under the nose.  I decided to keep it for those hot summer nights when  a lightweight mask is preferable.  The mask that wins the 5 star rating from me was the Lewis n Clark 505 black mask.  NO LIGHT WHATSOEVER providing Total darkness and comfortable to wear. As for the velcro on both brands, I have long hair and usually braid it at night, therefore, I do not have any trouble with the velcro.</li>
            <li> I got this because I had surgery and had to sleep downstairs with my mom. She must sleep with the tv on. I can&#x27;t. I can&#x27;t fall asleep with it on! This sleeping mask is exactly what I needed! It&#x27;s soft! Doesn&#x27;t dubbinr against the face. Blocks out light! It&#x27;s adjustable! I love it! Very happy</li>
            <li> The worst part about this mask is that my hair gets tangled in the velcro if I pull it out from under the mask. I have to sleep with the band on over my hair, which I find makes the mask slip and slide a bit while I sleep (I toss and turn at night). That&#x27;s my biggest beef wth this mask. Also, I find it a bit difficult to tell which way is up and down; if I wear it the wrong way, it&#x27;s just off center enough to not be comfortable, plus the flap to keep extra light from getting in. So it&#x27;s not ideal for me, still looking for a perfect sleep mask...</li>
            <li> I got these masks because I have a new house that was built seven feet behind my bedroom and my new neighbors have these bright security lights that shine in my room at night. I used these masks and I was able to sleep. I couldn&#x27;t see any light at all. The mask is so comfortable to wear and the ear plugs will come in handy when they sit outside late night and talk.</li>
            <li> The Alvarez Sleep Mask is a perfect sleep mask if you are trying to block out the light and sound. My husband stays up late watching tv and once he falls asleep he snores so loud.&lt;br /&gt;The mask is so soft but blocks out any type of light you may have that is keeping you awake.&lt;br /&gt;The ear plugs fit right into your ears and block out all sound around you.&lt;br /&gt;So glad I read the reviews and purchased this set!!</li>
            <li> Thanks for a speedy delivery. Wow!  Two masks for the price of one. Love it! I have purchased those cheap drug store eye masks and used them when I travel by air. It is so annoying when you are trying to sleep on a long night flight and your neighbors have their reading lights on. The problem with these masks is that they are so uncomfortable. They are very thin and scratchy to my eyes. So I stopped wearing them completely. I decided to try the Evatex Sleep Mask and to my surprise, they were so much better. They are made of soft light weight satin. They are very comfortable to my eyes.  I like the wide elastic Velcro strap because it makes it adjustable to your face. The mask blocks light completely. I also happen to have sleep apnea, so I wear a mask over my mouth and nose. I needed an eye mask that would fit under my cpap and not interfere with my breathing. This eye mask did the trick. I can adjust the Velcro straps to my cpap with no problem. We all know how important getting a good night sleep is and when you have sleep apnea, even more. Thanks for the bonus earplugs that go with the masks and the satin pouch. Love the product.</li>
            <li> LOVE THESE!  I work rotating shifts as a nurse, so when I come off a night shift I need something covering my eyes to help me sleep during the day without having to purchase new window treatments.  They&#x27;re great for travel as well, and they come with ear plugs.  I keep one mask in my travel bag and the other on my night stand.  I was worried that the masks would be uncomfortable and constricting, but they&#x27;re adjustable and feel very light on the face.  The nose piece extends down further, so it blocks out almost ALL light.  The ear plugs are comfy too...even for my small ears (I can never find ear buds or plugs that fit--and stay in--well.</li>
            <li> I received the product for free for an unbiased and honest opinion. These helped keep out light while I&#x27;m trying to sleep. They also helped when I have a headache and trying to keep out the light. It&#x27;s soft and lightweight. Very comfortable. It even has a holder for your ear plugs.  I love it</li>
            <li> Really great, work awesome to make it dark. Have bought others that were too big for both me and my husband and these work. Good price for 2. Only wish they had the gel inserts, but overall great bang for buck.</li>
            <li> The masks (2) are very comfortable and when adjusted properly completely blot out any light from getting to my eyes. The price for 2 was about the same price others charged for 1,so it is getting 2 for the price of one. I would advise anybody needing blinders to buy these.</li>
            <li> Great product, thanks!</li>
            <li> Great price.  Works great.</li>
            <li> This sleep mask is good, not great. It is very soft and fits comfortably but is too small for me. It doesn&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;blackout effect&amp;#34;. It is a terrific bargain for the price-2masks plus earplugs!</li>
            <li> Mask worked great but the ear plugs didn&#x27;t work at all. Wouldn&#x27;t go in the ears and did not block sounds at all.</li>
