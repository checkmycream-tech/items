            <li>and we both love the fragrance because it leaves him smelling fresh without being overbearing and offensive like some colognes that are out there.</li>

            <li>save mooney and it comes right to your door.</li>
            <li>but I spray it on in the shower right before I get  out</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this on my husband, my hands down favorite smell in a cologne.</li>
            <li>A bit too strong for me when applied directly</li>
            <li>So nice when used that way I actually enjoy smelling my arm a few times a day.</li>
            <li>I never find these in local stores and I am glad that I can always find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>My husband wore this years ago when we first met.  </li>
            <li>Will more than likely order another, as he is away 5 days a week, so that there will be one in both locations.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fragrance is fresh and subtle, more on the sweet side, but it doesn&#x27;t last for more than a couple of minutes!</li>
            <li>It is not overwhelming and has a very pleasant smell but doesn&#x27;t last through the day.</li>
            <li>The price on amazon is half compared to the retail store if you buy 25.00 worth of qualified merchandise,which i always do, and dont forget the free super saver shipping.</li>
            <li>My husband gets more compliments when he wears this than any other fragrance he owns...including some very pricey ones!</li>
            <li>cotys white musk the guy version, crisp clean smelling.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a real value.</li>
            <li>I am excited to get it back!</li>
            <li>Smells nice, but does not last long.</li>
            <li>Clean, sophisticated, subtle.</li>
            <li>I buy this for a friend as a gift frequently as it  seems to not be available any longer in the community, only online.</li>
            <li>The women&#x27;s White Musk is a lovely basic musk and lasts for hours.</li>
            <li>Its not original for sure.</li>
            <li>So decided to get a new one ....     </li>
            <li>This is the first time I have tried the White Musk.  </li>
            <li>I priced this exact product in exactly the same size at my local CVS store and the price tag was $30.00.</li>
            <li>Thought the scent might be different after all these years but was exactly as I remembered.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells good but it seems watered down and doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>I also purchase the black musk which I feel is more oriented for evenings, romantic occasions.</li>
            <li>He likes it a lot and tells me it is much better than the Jovan Musk (regular) or even the black musk.</li>
            <li>Just make certain not to confuse it with the regular, that is not the \\&quot;white\\&quot;, Jovan Musk for men.</li>
            <li>It &#x27;complete me&#x27;.</li>
            <li>It disappears completely.</li>
            <li>It is sexy and subtle.</li>
            <li>fragrance is a little different from typical male perfume sprays and is more of a sweet fragrance which I like.</li>
            <li>Slightly sweet and subtle spice.</li>

            <li> It has this sweet and subtle smell, not very strong.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband after finding a small amount of an old bottle my son left at my home after he moved out</li>

            <li> Nothing more annoying than over powering scents.</li>
            <li> similar smell which lasts longer please suggest me even if that is expensive that this product.</li>
            <li> Small doesn&#x27;t stay longer</li>
            <li> He usually uses wherever he goes.</li>
            <li> Getting hard to find though.</li>
            <li> This is hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> Not a good fragrance at all for men.</li>
            <li> I worse this</li>
            <li> I use this for casual wear.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I received a bottle from a bad batch, or what, but this cologne literally lasts 10 seconds.</li>
            <li> Either there has been a reformulation, or I got a dud from a bad batch....</li>

            <li> Nothing special. Will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> citrusy aroma, it&#x27;s wonderful, very pleasant and not over powering</li>
            <li> cotys white musk the guy version, crisp clean smelling.The scent lasts all day. The price on amazon is half compared to the retail store if you buy 25.00 worth of qualified merchandise,which i always do, and dont forget the free super saver shipping. The musk works for me .Its not the only scent i use but its one i like and will use day or nite.My wifes friends make comments to her on how great my scent is . :)Even one of my bank tellers complimented me on how great my deposits smelled! I swear its true.</li>
            <li> Not a good fragrance at all for men. Expected more pleasant musk smell but it was not and did not last long their fragrance.</li>
            <li> Had been using this product for a while ...   So decided to get a new one ....     Still going good !!!</li>
            <li> What happened to this product? They took it off the shelves! I have more compliments on this cologne than any EXPENSIVE cologne I have ever had....so if you read this PLEASE keep making it and PLEASE don&#x27;t raise the price :)    Man I freakin love it and have never had so many compliments as I have on this cologne. I am excited to get it back! It is light and stays through the day. It is sexy and subtle. Very clean and refreshing. Slightly sweet and subtle spice. It&#x27;s just enough!    Thanks</li>
            <li> The cologne has a nice clean smell that last awhile, and since i got it from amazon i got it for a good price.</li>
            <li> My favorite.  Clean, sophisticated, subtle. Just make certain not to confuse it with the regular, that is not the \\&quot;white\\&quot;, Jovan Musk for men.</li>
            <li> Use this if you like your cologne a bit strong in musky/woody fragrance</li>
            <li> I like Jovan products. I have always used their colognes. Their colognes have a distinctive scent that is awesome. If you don&#x27;t want women stopping you to ask what you are wearing for cologne, don&#x27;t buy Jovan White Musk. I will not be responsible for anyone who is unable to fend off the women from using this product. Seriously, this cologne is AWESOME!!!!!</li>
            <li> Its not original for sure. Just counter fit or water added in perfume.</li>
            <li> I have used it for years, recently learned what a great savings it was to buy 4 through you.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last a minute,.</li>
            <li> Great product, Fast Shipping  Thank - You !!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  I use it for daily wear.  Over my Creed cologne</li>
            <li> Probably not the best smelling cologne in the world but for the price it works great.</li>
            <li> I have all of these strange women chasing me now, it has to be the JOVAN. Women just love the smell and they want to hit the sheets.</li>
            <li> I worse this and I wondered why this is a cologne. It smells like moss or some mold or something I want to wash it off.</li>
            <li> I never find these in local stores and I am glad that I can always find it on Amazon. I love the fragrance. It is not overwhelming and has a very pleasant smell but doesn&#x27;t last through the day. But you can still sniff it off your clothes/skin at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is a little different from typical male perfume sprays and is more of a sweet fragrance which I like. The 3 ounce bottle should last me easily for many months. This is my all time favorite and one can never go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> This is a fine floral cologne. Colognes are floral or spice.  This floral is light. Smells very good without that too much lingering smell.JOVAN WHITE.  If YOU LIKE JOVAN MUSK I think you will enjoy having this very cool cologne to use on occassion. Its always good to have good choices of cologne. Jovan is very good.  I bought this Jovan WHITE cologne thru AMAZON to save money and save a trip to the store to buy this cologne I had already become a fan of.  You can&#x27;t lose.  You don&#x27;t have to go anywhere......save mooney and it comes right to your door. Cool.</li>
            <li> I have been using tis for years. I have had people stop and ask what the brand of my cologne is and start using it too.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite colognes now I&#x27;ll be buying more</li>
            <li> I wear this daily for a little scentification. It has a pleasant smell that is semi-floral but not too strong. I also purchase the black musk which I feel is more oriented for evenings, romantic occasions.</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of Jovan Musk.  This is the first time I have tried the White Musk.  Very nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> Love it :-D.  Super Fast Delivery!</li>
            <li> A bit too strong for me when applied directly but I spray it on in the shower right before I get  out and then wash it off quickly,  leaving me smelling really fresh and clean.  So nice when used that way I actually enjoy smelling my arm a few times a day.</li>
            <li> I have been using Jovan scents for many years. It has become my favored stand by. Always get compliments from the Ladies. White Musk gets noticed without being over powering. Nothing more annoying than over powering scents. This one is a keeper! I priced this exact product in exactly the same size at my local CVS store and the price tag was $30.00. I don&#x27;t know how many they sell but the price here on Amazon is much more reasonable. I think the $30.00 price does speak for the popularity and perception of the product. This is the good stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this musk fragrance I have only one concern about his is that, it wont last long but for this price I expect what I got is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if anyone know similar smell which lasts longer please suggest me even if that is expensive that this product.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, but does not last long. Wears off (for me) in about an hour.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this on my husband, my hands down favorite smell in a cologne. Not overpowering, long lasting, delicious!</li>
            <li> My husband smells sooooo good.</li>
            <li> My husband gets more compliments when he wears this than any other fragrance he owns...including some very pricey ones! Getting hard to find though.</li>
            <li> Fast ship recommend good price</li>
            <li> It is Jovan Musk..If you like the smell .. nothing bad .Normal light perfume without steering any attraction to you.</li>
            <li> My husband wore this years ago when we first met.  I have not been able to find it anywhere.  I was very pleased when it arrived.  Thought the scent might be different after all these years but was exactly as I remembered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordered this product on a Saturday, order shipped on Monday and it arrived in my mailbox on Wednesday.  Will more than likely order another, as he is away 5 days a week, so that there will be one in both locations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> Stick with regular musk for a man.</li>
            <li> A sweet scent very good and low cost. Also last for days one spayed on any fabric.</li>
            <li> Good delivery time, great smell.</li>
            <li> Great transaction,Great product</li>
            <li> It smells good but it seems watered down and doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband after finding a small amount of an old bottle my son left at my home after he moved out and when my husband put it on I loved the fragrance and he did too..so I ordered a bottle and we both love the fragrance because it leaves him smelling fresh without being overbearing and offensive like some colognes that are out there. Really great fragrance and you can&#x27;t beat the price!!</li>
            <li> I use this for casual wear. It&#x27;s very good for its price. It has this sweet and subtle smell, not very strong. Although it can lasts long (4+ hours, I&#x27;d say) it stays fairly close to the skin, so it doesn&#x27;t come off as very noticeable. I wear it like once every 2 or 3 days, and I&#x27;m guessing my 3oz bottle is gonna last for me several months. Spray doesn&#x27;t have very good projection. Overall, thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I love this smell and brand as a cheaper cologne than Canoe who is an old favorite. It &#x27;complete me&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I use to use the Jovan musk, but after trying to white musk I switched to it because it&#x27;s got a lighter sweeter scent.</li>
            <li> Husband&#x27;s favorite even with all the new products out there.</li>
            <li> I buy this for a friend as a gift frequently as it  seems to not be available any longer in the community, only online.</li>
            <li> Small doesn&#x27;t stay longer</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I received a bottle from a bad batch, or what, but this cologne literally lasts 10 seconds. The women&#x27;s White Musk is a lovely basic musk and lasts for hours. It&#x27;s a real value. But this starts with a chemical blast of I know what not, and then, poof! It disappears completely. Either there has been a reformulation, or I got a dud from a bad batch....</li>
            <li> Bought this for my Uncle. He likes it a lot and tells me it is much better than the Jovan Musk (regular) or even the black musk.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is fresh and subtle, more on the sweet side, but it doesn&#x27;t last for more than a couple of minutes! Or perhaps I received mine from a degraded batch or something.</li>
            <li> The price was right and the scent  is a light and clean smelling. This is hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> My son liked the scent of this jovan musk. He usually uses wherever he goes.</li>
            <li> by far my favorite scent. it arrived fast in original box. love it</li>
