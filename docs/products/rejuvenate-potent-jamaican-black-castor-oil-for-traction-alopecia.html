            <li>Am still on the process but so far so good</li>

            <li>Maybe the next person will have better results then I did!</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t worth returning, but I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li>either because we all don&#x27;t have the same scalp; however, the honest truth is that it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>I actually make my own similiar stuff</li>
            <li>First time using this product, the smell is not bad.</li>
            <li>It has a good scent unlike other castor oils.</li>
            <li>I can tell that my hair is starting to feel and look much thicker and filling in nicely.</li>

            <li>Sometimes you have to just do your own due diligence and be patient.</li>
            <li>The smell of this product is alot easier to handle than the pure Castor oil.</li>
            <li>Recommend product as a great moisturizer on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t need much at all just 4-6 drops in your hand and rub it in the problem areas of your head.</li>

            <li>It leaves my hair very soft!</li>
            <li>Been using rejuvenate potent Jamaica castor oil now for a few weeks</li>
            <li>so I will continue for a few more weeks.</li>
            <li>I am hoping I did not mess up my scalp so that my hair can go back to a natural clean bumpless, soreless scalp.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Potent Jamaican Black Castor Oil last month and it seems to be working very well.  </li>
            <li>all these years I&#x27;ve finally found something that really works!</li>
            <li>He used it everyday  and sure enough his hair growth was so fast.</li>
            <li>Too early for me to provide any conclusive feedback.</li>
            <li>I like the product so far</li>
            <li>so far it&#x27;s working a miracle</li>
            <li>I lovethis produce it makes my hair so soft and shine.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li>It also makes my hair soft and gives it a shine..</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t experience at least peach fuzz, I am discontinuing use and trying one of the other JBCO products with good reviews.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using an other oil and it looks promising.</li>
            <li>I honestly wanted this to work and really didn&#x27;t want to give it a bad review</li>
            <li>I doubt very seriously that it will prevent the hair loss from alopecia, but I love how it makes my hair and scalp feels.</li>
            <li>Hair for the first time in my life since I was a little girl.</li>
            <li>I am now growing out my loose natural hair again .</li>
            <li>I love this product because recently I suffered from Traction Alopecia around my edges, due to tight ponytails and weaving and tight braiding.  </li>

            <li> I have used Potent  Jamaican Black Castor Oil for approximately 2 1/2 months.  </li>
            <li> I figured it was traction alopecia due to wearing tight cornrows straight for about 6-8 months.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;ll take a long time before hair is restored around my edges.</li>
            <li> Has not work very well for me and is too thick...</li>
            <li> brought back my hair in a half dollar sized bald spot I received from stress related alopecia.</li>

            <li> I have been using this for only a few weeks, no major results at this time . Too early for me to provide any conclusive feedback.Check back in a month or so.</li>
            <li> First time using this product, the smell is not bad.</li>
            <li> The smell of this product is alot easier to handle than the pure Castor oil. I use the produce everyday, it&#x27;s been about 1 month now, my temples have started to filled in. I also used the oil for my hairline at the nape of my neck too.</li>
            <li> Awesome product...I&#x27;m already seeing results and yet I haven&#x27;t been consistent with applying this product as directed.</li>
            <li> my mother love this stuff for her hair</li>
            <li> Ordered for my sister and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Potent Jamaican Black Castor Oil last month and it seems to be working very well.  My hair is definitely thicker and I am seeing some of my bald spots go away.  I am going to continue using the product to see how quickly my hair continues to grow.</li>
            <li> I like the product so far</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair very soft! I love it.</li>
            <li> I see some growth but it hasn&#x27;t been a month yet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing weaves for quite some time. My hair is pretty healthy, except for my edges, which are thinning. Due to perming. I started using jbco about 2x per day, one week ago, no improvement yet. I&#x27;ll give it about 5 more weeks.</li>
            <li> I got this product about three weeks ago and I am about to order my second bottle...No I haven&#x27;t used all of the first one yet but the results are amazing. I can tell that my hair is starting to feel and look much thicker and filling in nicely. My beautician recommended this product and all I can say is &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love this product because recently I suffered from Traction Alopecia around my edges, due to tight ponytails and weaving and tight braiding.  I have been using this product over 1 month now and it works. My edges is starting to show peach fuss. The smell is like a strong onion smell, so I prefer to use it over night,  I mix this with Emu oil, olive oil, tea tree oil and I put this on my hair, every other night. you don&#x27;t need much at all just 4-6 drops in your hand and rub it in the problem areas of your head. My problem area&#x27;s is my hair line, front and back.  I&#x27;ve noticed hair growth with in 1 month, But you also have to keep up with you daily, weekly ,monthly hair regimen. Try it what do you have to lose  Thank you, Iyauna</li>
            <li> We reorder product.  Been using rejuvenate potent Jamaica castor oil now for a few weeks and I see good results</li>
            <li> so far it&#x27;s working a miracle and I&#x27;m only just past my first month of using it.  If things continue to progress as is Hopefully it trully will be something to celebrate for my birthday next year.  Sometimes you have to just do your own due diligence and be patient.Which I am as required. Things didn&#x27;t happen over night.</li>
            <li> This stuff here is off the chain.  I had been having problems with my hair thinning in the crown and I started using this and all I can say is the thinning is gone.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!!  Did absolutely NOTHING for my sides!  Maybe the next person will have better results then I did!</li>
            <li> This stuff did not work for me. Only gave a bad smell in my hair but I kept it and just mixed with others oils until it was gone. Wasn&#x27;t worth returning, but I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd bottle and I&#x27;ve already seen results.  Works great.  Will continue to use until completion of process</li>
            <li> I used this for oiling my feet. I have diabetes and this helps will with my feet. like it for that purpose, have not seen anything happen for my hair, that is why I bought it really.</li>
            <li> I lovethis produce it makes my hair so soft and shine. I would recommend this to all my friends that are transitioning and have weak edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicki10mil</li>
            <li> I have not seen any results yet! I have started on a second bottle! I am praying that my hair will grow back!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I doubt very seriously that it will prevent the hair loss from alopecia, but I love how it makes my hair and scalp feels.</li>
            <li> brought back my hair in a half dollar sized bald spot I received from stress related alopecia.</li>
            <li> I have seen no result yet. I only had it for a month now it why I have not seen no result. But in all I love it.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works it&#x27;s a true product kno lyes it does wat it saids.my nephew suffers from alopecia an his hair is growing back he also used it on his eyebrows an arms too.Im a female an I use it too this stuff is Awesome an the PRICE IS UNBELEIVEABLE</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me. I used it and it made my hair come out more. I don&#x27;t know If I had an allergic reaction to it or not. Every time I used it, it made my scalp itch really bad. If you have sensitive skin, don&#x27;t buy this product. I am not knocking the product! It might work for you!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month and a half and have seen no results! The instructions say to apply and massage regularly with one massage lasting for at least 10 mins. Well I&#x27;ve done that and nothing! I bought this product due to braids ripping my edges out. It says to use for 2 Months to fully see results so I will continue for a few more weeks. If I don&#x27;t experience at least peach fuzz, I am discontinuing use and trying one of the other JBCO products with good reviews.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil for about a month now and i already see results. I have a few thin spots in my hair for reasons various reasons. Braids that were to tight around my edges a bad quick weave and i sleep on my left side. I apply this to my thin areas every night, i&#x27;ve only added  to my deep conditioner once. the hair was fine and slicked to the scalp but now i can pull it, it is still thin but the hair has grown longer. I also gave my grandmother a bottle and she has already felt a difference in the tightness of her scalp. I know that it says that it could take 30-90 days so i&#x27;m going to continue to use it, i will also be back to update. This is a great product and i highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I honestly wanted this to work and really didn&#x27;t want to give it a bad review either because we all don&#x27;t have the same scalp; however, the honest truth is that it didn&#x27;t work for me. I started it Sept.21 and it is today Nov. 12 and nothing has changed. I followed the instructions to a \\&quot;T\\&quot;. I was using it on my edges and nothing happened. I contacted the buyer who is also the seller and she stated to give it time also if you have chemical damage this will not help. I want you to know that I do not have chemical damage but trichotillomania which isn&#x27;t a chemical burn. I know hair can grow there because I have little spuds even before the oil. I&#x27;ve tried this oil on other parts of my scalp and it still doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve been using an other oil and it looks promising. I know it&#x27;ll take a long time before hair is restored around my edges. Unfortunately, this product only works on scalp with hair already. It needs to start off with a healthy scalp. FYI It&#x27;s important that you remove the gunk and buildup on your scalp for any product to take place and help grow. I&#x27;ve done that and this product still didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I STOPED USING THIS PRODUCT NO PROBLEM TOWARDS THE PRODUCTS. wHY I STOPPED USING IT DUE TO I WAS PUT ON AN ANTIBIOTICS FROM MY DOCTOR. I WILL START USING THIS PRODUCTS AGAIN SOON. tHANKS</li>
            <li> it caused a terrible allergic reaction</li>
            <li> Because I take blood pressure medicine, I can not use treatments that contain medication.  I have been trying find something that would grow my edges for many years.  I have used Potent  Jamaican Black Castor Oil for approximately 2 1/2 months.  For the first time in years, I can see hair sprouting on my edges. I love what I see.  My edges were smooth bald.  Now, I see hair coming.</li>
            <li> I had cornrows for about 2 years and decided to cut my hair but realized my hairline on one half was pushed back and my edges was thin(more thin on one side). I figured it was traction alopecia due to wearing tight cornrows straight for about 6-8 months. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month and a half and noticed that the hair grew but never thickened. Also, whatever hair grew ended up falling out. Now it seems like no hair is growing. I know it says use for 60 days to see results but its been almost 30 days and i haven&#x27;t seen anything. I&#x27;ve lost faith. Gonna try the regular JBCO and see what that does for me.</li>
            <li> This product does just what it suppose 2, I will recommend this to my friends. My results is amazing. ðŸ˜‚</li>
            <li> This stuff Will now be apart of my staple products.&lt;br /&gt;Yessssssss it really works! I&#x27;ve had Alopecia in my edges all my life due to childhood impentago.&lt;br /&gt;I could not believe my eyes! Hair for the first time in my life since I was a little girl. I grew up with out sideburn edges.&lt;br /&gt;Always wearing styles to camouflage my hair lost. Never enjoying ponytails pulled back!  And I had balding at my nape from wearing heavy dred locks for seven years. I am now growing out my loose natural hair again . It has a good scent unlike other castor oils. I love it.  It also makes my hair soft and gives it a shine.. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month and I plan to use this for the full ninety days!  My nape is growing down my neck, And I now have the beginning of sideburns starting to sprout...! I am so pleased and happy!....all these years I&#x27;ve finally found something that really works!</li>
            <li> Has not work very well for me and is too thick... I will not purchase again, thank you so much.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great my husband had a bald spot on his head for two months  i bought this product hoping it would work . He used it everyday  and sure enough his hair growth was so fast. He still uses it as a daily moisturizer.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much results.  Found a less expense jamaican black castor oil option which offers the same results</li>
            <li> Good product to use,  Been using it for a month now I see new growth... works very well. will be ordering again soon:)</li>
            <li> I love this oil! I have noticed a big difference in how my hairline looks now. It was thinning, now it&#x27;s trying to grow back in...slowly but surely.  I use this in combination with the potent black castor oil. I think this one works better because it&#x27;s designed for what I am experiencing...traction alopecia.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work it smell terrible</li>
            <li> Am still on the process but so far so good</li>
            <li> I used this every night and I am not sure that it did anything. It seems like it would and has great ingredients. I actually make my own similiar stuff and I think what I was using was already working great so thats why I didnt see any difference</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for everyone.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed. Try it, you may like it. Tell them i sent you ! Ms.Alita Copney</li>
            <li> I was told that this product was good for hair growth and thickness for thinning hair from having traction and alopecia from wearing weaves.  I used this product and within a week, my scalp starting to itch really bad, then when i took my weave out to wash away the product that was lingering on my scalp, i noticed that i have broke out with big sores and bumps on my scalp.. scabs all over my scalp from scratching.  The product smells very strong as if they put gasoline in it.  This was not the experience I thought I would have with this product.  This product has required that I take my weave out to let my scalp breathe for a good 2 months.  I am hoping I did not mess up my scalp so that my hair can go back to a natural clean bumpless, soreless scalp. Its giving me headaches by the sores on my head and in result to that I am now required to see a dermatologist and have ordered Nioxin treatment for itchy scalp.  I would not recommend this to anyone at all.  This product needs to be removed off this site!  [[ASIN:B008VHPM6Q Rejuvenate Potent Jamaican Black Castor Oil for Traction Alopecia]]</li>
            <li> The reviews were great, but I MUST COLOR my hair.(It is not recommended?  Returned</li>
            <li> So far this product is working well for damaged scalp and hair, Use as hot oil treatment and keeping the hair hydrated</li>
            <li> Did not work as well as I had hoped. Great smell. Using a leave in cream conditioner worked better for me. Recommend product as a great moisturizer on wet or dry hair.</li>
