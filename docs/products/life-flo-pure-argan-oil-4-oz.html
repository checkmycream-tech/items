            <li>AND THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE OILS.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love argan oil for my face and hair.  </li>
            <li>However have tried this brand before, results are satisfying.</li>
            <li>I love argan oil for moisturizing my hair.</li>

            <li>Outstanding product.</li>
            <li>Makes our hair look fabulous!</li>
            <li>this smell more pungeant.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell the best but as long as you aren&#x27;t slathering it on, it will go away.</li>
            <li>I find it to be the cheapest argan oil out there, yet the most pure and good quality one.</li>
            <li>The liquid, texture and smell, also seems original Argan (I think!).</li>
            <li>It feels so nice on my skin and hair and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>The consistency is really light, goes in smoothly and does the job, any job!&lt;br /&gt;I use about a m &amp; m size , rub it in my hands to warm it</li>
            <li>I ordered Life-flo Pure Argan Oil because I have been seeing how good argan oil is for you hair and skin.  </li>
            <li>great clear clean product!</li>
            <li>Best usage for me on wet hair.</li>
            <li>A couple of drops is also great when my hair is wild from the wash the night before.</li>
            <li>I have no issues with pure argan oil, but this product, is too good to be true for the price.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t find a 4-ounce bottle of pure argan oil for this price anywhere else!!!</li>
            <li>and it smelled fine</li>
            <li>I found Life-flo pure argan oil on Amazon and was happy to find the product in pure form and it is affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The smell is light and not over powering like virgin argon.</li>
            <li>so it shipped for free.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a great saving.  </li>
            <li>My wife and daughter really enjoy the Argan Oil.  </li>
            <li>One of the better priced options and works just as well as the higher priced versions.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with my purchase of Life-flo Pure Argan Oil.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true, this product does have a goat or cheese smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m grateful to Amazon for giving me a full refund though I purchased the bottle over a month ago.</li>
            <li>That seems counter-intuitive but it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>Easy, inexpensive, natural, healthy - won&#x27;t ever be without it again.</li>
            <li>I use this oil as moisturizer, frizz control, cuticle oil and even to soothe mild rashes.</li>
            <li>Thought I would try this one because of the price, and love it, will be back for more.</li>
            <li>order arrived quickly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought smaller bottles for much more!</li>
            <li>When I use it in my hair the smell seems to dissipate quickly, but when I use it on my skin I have to put on another lotion right away to make the smell go away.  </li>
            <li>The oil is light, much lighter than the emu oil</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been using Eden Allure with much success and decided to try Life-Flo based on cost and quantity.</li>
            <li>I love what it does for my hair, its soft shiny, and my scalp retains moisture</li>
            <li>I found this at my natural food store, but found this price on Amazon to be better.</li>
            <li>It does have a funny smell (as mentioned by many other reviewers), but it goes away very quick!  </li>
            <li>: If you can get past the scent or mask it, you will be very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li>I also apply a few drops on the ends of my hair and can honestly say it HAS MADE A DIFFERENCE!</li>
            <li>Then I took and nice, long whiff of my palms</li>
            <li>Unless you are using a lot of this oil, it is absorbed into the hair without being oily, and leaves your hair smooth, soft, and shiny.  </li>
            <li>It is a pure Argan with just a touch of Vitamin E to keep the oil fresh.</li>
            <li>This purchase is a great deal, and is the same pure, top quality item I have bought in the past on QVC.  </li>
            <li>First the bottle I received did not come in a box.</li>
            <li>This product was exactly as described and way cheaper than the options in the cosmetic stores.</li>
            <li>My first purchase of Argan Oil was an impulse buy of .5 oz of it for $14- in the check-out line of Sephora.</li>
            <li>Near Order less, Makes my skin feel great .</li>
            <li>After using other products, I apply it last to have that nice healthy sheen.  </li>
            <li>It makes hair grow long, strong and soft and keeps it frizz free.</li>
            <li>The smell was rather odd but the consistency was nice.</li>
            <li>So, I decided to try PURE argan oil.</li>
            <li>The Life-flo Argan oil is 95% pure Argan oil with 5% vitamin E.</li>
            <li>The oil absorb quickly and my 70 year old skin (face &amp; very wrinkled arms) is much softer -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little heavy for daytime use, but perfect for night time.</li>
            <li>i haven&#x27;t used it much, but hope that it lives up to the claims of smoothing the frizz in the hair and adding moisture to the face without residue.</li>
            <li>You will have to experiment to find the amount that works for you as too much WILL leave your hair greasy.</li>
            <li>It leaves my legs on fire, and itchy, whereas REAL argan oil does not.</li>
            <li>They really need to look into the quality control in the products they sell and how they store them.</li>
            <li>Really for this price though I&#x27;m not going to complain.</li>
            <li>when I run low again I will re-order the Life-flo Argan oil, it&#x27;s a fantastic value.</li>
            <li>have very course and unruly hair.  </li>
            <li>The real deal.</li>
            <li>I just wish a larger bottle was available.</li>
            <li>both of our symptoms have decreased a great deal.</li>
            <li>smells different if your used to toast argan oil which smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>This one was much stronger.</li>
            <li>If you use small amounts to rub into your skin it goes on lightly, absorbs quickly and leaves your skin soft, hydrated and lightly sheened without any greasy residue.</li>
            <li>One brand is okay, but it is not pure as it has many chemicals in it, and is not absorbed into the hair as readily.  </li>
            <li>Other argan oils I have tried have smelled much better.</li>
            <li>The good thing is that the smell usually disappears completely within 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only moisturizer I&#x27;ve been able to use that doesn&#x27;t cause irritation, and actually seems to lessen my rosacea symptoms.</li>
            <li>I have somewhat oily hair, so I always wash it in the morning, but it makes my hair very soft and shiny!  </li>
            <li>I use it right out of the shower when my skin is still wet, and let it be absorbed.</li>
            <li>The aroma of this product to me is not appealing but fortunately the smell dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend you give it a try both for skin and hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended if your skin suits the oil.</li>
            <li>size bottle will last me for 4 to 5 months, unless I discover more uses for it in the near future.</li>
            <li>And should be stored in a cool, dry place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very upset that in the summary and description of this product it says 100% Pure, on the bottle its only 95% plus it contains Vitamin E (Tocopherol) which is gluten.  </li>
            <li>The odor is not unpleasant and it is just right for me, not too heavy.</li>
            <li>Some of the reviews complain about the small amount of vitamin E, but the E is also just as healthy as the Argan oil for your hair and skin.  </li>
            <li>It actually smells better than the other one I was using for years.</li>
            <li>and the text was almost exactly the same.  </li>
            <li>I guess I would not have bought a second one if the first did not meet expectations.  </li>
            <li>Argan oil is a light weight, natural product infused with nutrients that offers shine and control with out weighing hair down if used sparingly.  </li>
            <li>Same smell (not that it has a strong smell), same color, same consistency.</li>
            <li>After only two weeks of using Life-flo Pure Argan Oil it was gone.</li>
            <li>And wow, what a difference.</li>
            <li>The condition of my hair has changed completely.</li>
            <li>My hair is extremely soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>The key is not putting too much on.</li>
            <li>It appears that is the oil&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li>But the bottle I received smells like old cheese.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Used on your skin, it keeps your skin hydrated and soft.  </li>
            <li>AS WE AGE, WE LOSE NATURAL OILS IN OUR SKIN AND HAIR.</li>
            <li>(obviously it doesn&#x27;t bother others as much).</li>
            <li>I purchased the one ounce before and was so surprised by the price of this brand.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to try it that I immediately opened it and slathered a few drops all over my hands.</li>
            <li>Definitely a niceproduct if you are willing to work around the initial smell.</li>
            <li>Just remember, when using PURE argan oil on you hair, alittle goes a long way.</li>
            <li>IT IS USED FOR MANY USES:  DRY HAIR, DRY SKIN, DRY NAILS</li>
            <li>filled up the small bottle w/ dropper w/ the Life-flo oil for ease of use!&lt;br /&gt;I should be set with Argan oil for a while, but</li>
            <li>This oil is a bit heavy but soaks into your skin quickly and does not leave an oily residue.</li>
            <li>This brand smells rancid, no other way to put it, and it makes my hair sticky, like when you get food in your hair and try to brush it, there is a gob of something</li>
            <li>If you buy some of the other brands that contain chemicals, you will see that this oil is light compared to those that are not pure Argan oil.</li>
            <li>This Argan Oil works really great, but the smell is atrocious.  </li>
            <li>But it should definitely not smell like old cheese.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how could I live without argan oil for so long!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased other brands of Argan oil and they have smelled lovely, but this one smells a little strange.  </li>
            <li>I should also note that after receiving this oil I did have the chance to check out other relatively pure Argan oils (such as Acure&#x27;s Argan Oil) and they also smelled like goat.</li>
            <li>I first started researching this product, I saw a few reviewers noted it smelled like A) Goat B)</li>
            <li>As my small expensive bottle of Argan Oil started to run low, I began searching for a more economical brand.</li>

            <li> A couple of drops is also great when my hair is wild from the wash the night before.</li>
            <li> I have no issues with pure argan oil, but this product, is too good to be true for the price.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t find a 4-ounce bottle of pure argan oil for this price anywhere else!!!</li>
            <li> and it smelled fine</li>
            <li> I found Life-flo pure argan oil on Amazon and was happy to find the product in pure form and it is affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The smell is light and not over powering like virgin argon.</li>
            <li> so it shipped for free.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a great saving.  </li>
            <li> My wife and daughter really enjoy the Argan Oil.  </li>
            <li> One of the better priced options and works just as well as the higher priced versions.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my purchase of Life-flo Pure Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true, this product does have a goat or cheese smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m grateful to Amazon for giving me a full refund though I purchased the bottle over a month ago.</li>
            <li> That seems counter-intuitive but it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> Easy, inexpensive, natural, healthy - won&#x27;t ever be without it again.</li>
            <li> I use this oil as moisturizer, frizz control, cuticle oil and even to soothe mild rashes.</li>
            <li> Thought I would try this one because of the price, and love it, will be back for more.</li>
            <li> order arrived quickly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought smaller bottles for much more!</li>
            <li> When I use it in my hair the smell seems to dissipate quickly, but when I use it on my skin I have to put on another lotion right away to make the smell go away.  </li>
            <li> The oil is light, much lighter than the emu oil</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using Eden Allure with much success and decided to try Life-Flo based on cost and quantity.</li>
            <li> I love what it does for my hair, its soft shiny, and my scalp retains moisture</li>
            <li> I found this at my natural food store, but found this price on Amazon to be better.</li>
            <li> It does have a funny smell (as mentioned by many other reviewers), but it goes away very quick!  </li>
            <li> : If you can get past the scent or mask it, you will be very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> I also apply a few drops on the ends of my hair and can honestly say it HAS MADE A DIFFERENCE!</li>
            <li> Then I took and nice, long whiff of my palms</li>
            <li> Unless you are using a lot of this oil, it is absorbed into the hair without being oily, and leaves your hair smooth, soft, and shiny.  </li>
            <li> It is a pure Argan with just a touch of Vitamin E to keep the oil fresh.</li>
            <li> This purchase is a great deal, and is the same pure, top quality item I have bought in the past on QVC.  </li>
            <li> First the bottle I received did not come in a box.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly as described and way cheaper than the options in the cosmetic stores.</li>
            <li> My first purchase of Argan Oil was an impulse buy of .5 oz of it for $14- in the check-out line of Sephora.</li>
            <li> Near Order less, Makes my skin feel great .</li>
            <li> After using other products, I apply it last to have that nice healthy sheen.  </li>
            <li> It makes hair grow long, strong and soft and keeps it frizz free.</li>
            <li> The smell was rather odd but the consistency was nice.</li>
            <li> So, I decided to try PURE argan oil.</li>
            <li> The Life-flo Argan oil is 95% pure Argan oil with 5% vitamin E.</li>
            <li> The oil absorb quickly and my 70 year old skin (face &amp; very wrinkled arms) is much softer -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little heavy for daytime use, but perfect for night time.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t used it much, but hope that it lives up to the claims of smoothing the frizz in the hair and adding moisture to the face without residue.</li>
            <li> You will have to experiment to find the amount that works for you as too much WILL leave your hair greasy.</li>
            <li> It leaves my legs on fire, and itchy, whereas REAL argan oil does not.</li>
            <li> They really need to look into the quality control in the products they sell and how they store them.</li>
            <li> Really for this price though I&#x27;m not going to complain.</li>
            <li> when I run low again I will re-order the Life-flo Argan oil, it&#x27;s a fantastic value.</li>
            <li> have very course and unruly hair.  </li>
            <li> The real deal.</li>
            <li> I just wish a larger bottle was available.</li>
            <li> both of our symptoms have decreased a great deal.</li>
            <li> smells different if your used to toast argan oil which smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> This one was much stronger.</li>
            <li> If you use small amounts to rub into your skin it goes on lightly, absorbs quickly and leaves your skin soft, hydrated and lightly sheened without any greasy residue.</li>
            <li> One brand is okay, but it is not pure as it has many chemicals in it, and is not absorbed into the hair as readily.  </li>
            <li> Other argan oils I have tried have smelled much better.</li>
            <li> The good thing is that the smell usually disappears completely within 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only moisturizer I&#x27;ve been able to use that doesn&#x27;t cause irritation, and actually seems to lessen my rosacea symptoms.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat oily hair, so I always wash it in the morning, but it makes my hair very soft and shiny!  </li>
            <li> I use it right out of the shower when my skin is still wet, and let it be absorbed.</li>
            <li> The aroma of this product to me is not appealing but fortunately the smell dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend you give it a try both for skin and hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended if your skin suits the oil.</li>
            <li> size bottle will last me for 4 to 5 months, unless I discover more uses for it in the near future.</li>
            <li> And should be stored in a cool, dry place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very upset that in the summary and description of this product it says 100% Pure, on the bottle its only 95% plus it contains Vitamin E (Tocopherol) which is gluten.  </li>
            <li> The odor is not unpleasant and it is just right for me, not too heavy.</li>
            <li> Some of the reviews complain about the small amount of vitamin E, but the E is also just as healthy as the Argan oil for your hair and skin.  </li>
            <li> It actually smells better than the other one I was using for years.</li>
            <li> and the text was almost exactly the same.  </li>
            <li> I guess I would not have bought a second one if the first did not meet expectations.  </li>
            <li> Argan oil is a light weight, natural product infused with nutrients that offers shine and control with out weighing hair down if used sparingly.  </li>
            <li> Same smell (not that it has a strong smell), same color, same consistency.</li>
            <li> After only two weeks of using Life-flo Pure Argan Oil it was gone.</li>
            <li> And wow, what a difference.</li>
            <li> The condition of my hair has changed completely.</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> The key is not putting too much on.</li>
            <li> It appears that is the oil&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li> But the bottle I received smells like old cheese.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Used on your skin, it keeps your skin hydrated and soft.  </li>
            <li> AS WE AGE, WE LOSE NATURAL OILS IN OUR SKIN AND HAIR.</li>
            <li> (obviously it doesn&#x27;t bother others as much).</li>
            <li> I purchased the one ounce before and was so surprised by the price of this brand.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to try it that I immediately opened it and slathered a few drops all over my hands.</li>
            <li> Definitely a niceproduct if you are willing to work around the initial smell.</li>
            <li> Just remember, when using PURE argan oil on you hair, alittle goes a long way.</li>
            <li> IT IS USED FOR MANY USES:  DRY HAIR, DRY SKIN, DRY NAILS</li>
            <li> filled up the small bottle w/ dropper w/ the Life-flo oil for ease of use!&lt;br /&gt;I should be set with Argan oil for a while, but</li>
            <li> This oil is a bit heavy but soaks into your skin quickly and does not leave an oily residue.</li>
            <li> This brand smells rancid, no other way to put it, and it makes my hair sticky, like when you get food in your hair and try to brush it, there is a gob of something</li>
            <li> If you buy some of the other brands that contain chemicals, you will see that this oil is light compared to those that are not pure Argan oil.</li>
            <li> This Argan Oil works really great, but the smell is atrocious.  </li>
            <li> But it should definitely not smell like old cheese.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how could I live without argan oil for so long!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased other brands of Argan oil and they have smelled lovely, but this one smells a little strange.  </li>
            <li> I should also note that after receiving this oil I did have the chance to check out other relatively pure Argan oils (such as Acure&#x27;s Argan Oil) and they also smelled like goat.</li>
            <li> I first started researching this product, I saw a few reviewers noted it smelled like A) Goat B)</li>
            <li> As my small expensive bottle of Argan Oil started to run low, I began searching for a more economical brand.</li>
            <li> Fantastic price, however, I feel this argan oil is quite thick compared to other consistencies.</li>
            <li> My skin is much softer and a lot less dry since using this product.</li>
            <li> A little bit really does go a long way.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m on a fixed income, decided to try this argon oil for about 9 times less then the one being sold on a well known shopping channel.</li>
            <li> I have researched several brands and find this one to be top of the line and a lot less expensive.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad bottle that had gone rancid, but it did not smell nice at all.</li>
            <li> so please excuse that my review is rather long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not particularly sensitive to smells</li>
            <li> I compared those claims to the much more expensive brand I had previously purchased-</li>
            <li> I have added this to my other hair products (just about a teaspoon per bottle) and there is definitely a difference.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use it on my face, but due to the smell, I have resorted to use only on my heels and legs and sometimes the ends of my hair.  </li>
            <li> but rather a dry oil.  </li>
            <li> I had a dry patch of skin I had even seen a doctor for to no avail.</li>
            <li> It did not seem diluted or watered down; just the same.  </li>
            <li> and then apply to wet or dry hair, and miraculously tames the frizz.</li>
            <li> Just an open mouthed bottle, that&#x27;s difficult to use terms of measuring how much to apply for each application.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, leaves my skin and hair soft and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> During the day I use only a small amount and run it through my hair, which is curly, can be frizzy, and dry from hair dyes.  </li>
            <li> This is NOT pure argan oil.</li>
            <li> I will not be repurchasing due to the smell, but they product does soften and moisturize as expected.</li>
            <li> When I read the description for the Life-flo brand, that the oil was \\&quot;Cold pressed and certified organic, Purchased from women?s cooperatives in Morocco to support their social and economic welfare.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by other \\&quot;Argan</li>
            <li> Oil\\&quot; products that have other</li>
            <li> but I picked up on the \\&quot;goat smell\\&quot; noted by other reviewers.</li>
            <li> It can also be masked or diluted with other oils so all is not lost.</li>
            <li> It worked but it had lots of other things in it, including an orange dye.</li>
            <li> I have tried products that have argan oil in them and they are costly and diluted with other ingredients.  </li>
            <li> On dry hair my hair started to curl up a little.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different brands of argan oil, and they have all had the same, subtle smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other, expensive argan oil products, but none of them have actually helped to improve the condition of my hair( which is very dry and prone to breakage).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so odd.</li>
            <li> Half of that amount will do for the face and neck.  </li>
            <li> called Life-flo, they said the bottle should not be expired yet since this product was launched less than a year ago.</li>
            <li> My skin becomes less oily and tender after using it, a little sticky though.</li>
            <li> A little goes along way.</li>
            <li> Because it is a somewhat heavy oil.</li>
            <li> I also add a few drops to my body and feet lotion.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Some have mentioned that they feel the oil is too heavy.  </li>
            <li> (the smell fades within minutes, so if you can stand it for a few, it&#x27;s work the money.)  </li>
            <li> Did I get a bottle with missing dropper, or it just come like that.</li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> (light, nutty scent) opened it again a few days later to use it and it smelled horrible!</li>
            <li> I ended up pouring it down the drain, which was disappointing since I tried buying this big 4 oz bottle instead of other brands of 1 oz to &amp;#34;save money&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I had to put Essential Oil of Lavender to make it bearable, but the nasty smell still is very evident.  </li>
            <li> As very very little goes along way.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I&#x27;m going back to EA!</li>
            <li> It takes away the frizz and excessive volume, giving it shine and softness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have used vitamin E on the skin under my eyes for years and have very few wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Anytime my skin is feeling particularly dry, I dab about 1-2 drops on my fingers and rub on troubled areas.</li>
            <li> ESPECIALLY IN THE COLD WINTER MONTHS.</li>
            <li> so I pour slowly.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!!</li>
            <li> It really smells bad and I wouldn&#x27;t put it on any part of my body or hair!</li>
            <li> I am not very impressed.  </li>
            <li> PEOPLE ARE SOOOOO DRAMATIC WHEN THEY DON&#x27;T LIKE SOMETHING!\\&quot; and decided to ignore their reviews.</li>
            <li> I have noticed very little breakage if any!!!</li>
            <li> Even my husband complained that it made me smell bad</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like the expensive one I was buying.</li>
            <li> though I should let it go if there is nothing wrong with the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I immediately did a side-by-side comparison of the expensive argan oil (which I was almost out of) to the Life-flo argan oil.  </li>
            <li> I used previously, but the scent of the argan oil is absolutely terrible to me</li>
            <li> I keep my room cold, the coldest room in the house.</li>
            <li> So unhappy.</li>
            <li> This Argan oil stinks for some reason.  </li>
            <li> Except my Josie Maran bottle lasted for what seemed like forever &amp; never went bad.</li>
            <li> This bottle was bad from the start.</li>
            <li> The smell is really bad !</li>
            <li> How could a product go bad in 3 days?!</li>
            <li> This smells horrible!!!</li>
            <li> (When I use it on my hair, my husband wrinkles his nose and says it smells terrible.)  </li>
            <li> Disgusting.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works great for my skin and hair.  Humidity is no longer an enemy to my hair.  It works great for skin too.  The smell is light and not over powering like virgin argon.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews I decided to give this a try along with a more expensive 100% Argan oil.  In comparing the two, there seemed to be no difference in smell, touch, or appearance. It did not seem diluted or watered down; just the same.  I will note, however, that this product is 99.5% argan oil and .5% vitamin E \\&quot;to preserve the fresheness of the oil\\&quot;. Product has an expiration date.</li>
            <li> Great product and a very good price too! I have added this to my other hair products (just about a teaspoon per bottle) and there is definitely a difference. My frizzy hair looks much better now!!</li>
            <li> I use argan oil for my hair. Although its great for your skin as well. I&#x27;ve tried several other, expensive argan oil products, but none of them have actually helped to improve the condition of my hair( which is very dry and prone to breakage). So, I decided to try PURE argan oil. And wow, what a difference. The condition of my hair has changed completely. My hair is extremely soft and shiny. I have noticed very little breakage if any!!! Also, the price is a steal. You won&#x27;t find a 4-ounce bottle of pure argan oil for this price anywhere else!!! Trust me, I&#x27;ve done alot of searching online and in stores. Just remember, when using PURE argan oil on you hair, alittle goes a long way. Because it is a somewhat heavy oil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so odd. I&#x27;d been using Eden Allure with much success and decided to try Life-Flo based on cost and quantity. Needless to say I&#x27;m going back to EA! It really smells bad and I wouldn&#x27;t put it on any part of my body or hair!</li>
            <li> A little goes along way. The product&#x27;s bottle opening is about a the size of a nickle so I pour slowly. The aroma of this product to me is not appealing but fortunately the smell dissipates quickly. The product leaves a nice shine on the hair.    Best usage for me on wet hair. On dry hair my hair started to curl up a little.     Note: Review written after 3rd time of usage.    Made in ???? - Country of Origin not mentioned on box or on bottle</li>
            <li> Very upset that in the summary and description of this product it says 100% Pure, on the bottle its only 95% plus it contains Vitamin E (Tocopherol) which is gluten.  I would have never ordered this product had I know.  This should be listed for those w/gluten sensitivites such as myself!</li>
            <li> I use this oil as moisturizer, frizz control, cuticle oil and even to soothe mild rashes. I don&#x27;t know how could I live without argan oil for so long! The consistency is really light, goes in smoothly and does the job, any job!&lt;br /&gt;I use about a m &amp; m size , rub it in my hands to warm it some and then apply to wet or dry hair, and miraculously tames the frizz. Half of that amount will do for the face and neck.  I also add a few drops to my body and feet lotion.&lt;br /&gt;This size bottle will last me for 4 to 5 months, unless I discover more uses for it in the near future.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. Anytime my skin is feeling particularly dry, I dab about 1-2 drops on my fingers and rub on troubled areas. I have sensitive/sometimes breakout prone skin but this oil doesn&#x27;t go on greasy. The key is not putting too much on. A little bit really does go a long way. A couple of drops is also great when my hair is wild from the wash the night before. It takes away the frizz and excessive volume, giving it shine and softness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love that it doesn&#x27;t have all those nasty chemicals that coat your hair to make it appear healthy. This stuff is actually GOOD for your hair! Don&#x27;t be fooled by other \\&quot;Argan Oil\\&quot; products that have other ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell the best but as long as you aren&#x27;t slathering it on, it will go away.</li>
            <li> Smells great and provides great moisture. I use this on my body face and my hair I love it</li>
            <li> i purchased this oil after reading several reviews on the product.  i was inspired by the fact that morrocan women are the sole producers of this oil.  i haven&#x27;t used it much, but hope that it lives up to the claims of smoothing the frizz in the hair and adding moisture to the face without residue.</li>
            <li> I want to be fair in my review of this product and discuss the pros and cons so please excuse that my review is rather long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first started researching this product, I saw a few reviewers noted it smelled like A) Goat B) Goat poo and C) Rancid cheese. My reaction was, \\&quot;GEEZ! PEOPLE ARE SOOOOO DRAMATIC WHEN THEY DON&#x27;T LIKE SOMETHING!\\&quot; and decided to ignore their reviews. When I received my bottle of Life-Flo Argan Oil I was so excited to try it that I immediately opened it and slathered a few drops all over my hands. Then I took and nice, long whiff of my palms aaaaaaaand...(INSERT SOUNDS OF SCREECHING CAR BRAKES HERE). My hands smelled like a goat petting zoo OR some rancid German cheese. It&#x27;s true, this product does have a goat or cheese smell. I&#x27;m not particularly sensitive to smells but I picked up on the \\&quot;goat smell\\&quot; noted by other reviewers. I guess some people pick up on and some don&#x27;t. Others might just have a different reference to liken it to. The good thing is that the smell usually disappears completely within 5 to 10 minutes. It can also be masked or diluted with other oils so all is not lost. I should also note that after receiving this oil I did have the chance to check out other relatively pure Argan oils (such as Acure&#x27;s Argan Oil) and they also smelled like goat. It appears that is the oil&#x27;s natural scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: The initial \\&quot;goat\\&quot; or \\&quot;rancid cheese\\&quot; smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: If you can get past the scent or mask it, you will be very pleased with this product! If you use small amounts to rub into your skin it goes on lightly, absorbs quickly and leaves your skin soft, hydrated and lightly sheened without any greasy residue. I also apply a few drops on the ends of my hair and can honestly say it HAS MADE A DIFFERENCE! The ends of my hair look healthier, feel smoother and have an extra boost of softness. You will have to experiment to find the amount that works for you as too much WILL leave your hair greasy. Definitely a niceproduct if you are willing to work around the initial smell.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my purchase of Life-flo Pure Argan Oil. I use it as a facial moisturizer and I think it&#x27;s great. And the price makes this a great value.</li>
            <li> This is NOT pure argan oil. do NOT BELIEVE THE LIES. I have no issues with pure argan oil, but this product, is too good to be true for the price. It leaves my legs on fire, and itchy, whereas REAL argan oil does not.</li>
            <li> I use this to remove mascara, to moisturize my face, hands and hair.  I use all over once a month to soften my skin and add a lovely glow.  Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Thought I would try this one because of the price, and love it, will be back for more. It&#x27;s just like the expensive one I was buying.</li>
            <li> I have purchased Argan oil before - and I love it - but it was so expenseive!  This purchase is a great deal, and is the same pure, top quality item I have bought in the past on QVC.  I highly recommend you give it a try both for skin and hair.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest moisturizing product I have ever tried. Easy, inexpensive, natural, healthy - won&#x27;t ever be without it again.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. I find it to be the cheapest argan oil out there, yet the most pure and good quality one.</li>
            <li> The bottle of oil I received is rancid. First the bottle I received did not come in a box. It came in a bag that was then wrapped in bubble wrap. When I looked at the use by date it was smudged. This worried me but I though I should let it go if there is nothing wrong with the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened the bottle over a month after it arrived. I kept the kept the bottle in a drawer in my room. I keep my room cold, the coldest room in the house. I waited to use it because I had a tiny bottle of Josie Maran Argan oil &amp; I was waiting to use that up before I started using this bottle of Life-flo Argan Oil. This bottle is quite a deal 4oz for $18.15 while .5oz of the Josie Maran oil is $14. Except my Josie Maran bottle lasted for what seemed like forever &amp; never went bad. This bottle was bad from the start. I put a couple of drops of Lavender oil before applying it to my skin so I did not notice the smell immediately. But the bottle I received smells like old cheese.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called Life-flo, they said the bottle should not be expired yet since this product was launched less than a year ago. But it should definitely not smell like old cheese. They think it might be the way the seller stores the oil. Argan oil has a nutty smell. And should be stored in a cool, dry place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m grateful to Amazon for giving me a full refund though I purchased the bottle over a month ago. But I&#x27;m horrified at having put rancid oil on my face, skin &amp; hair. They really need to look into the quality control in the products they sell and how they store them.</li>
            <li> I have used many brands and I like Life-flo&#x27;s the best especially because of the price. It is a pure Argan with just a touch of Vitamin E to keep the oil fresh. I will be giving it to my many of my friends for the holiday</li>
            <li> This smells horrible!!! What a waste of money!! I wish I could return it. So unhappy. Other argan oils I have tried have smelled much better.</li>
            <li> Compare to its price it does what it supposed to do. My only downside was smell. Had to hold my breath every time I put it on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this straight-up as a night-time facial and hand moisturizer (and I&#x27;ve used it in homemade personal care products) and I&#x27;ve been very happy with it.  The odor is not unpleasant and it is just right for me, not too heavy.</li>
            <li> Absorbs into skin and hair without looking greasy.  Makes my skin feel smooth and youthful especially on harsh to the skin Winter days.</li>
            <li> I have used several different brands of Argan oil.  One brand is okay, but it is not pure as it has many chemicals in it, and is not absorbed into the hair as readily.  The Life-flo Argan oil is 95% pure Argan oil with 5% vitamin E. I use Life-flo on my hair and face.  During the day I use only a small amount and run it through my hair, which is curly, can be frizzy, and dry from hair dyes.  At night I use more in my hair. Unless you are using a lot of this oil, it is absorbed into the hair without being oily, and leaves your hair smooth, soft, and shiny.  Some of the reviews complain about the small amount of vitamin E, but the E is also just as healthy as the Argan oil for your hair and skin.  I have used vitamin E on the skin under my eyes for years and have very few wrinkles.  Used on your skin, it keeps your skin hydrated and soft.  Some have mentioned that they feel the oil is too heavy.  If you buy some of the other brands that contain chemicals, you will see that this oil is light compared to those that are not pure Argan oil.</li>
            <li> Fantastic price, however, I feel this argan oil is quite thick compared to other consistencies. Really for this price though I&#x27;m not going to complain.</li>
            <li> For me, this product is ok if I apply just a drop onto my palm rub it and apply on my hair.  The moment even my palm touches my scalp, this instantly gives me a head ache to last for next 3-4 hrs minimum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does leave the hair softer.</li>
            <li> This Argan Oil works really great, but the smell is atrocious.  (the smell fades within minutes, so if you can stand it for a few, it&#x27;s work the money.)  I had to put Essential Oil of Lavender to make it bearable, but the nasty smell still is very evident.  I wanted to use it on my face, but due to the smell, I have resorted to use only on my heels and legs and sometimes the ends of my hair.  (When I use it on my hair, my husband wrinkles his nose and says it smells terrible.)  So, not a turn on.  I will not be repurchasing due to the smell, but they product does soften and moisturize as expected.</li>
            <li> I have used a different brand of Argan Oil for years. It worked but it had lots of other things in it, including an orange dye. The price went up on it and I searched for a cheaper one, but 100% Argan Oil or close to it. I really am impressed with Life-flo&#x27;s product. I am now a convert. It actually smells better than the other one I was using for years.</li>
            <li> I just received this product. Packaging, and label look authentic. The liquid, texture and smell, also seems original Argan (I think!). Yet while unscrewing the cap, there is no dropper! Just an open mouthed bottle, that&#x27;s difficult to use terms of measuring how much to apply for each application. Can someone help! Did I get a bottle with missing dropper, or it just come like that. I&#x27;ll give it 3 stars till I get some clarification for this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: it&#x27;s very good oil for hair. Though should have dropper for ease of use. As very very little goes along way. Especially with short/medium length hair. Four Stars :)</li>
            <li> This product was exactly as described and way cheaper than the options in the cosmetic stores. I would buy again!</li>
            <li> I had another brand of argon oil, much smaller size that came in a dropper bottle.  It was great, no smell and helped with the texture of my hair.  This brand smells rancid, no other way to put it, and it makes my hair sticky, like when you get food in your hair and try to brush it, there is a gob of something and you end up pulling out your hair because the brush won&#x27;t go through the ends where I applied it.  I bought from Vitamin Shoppe and hopefully they&#x27;ll take it back.</li>
            <li> ARGAN OIL, KNOW AS LIQUID GOLD, IS IN FACT, JUST THAT. IT IS USED FOR MANY USES:  DRY HAIR, DRY SKIN, DRY NAILS AND I MAKE A CLEANSING OIL OUT OF IT FOR MY FACE. WOULDN&#x27;T BE WITHOUT IT. WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE WHO WANTS BEAUTIFUL SKIN; ESPECIALLY IN THE COLD WINTER MONTHS. AS WE AGE, WE LOSE NATURAL OILS IN OUR SKIN AND HAIR. WE NEED TO REPLACE THAT WITH GOOD NOURISHMENT AND THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE OILS.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love argan oil for my face and hair.  It does not make me break out, it is not greasy but rather a dry oil.  Great under foundation.  It makes hair grow long, strong and soft and keeps it frizz free.</li>
            <li> i bought this to mix it with rosehip oil and patchouli, to make a face moisturizer. It does have a funny smell (as mentioned by many other reviewers), but it goes away very quick!  The product was so good that i quickly began to apply it in my hair and use it as a body lotion. I am planning on buying this again.&lt;br /&gt;Good product!</li>
            <li> This Argan oil stinks for some reason.  I&#x27;ve purchased other brands of Argan oil and they have smelled lovely, but this one smells a little strange.  I am not very impressed.  I&#x27;m just going to mix it with almond oil and essential oils so that I can&#x27;t smell it but still use it.  (By the way, the smell does go away after it&#x27;s applied but it still doesn&#x27;t make it nice to use)</li>
            <li> My first purchase of Argan Oil was an impulse buy of .5 oz of it for $14- in the check-out line of Sephora. I used it and really liked it for both skin and hair.  I also use it on my children&#x27;s skin. As my small expensive bottle of Argan Oil started to run low, I began searching for a more economical brand. When I read the description for the Life-flo brand, that the oil was \\&quot;Cold pressed and certified organic, Purchased from women?s cooperatives in Morocco to support their social and economic welfare.\\&quot;  I compared those claims to the much more expensive brand I had previously purchased- and the text was almost exactly the same.  I paid 17.99 for 4 ounces and I have Amazon Prime so it shipped for free.  For $3 more I was getting 8x the amount of oil for the expensive brand. What did I have to lose?&lt;br /&gt;My order arrived quickly and I immediately did a side-by-side comparison of the expensive argan oil (which I was almost out of) to the Life-flo argan oil.  The 2 oils are identical in color, scent and texture.&lt;br /&gt;I filled up the small bottle w/ dropper w/ the Life-flo oil for ease of use!&lt;br /&gt;I should be set with Argan oil for a while, but when I run low again I will re-order the Life-flo Argan oil, it&#x27;s a fantastic value.</li>
            <li> The smell was rather odd but the consistency was nice. My skin and hair felt great after about 2 uses.</li>
            <li> I ordered Life-flo Pure Argan Oil because I have been seeing how good argan oil is for you hair and skin.  I have tried products that have argan oil in them and they are costly and diluted with other ingredients.  I found Life-flo pure argan oil on Amazon and was happy to find the product in pure form and it is affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very course and unruly hair.  Argan oil is a light weight, natural product infused with nutrients that offers shine and control with out weighing hair down if used sparingly.  I put in on my hair after I wash it and then touch up daily if I do not have styling products on my hair.  My hair is shinier and healthier looking and feels softer.  My goal is healthier, softer hair overall and I believe argan oil will help achieve that goal.  I plan to use it on my face as a moisturizer, as well, as soon as I use up the products I have currently.</li>
            <li> Good product. The real deal.</li>
            <li> The oil works beautifully on my hair, I put it on my ends during the day or through all my hair for an overnight treatment to be washed out in the morning.  The oil is light, much lighter than the emu oil I used previously, but the scent of the argan oil is absolutely terrible to me (obviously it doesn&#x27;t bother others as much). When I use it in my hair the smell seems to dissipate quickly, but when I use it on my skin I have to put on another lotion right away to make the smell go away.  To be frank, my husband says it smells like baby poo. He will keep his distance from me after I put it on.</li>
            <li> Argan oil makes my hair shiny.  After using other products, I apply it last to have that nice healthy sheen.  I purchased the one ounce before and was so surprised by the price of this brand.  It&#x27;s such a great saving.  I simply poured it in the 1 oz bottle with the dropper and store the rest.  It&#x27;s the same product! Same smell (not that it has a strong smell), same color, same consistency. I would definitely reorder from them.</li>
            <li> Arrived as described. Yet to use product! However have tried this brand before, results are satisfying. Highly recommended if your skin suits the oil.</li>
            <li> I use this product every night on my face. It&#x27;s a little heavy for daytime use, but perfect for night time. It absorbs well and isn&#x27;t greasy even though it is oily. That seems counter-intuitive but it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of Life-Pro.  I guess I would not have bought a second one if the first did not meet expectations.  This oil is a bit heavy but soaks into your skin quickly and does not leave an oily residue. I am 71 and use this at night and under my makeup. My skin is much softer and a lot less dry since using this product. I have researched several brands and find this one to be top of the line and a lot less expensive.  I will buy my third bottle when the time comes.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m on a fixed income, decided to try this argon oil for about 9 times less then the one being sold on a well known shopping channel. The oil absorb quickly and my 70 year old skin (face &amp; very wrinkled arms) is much softer - I am thrilled and will continue to purchase argon oil from this seller.</li>
            <li> I use this Argan Oil at night in my hair.  I have somewhat oily hair, so I always wash it in the morning, but it makes my hair very soft and shiny!  Love it!</li>
            <li> I love argan oil for moisturizing my hair. This product is 100% pure and it&#x27;s a great price. I&#x27;ve bought smaller bottles for much more!</li>
            <li> My skin becomes less oily and tender after using it, a little sticky though. It will be good if it comes with a punch.</li>
            <li> I love what it does for my hair, its soft shiny, and my scalp retains moisture I just wish a larger bottle was available.</li>
            <li> In love with this product. It feels so nice on my skin and hair and absorbs quickly. Smells wonderfully earthy too.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and my husband has eczema-ever since we started using Argan oil a year ago both of our symptoms have decreased a great deal. I use it right out of the shower when my skin is still wet, and let it be absorbed. It&#x27;s the only moisturizer I&#x27;ve been able to use that doesn&#x27;t cause irritation, and actually seems to lessen my rosacea symptoms. I love it!</li>
            <li> great clear clean product! Wonderfully priced, lasts and lasts. Near Order less, Makes my skin feel great . I had a dry patch of skin I had even seen a doctor for to no avail. After only two weeks of using Life-flo Pure Argan Oil it was gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m korean&lt;br /&gt;This product is good for your hair</li>
            <li> Outstanding product. One of the better priced options and works just as well as the higher priced versions. Makes our hair look fabulous!</li>
            <li> The most pure Argan oil I can find and at a great price too! I put this stuff everywhere!!! Face - Arms - Legs - You name it! The best!</li>
            <li> great oil, what you expect from argan oil. smells different if your used to toast argan oil which smells fantastic. this smell more pungeant. glass bottle is cumbersome to pour, i suggest you buy a plastic bottle like the ones you can buy for air travel for easier pouring. great price too.</li>
            <li> The smell is really bad ! Wouldnt buy again !!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different brands of argan oil, and they have all had the same, subtle smell. This one was much stronger. I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad bottle that had gone rancid, but it did not smell nice at all. Even my husband complained that it made me smell bad and I had to wash it off. I ended up pouring it down the drain, which was disappointing since I tried buying this big 4 oz bottle instead of other brands of 1 oz to &amp;#34;save money&amp;#34;. What a waste.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot.  It&#x27;s thick, leaves my skin and hair soft and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> My wife and daughter really enjoy the Argan Oil.  It&#x27;s great for your skin as well as nice healthy/shiny hair.  Great service and a great value.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t feel oily, face is looking healthier ....</li>
            <li> Opened it the day I got it and it smelled fine (light, nutty scent) opened it again a few days later to use it and it smelled horrible! How could a product go bad in 3 days?! Disgusting.</li>
            <li> I use Argan Oil as my night facial moisturizer. I&#x27;ve used it as a hair oil as well when I wear it curly. Great stuff. This is WAY cheaper than another brand you can buy in beauty stores...it&#x27;s 1/3 the price. I found this at my natural food store, but found this price on Amazon to be better. Love it. Will re-order.</li>
