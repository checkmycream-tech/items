            <li>Squikey clean.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and my skin is very soft.</li>
            <li>I love this better than soap for my face, your pores get smaller and face looks so smooth, this is all I use on my face</li>
            <li>It was shipped quickly and I got it in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>Now I feel confident enough not wearing make up.</li>

            <li>Almost positive that these are NOT clones.</li>
            <li>Really haven&#x27;t used the soap long enough to make a fair judgement.</li>
            <li>My son has a pimple prone skin and this soap has helped clear up his skin somewhat.  </li>
            <li>it so far.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone that is looking for a natural product, without harmful residues, it cleans as well as nourishes the skin.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it is personal preference, but I have used other Dead Sea Mud Soaps that I&#x27;ve loved, and this one did not measure up.  </li>
            <li>First of all, the other soaps I&#x27;ve used have been very mild-smelling, but this soap has a scent I&#x27;m not sure I like.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love this soap! It was shipped quickly and I got it in a timely manner. Great price too!</li>
            <li> This soap has done wonders for my face. My husband bought it at the mall in a kiosk, it was for him but made it mine when I gave it a try. My acne prone skin starting clearing up and now I don&#x27;t have any pimples. I get one to two a month but this soap makes my face feel so smooth. My face doesn&#x27;t look all stressed and greasy. Now I feel confident enough not wearing make up.</li>
            <li> I like it very much...feel good on your skin</li>
            <li> Almost positive that these are NOT clones. They work just as good as the authentic I bought straight from the company. I will be returning here to buy more once I run out.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and my skin is very soft.</li>
            <li> This soap is so good. It cleans your skin good. Takes your make up off and does not leave any residue on your skin. Squikey clean.</li>
            <li> I love this better than soap for my face, your pores get smaller and face looks so smooth, this is all I use on my face</li>
            <li> I really liked this soap.  It was the first time I have used it.  I got it for me as well for my son.  My son has a pimple prone skin and this soap has helped clear up his skin somewhat.  Would recommend to anyone willing to give it a shot.</li>
            <li> been using it for three years now.  great face soap.  last a long time too.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Only used product once since it shipped but it seems Great! Bad smell though</li>
            <li> Really haven&#x27;t used the soap long enough to make a fair judgement. I use it only for facial cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;Like it so far.</li>
            <li> This can help some with acne prone skin so if you are looking for something to try it cant hurt for the price to give it a shot. My daughter loves it</li>
            <li> Great product. Great smell, great texture. I use this product twice a day, my skin feels like silk! I would recommend this product to anyone that is looking for a natural product, without harmful residues, it cleans as well as nourishes the skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap hoping it would help acne as I saw some other reviews that indicated it might.  I have not seen a big difference in my acne, and I am not too fond of the smell of this soap so probably will not order again.</li>
            <li> I always love Vivo products.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap to see if my eczema would get better.  I&#x27;m not noticing any great change in my eczema but the soap is very pleasant.</li>

            <li> It is so awesome!!! Took away my blemishes.</li>
            <li> Smells like a vacation:) I will probably buy it again in the future because it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin versus regular soaps.</li>
