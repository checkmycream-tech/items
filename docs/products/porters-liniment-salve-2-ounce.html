            <li>This product works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>It still works just as well - its longevity says a lot about how effective it is.</li>
            <li>It is particularly effective on splinters but we use it on cuts, scraps and any sort of skin abrasions.</li>

            <li>on there cows on there farm, plus for there own cuts.</li>

            <li>Having used Porter&#x27;s Salve since childhood and not being able to find it, when we spotted it on Amazon, it was a must have.</li>
            <li>Now I know where to send our newest recruits for more salve.</li>
            <li>It stops itching, cures diaper rash, and heals things better than just about anything else out there.</li>
            <li>My family has been using Porter&#x27;s salve for better than 50 years.</li>
            <li>Porter&#x27;s is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Awesome as I remember, liniment smell takes me back to childhood and works well.</li>
            <li>It is not an antibiotic cream and works more like I remember drawing salve is supposed to.  </li>
            <li>best stuff ever for pulling out infection or possible infection</li>
            <li>but it will help you heal better and faster.</li>
            <li>Some people don&#x27;t care for the scent which can be overpowering, but the results more than make up for it.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t need to buy many tins during your lifetime.</li>
            <li>Love this salve, best there is and only get it through the Internet.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better to go to porters Web site.</li>
            <li>and I got to say I love it.</li>
            <li>I say this confidently because I did just that</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t sting and is super effective.</li>
            <li>it really works good</li>
            <li>It heals diaper rash, heat rash, draws like the best drawing salve to heal spider bites and other insect bites.  </li>
            <li>Strong smell,</li>
            <li>Yes the odor is strong, but it works.</li>
            <li>First time to try this nice purchase</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan now.  </li>
            <li>presently I got from my great grandparents&#x27; home after they passed away, 15 years ago.</li>
            <li>Of course, if one has a problem with their immune system or diabetes, for example, it is important to receive you doctors approval.  </li>
            <li>This salve has been in the family for yrs.&#x27;, great for a lot of different uses.</li>
            <li>I am delighted to be able to get it by mail order as my local stores do not carry it</li>
            <li>I agree, it&#x27;s unique smell</li>
            <li>yes it has a strong mediciny smell, but my great grandmother used to put it on me for diaper rashes, and the tradition has continued on down thru the years in my family.  </li>
            <li>The whole family keeps it on hand for everything, there is nothing any better out there.</li>
            <li>Smell not bad either.</li>
            <li>I received this quick.</li>
            <li>My grandfather used this when he suffered from burns from a fire and he healed quickly and no scaring.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>The smell can be pretty strong but the results are really worth it.  </li>
            <li>The one drawback is it smells pretty strong, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it right before you go on a road trip.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon for making it easy to restock our supply.</li>
            <li>but well worth it.</li>
            <li>Somehow I ran across this Porters salve And decided it&#x27;s worth a try</li>
            <li>I am so excited to see that I can get more of it, and especially on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Great stuff for dry rough feet and hands, works better then any lotions I have found so</li>
            <li>Best Salve we  have ever used for Dry Winter Cracks, rough heels, scrapes, burns, mosquito bites etc.</li>
            <li>Grew up using this salve, and have given it to several friends - all of whom sooner or later call to rave about what a great job it does.  </li>
            <li>I have used this item in the past and just love it and was pleased with my purchase and would purchase from seller again.</li>
            <li>If anyone gets hurt, the first thing they head for are the bandages and the Porters&#x27; Liniment.</li>
            <li>I put it on chapped lips at night and in the morning they are soft &amp; smooth.  </li>
            <li>and you know exactly what you are getting</li>
            <li>this stuff is great, only negative thing is the smell, not awful just very distinctive.</li>
            <li>pretty much does.</li>
            <li>As the title says, it pretty much works for just about everything.</li>
            <li>The scent is a little strong, but the salve&#x27;s effectiveness makes the scent worth it!</li>
            <li>My grandfather uses this salve and my dad uses it and the whole family</li>
            <li>arrived fast works like a charm</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t notice the difference</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care much for the odor of this salve</li>
            <li>Wonderful on dirty abrasions and splinters.</li>
            <li>It really works for blisters and bruises, dries the  blisters and takes away a lot of the color and soreness of bruises.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to any one, thanks for asking.  </li>
            <li>This salve works wonders, heals wounds fast and prevents infection.</li>
            <li>If it draws that much might even work on acne.   </li>
            <li>This worked very well for a skin condition I had.</li>
            <li>This is a fast working salve.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough about this and so excited to find it online for purchase.</li>
            <li>This particular ad needs attention...</li>
            <li>Not only does it hold nostalgic value to me, it is an awesome product.</li>
            <li>I still use it and highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for everyone.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Porter&#x27;s Liniment Salve.</li>
            <li>and I recently found it, smelled it out by its distinct odor.</li>
            <li>Normally I use Neosporin when I get home after a day of working with my hands, but I tried this</li>
            <li>I wish I would have been more careful in reading the ENTIRE offer because I paid $10.99 for 1 box</li>
            <li>Am so glad to know I can still get it since the local pharmacy that carried it has closed and the chain pharmacies don&#x27;t have it.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I personally was using my table saw and accidentally got my finger into the blade about 1/4 inch or little better.</li>
            <li>I used alot of this when I was young.</li>
            <li>this old time product has been in my family&#x27;s household for sixty years, we use it on itchy skin.</li>
            <li>used this since childhood (now 60 yrs old)...</li>
            <li>Now my adult kids use it on their kids.  </li>
            <li>When the doctor&#x27;s recommendation failed to produce results, back to the good old Porter&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Really heals my dry cracked hands.</li>
            <li>I am starting to run out and have been hoarding it so that its only used when I really need it.</li>
            <li>Also great to use on painful boil&#x27;s, to draw out the infection.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t turn your hands into a soft skin which will get torn up the next day like some products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a major alarm if we run out, since our local drugstores no longer can order it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it ever since to combat minor cuts or scratches which have developed infections.  </li>

            <li> I have used this item in the past and just love it and was pleased with my purchase and would purchase from seller again.</li>
            <li> If anyone gets hurt, the first thing they head for are the bandages and the Porters&#x27; Liniment.</li>
            <li> I put it on chapped lips at night and in the morning they are soft &amp; smooth.  </li>
            <li> and you know exactly what you are getting</li>
            <li> this stuff is great, only negative thing is the smell, not awful just very distinctive.</li>
            <li> pretty much does.</li>
            <li> As the title says, it pretty much works for just about everything.</li>
            <li> The scent is a little strong, but the salve&#x27;s effectiveness makes the scent worth it!</li>
            <li> My grandfather uses this salve and my dad uses it and the whole family</li>
            <li> arrived fast works like a charm</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice the difference</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care much for the odor of this salve</li>
            <li> Wonderful on dirty abrasions and splinters.</li>
            <li> It really works for blisters and bruises, dries the  blisters and takes away a lot of the color and soreness of bruises.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to any one, thanks for asking.  </li>
            <li> This salve works wonders, heals wounds fast and prevents infection.</li>
            <li> If it draws that much might even work on acne.   </li>
            <li> This worked very well for a skin condition I had.</li>
            <li> This is a fast working salve.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this and so excited to find it online for purchase.</li>
            <li> This particular ad needs attention...</li>
            <li> Not only does it hold nostalgic value to me, it is an awesome product.</li>
            <li> I still use it and highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for everyone.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Porter&#x27;s Liniment Salve.</li>
            <li> and I recently found it, smelled it out by its distinct odor.</li>
            <li> Normally I use Neosporin when I get home after a day of working with my hands, but I tried this</li>
            <li> I wish I would have been more careful in reading the ENTIRE offer because I paid $10.99 for 1 box</li>
            <li> Am so glad to know I can still get it since the local pharmacy that carried it has closed and the chain pharmacies don&#x27;t have it.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I personally was using my table saw and accidentally got my finger into the blade about 1/4 inch or little better.</li>
            <li> I used alot of this when I was young.</li>
            <li> this old time product has been in my family&#x27;s household for sixty years, we use it on itchy skin.</li>
            <li> used this since childhood (now 60 yrs old)...</li>
            <li> Now my adult kids use it on their kids.  </li>
            <li> When the doctor&#x27;s recommendation failed to produce results, back to the good old Porter&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Really heals my dry cracked hands.</li>
            <li> I am starting to run out and have been hoarding it so that its only used when I really need it.</li>
            <li> Also great to use on painful boil&#x27;s, to draw out the infection.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t turn your hands into a soft skin which will get torn up the next day like some products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a major alarm if we run out, since our local drugstores no longer can order it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it ever since to combat minor cuts or scratches which have developed infections.  </li>
            <li> Not only cuts, scrapes and burns we&#x27;ve found it also works on pimples, and also smooths scars if applied long enough.</li>
            <li> Once you get past the smell you can expect the healing to happen, fast</li>
            <li> For as long as I can remember, Porter&#x27;s Liniment salve has been in our bathroom cabinet, going back to the 60&#x27;s, when I was born.  </li>
            <li> This last a very long time and heals wounds.</li>
            <li> It worked in less than 48 hours--no more lump, no more pimple, no more pain.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have applied Porter&#x27;s to about every kind of injury including a bad cut to our son&#x27;s hand.</li>
            <li> My family has been using this for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> Everything has healed faster when I put Porter&#x27;s Salve on it, minor cuts and abrasions.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We have sent Porter&#x27;s to Iraq and Afghanistan with our son and his buddies to take care of their minor scrapes and pains.</li>
            <li> I have been waiting so long to find it.</li>
            <li> The salve keeps forever and lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> she could not remember how long she had it</li>
            <li> so it lasts a long  time.</li>
            <li> I hope they continue to keep on manufacturing it for as long as I&#x27;m around and</li>
            <li> Last week I had a wrench slip and I pinched out the side of my little finger.</li>
            <li> It only takes a little bit</li>
            <li> It smells horrible but it works great.</li>
            <li> I chopped off the end on a finger a few years back.</li>
            <li> Actually does work how it was described by my vet - I&#x27;ve actually used it on cuts for myself as well - Fabulous - albeit a bit brutal in the olfactory dept.</li>
            <li> It takes the soreness out of cuts, big and small.</li>
            <li> As other have said; this stuff will work wonders.  </li>
            <li> My son had been bitten by a spider, developed a painful, large swelling from it.  </li>
            <li> and it took 30 miles for the smell to die down, half of which I rolled the windows down for.</li>
            <li> A serious spider-bite should always receive qualified medical attention, but in this case, for us, it worked.  </li>
            <li> My family has been using this at least as long ago as when my mom was a little girl 100 years ago.</li>
            <li> My mom used this on us when we were little, and I used it on my kids.</li>
            <li> My mom used it when I was a little girl</li>
            <li> If you have a sliver, put some Porter&#x27;s on a bandage, cover the spot and within a few days the sliver will be drawn out.</li>
            <li> and I always had to have mom send it to me in the past.</li>
            <li> For rashes, bug bites, small cuts.</li>
            <li> needed a small splinter removed from foot and used Porters to remove it.</li>
            <li> today you&#x27;d hardly know it ever happened.</li>
            <li> It is getting hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> (shrinks those suckers over night) and those slivers you just can&#x27;t get out.</li>
            <li> It is also a drawing salve, meaning if one of the kids, who are afraid of needles or tweezers, put a dab on a bandaid and the next day, gone, it literally draws out the sticker or whatever they have in there!  </li>
            <li> But yesterday I put some on the little spot that had been angry On my chin for at least a month.</li>
            <li> Horrible smell - like burning electrical wires, also not effective at all</li>
            <li> Ohhhh the horrible, terrible SMELL of it caused me to discard it same day.</li>
            <li> Porter&#x27;s Liniment was given to me by a friend&#x27;s mother when I was 20 and had a painful pimple in my ear.</li>
            <li> We have never been disappointed with this produce.</li>
            <li> Very painful.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with it!!!!</li>
            <li> The smell is just overpowering and nasty.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works great. I use it on my babies diaper rash and it heals it better and faster then diaper rash cream does! Two thumbs up!!!</li>
            <li> Having used Porter&#x27;s Salve since childhood and not being able to find it, when we spotted it on Amazon, it was a must have. This last a very long time and heals wounds. Our parents always had this in the medicine cabinet and so do we.</li>
            <li> This stuff is an oldie &amp; a goodie.  Some people never heard about it. Is good if u get a splinter and can&#x27;t get it out. Use this drawing save</li>
            <li> It is  really good stuff. I used alot of this when I was young.</li>
            <li> I used this product when I was a kid 50 years ago - it worked great then to relieve pain and heal cuts &amp; scrapes.  It still works just as well - its longevity says a lot about how effective it is.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to Porter&#x27;s Liniment Salve by my mother-in-law in the mid sixties and have used it ever since.  It heals diaper rash, heat rash, draws like the best drawing salve to heal spider bites and other insect bites.  It relieves pain in cuts and burns as well.  I am delighted to be able to get it by mail order as my local stores do not carry it and I always had to have mom send it to me in the past.</li>
            <li> My family has been using this for as long as I can remember. As a child I remember it being the only medicine my mom could come at me with that didn&#x27;t make me cringe. It doesn&#x27;t sting and is super effective. It is particularly effective on splinters but we use it on cuts, scraps and any sort of skin abrasions. Can&#x27;t say enough about this and so excited to find it online for purchase. My current tin I&#x27;ve had for almost 20 years.</li>
            <li> It is a great product !!!! Works !!!</li>
            <li> I have never written a review for a product until now, but I can&#x27;t rave enough about this salve.  My mother used it on my cuts, scrapes, burns, splinters. Her mother used it on her.  My aunts all use.  Our family has shared this well kept miracle worker for decades. Thank you Amazon for carrying.  Now I know where to send our newest recruits for more salve.</li>
            <li> My great grandfather sold this product door to door to augment his farm income and our family has used it ever since.</li>
            <li> My grandfather uses this salve and my dad uses it and the whole family pretty much does. As the title says, it pretty much works for just about everything. Not only cuts, scrapes and burns we&#x27;ve found it also works on pimples, and also smooths scars if applied long enough. So it is amazing what this salve will do.</li>
            <li> Porter&#x27;s salve is wonderful stuff!  It stops itching, cures diaper rash, and heals things better than just about anything else out there.</li>
            <li> this old time product has been in my family&#x27;s household for sixty years, we use it on itchy skin. I did not think it was even being sold.</li>
            <li> arrived fast works like a charm</li>
            <li> Porter&#x27;s Liniment was given to me by a friend&#x27;s mother when I was 20 and had a painful pimple in my ear. It worked in less than 48 hours--no more lump, no more pimple, no more pain. I still use it and highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> My family has been using Porter&#x27;s Salve since my grandmother was a girl. I always remember wanting it when I had a bug bit, a cut, scrape and especially a sliver. The smell of it is soothing to me. Everything has healed faster when I put Porter&#x27;s Salve on it, minor cuts and abrasions. I&#x27;ve turned several people onto it, including a friend of mine who is a vet and uses it on her children.     The tin I have presently I got from my great grandparents&#x27; home after they passed away, 15 years ago. It sat in a box for about 10 of those years and I recently found it, smelled it out by its distinct odor. I am starting to run out and have been hoarding it so that its only used when I really need it. I am so excited to see that I can get more of it, and especially on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My family has been using Porter&#x27;s salve for better than 50 years. My wife and I have applied Porter&#x27;s to about every kind of injury including a bad cut to our son&#x27;s hand. Today no scar and perfect use of his hand. I personally was using my table saw and accidentally got my finger into the blade about 1/4 inch or little better. Hurt like hell till I put salve and a bandage on it, today you can&#x27;t tell I ever cut that finger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have sent Porter&#x27;s to Iraq and Afghanistan with our son and his buddies to take care of their minor scrapes and pains. I just wish I owned the company.</li>
            <li> Porter&#x27;s is fantastic!  My father is a doctor and used it on me growing up, now it&#x27;s the only thing we use for scrapes, sunburn, abrasions, etc.  This stuff would probably even work great for a gunshot wound...lol, it&#x27;s that good!</li>
            <li> I received this quick. I have been waiting so long to find it. It works great on pimples, cuts.   The smell takes time getting used to but well worth it.</li>
            <li> We use this salve for everything in our house. It takes the soreness out of cuts, big and small. We also use it for diaper rash, and it works wonders! Highly recommend. The scent is a little strong, but the salve&#x27;s effectiveness makes the scent worth it!</li>
            <li> This slave is amazing and just what my Grandma always used.</li>
            <li> Awesome as I remember, liniment smell takes me back to childhood and works well.</li>
            <li> I used this ointment as a teenager for acne under my Dr&#x27;s recomendation. I&#x27;ve always had some in my medicine cabinet since. I chopped off the end on a finger a few years back. No skin left for stitches, so we packed it with Porter&#x27;s and today you&#x27;d hardly know it ever happened. Last week I had a wrench slip and I pinched out the side of my little finger. Bleed like heck. Been packin&#x27; it with Porters and it&#x27;s healing nicely. Strong smell, but it&#x27;s the smell of healing. You can&#x27;t go wrong with it!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this item in the past and just love it and was pleased with my purchase and would purchase from seller again.</li>
            <li> We have had Porter&#x27;s Salve in our medicine stock for a number of years.  When the doctor&#x27;s recommendation failed to produce results, back to the good old Porter&#x27;s.  It&#x27;s the best we have found for drawing infection and healing a wound.  Thanks to Amazon for making it easy to restock our supply.</li>
            <li> As other have said; this stuff will work wonders.  I have been bit several times by brown recluse spiders and this is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that fights the poison.  Six times over 5 years, and not a scar to show...&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for supplying a awesome product!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best salves I have ever used.  It seems to draw infection out of cuts overnight</li>
            <li> My grandfather used this when he suffered from burns from a fire and he healed quickly and no scaring. This is my go to for any blemish or any bug bites. works Great!</li>
            <li> This particular ad needs attention...it is deceiving because it appears as though the price is for 2 boxes (total 4 oz).  I wish I would have been more careful in reading the ENTIRE offer because I paid $10.99 for 1 box and I now see there are 2 boxes for $15.99!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have used this since childhood (now 60 yrs old)...absolutely love the product!!  Have passed it on to children and grandchildren.</li>
            <li> My mother&#x27;s a nurse and recommended this.  I&#x27;ve been using it ever since to combat minor cuts or scratches which have developed infections.  Of course, if one has a problem with their immune system or diabetes, for example, it is important to receive you doctors approval.  My son had been bitten by a spider, developed a painful, large swelling from it.  We put the salve on it and within hours, the swelling subsided.  A serious spider-bite should always receive qualified medical attention, but in this case, for us, it worked.  It is not an antibiotic cream and works more like I remember drawing salve is supposed to.  I will continue to have it in my medicine chest and use it.</li>
            <li> Since I have autoimmune issues I have problems with healing and issues with my skin I use zinc  cream Neosporin peroxide you name it I&#x27;ve tried it. Somehow I ran across this Porters salve And decided it&#x27;s worth a try they don&#x27;t advertise it they don&#x27;t even have a website where you can buy it you have to call or write and place order and send a check, It&#x27;s cheaper than buying it here lol ... Anyway I bought it I was using it I really didn&#x27;t notice the difference But yesterday I put some on the little spot that had been angry On my chin for at least a month. I was putting everything on it several times a day to no avail. I put some Savonna before I went to bed and I woke up and it was halfway healed Halfway! I&#x27;m a huge fan now.  I&#x27;m telling you give it a try There&#x27;s a reason why it&#x27;s been around all these years and they don&#x27;t advertise it because it works and word-of-mouth is all they need!</li>
            <li> Everyone in our extended family depends on Porters&#x27; Liniment Salve in the medicine chest. Now the 5th generation are beginning their homes with the salve as a staple item. It prevents infection from beginning in an open wound. It painlessly draws out splinters. It even heals bruises. It has a &#x27;good&#x27; smell, and to our family the smell is equated with healing. If anyone gets hurt, the first thing they head for are the bandages and the Porters&#x27; Liniment. It&#x27;s a major alarm if we run out, since our local drugstores no longer can order it.</li>
            <li> Its good..used it for my psoriasis..no change there but used for a burn and helped tremendously..would buy again</li>
            <li> I have used this salve all my life.  It is great for everything. I highly recommend it for everyone.  Great!</li>
            <li> best stuff ever for pulling out infection or possible infection</li>
            <li> My mom bought a tin of this before I was born and she still has it. We&#x27;re going on 32 years and 2 kids. I use it for almost anything. Works great on acne (shrinks those suckers over night) and those slivers you just can&#x27;t get out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care much for the odor of this salve but I&#x27;m very impressed with the results.  I have had a itchy rash on my lower leg for several months that was not responding well to treatments prescribed by a Dermatologist.  I discovered Porters Salve by accident and decided to try it.  After applying it for only 3 days there has been a drastic improvement.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> This liniment is a must have for every household.  Great on burns, cuts, and abrasions.  No it won&#x27;t take the pain away but it will help you heal better and faster.</li>
            <li> Grew up using this salve, and have given it to several friends - all of whom sooner or later call to rave about what a great job it does.  I put it on chapped lips at night and in the morning they are soft &amp; smooth.  Some people don&#x27;t care for the scent which can be overpowering, but the results more than make up for it.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with Porter&#x27;s Liniment and Salve.  Have looked for this product for years!!  Thank you for carrying this product.</li>
            <li> Actually does work how it was described by my vet - I&#x27;ve actually used it on cuts for myself as well - Fabulous - albeit a bit brutal in the olfactory dept.</li>
            <li> Arrived in good condition. We have used this ointment for years. For rashes, bug bites, small cuts. The smell is different but tolerable. This is good stuff. Highly recommend. Arrived quickly. It is getting hard to find in stores so we order on line.</li>
            <li> My family has been using this at least as long ago as when my mom was a little girl 100 years ago. My mom used this on us when we were little, and I used it on my kids. I agree, it&#x27;s unique smell is almost as comforting as the salve is.  Wonderful on dirty abrasions and splinters. The salve keeps forever and lasts a really long time. You won&#x27;t need to buy many tins during your lifetime. I loaned my tin to my niece when her daughter had a deep sliver of glass in her foot. It was the only thing that worked to pull the sliver out. So happy it is offered here. I am buying one for each of my daughters and all my neices and nephews so they can have it for their kids.</li>
            <li> we have always had it in the house, but as kids we called it \\&quot;Uncle Ed&#x27;s salve\\&quot;  since he worked there.  I can remember my mother putting it on her foot when she stepped on a board of nails and several went into her foot.  The foot healed so well the doctor had to do nothing.  It really works for blisters and bruises, dries the  blisters and takes away a lot of the color and soreness of bruises. The smell can be pretty strong but the results are really worth it.  Am so glad to know I can still get it since the local pharmacy that carried it has closed and the chain pharmacies don&#x27;t have it.</li>
            <li> Porter&#x27;s Liniment Salve has been around for years and that is because it works.  My grandparents used it for cuts ETC. on there cows on there farm, plus for there own cuts. It also helps draw out slivers you might get. My parents also used it for the same reasons. I have had it on hand for over 50 years while raising my family, and they are grown up and gone and my wife and i keep it in our home at all times. It also cures infections from cuts ETC.  I would recommend it to any one, thanks for asking.  Regards, Jim    [...]</li>
            <li> I had a tin of this from my father. He used to use it on any cut, abrasion or burn he even used it on livestock. This salve works wonders, heals wounds fast and prevents infection. My son recently burned his leg on an ATV muffler and used this, instead of antibiotic ointment. It healed in a week and seemed to help prevent scarring. Yes the odor is strong, but it works. I highly recommend Porter&#x27;s Liniment Salve.</li>
            <li> Been using this for over 25 years. It works for just about anything, cuts, burns, pimples, rashes, etc. It smells horrible but it works great.</li>
            <li> Love this salve, best there is and only get it through the Internet. Local drug stores don&#x27;t carry it.</li>
            <li> Really heals my dry cracked hands.</li>
            <li> This product is GREAT, and delivery was exceptional!!! I wasn&#x27;t sure it was going to be worth me even trying, but I am very impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> My family has used Porters Salve for years, my mother used it and my grandmother used it.  Now my adult kids use it on their kids.  We have never been disappointed with this produce.</li>
            <li> A 60-year-old can Of Porter Salve I&#x27;ve been using for cuts it really works good it heals like two days</li>
            <li> This is a great product ! Also great to use on painful boil&#x27;s, to draw out the infection.  works over night.  Last a lonnnnnggg ! time. Had a boil on the back of my neck. Very painful. went to mothers and asked if she still had some Porters Salve. The tin said 35 cents / 3 for a Dollar. she could not remember how long she had it but, the price should tell the story. almost gone. Took it home and applied on my boil and within 2 nights i was on the road to recovery. If it draws that much might even work on acne.   Went on line and ordered 2 cans. 1 to replace my Mothers, who is 85. Pass this on to your kids and friends. It WORKS !</li>
            <li> Best stuff on the market for cuts.  My experience with Porters: draws a splinter out, keeps from infections,    even works on a pimple.  GREATEST product ever!</li>
            <li> The product is great but the seller is not. The add makes you think you are getting 2 but you are getting just 1 I won&#x27;t buy from them again it&#x27;s better to go to porters Web site. Cheaper and you know exactly what you are getting</li>
            <li> just what we were looking for...but for some reason, because of the foto I guess, I thought I was ordering 2...which I had wanted. otherwise the product is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Ohhhh the horrible, terrible SMELL of it caused me to discard it same day. The smell is just overpowering and nasty.</li>
            <li> Great stuff for dry rough feet and hands, works better then any lotions I have found so far!&lt;br /&gt;Love this stuff! Smell not bad either.</li>
            <li> This salve has been in the family for yrs.&#x27;, great for a lot of different uses.</li>
            <li> This prouct is great for insect bites and for pimples that won&#x27;t go away. I have used it before and always had great luck with it.</li>
            <li> This is the best salve; I have used it for years.  It only takes a little bit so it lasts a long  time.</li>
            <li> Our family has been using this liniment for years. My grandmother swore by it and always used it and as we grew up we have always used it. The whole family keeps it on hand for everything, there is nothing any better out there.</li>
            <li> This salve is the best!  My mom used it when I was a little girl and I used it with my kids.  It takes away pain and fights infection for cuts, scrapes, you name it. If you have a sliver, put some Porter&#x27;s on a bandage, cover the spot and within a few days the sliver will be drawn out. It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> REMINDS ME OF MY GRANDMOTHER</li>
            <li> Love this product!!  Use for almost everything!  Bought years ago in Kentucky and them never could find it.  So glad got it!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for everything, bug bites , scratches , burns you name it. I will always have this in my medicine cabinet</li>
            <li> this product has been in my family for years. any insect bite or owey needs gma salve cures all ails</li>
            <li> First time to try this nice purchase</li>
            <li> This worked very well for a skin condition I had. It kind of smells for about 15 minutes after you put it on. This was recommended by my wife who grandparents used it for alot of things. Guess that means it has been around for a while. I have it on the shelf for the next issue.</li>
            <li> This product has been around forever, my grandmother used to call it man and beast salve, she would use it on her kids for things ranging from scrapes to bee stings and also on the farm animals if the had a cut or a sore.</li>
            <li> was told of product by a friend. needed a small splinter removed from foot and used Porters to remove it. The seller was prompt and was sent the day the order was placed.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest stuff ever made, I can never find it in stores.  My mother uses this stuff for everything, if you have a boo boo, splinter, acne, just about anything......this stuff is great, only negative thing is the smell, not awful just very distinctive.</li>
            <li> Same as it was 40 years ago. Heals stubborn owiees.</li>
            <li> Wonderful healing salve</li>
            <li> For as long as I can remember, Porter&#x27;s Liniment salve has been in our bathroom cabinet, going back to the 60&#x27;s, when I was born.  I remember that great smell, yes it has a strong mediciny smell, but my great grandmother used to put it on me for diaper rashes, and the tradition has continued on down thru the years in my family.  It is also a drawing salve, meaning if one of the kids, who are afraid of needles or tweezers, put a dab on a bandaid and the next day, gone, it literally draws out the sticker or whatever they have in there!  Porter&#x27;s is the best! I hope they continue to keep on manufacturing it for as long as I&#x27;m around and my kids and their kids!  Love this product!!!</li>
            <li> The very best .  Used for 73 years and do not use anything else.</li>
            <li> Wow! No home should be without this! One tin of it will last forever. And I got two of them!</li>
            <li> This is a fast working salve. Once you get past the smell you can expect the healing to happen, fast</li>
            <li> Yes, I like this salve.</li>
            <li> Horrible smell - like burning electrical wires, also not effective at all</li>
            <li> This product works amazingly well. Normally I use Neosporin when I get home after a day of working with my hands, but I tried this and I got to say I love it. It doesn&#x27;t turn your hands into a soft skin which will get torn up the next day like some products. The one drawback is it smells pretty strong, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it right before you go on a road trip. I say this confidently because I did just that and it took 30 miles for the smell to die down, half of which I rolled the windows down for.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find this salve on Amazon. My grandparents and my parents bought this years ago, and when I was a child, my mom used to apply this to my chapped lips or chapped hands. Not only does it hold nostalgic value to me, it is an awesome product. It still works!</li>
            <li> Best Salve we  have ever used for Dry Winter Cracks, rough heels, scrapes, burns, mosquito bites etc.</li>
