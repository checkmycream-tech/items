            <li>love,  it is a really fantastic fragrance</li>
            <li>Perfume is good, well packaged, I just didn&#x27;t like the scent as much as I thought I would.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not to strong</li>
            <li>This is my favorite scent, not too sweet but not too &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I love the sweet smell of this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I bought the 3oz, and it came in a beautifully boxed gift set that included lotion that she now uses daily in addition to the perfume!</li>
            <li>why one reviewer said that it was diluted - it is totally fine.  </li>
            <li>Not too strong or feminine; it has a clean smell to it.  </li>
            <li>that too so cheap (as compared to the departmental stores)</li>
            <li>I love many of Versace&#x27;s perfume but this one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>and I am constantly getting complements on how great I smell.</li>
            <li>People are constantly asking me what I&#x27;m wearing and saying it smells great.</li>
            <li>Light citrus.</li>
            <li>The fragrance has light musk and floral scent.</li>
            <li>was such a great price for this perfume.</li>
            <li>light and clean.</li>
            <li>My new favorite scent!</li>
            <li>The item I received was exactly what I ordered plus more</li>
            <li>IMO if you are buying perfume through Amazon, you are already familiar with and like the fragrance, just looking for a deal.</li>
            <li>Well worth the purchase!</li>
            <li>I get many compliments about this perfume, but I like the Bright Crystal (pink)</li>
            <li>This is a light, fresh, lemony scent.</li>
            <li>This is the real stuff, and so much more inexpensive than at the department store.  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s so much cheaper on Amazon than in a department store.</li>
            <li>Wife loves it as do I.  Sweet citrus smell but not overpowering like some perfumes.  </li>
            <li>I say buy it if you like the way it smells price not bad.</li>
            <li>so I have to spray more than normal use.</li>
            <li>My new absolute favorite !</li>
            <li>I loved it then and this bottle is exactly the same size and scent.</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite in the whole Versace line!</li>
            <li>It smells so amazing that my daughter tried to trade me her Jimmy Choo for my Versace Yellow Diamonds....</li>
            <li>It is totally worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Prompt delivery, free shipping, my favorite fragrance at an incredibly low price....</li>
            <li>Fresh.</li>
            <li>so it is very large....</li>
            <li>Great as Usual...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a light, classy smell to it!</li>
            <li>Was a gift, but It arrived fast, thanks!!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t last more than a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than anywhere else!  </li>
            <li>I ordered it here because the price at stores was much higher.</li>
            <li>The scent is lovely, but it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>Thanks...!</li>
            <li>Love this colonge, it came broken but the new bottle arrived quickly and I was very pleased.</li>
            <li>Clean - not heavy.</li>
            <li>I love Versace perfume and have wanted a bottle for a long time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again, this is my new top of the list perfume...</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>thanks amazon....</li>
            <li>This product has everything I expected and more</li>
            <li>The crystal pink one is much better.</li>
            <li>She is always getting asked what scent she&#x27;s wearing because it&#x27;s very noticeable without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>Great buy that should last a long time since you only need two or three spritzes max!</li>
            <li>I can verify that this particular listing is indeed the real thing, not a knock off.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a birthday present for my sister who has been in love with this scent since she got a sample from Sephora way back.</li>
            <li>While the fragrance is lovely, the perfume isn&#x27;t as long lasting as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>It smells slightly different, but definitely complimentary.</li>
            <li>My everyday perfume, I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>this one is sweet and less strong but it lasts so long .and</li>
            <li>I received the product as new and to my surprise I got a travel pack that means a 3 oz bottle plus a 3.4 oz body lotion though it was not mentioned in the order that I placed.  </li>
            <li>It is one of my new favorites.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth looking at all the options when there are multiple offers and compare the reviews based on purity of fragrance.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually stray from my normal perfumes, so I went out on a LB and was pleasantly surprised:)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Just head&#x27;s up, if you have sensitive skin -- the lotion will wreck your day.</li>
            <li>This IS the real thing (NOT a knockoff) and less than half the price of the  same size bottle sold in most stores.  </li>
            <li>Not too strong or too weak</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Was a gift, but It arrived fast, thanks!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last more than a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than anywhere else!  </li>
            <li> I ordered it here because the price at stores was much higher.</li>
            <li> The scent is lovely, but it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> Thanks...!</li>
            <li> Love this colonge, it came broken but the new bottle arrived quickly and I was very pleased.</li>
            <li> Clean - not heavy.</li>
            <li> I love Versace perfume and have wanted a bottle for a long time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again, this is my new top of the list perfume...</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> thanks amazon....</li>
            <li> This product has everything I expected and more</li>
            <li> The crystal pink one is much better.</li>
            <li> She is always getting asked what scent she&#x27;s wearing because it&#x27;s very noticeable without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> Great buy that should last a long time since you only need two or three spritzes max!</li>
            <li> I can verify that this particular listing is indeed the real thing, not a knock off.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a birthday present for my sister who has been in love with this scent since she got a sample from Sephora way back.</li>
            <li> While the fragrance is lovely, the perfume isn&#x27;t as long lasting as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> It smells slightly different, but definitely complimentary.</li>
            <li> My everyday perfume, I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> this one is sweet and less strong but it lasts so long .and</li>
            <li> I received the product as new and to my surprise I got a travel pack that means a 3 oz bottle plus a 3.4 oz body lotion though it was not mentioned in the order that I placed.  </li>
            <li> It is one of my new favorites.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth looking at all the options when there are multiple offers and compare the reviews based on purity of fragrance.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually stray from my normal perfumes, so I went out on a LB and was pleasantly surprised:)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Just head&#x27;s up, if you have sensitive skin -- the lotion will wreck your day.</li>
            <li> This IS the real thing (NOT a knockoff) and less than half the price of the  same size bottle sold in most stores.  </li>
            <li> Not too strong or too weak</li>
            <li> Iam little allergic to strong smell of the perfume(it makes me breathe hard)..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lasting but not loud</li>
            <li> but it last a long time.  </li>
            <li> It smells just like the ones at store and last long.</li>
            <li> it is my new everyday wear</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t last very long though</li>
            <li> Wife loves it and said it stays on all day long, plus gets compliments almost every time when out!</li>
            <li> Lasts all day long!</li>
            <li> Love the perfume, I was a little skeptical about buying it online, but it&#x27;s just like the store bought</li>
            <li> It lasts a very long time......</li>
            <li> not real .</li>
            <li> and I got in the time frame expected.  </li>
            <li> I have received about 5 compliments after only having it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> As an added bonus I also received a body lotion ( which wasn&#x27;t included in the product description, but hey, I&#x27;m certainly not complaining).  </li>
            <li> I have other versace perfumes.</li>
            <li> It was half the price on Amazon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> but it does not last long on me :(</li>
            <li> I bought it for myself, but end up blessing someone else with it because she never experienced Versace...</li>
            <li> its the fake one very disappointed</li>
            <li> Buy it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

            <li> Heavenly Scent.  I get compliments every time I wear it.</li>
            <li> This is a light, fresh, lemony scent. Clean - not heavy. The bottle is outstanding too!&lt;br /&gt;Shipment came as promised and the price was fab.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy.&lt;br /&gt;Cindy from CA</li>
            <li> Fast delivery,  authentic and smells amazing! Would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> My new favorite scent! Lasts all day long! A way better deal buying it on Amazon compared to any of the beauty or department stores that carry this perfume!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume! Plus it was the best deal I could find!</li>
            <li> Great as Usual...Product sells itself!!</li>
            <li> Perfume is good, well packaged, I just didn&#x27;t like the scent as much as I thought I would.</li>
            <li> Not too strong or feminine; it has a clean smell to it.  The scent doesn&#x27;t last very long though so I have to spray more than normal use.</li>
            <li> not real . its the fake one very disappointed</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on this cologne. It is totally worth the money.  I will buy it again. Thanks</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this perfume on board a cruise ship. I loved it then and this bottle is exactly the same size and scent. It arrived fast and beautifully packaged.Price was VERY good.</li>
            <li> Excellent service! Love the perfume, I was a little skeptical about buying it online, but it&#x27;s just like the store bought and it comes with a body lotion. I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again, this is my new top of the list perfume...</li>
            <li> This is the real stuff, and so much more inexpensive than at the department store.  I have received several compliments on it, too.  Great buy!</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than anywhere else!  I&#x27;m not sure why one reviewer said that it was diluted - it is totally fine.  The shrink-wrapping seems legit too.  I&#x27;d vouch this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just head&#x27;s up, if you have sensitive skin -- the lotion will wreck your day.</li>
            <li> I had been searching for a great new perfume and this fits perfectly. Not too strong or too weak I really love it.</li>
            <li> Smells great.  I always get tons of compliments.  I&#x27;ve purchased several for gifts.</li>
            <li> Nice light lemony, citrusy fragrance.......  Not so overpowering..... Though my taste is more sweeter and floral still I like this fragrance..... I received the product as new and to my surprise I got a travel pack that means a 3 oz bottle plus a 3.4 oz body lotion though it was not mentioned in the order that I placed.  (Don&#x27;t know whether everyone is getting that) So I was thrilled to get that for the price of one....that too so cheap (as compared to the departmental stores) :) thanks amazon....</li>
            <li> The box came wrapped in it&#x27;s plastic and I had no idea it came with a lotion that&#x27;s scented the same! Love the smell and love the lotion!</li>
            <li> Great Product I will recommended to my friends I will purchase it again. This product has everything I expected and more</li>
            <li> Omg i smelled this perfume on my aunt i was like ok have to have it. I have other versace perfumes. Omg omg this one.smells so good it last on me for hrs even the next day i can still smell it on my clothes. My bf love it. I say buy it if you like the way it smells price not bad.</li>
            <li> Smelled amazingly good..........but is not too strong....I like to spray myself once a day...This I have to spray twice sometimes 3 times...It smells so good, but doesn&#x27;t have staying power.....The bottle is 3 ounces so it is very large....</li>
            <li> I dearly love this fragrance it&#x27;s light yet stays with you,  love all the floral notes to it as well. I have gotten so many complements on it as well. I&#x27;m a happy happy lady!!</li>
            <li> I was looking for something refreshing for the summer.  The reviews said it had a lemony note to it but I couldn&#x27;t smell it.  Seems to have a very generic smell, like something you&#x27;d pick up at a drug store.  The crystal pink one is much better.</li>
            <li> I love many of Versace&#x27;s perfume but this one is by far my favorite. I love that it&#x27;s so much cheaper on Amazon than in a department store. I think it&#x27;s about 1/2 the price! It has become my signature scent and I am constantly getting complements on how great I smell. That&#x27;s always nice to hear! :)</li>
            <li> I like it a lot.. I don&#x27;t usually stray from my normal perfumes, so I went out on a LB and was pleasantly surprised:)</li>
            <li> Great price &amp; prompt service. While the fragrance is lovely, the perfume isn&#x27;t as long lasting as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of the perfume for Christmas. When I opened it to smell it, I fell in love! The smell is beautiful! It&#x27;s lasting but not loud and it smells amazing!  It smells so amazing that my daughter tried to trade me her Jimmy Choo for my Versace Yellow Diamonds.... NOT!!! Buy it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The item arrived promptly and met my expectations.</li>
            <li> Delivery came before estimated time! Wowie-Wow-Wow! Fragrance is beautiful!</li>
            <li> I always get compliments when I wear Versace Yellow Diamond.  The value was great!</li>
            <li> It is a very good fragrance. It lasts a very long time......&lt;br /&gt;I love,  it is a really fantastic fragrance</li>
            <li> Amazing product, came in box in great condition!</li>
            <li> I love the way this perfume smells.  It&#x27;s not to strong but it last a long time.  The item I received was exactly what I ordered plus more and I got in the time frame expected.  I am very happy I purchased this!</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments for this fragrance and Amazon has it for a great price.</li>
            <li> Love this colonge, it came broken but the new bottle arrived quickly and I was very pleased. Thanks for a great job.</li>
            <li> Was a gift, but It arrived fast, thanks!!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves it!! He won&#x27;t keep his hands off of me. Great gift idea for any occasion. 5 star:)</li>
            <li> Best bargain of the year! This IS the real thing (NOT a knockoff) and less than half the price of the  same size bottle sold in most stores.  As an added bonus I also received a body lotion ( which wasn&#x27;t included in the product description, but hey, I&#x27;m certainly not complaining).  This is my favorite scent, not too sweet but not too &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34;. Total strangers have stopped to ask what fragrance I&#x27;m wearing.  Prompt delivery, free shipping, my favorite fragrance at an incredibly low price....what more can a gal ask for?</li>
            <li> I love this scent it is my new everyday wear and I get compliments on it from my colleagues in the office.</li>
            <li> I am writing and rating this on the assumption that one already knows how wonderful this smells. I will never understand people who wing it and then review based on that it wasn&#x27;t for them. IMO if you are buying perfume through Amazon, you are already familiar with and like the fragrance, just looking for a deal. I can verify that this particular listing is indeed the real thing, not a knock off. Yellow Diamond is listed elsewhere on Amazon, and is sold/fulfilled by Amazon, and those have questionable reviews as to whether it was authentic or not. It&#x27;s worth looking at all the options when there are multiple offers and compare the reviews based on purity of fragrance.</li>
            <li> I bought this after smelling it at an airport gift shoppe. It was half the price on Amazon and I love it. I have received about 5 compliments after only having it for a few weeks. It&#x27;s got a light, classy smell to it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume!! Iam little allergic to strong smell of the perfume(it makes me breathe hard).. this one is sweet and less strong but it lasts so long .and you can feel the amazing breeze of the perfume.So I would recommend to purchase this product and hey wait for lot of compliments!! :)</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. It is one of my new favorites. Versace has the best smelling perfumes. Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I ordered it here because the price at stores was much higher. It smells just like the ones at store and last long. I also recieved it with in days of ordering it. I extremely happy with this purchased and will purchase here again.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite. It has such a wonderful scent.</li>
            <li> I get many compliments about this perfume, but I like the Bright Crystal (pink) Versace much better.</li>
            <li> My new absolute favorite ! People are constantly asking me what I&#x27;m wearing and saying it smells great. It is especially good smelling even hours later.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it as do I.  Sweet citrus smell but not overpowering like some perfumes.  Great gift at a great price.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Wife loved it, I&#x27;ll be buying more</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite fragrances.  I get so many compliments when I wear this.  I love the sweet smell of this fragrance.  I recommend this to every woman.  This needs to be in your perfume collection</li>
            <li> I bought this as a birthday present for my sister who has been in love with this scent since she got a sample from Sephora way back. I bought the 3oz, and it came in a beautifully boxed gift set that included lotion that she now uses daily in addition to the perfume! It smells slightly different, but definitely complimentary. She is always getting asked what scent she&#x27;s wearing because it&#x27;s very noticeable without being overpowering. Great buy that should last a long time since you only need two or three spritzes max!</li>
            <li> Fresh. light and clean. Light citrus. My everyday perfume, I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I bought this nice fragrance for mom...she loved it, her first time using Versace. The fragrance has light musk and floral scent.</li>
            <li> The scent is lovely, but it doesn&#x27;t last. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Great price and the perfume was shipped quickly! I love Versace perfume and have wanted a bottle for a long time but I&#x27;ve always thought it was a bit too pricey. Amazon prime gave me a deep discount, making it affordable.</li>
            <li> This smells absolutely wonderful!  I bought it for myself, but end up blessing someone else with it because she never experienced Versace...it was her time, lol!  It arrived in perfect condition!  Thanks...!</li>
            <li> My wife loves the perfume and loves the smell.&lt;br /&gt;It was such a great price for this perfume. And it smells good</li>
            <li> Great price, great product, fast shipment, will shop again, thank you!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and it is such a great price on amazon!</li>
            <li> Everything came as promised</li>
            <li> Was kinda nervous when I got it and it had the lotion. I thought I was getting a smaller bottle but it turned out to just be a bouns</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite in the whole Versace line! Well worth the purchase! I always get compliments in this one!!</li>
            <li> I think this is a tester fades real quick</li>
            <li> it smells good,  but i  wish the scent lasted longer.great parfum though</li>
            <li> I LOVE the smell of this!  One of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I love the price and it smells amazing I get compliments all the time</li>
            <li> My Girl loves this perfume. It Smells really nice</li>
