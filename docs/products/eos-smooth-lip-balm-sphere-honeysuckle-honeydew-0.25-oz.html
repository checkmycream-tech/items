            <li>I LOVE this lip balm!!!  </li>
            <li>product and very good.</li>
            <li>but the formula of this chapstick is great, it absorbs into your lips perfectly after about a minute.</li>
            <li>I got one as a promo at work and we loved it!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like paying 3 bucks for something that doesn&#x27;t do that great when it comes to lip balm</li>
            <li>Great, It was all like I was expecting, just like The image and description.</li>
            <li>The texture is perfect it smoothes on so nicely</li>

            <li>and i never felt so good for my lips before.</li>
            <li>and it stays on for a good 2 hours.</li>
            <li>The balm is 95% organic, petrolatum &amp; paraben free, 100% nature, shea butter, jojoba oil helps your lips moisturized, and Vitamin E to keep your skin healthy through antioxidation, and, best of all, a great price.  </li>

            <li>This product is really nourishing and makes my lips feel wonderful!</li>
            <li>And I guess I lost my own bet in a win-win situation.</li>
            <li>we&#x27;re loving</li>
            <li>What a pleasant surprise, I immediately fell in love with this new best friend of mine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely sold on this lip balm I love it!!!!!</li>
            <li>THE GOOD: The EOS sphere lip balm applies smoothly.</li>
            <li>the price I just think you could find something better.</li>
            <li>My all time favorite is Rosebud Salve (either the Strawberry or the Brambleberry).  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this balm.</li>
            <li>The sphere packaging is just OK.</li>
            <li>It was just OK.</li>
            <li>(Maybe that&#x27;s what compels you to apply more.)</li>
            <li>but I still like the noisily texture of rosebud salve better.</li>
            <li>Which means a lot, if you know how many bags I have</li>
            <li>Over all, I love it.</li>
            <li>:) I would like to buy it again.</li>
            <li>I was hesitated when choosing this pack of 8, but honey suckle smells better.</li>
            <li>I though why not give EOS more a try</li>
            <li>I love the feel of this stuff on my lips; nothing else comes close.  </li>
            <li>This honeysuckle honeydew flavor is my favorite and love</li>
            <li>It smelled nice and the shape of the packaging was cool.  </li>
            <li>The flavor is pleasant but not overpowering, and certainly does not smell chemical/artificial.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re excellent for dry lips.</li>
            <li>Cute &#x3D; Cheap.</li>
            <li>Her coworkers loved it so much, she is buying them again this year.</li>
            <li>Great shape -- so fun to play with -- and works really well, too.</li>
            <li>easy.</li>
            <li>, I know, I&#x27;m cheap, but I go through this stuff like hotcakes, so</li>
            <li>This absolutely fit the bill.</li>
            <li>I checked with a doctor who confirmed that it wasn&#x27;t herpes or anything like that</li>
            <li>they have a package of 8 available</li>
            <li>Easy grab, easy drop, worry free, thanks to the genius idea of twist off top, as I have had plenty of click on/click off cap disaster stories.</li>
            <li>The EOS balms are very moisturizing and have pretty good staying power.</li>
            <li>I saw this at the checkout at Ulta and after the first use fell in love.</li>
            <li>It looks cute, feel good, softens my lips with a little shine, smells sweet to use all year around and has healthy ingredients.</li>
            <li>The honeysuckle honeydew scent is light and sweet and the sphere container is so fun to use.</li>
            <li>Everyone loved them, and I will probably do that for a future event.</li>
            <li>Sweet Mint, Summer Fruit, Lemon drop and Strawberry Sorbet.</li>
            <li>They arrived ok and the shipping was fast</li>
            <li>I will most definitely purchase this again, but with a pack of 8, it might be awhile :)</li>
            <li>may, in fact, but my new favorite.  </li>
            <li>The scent is light &amp; really smells like honeydew.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try EOS because they use all natural ingredients and certified organic extracts, which has been very important to me since I learned how much lip balm women end up eating over their lifespan.</li>
            <li>also the feel on my lips is nice and soft, not waxy like some other balms, also the taste is really nice.</li>
            <li>This sweetly flavored lip gloss comes in a delightful little circular dispenser, that twists open.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say how the longevity of the product is, but I can say how it feels right at this moment.  </li>
            <li>and I could feel the moisture right away</li>
            <li>Yes, you read it right, GAMBLING.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of lip balms and initially fell in love with these, so much so that I purchased an 8 pack.</li>
            <li>The true benefits of this lip balm is that, it is not only feels good, but the whole package is good, at least to me it is.</li>
            <li>Pretty right on for Honeysuckle Honeydew.  </li>
            <li>Still, I would certainly recommend this!</li>
            <li>, it smells like a light melony scent not an overwhelming smell like all of the other EOS lip balms.</li>
            <li>The presentation is adorable and the flavors are great, HOWEVER-- within a few weeks of using these, I noticed that my lips were much dryer than usual, and I was applying lip balm many times a day.</li>
            <li>Like most of the girls out there, I have plenty of lip balms for me at home, so clearly I did not first purchase this because the function of the balm, but for simple facts - I picked it up because it looked attractive to me</li>
            <li>I got an EOS lip balm of honey drop earlier and love it very much.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s pretty amazing, as they&#x27;re not very keen on lip balms.</li>
            <li>Most definitely.</li>
            <li>, I purchased it because it is 95% organic, and I tried for the first time because I was gambling.</li>
            <li>She was looking for something useful, but reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>so I brought Honeysuckle Honeydew for the first time and thank goodness</li>
            <li>The first time I just stopped using it</li>
            <li>I bought this because I absolutely love other Eos balms, and prefer more natural lip-balm to Chapstick.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s sweet, but not that sweet as the red one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty much a lip balm snob.  </li>
            <li>Not only is it organic but the shape makes it easy to find when your fishing around in your purse one handed.</li>
            <li>Love enough to almost eat it, but if I some how accidently do eat it one day, at least I know it is 100% nature and safe to use when I am pregnant.   </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s waxy enough to stay put when drinking and light eating (it doesn&#x27;t leave too much residue on the cup or straw).  </li>
            <li>The taste is really YUMMY</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li>hahaha</li>
            <li>I have noticed a difference in  my lips since I&#x27;ve been using it there much much softer and healthier.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing.   </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this lip balm.</li>
            <li>I also love that it&#x27;s organic and uses natural flavoring extracts and such...</li>
            <li>So fresh, soft and smooth, not like my other lip products, it does not feel sticky to me at all.</li>
            <li>I have been using rosebud salve for a while ans decide to try other brand lip smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally unique, so luckily my older sister bought me one (actually two, at different times).</li>
            <li>From the photos you can tell that the bottom is flat and there is a helpful finger grip on the side for easy twist on/twist off when my fingers are too cold in the winter to get a good grip.  </li>
            <li>A cute little round circle instead of a cylindrical, where you do not have to touch your finger to your lips (for those who can be a bit of a germophobe, like myself), and a product that smells so sweet.</li>
            <li>I am a fan of natural and organic products.</li>
            <li>By chance, I switched to another lip balm and the problem has completely gone away.  </li>
            <li>You do kind of get addicted to it though...</li>
            <li>My lips were pretty dry when I applied it</li>
            <li>Compared to most other beeswax lip balms, this brand is a little waxy.</li>
            <li>I feel and can&#x27;t really penetrate into your lips to give you that long lasting moisture.</li>
            <li>Do my lips feel soft following the application?</li>
            <li>I love the idea behind this lipgloss and it&#x27;s packaging.</li>
            <li>I live in Sacramento and the weather is not even that dry.  </li>
            <li>The subtle smell of sweet melon is an added bonus.  </li>
            <li>After trying so many other lip balms, chapsticks and other remedies to get my lips softer and less chapped and dry, this was the answer.</li>

            <li> After trying so many other lip balms, chapsticks and other remedies to get my lips softer and less chapped and dry, this was the answer.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, be careful with these, and at least try one before committing to a whole set!</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t like to use balm containing parabens, petroleum, or artificial colors because I use so much of it, especially during the winter, and want to minimize chemical intake.   </li>

            <li> I love the idea behind this lipgloss and it&#x27;s packaging. I also love that it&#x27;s organic and uses natural flavoring extracts and such... But on the side if actually having long lasting softness of lips and moisture, it leaves a little to be desired. It is a little too thick I feel and can&#x27;t really penetrate into your lips to give you that long lasting moisture. I find myself having to apply and reapply bc my lips just stay chapped!&lt;br /&gt;For the price I just think you could find something better.</li>
            <li> This sweetly flavored lip gloss comes in a delightful little circular dispenser, that twists open. Inside, is a glorious little orb of jojoba, emollient goodness. Does it taste like honeysuckle/honeydew (like the name implies)? Yes, it does. Do my lips feel soft following the application? Most definitely. Would I buy this product again? For sure!  Do not let its avant garde spherical appearance throw you. This is a great product! Try something different and try something Eos.</li>
            <li> I saw this at the checkout at Ulta and after the first use fell in love. I knew it would be cheaper on amazon and I have to say this 8 pack is a fab deal!! Especially the subscribe and save option!!!  rea  The scent is light &amp; really smells like honeydew. The taste is really YUMMY and I am thankful it is organic or I&#x27;d be worried about the amount I consume.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty much a lip balm snob.  I&#x27;ve used tons of brands, tons of flavors.  My all time favorite is Rosebud Salve (either the Strawberry or the Brambleberry).  At 6-9 bucks a pot, it seems expensive until you realize it lasts forever.  Eos Lip Balm may, in fact, but my new favorite.  I just received it today, so I can&#x27;t say how the longevity of the product is, but I can say how it feels right at this moment.  It&#x27;s waxy enough to stay put when drinking and light eating (it doesn&#x27;t leave too much residue on the cup or straw).  I can feel the moisture.  My lips were pretty dry when I applied it and I could feel the moisture right away (the Rosebud Salve doesn&#x27;t always sooth immediately).  It&#x27;s not so waxy either.  It&#x27;s that perfect in between that most people are looking for.  The scent it light, but wonderful.  Very subtle flavor too.  Pretty right on for Honeysuckle Honeydew.  I will most definitely purchase this again, but with a pack of 8, it might be awhile :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE this balm. Not only is it organic but the shape makes it easy to find when your fishing around in your purse one handed. also the feel on my lips is nice and soft, not waxy like some other balms, also the taste is really nice.</li>
            <li> I went to try this after having a horrible experience with the Summerfruit. This smells AWESOME. I think it might be a tad bit too waxy as I find myself applying layer after layer, but when I do get it, it feels just a little less than my chapstick, but it lasts a lot longer. I don&#x27;t like paying 3 bucks for something that doesn&#x27;t do that great when it comes to lip balm, I know, I&#x27;m cheap, but I go through this stuff like hotcakes, so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m buying it again, but smells good. Smells good.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of natural and organic products. When I first got the lip balm I was very happy. It smelled nice and the shape of the packaging was cool.  I would give the lip product itself alone a 4star. I got it last spring and it worked well throughout spring/summer/early winter. However, when winter hit, I could not longer use this lip product. I live in Sacramento and the weather is not even that dry.  The sphere packaging is just OK. It does not allow you to use up all the content. I know a lot of girls don&#x27;t finish their lip gloss/lip balm but I do not like to waste any product. Once you use up 80% it becomes impossible to apply on the lips unless you use your finger. It is also hard to use your finger since the product texture is more on the hard side. I would not buy an 8 pack unless you have other people to split it with.  Bottom line, nothing impressive. It was just OK. I will not buy again unless they improve the packaging to allow me to use up the entire content.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s addictive! I have another in Summer Fruit, but it doesn&#x27;t compare to the honeysuckle. The EOS balms are very moisturizing and have pretty good staying power. They&#x27;re excellent for dry lips. Compared to most other beeswax lip balms, this brand is a little waxy. (Maybe that&#x27;s what compels you to apply more.) It coats the lips but doesn&#x27;t seem to fully absorb. For me, however, the honeysuckle is so divine I really don&#x27;t care. My sons (7 &amp; 10) love it, too! That&#x27;s pretty amazing, as they&#x27;re not very keen on lip balms. It&#x27;s a winner!</li>
            <li> I have been using rosebud salve for a while ans decide to try other brand lip smooth. but I still like the noisily texture of rosebud salve better.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try EOS because they use all natural ingredients and certified organic extracts, which has been very important to me since I learned how much lip balm women end up eating over their lifespan. I was VERY impressed when I first tried the product. The honeysuckle honeydew scent is light and sweet and the sphere container is so fun to use. This product is really nourishing and makes my lips feel wonderful! I definitely recommend this flavor.</li>
            <li> I honestly hate the shape of this thing. I find it inconvenient and I don&#x27;t like the smell hahaha but the formula of this chapstick is great, it absorbs into your lips perfectly after about a minute. You do kind of get addicted to it though...</li>
            <li> Like most of the girls out there, I have plenty of lip balms for me at home, so clearly I did not first purchase this because the function of the balm, but for simple facts - I picked it up because it looked attractive to me, I purchased it because it is 95% organic, and I tried for the first time because I was gambling. Yes, you read it right, GAMBLING. From my past experiences Cute &#x3D; Cheap. And I guess I lost my own bet in a win-win situation. That even sounds weird to me.  It all started when the moment it touched my lips. So fresh, soft and smooth, not like my other lip products, it does not feel sticky to me at all. What a pleasant surprise, I immediately fell in love with this new best friend of mine. With sparkles in my eyes knowing what to do next! Check on Amazon, one for each bag of mine. Which means a lot, if you know how many bags I have - I am a Bag-a-holic!  The true benefits of this lip balm is that, it is not only feels good, but the whole package is good, at least to me it is. It looks cute, feel good, softens my lips with a little shine, smells sweet to use all year around and has healthy ingredients. The balm is 95% organic, petrolatum &amp; paraben free, 100% nature, shea butter, jojoba oil helps your lips moisturized, and Vitamin E to keep your skin healthy through antioxidation, and, best of all, a great price.  I keep this little thing close to me everywhere I go. Easy grab, easy drop, worry free, thanks to the genius idea of twist off top, as I have had plenty of click on/click off cap disaster stories. It sits nicely next to me when I am studying. From the photos you can tell that the bottom is flat and there is a helpful finger grip on the side for easy twist on/twist off when my fingers are too cold in the winter to get a good grip.  Over all, I love it. Love enough to almost eat it, but if I some how accidently do eat it one day, at least I know it is 100% nature and safe to use when I am pregnant.   As my mummy always tells me, don&#x27;t alwaysjust assume something, even if you think you won&#x27;t like it. Try it out at least so you know why you don&#x27;t like it. I am glad I tried this one, which proved me wrong.</li>
            <li> I got one as a promo at work and we loved it! Great shape -- so fun to play with -- and works really well, too. I passed these out (these and the red ones) as favors for my Holiday Tea last year. Everyone loved them, and I will probably do that for a future event.</li>
            <li> product and very good. recommend this product .. excellent&lt;br /&gt;packaging easy. for practical use. performs miracles.&lt;br /&gt;toos use here at home. we&#x27;re loving</li>
            <li> Great, It was all like I was expecting, just like The image and description. :) I would like to buy it again.</li>
            <li> very nice packaging love it smell</li>
            <li> I got an EOS lip balm of honey drop earlier and love it very much.  I was hesitated when choosing this pack of 8, but honey suckle smells better. it&#x27;s sweet, but not that sweet as the red one. and i never felt so good for my lips before.</li>
            <li> My sister bought these last year for her coworkers. She was looking for something useful, but reasonably priced. Her coworkers loved it so much, she is buying them again this year.</li>
            <li> Honeysuckle Honeydew is the only EOS lip balm I like. I&#x27;ve tried: Sweet Mint, Summer Fruit, Lemon drop and Strawberry Sorbet. None of them impressed me. The next time I went to Walgreens I though why not give EOS more a try so I brought Honeysuckle Honeydew for the first time and thank goodness I did I LOVE this lip balm!!!  The texture is perfect it smoothes on so nicely and it stays on for a good 2 hours. I have noticed a difference in  my lips since I&#x27;ve been using it there much much softer and healthier. The smell it perfect, it smells like a light melony scent not an overwhelming smell like all of the other EOS lip balms. I&#x27;m completely sold on this lip balm I love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I absolutely love other Eos balms, and prefer more natural lip-balm to Chapstick. I don&#x27;t like to use balm containing parabens, petroleum, or artificial colors because I use so much of it, especially during the winter, and want to minimize chemical intake.   This absolutely fit the bill. The flavor is pleasant but not overpowering, and certainly does not smell chemical/artificial. It glides on well, and stays put. It&#x27;s very moisturizing.   The only downside is its shape. While it&#x27;s cute and different, it is somewhat inconvenient for pockets. Still, I would certainly recommend this!</li>
            <li> They arrived ok and the shipping was fast but u only recieved 7 of them :(</li>
            <li> After trying so many other lip balms, chapsticks and other remedies to get my lips softer and less chapped and dry, this was the answer. It stays on a long time as well so you dont find yourself reaching for it every 30 min. Really love this product!</li>
            <li> THE GOOD: The EOS sphere lip balm applies smoothly. The subtle smell of sweet melon is an added bonus.  THE BAD: Over the last year the corners of my lips would often become red, cracked and sore, occurring about once a month and lasting for about a week at a time. I had never experienced this before in my life and now it keeps occurring. I checked with a doctor who confirmed that it wasn&#x27;t herpes or anything like that but likely a presence of bacteria. By chance, I switched to another lip balm and the problem has completely gone away.  TL;DR: This lip balm gave me herpes-like sores in the corners of my lips.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of lip balms and initially fell in love with these, so much so that I purchased an 8 pack. The presentation is adorable and the flavors are great, HOWEVER-- within a few weeks of using these, I noticed that my lips were much dryer than usual, and I was applying lip balm many times a day. Then, I developed small pimples at my lip line, that ultimately spread around my lip line and became extremely painful. After exploring online, other people have had the same reaction. If you have sensitive skin, be careful with these, and at least try one before committing to a whole set! I wish I had known this might happen before I purchased.</li>
            <li> I ran into Walgreens looking for my usual brand of lip gloss but settled for trying this one when I couldn&#x27;t find my usual.  Now I won&#x27;t use anything else if this is anywhere close (and I do make it a point to keep it nearby).  I adore this stuff.  I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like the packaging but it just all works for me.  I love the feel of this stuff on my lips; nothing else comes close.  Wonderful!</li>
            <li> i know this works for a lot of people but for me it does not seem to work at all</li>
            <li> This pack is cheaper than buying them separately! This honeysuckle honeydew flavor is my favorite and love they have a package of 8 available</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this lip balm. I mean, the idea is genius. A cute little round circle instead of a cylindrical, where you do not have to touch your finger to your lips (for those who can be a bit of a germophobe, like myself), and a product that smells so sweet. It seriously reminds me of starbursts. But this lip balm doesn&#x27;t work for me. I saw my sisters use it, and I had to have one. It&#x27;s totally unique, so luckily my older sister bought me one (actually two, at different times). I gave it two tries with pomegranate raspberry and honeysuckle honeydew, and they both made my lips break out. It was a disaster, and I do not know what ingredient in this that gives me a reaction, for this is supossed to be organic. The first time I just stopped using it and my lips went back to the way they were to be. But the second time I actually had to apply a mixture of over the counter medication in order to releave I guess you can call it a rash. It was just bumpy and no good. I&#x27;m so disappointed that this didn&#x27;t work out for me.</li>
