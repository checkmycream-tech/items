            <li>My hair is a darkish blond with highlights, and I&#x27;ve avoided most leave-in hair products because they darken my hair until I wash them out.</li>

            <li>My hair looks and feels better.</li>
            <li>Prevents static:</li>
            <li>Every product I have tried, to date, has been wonderful and Simply</li>
            <li>This spray-in conditioner has a wonderful spicy scent and a smooth, pleasant feel which doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair.</li>
            <li>to use and quick, quick - you are done and when your hair dries, you have a great head of hair.</li>
            <li>my hair is since I began using this, but I will say that if you really do have concerns about taking good care of your hair, THIS PRODUCT,  Simply Beautiful Marvel 10 Effects 10 in 1 Hair Treatment, really does what it claims to do.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>

            <li>: Suitable for all hair types: She thinks so, she can say that it works on fine hair when used on the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As for the static, it does a fine job.</li>
            <li>Smells good, and keeps the static away, which is the main reason why I bought it.  </li>
            <li>True!</li>
            <li>Its so easy to use, and helps stop hair from breaking..</li>
            <li>Does not leave it greasy and it is really easy to wash out.</li>
            <li>I found the scent to be somewhat strong, but it diminished after a while.</li>
            <li>The scent is too strong</li>
            <li>Suitable for all hair types (well, my hair is not in great shape normally, and Marvel 10 Effects has fixed that, so if  that counts as a vote for suitable for all hair types, so be it!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>It smells fine.</li>
            <li>Fine satin sheen</li>
            <li>However it has the odor of really cheap perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>no amount of blow-drying will smooth it out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes the hair silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>It smells really good and makes my hair feel really soft.</li>
            <li>I have been lucky enough to discover this line of products and I am so happy that I have.  </li>
            <li>Rich in antioxidants (&amp;</li>
            <li>My hair dresser used it on me and for the first time all winter, I didn&#x27;t have any static.</li>
            <li>Rich in antioxidants: No way to measure this&lt;</li>
            <li>My hair no longer has the static electricity and an added bonus my hair is more manageable, fuller, and soft.  </li>
            <li>Purchased for my daughter that has staticky hair and use as a light conditioner, doesn&#x27;t work any better than suave detangler for kids but costs 10 times as much.</li>
            <li>winter, my apartment *is* full of ionizing crystal lamps, and</li>
            <li>Looks cool</li>
            <li>Wow, when I sprayed in the simply beautiful marvel it was instant results.</li>
            <li>After years of looking and spending hundreds of dollars, this product really tames my course (yet fine), frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>Leaves her hair soft and without static.  </li>
            <li>The static is almost completely gone, but then it *is*</li>
            <li>When hair is properly conditioned, it not only looks better and feels better, it holds its style better and longer.</li>
            <li>We have no bald family members, but that&#x27;s probably the only kind of person who would not find this</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take the static out of my hair completely.</li>
            <li>very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;It smells very fresh .&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very long, fine hair and even after combing it multiple times and straightening it, it still didn&#x27;t have static!!  </li>
            <li>Those with long hair liked the detanglling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve waist length hair, and rarely use heated products - life&#x27;s too short to spend time faffing about with hair :-).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about four weeks and the ends of my hair that can look dry, being older, look shiny and as good as the roots.</li>
            <li>Very highly recommended!</li>
            <li>and it really works!  </li>
            <li>Because of it, I feel great about my pretty, shiny, silky and thick looking hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Because of it, I feel great about my pretty, shiny, silky and thick looking hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was offered a sample but used my girlfriend for the actual testing as shes going to give you a much better opinion than I ever</li>
            <li>: I shampooed my hair with a fairly nondescript, somewhat drying shampoo, Then I used no conditioner, and towel dried my hair.</li>
            <li>It makes my super fine and dry hair look so much healthier!</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t recommend this enough if you have static</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it every morning for the past three weeks or so, and my hair has been consistently looking good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a number of products, but this is the first one that has been a real help.</li>
            <li>The difference between this and regular hair treatments is distinct and unique.</li>
            <li>Hair Treatment - 250ml works like a charm, leaving my hair soft, full, and manageable.</li>
            <li>After washing my hair I leave it in and my hair is super soft.</li>
            <li>Certainly yes&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li>This winter has been dry, unusually so here in the swamp, and I have static</li>
            <li>The product works very well.  </li>
            <li>My hair was shinier and so much smoother.</li>
            <li>Our whole family tried it out.</li>
            <li>gave Marvel 10 Effects the real litmus test</li>
            <li>* Really does help with blow drying straight&lt;</li>
            <li>I have short, very fine hair that tends to get greasy and totally unruly if I don&#x27;t shampoo and blow-dry it every morning.</li>
            <li>Running the brush through my hair, my hair stayed down instead of flying up with the brush with static.</li>
            <li>I have thin fine hair and have had a static problem in the winter all my life where my hair flies around my face almost immediately after showering.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally use a blow dryer or heat styling tools, but for those that do, this product will protect against heat damage.  </li>
            <li>When she blow dried she felt like it held her style a bit better (and she wasn&#x27;t expecting this).</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is where this product comes in - anything you need to tame, repair and make your hair healthy and glowing is in this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a new &#x27;for life&#x27; customer and buying it from Amazon</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got fine, curly hair that tends to look flat and greasy if I use a regular conditioner.  </li>
            <li>; I&#x27;ve developed a couple of cowlicks that drive me nuts!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m anxious not to repeat it :-)</li>
            <li>It gives just a small touch of conditioning to my hair - making it shiny, static free, and helping define my curls - without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a patient person and tend to drag the brush through quickly.....</li>
            <li>No fly away hair, more body, more shine and acts as a styling product without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li>hair is naturally made up of keratin, but it can be stripped out by bleaching, coloring, perming or straightening.  </li>
            <li>I found this conditioner does what it says as far as detangling and leaving hair feeling silky and soft, and looking glossy without looking greasy.</li>
            <li>Its in a plastic bottle, and has a pump aerosol dispenser, so it can be applied directly to hair.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions and sprayed Marvel 10 Effects directly on my damp hair.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural curl.&lt;br /&gt;8.</li>
            <li>, it helps give my hair shine and it feels soft without making it look greasy.</li>
            <li>This product is a good alternative to expensive salon keratin treatments, as it absorbs into the hair strands and helps revive the beauty of our hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lucky in having &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; hair, but this seems to be suitable for all hair types, and certtainly isn&#x27;t in any way oily or greasy, so I imagine would help detangle even hair prone to greasiness without leaving it looking limp and dull.</li>
            <li>I did cool the dryer down at the end to seal my hair.</li>
            <li>Having Marvel 10 Effects 10 in 1 Hair Treatment in your collection of hair treatment products is like getting to amplify by ten times the magnificence you normally expect from the appearance of your hair!</li>
            <li>I still have to use a flat iron to straighten my hair but this product makes it soooooo much easier.</li>
            <li>Great for my hair but unpleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Have only used this product a few times, but so far, it&#x27;s been fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Your hair will look healthier and be so much more touchable with less hairspray and other styling products \\&quot;gooping\\</li>
            <li>Can you tell I hate static?  :)</li>
            <li>I live on the central Oregon Coast, which is usually very damp, so even if I start out with that curl in front tamed, going outside generally causes it to spring back to life and</li>
            <li>o.O</li>
            <li>#60;--that is why I blew my hair dry using high heat, and although I do not recommend doing that, Marvel 10 came through for me as stated.</li>
            <li>The spray worked with both blow drying or letting dry normal.</li>
            <li>Even using it daily, you don&#x27;t use much, so a bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li>Those who have trouble with static in their hair found that they no longer had trouble.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for three days and my hair hasn&#x27;t ever been this soft, cooperative and healthy-looking without the use of several different products, each for a different purpose, and the total price of such far exceeding twelve dollars.</li>
            <li>I have long, baby-fine hair with natural waves.</li>
            <li>Then I blew my hair dry, a bit more roughly than usual, to see what would happen.</li>

            <li> Its so easy to use, and helps stop hair from breaking..</li>
            <li> Does not leave it greasy and it is really easy to wash out.</li>
            <li> I found the scent to be somewhat strong, but it diminished after a while.</li>
            <li> The scent is too strong</li>
            <li> Suitable for all hair types (well, my hair is not in great shape normally, and Marvel 10 Effects has fixed that, so if  that counts as a vote for suitable for all hair types, so be it!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> It smells fine.</li>
            <li> Fine satin sheen</li>
            <li> However it has the odor of really cheap perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> no amount of blow-drying will smooth it out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes the hair silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> It smells really good and makes my hair feel really soft.</li>
            <li> I have been lucky enough to discover this line of products and I am so happy that I have.  </li>
            <li> Rich in antioxidants (&amp;</li>
            <li> My hair dresser used it on me and for the first time all winter, I didn&#x27;t have any static.</li>
            <li> Rich in antioxidants: No way to measure this&lt;</li>
            <li> My hair no longer has the static electricity and an added bonus my hair is more manageable, fuller, and soft.  </li>
            <li> Purchased for my daughter that has staticky hair and use as a light conditioner, doesn&#x27;t work any better than suave detangler for kids but costs 10 times as much.</li>
            <li> winter, my apartment *is* full of ionizing crystal lamps, and</li>
            <li> Looks cool</li>
            <li> Wow, when I sprayed in the simply beautiful marvel it was instant results.</li>
            <li> After years of looking and spending hundreds of dollars, this product really tames my course (yet fine), frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Leaves her hair soft and without static.  </li>
            <li> The static is almost completely gone, but then it *is*</li>
            <li> When hair is properly conditioned, it not only looks better and feels better, it holds its style better and longer.</li>
            <li> We have no bald family members, but that&#x27;s probably the only kind of person who would not find this</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take the static out of my hair completely.</li>
            <li> very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;It smells very fresh .&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very long, fine hair and even after combing it multiple times and straightening it, it still didn&#x27;t have static!!  </li>
            <li> Those with long hair liked the detanglling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waist length hair, and rarely use heated products - life&#x27;s too short to spend time faffing about with hair :-).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about four weeks and the ends of my hair that can look dry, being older, look shiny and as good as the roots.</li>
            <li> Very highly recommended!</li>
            <li> and it really works!  </li>
            <li> Because of it, I feel great about my pretty, shiny, silky and thick looking hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because of it, I feel great about my pretty, shiny, silky and thick looking hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was offered a sample but used my girlfriend for the actual testing as shes going to give you a much better opinion than I ever</li>
            <li> : I shampooed my hair with a fairly nondescript, somewhat drying shampoo, Then I used no conditioner, and towel dried my hair.</li>
            <li> It makes my super fine and dry hair look so much healthier!</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t recommend this enough if you have static</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it every morning for the past three weeks or so, and my hair has been consistently looking good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of products, but this is the first one that has been a real help.</li>
            <li> The difference between this and regular hair treatments is distinct and unique.</li>
            <li> Hair Treatment - 250ml works like a charm, leaving my hair soft, full, and manageable.</li>
            <li> After washing my hair I leave it in and my hair is super soft.</li>
            <li> Certainly yes&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> This winter has been dry, unusually so here in the swamp, and I have static</li>
            <li> The product works very well.  </li>
            <li> My hair was shinier and so much smoother.</li>
            <li> Our whole family tried it out.</li>
            <li> gave Marvel 10 Effects the real litmus test</li>
            <li> * Really does help with blow drying straight&lt;</li>
            <li> I have short, very fine hair that tends to get greasy and totally unruly if I don&#x27;t shampoo and blow-dry it every morning.</li>
            <li> Running the brush through my hair, my hair stayed down instead of flying up with the brush with static.</li>
            <li> I have thin fine hair and have had a static problem in the winter all my life where my hair flies around my face almost immediately after showering.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally use a blow dryer or heat styling tools, but for those that do, this product will protect against heat damage.  </li>
            <li> When she blow dried she felt like it held her style a bit better (and she wasn&#x27;t expecting this).</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is where this product comes in - anything you need to tame, repair and make your hair healthy and glowing is in this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a new &#x27;for life&#x27; customer and buying it from Amazon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got fine, curly hair that tends to look flat and greasy if I use a regular conditioner.  </li>
            <li> ; I&#x27;ve developed a couple of cowlicks that drive me nuts!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m anxious not to repeat it :-)</li>
            <li> It gives just a small touch of conditioning to my hair - making it shiny, static free, and helping define my curls - without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a patient person and tend to drag the brush through quickly.....</li>
            <li> No fly away hair, more body, more shine and acts as a styling product without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> hair is naturally made up of keratin, but it can be stripped out by bleaching, coloring, perming or straightening.  </li>
            <li> I found this conditioner does what it says as far as detangling and leaving hair feeling silky and soft, and looking glossy without looking greasy.</li>
            <li> Its in a plastic bottle, and has a pump aerosol dispenser, so it can be applied directly to hair.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and sprayed Marvel 10 Effects directly on my damp hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural curl.&lt;br /&gt;8.</li>
            <li> , it helps give my hair shine and it feels soft without making it look greasy.</li>
            <li> This product is a good alternative to expensive salon keratin treatments, as it absorbs into the hair strands and helps revive the beauty of our hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lucky in having &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; hair, but this seems to be suitable for all hair types, and certtainly isn&#x27;t in any way oily or greasy, so I imagine would help detangle even hair prone to greasiness without leaving it looking limp and dull.</li>
            <li> I did cool the dryer down at the end to seal my hair.</li>
            <li> Having Marvel 10 Effects 10 in 1 Hair Treatment in your collection of hair treatment products is like getting to amplify by ten times the magnificence you normally expect from the appearance of your hair!</li>
            <li> I still have to use a flat iron to straighten my hair but this product makes it soooooo much easier.</li>
            <li> Great for my hair but unpleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Have only used this product a few times, but so far, it&#x27;s been fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Your hair will look healthier and be so much more touchable with less hairspray and other styling products \\&quot;gooping\\</li>
            <li> Can you tell I hate static?  :)</li>
            <li> I live on the central Oregon Coast, which is usually very damp, so even if I start out with that curl in front tamed, going outside generally causes it to spring back to life and</li>
            <li> o.O</li>
            <li> #60;--that is why I blew my hair dry using high heat, and although I do not recommend doing that, Marvel 10 came through for me as stated.</li>
            <li> The spray worked with both blow drying or letting dry normal.</li>
            <li> Even using it daily, you don&#x27;t use much, so a bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Those who have trouble with static in their hair found that they no longer had trouble.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for three days and my hair hasn&#x27;t ever been this soft, cooperative and healthy-looking without the use of several different products, each for a different purpose, and the total price of such far exceeding twelve dollars.</li>
            <li> I have long, baby-fine hair with natural waves.</li>
            <li> Then I blew my hair dry, a bit more roughly than usual, to see what would happen.</li>
            <li> My hair would stick to my forehead and it was so flat and flyaway.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair really soft without feeling or looking heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> I used Marvel 10 Effects with a blow dryer and also with just letting my hair dry naturally--great results either way.</li>
            <li> dry frizzy</li>
            <li> Replenishes lost moisture in dry, damaged hair (&amp;#60;--it</li>
            <li> Iâ€™ve tried a lot of different products to help tame my hair and make it frizz-free, and I was recently told to give a leave-in conditioner a shot.</li>
            <li> As we age our hair dulls as keratin production slows.  </li>
            <li> My daughter (who has very thick, very long, coarse hair) used it before she straightened her hair, and it left her hair silky and shiny.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way as well</li>
            <li> can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She used this after the shower, a couple of pumps onto the lower half of her hair (avoiding the roots), brushed it through and blow dried.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I spray it on my towel dried hair after shampooing, brush it through, scrunch my hair and let it air dry.  </li>
            <li> Giving it three stars only because it didn&#x27;t way my very thin hair down and made my hair feel very soft.</li>
            <li> also like leave in conditioners as I&#x27;m a wheelchair user, one leg, and conventional conditioners</li>
            <li> I usually just apply a drop or two of argan oil or anti-frizz serum to keep my curls defined, but I&#x27;ve had to pick between dry curls or a &amp;#34;bad hair day&amp;#34; after I broke down and conditioned</li>
            <li> Well-conditioned hair also requires less styling products to create and keep a style in place.</li>
            <li> Some products put in damp hair leave it looking greasy or odd without blowing out, but this one didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Because I keep it short, it doesn&#x27;t get seriously damaged, but as I&#x27;ve gotten &amp;#34;more</li>
            <li> the slight shine is</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not a good idea when you&#x27;ve only one leg to get out with.</li>
            <li> I moved to Las Vegas and since it is so dry here, my hair had terrible static cling.  </li>
            <li> then it isn&#x27;t too heavy.  </li>
            <li> Never was able to check out it&#x27;s properties, other than the awful smell.  </li>
            <li> Those with frizziness issues had no more frizziness.</li>
            <li> I spray a small amount in my hand, rub them together, and scrunch it in...</li>
            <li> Protection from heated styling tools: Not sure here but seemed to work</li>
            <li> The smell is so horrible I only used it once and will be sending back.</li>
            <li> I have very thick unruly hair</li>
            <li> One slip and its ouch, broken bones - been there, done that</li>
            <li> so it difficult to find stuff I like.</li>
            <li> hate washing my hair because it is so thick</li>
            <li> I *do* have a bad habit of putting my coat, backpack, etc on over my hair and then dragging it out from under them.</li>
            <li> If it worked on my horrible hair, it will work for anyone.</li>

            <li> I couldn&#x27;t handle the &amp;#34;old lady perfume&amp;#34; smell of this.  I had to return it.</li>
            <li> The product works very well.  It did everything it was supposed to. However it has the odor of really cheap perfume.&lt;br /&gt;Also some of it leaked in the package in which it was sent.</li>
            <li> Have only used this product a few times, but so far, it&#x27;s been fantastic.  Smells good, and keeps the static away, which is the main reason why I bought it.  I used it on my daughter&#x27;s hair as well, and it works wonders. Leaves her hair soft and without static.  Can you tell I hate static?  :)</li>
            <li> It helps and smells really good</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty great. I&#x27;ve been using it for three days and my hair hasn&#x27;t ever been this soft, cooperative and healthy-looking without the use of several different products, each for a different purpose, and the total price of such far exceeding twelve dollars. As for the static, it does a fine job. The static is almost completely gone, but then it *is* winter, my apartment *is* full of ionizing crystal lamps, and I *do* have a bad habit of putting my coat, backpack, etc on over my hair and then dragging it out from under them. In all fairness, that&#x27;s a tall order for any product to handle. But I totally recommend this to anyone who... well, has hair. o.O</li>
            <li> I moved to Las Vegas and since it is so dry here, my hair had terrible static cling.  My hair would stick to my forehead and it was so flat and flyaway.  I was desparate.  I decided to try Simply Beautiful and it really works!  I am so pleased.  My hair no longer has the static electricity and an added bonus my hair is more manageable, fuller, and soft.  I think you will be very happy if you try it.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It makes my super fine and dry hair look so much healthier! I apply it only from middle to the ends. Definitely will order again!</li>
            <li> I have long, baby-fine hair with natural waves. Through lots of trial and error, I discovered that a leave-in conditioner suits my hair the best. Simply Beautiful Marvel 10 Effects - 10 In 1 Keratin Based Leave-In Hair Treatment - 250ml works like a charm, leaving my hair soft, full, and manageable. When hair is properly conditioned, it not only looks better and feels better, it holds its style better and longer. I used Marvel 10 Effects with a blow dryer and also with just letting my hair dry naturally--great results either way. Well-conditioned hair also requires less styling products to create and keep a style in place. Your hair will look healthier and be so much more touchable with less hairspray and other styling products \\&quot;gooping\\&quot; it up. I found the scent to be somewhat strong, but it diminished after a while. This is a non-greasy, effective conditioner which did not leave my fine hair flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review Product Gratis Second Glance Beauty</li>
            <li> Wow, when I sprayed in the simply beautiful marvel it was instant results. My hair tends to have fuzzy frizzy ends and is very fly away. This winter has been dry, unusually so here in the swamp, and I have static hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spraying on the Simply Beautiful was amazing, my hair went from fly away to manageable in seconds. Running the brush through my hair, my hair stayed down instead of flying up with the brush with static. The spray worked with both blow drying or letting dry normal. Some products put in damp hair leave it looking greasy or odd without blowing out, but this one didn&#x27;t. My hair was shinier and so much smoother. I really can&#x27;t recommend this enough if you have static dry frizzy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product sent for review</li>

I usually just apply a drop or two of argan oil or anti-frizz serum to keep my curls defined, but I&#x27;ve had to pick between dry curls or a &amp;#34;bad hair day&amp;#34; after I broke down and conditioned it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Marvel 10 Effects leave-in conditioner for a couple of weeks now, and I&#x27;m in love!  It gives just a small touch of conditioning to my hair - making it shiny, static free, and helping define my curls - without weighing it down.  I spray it on my towel dried hair after shampooing, brush it through, scrunch my hair and let it air dry.  I don&#x27;t normally use a blow dryer or heat styling tools, but for those that do, this product will protect against heat damage.  My daughter (who has very thick, very long, coarse hair) used it before she straightened her hair, and it left her hair silky and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our hair is naturally made up of keratin, but it can be stripped out by bleaching, coloring, perming or straightening.

            <li> This spray-in conditioner has a wonderful spicy scent and a smooth, pleasant feel which doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair. Our whole family tried it out. Those who style their hair loved the heat protection and ease of styling. Those with long hair liked the detanglling. Those who have trouble with static in their hair found that they no longer had trouble. Those with frizziness issues had no more frizziness. Those with gorgeous luxuriant hair liked the additional shine and softness. We have no bald family members, but that&#x27;s probably the only kind of person who would not find this beneficial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice for both men and women.</li>
            <li> I have short, very fine hair that tends to get greasy and totally unruly if I don&#x27;t shampoo and blow-dry it every morning. Because I keep it short, it doesn&#x27;t get seriously damaged, but as I&#x27;ve gotten &amp;#34;more mature,&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve developed a couple of cowlicks that drive me nuts! I&#x27;ve tried a number of products, but this is the first one that has been a real help. I&#x27;ve used it every morning for the past three weeks or so, and my hair has been consistently looking good. I live on the central Oregon Coast, which is usually very damp, so even if I start out with that curl in front tamed, going outside generally causes it to spring back to life and no amount of blow-drying will smooth it out. Not so anymore! It&#x27;s still there, but is much more manageable. My hair is a darkish blond with highlights, and I&#x27;ve avoided most leave-in hair products because they darken my hair until I wash them out. Not this one! I also like the scent. Is there anything I don&#x27;t like about this product? Not that I can think of! Even using it daily, you don&#x27;t use much, so a bottle will last a long time. I&#x27;m sold! Very highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This does lots of things for hair...from detangling to protecting from heat.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve waist length hair, and rarely use heated products - life&#x27;s too short to spend time faffing about with hair :-). I found this conditioner does what it says as far as detangling and leaving hair feeling silky and soft, and looking glossy without looking greasy. Its in a plastic bottle, and has a pump aerosol dispenser, so it can be applied directly to hair. I&#x27;ve been using it for about four weeks and the ends of my hair that can look dry, being older, look shiny and as good as the roots. I&#x27;m lucky in having &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; hair, but this seems to be suitable for all hair types, and certtainly isn&#x27;t in any way oily or greasy, so I imagine would help detangle even hair prone to greasiness without leaving it looking limp and dull. I&#x27;ve also used it sometimes between washes to help get morning tangles out. Its so easy to use, and helps stop hair from breaking..I&#x27;m not a patient person and tend to drag the brush through quickly.....&lt;br /&gt;I also like leave in conditioners as I&#x27;m a wheelchair user, one leg, and conventional conditioners can leave bath/shower slippery. That&#x27;s not a good idea when you&#x27;ve only one leg to get out with. One slip and its ouch, broken bones - been there, done that and I&#x27;m anxious not to repeat it :-)</li>
            <li> After years of looking and spending hundreds of dollars, this product really tames my course (yet fine), frizzy hair. It smooths out the fly-aways and has eliminated the static. I still have to use a flat iron to straighten my hair but this product makes it soooooo much easier. It leaves my hair really soft without feeling or looking heavy or greasy. It smells fine.</li>
            <li> Having Marvel 10 Effects 10 in 1 Hair Treatment in your collection of hair treatment products is like getting to amplify by ten times the magnificence you normally expect from the appearance of your hair! I couldn&#x27;t believe the great way this product REALLY works!  The difference between this and regular hair treatments is distinct and unique. It is wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;I gave Marvel 10 Effects the real litmus test: I shampooed my hair with a fairly nondescript, somewhat drying shampoo, Then I used no conditioner, and towel dried my hair. I followed the directions and sprayed Marvel 10 Effects directly on my damp hair. Then I used a brush (!!!). It went through beautifully, as if I had all sorts of detangling, conditioning products in my hair. Then I blew my hair dry, a bit more roughly than usual, to see what would happen. I did cool the dryer down at the end to seal my hair. However it was a vigorous drying session!&lt;br /&gt;I then looked at my hair and could not believe the difference in the glossiness, the texture, the appearance of volume, and the fullness. With no frizzy ends, and even an appearance of shape and volume, as if I had used hair spray ( but without any of the tacky texture you get with hair spray)!  This is an awesome product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the bottle, it says that the ten benefits you get from Marvel 10 Effects are:&lt;br /&gt;1) Replenishes lost moisture in dry, damaged hair (&amp;#60;--it did)&lt;br /&gt;2) Prevents static (&amp;#60;--it does ... and I have been known to be the &amp;#34;queen of static&amp;#34;!)&lt;br /&gt;3) Protection from heated styling tools (&amp;#60;--that is why I blew my hair dry using high heat, and although I do not recommend doing that, Marvel 10 came through for me as stated.

            <li> I didn&#x27;t read what the product was intended for on the bottle - but I didn&#x27;t need to.  My hair dresser used it on me and for the first time all winter, I didn&#x27;t have any static. At all!!  I have very long, fine hair and even after combing it multiple times and straightening it, it still didn&#x27;t have static!!  I was sold on it without even knowing what it actually was intended for!  I&#x27;m a new &#x27;for life&#x27; customer and buying it from Amazon saved me more than 50% from the cost of my hair dresser&#x27;s price!</li>
            <li> Great for my hair but unpleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Great smell and great on my hair</li>
            <li> OK.  Doesn&#x27;t take the static out of my hair completely.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Leaves my hair feeling shiny and looking really healthy after every use. Does not leave it greasy and it is really easy to wash out. A little goes a long way! I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I spray a small amount in my hand, rub them together, and scrunch it in... then it isn&#x27;t too heavy.  And it smells nice too.</li>
            <li> I love love this product! After washing my hair I leave it in and my hair is super soft. Love the smell and has improved my hair texture. I have very thick unruly hair so it difficult to find stuff I like. But I am on my way to 2nd bottle! Love </li>
            <li> This was recommended by a friend who swore by it. I thought I would give it a go and I do not regret it at all. My hair looks and feels better. A little goes a long way as well so it is good value for money.</li>
            <li> I was offered a sample but used my girlfriend for the actual testing as shes going to give you a much better opinion than I ever can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She used this after the shower, a couple of pumps onto the lower half of her hair (avoiding the roots), brushed it through and blow dried. When she blow dried she felt like it held her style a bit better (and she wasn&#x27;t expecting this). Even on a humid day, no fuzz occurred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listing the effects from the bottle and her comments:&lt;br /&gt;1. Replenishes moisture: Yes it did moisturize and hair felt soft&lt;br /&gt;2. Prevents static: True! No problems on a humid day&lt;br /&gt;3. Protection from heated styling tools: Not sure here but seemed to work&lt;br /&gt;4. Effective detangler: Certainly yes&lt;br /&gt;5. Rich in antioxidants: No way to measure this&lt;br /&gt;6. Aids in brushing: See number 4&lt;br /&gt;7. Maintains hair styles for longer: Yes! Her hair didn&#x27;t go back to it&#x27;s natural curl.&lt;br /&gt;8. Reduces appearance of split ends: Yes&lt;br /&gt;9. Controls fizzy hair and adds shine: See 8&lt;br /&gt;10: Suitable for all hair types: She thinks so, she can say that it works on fine hair when used on the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is emphasising that you must use this as directed on the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall though, she is very impressed. She thinks the bottle will last quite a while, she thinks around 9 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* Really does help with blow drying straight&lt;br /&gt;* Holds style&lt;br /&gt;* Looks smoother&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a sample in exchange for an honest review</li>
            <li> Very good care agent .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes the hair silky and smooth. Likewise, it is anti-static . I often change the sweater and have no electrified head anymore ! Likewise, I could feel a regeneration . My hair is not as brittle as before.&lt;br /&gt;Even the slight shine is very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;It smells very fresh .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Leaves hair silky&lt;br /&gt;+ Cares&lt;br /&gt;+ Cheap&lt;br /&gt;+ Looks cool&lt;br /&gt;+ Fine satin sheen&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion :&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMENDED !!!</li>
            <li> I have been lucky enough to discover this line of products and I am so happy that I have.  Every product I have tried, to date, has been wonderful and Simply Beautiful Marvel 10 effects is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about this product?  It combines a bunch of different working products into one product/bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate washing my hair because it is so thick - this means that washing, rinsing, washing and rinsing again can take forever, so the last thing I want is to also have to handle a bunch of different bottles doing different things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is where this product comes in - anything you need to tame, repair and make your hair healthy and glowing is in this bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and quick, quick - you are done and when your hair dries, you have a great head of hair.</li>
            <li> 1st time I have ever used this product.  It smells really good and makes my hair feel really soft. I didn&#x27;t rate it a five star only because I just received it and have only used it a couple of times.</li>
            <li> Iâ€™ve tried a lot of different products to help tame my hair and make it frizz-free, and I was recently told to give a leave-in conditioner a shot. So what perfect timing this was! I think the spray works well, it helps give my hair shine and it feels soft without making it look greasy. I donâ€™t like the way it smells, almost too chemically, but it seems to do a good job. I use it 2-3 times a week and will continue doing so after I shower.</li>
            <li> Giving it three stars only because it didn&#x27;t way my very thin hair down and made my hair feel very soft. The problem is the smell. The smell is so horrible I only used it once and will be sending back. If you like the smell of &amp;#34;old lady perfume&amp;#34; then this product would be great for you.</li>
            <li> Never was able to check out it&#x27;s properties, other than the awful smell.  Another reviewer said &amp;#34;old lady perfume&amp;#34; which is a perfect description. And that was with the tiniest of spray.  I had to rewash my hair.  Returning product.</li>
            <li> Does what it says! The scent is too strong but I got used to it.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my daughter that has staticky hair and use as a light conditioner, doesn&#x27;t work any better than suave detangler for kids but costs 10 times as much.</li>
            <li> I have thin fine hair and have had a static problem in the winter all my life where my hair flies around my face almost immediately after showering. This product actually works as advertised. No fly away hair, more body, more shine and acts as a styling product without weighing my hair down. I am so happy I found this product. If it worked on my horrible hair, it will work for anyone.</li>
