            <li>I ordered these and the box was a lot more than I anticipated.</li>
            <li>I love being able to control what ingredients touch his skin.</li>
            <li>ok how I feel about them being rectangular.</li>
            <li>they are softer and more absorbent than tissues.</li>
            <li>A much better alternative to any wipe out there.</li>
            <li>We just wet these with warm water and they work perfectly!!</li>
            <li>I am pleased with them.</li>
            <li>no chemicals no fragrance. :-)</li>
            <li>Pleased with the quality.</li>
            <li>great ad wet ones, just damp with water they do a great job....</li>
            <li>i love this one.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember how many times we have purchased this</li>
            <li>and we love it.</li>
            <li>This gives our baby better protection with no doubt.</li>

            <li>great size and soft cloth</li>
            <li>The larger size is good too!</li>
            <li>They fit perfectly in a travel huggies container which makes them even better for me :) While I wish these where a little wider if they were they wouldn&#x27;t fit in the wipe case</li>
            <li>Cleans stained wall easily.</li>
            <li>They are so strong, they are intact after being run in the laundry.</li>
            <li>Really a good product and soft :)</li>
            <li>The quantity is huge.</li>
            <li>smaller than the one used b hospital, but works great.</li>
            <li>Smaller than the ones I ordered before, but still great quality.  </li>
            <li>Great size to use for cleaning the face and the hands and for use on wiping personal areas of the body.</li>
            <li>I love it that these wipes are so soft!!!!  </li>
            <li>They are soft and they fit nicely into our wipes dispenser.  </li>
            <li>And the price is must definitely right!</li>
            <li>They are quite large, which is awesome and the sheer amount of them makes it a smart purchase.</li>
            <li>Absolute favorite wipe for baby.</li>
            <li>I make my own baby wipes using these, all natural witch hazel and Dr. Bronners for babies.  </li>
            <li>these are nice and soft</li>
            <li>My daughter tends to use too many at time for her new baby</li>
            <li>shipped on time, good packaging, this is exactly the same product we were given in hospital after baby arrived.</li>
            <li>thanks for making it available...</li>
            <li>These are really useful.</li>
            <li>it came the next day, and I didn&#x27;t pay for that kind of shipping.</li>
            <li>I think these may become a permanent part of our household, even when our daughter grows up, they&#x27;re so useful.</li>
            <li>But the economics of disposals has to be right</li>
            <li>Just the right size for wiping baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li>I loved the dry wipes that we used in the hospital when my daughter was born and was glad that I found something similar.</li>
            <li>great quality, thats the only thing i use to clean baby butt with water, instead of using wet wipe.</li>
            <li>The shipping was super fast</li>
            <li>I am truly hoping that it is just a batch problem, I will give them a second chance and buy them one more time, but if the issue continues, I will have to shop around for another brandâ€¦.</li>
            <li>Love these medical wipes.  </li>
            <li>We like to wet a bunch and put into a wipes box to have them handy.</li>
            <li>we love these and definitely recommend them for use as baby wipes.</li>
            <li>They are great since you can just wet them and use them instead of regular wipes.  </li>
            <li>Disposability is good because constantly laundering several washcloths per day is a pain</li>
            <li>The price is outstanding compared with similar products, and it is very covenient and cost-effective to package them in large quantity.  </li>
            <li>We cut them in half and use this with warm water and the Honest Soothing Bottom spray to make Diaper Wipes as natural as possible at home.</li>
            <li>I chose the large size and distribute the packs as requested.</li>
            <li>They are folded lengthwise then width-wise, so you have to unfold them to really use the whole thing.</li>
            <li>so they are ready to use.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>This is much cheaper than buying &amp;#34;sensitive skin / fragrance free&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>These hold up really well</li>
            <li>They hold up really well, even through the wash.  </li>
            <li>Been making my own wipes for several months now and never looked back.</li>
            <li>I decided to purchase these due to the softness and better care for mom.</li>
            <li>You get many wipes for less than the cost of wet wipes, and so staff can use as many as they need without worrying about running out.</li>
            <li>Also use it to clean his face, occasional spit up etc.</li>
            <li>Its perfect other than them being a little big.</li>
            <li>Just right  -  not too heavy not too wide - good price</li>
            <li>(&lt;br /&gt;You have to make sure you wet them well or add a lot of cream so that those wipes do not hurt baby&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more when we finally get through this giant box that I got.  </li>
            <li>Works very well to dry clean</li>
            <li>But the most recent box is different quality,</li>
            <li>Unlike the 10&amp;#34;x13&amp;#34; Medline Ultra-Soft wipes, these wipes aren&#x27;t very soft!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>but they are good for sponging or if the baby is allergic to other wet</li>
            <li>They are so soft and very sturdy.</li>
            <li>It is soft enough and absorbing enough to make that job easy.</li>
            <li>, I cut them in half to get more out of them as they are pretty big.  </li>
            <li>Nice thick quality and very soft.</li>
            <li>Use these each single day for my baby&#x27;s diaper changes, much better than regular baby wipers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted - the right size and consistency of material - I will use these for cleaning and other household chores.</li>
            <li>We actually wet an entire pack and place it in a wipe warmer to make them more convenient.</li>
            <li>My son has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My baby has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>These are just what I was looking for to use on my daughter&#x27;s very sensitive diaper area.</li>
            <li>Very soft, yet durable.  </li>
            <li>they are very soft.</li>
            <li>These were the exact same cloths used in our hospital NICU.  </li>
            <li>So soft!</li>
            <li>Fit&#x27;s perfectly in a typical wipe container.</li>
            <li>During our hospital stay the nurses used these exact wipes to care for our little one and our nurse was so kind to give us a few packs to bring home.</li>
            <li>My baby has never had diaper rash (unlike my two older children because I bought other store brand wet wipes ) and will continue to use these wipes. :-)</li>
            <li>They are large enough that one cloth can handle even the biggest diaper blowout.</li>
            <li>Using these along with the natural &amp;#34;wipes juice&amp;#34; I made to go with them, my baby has not even had the beginnings of any diaper rashes.</li>
            <li>Soft and just like the ones used in the hospital.  </li>
            <li>I use tem on my baby an find them soft and absorbent.</li>
            <li>The wipes are soft and fabric like.</li>
            <li>Within three days the rash that I had been battling for weeks was completely gone.</li>
            <li>The wipes are both durable and gentle, and overall, do the job well.  </li>
            <li>Soft, durable and hold moisture well.  </li>
            <li>wipes, which I would need to for my baby&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using them for a foster baby that was exposed to drugs at birth and has extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I never realized how much the chemicals in commercial wipes can have an effect on a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li>but it is not as soft as before.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these to any parent looking for an alternative to traditional store bought wipes.</li>
            <li>These are dry wipes that are much like the wipes you get in the hospital.  </li>
            <li>But other than that they are fine, healthier than the wet wipes you buy.</li>
            <li>They have solved the main problem, but if you compare them to the wet wipes I&#x27;d been using, they are not as soft.</li>
            <li>They are large enough and absorbant enough that I only need four a day</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t feed thru like regular wipes do, but they are super soft and cost slightly less than regular wipes, when you factor in the cost of the solution we use.  </li>
            <li>I highly suggest these for newborn infants or for babies who have sensitive skin so you can just wet them with water.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s 10 months old and not 1 rash that last longer than 12 hours.</li>
            <li>The one weird thing is the way they are folded lengthwise first, but I rip a small hole in the side of the pack and pull one out at a time like diaper wipes and the unfold fairly well for use.</li>
            <li>Not as thick as the big company prepackaged wipes but can&#x27;t complain as it absorbs the solution I make and wipes easily on baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li>We use it as wipes for our 2 year old and 6 month old we just get it wet with water.</li>
            <li>We cut them in half and BAM twice as much</li>
            <li>These are very absorbent dry and hold up well when wet.</li>
            <li>they used to be specially soft, now they are very rough and they scratch my baby if I am not careful enough.</li>

            <li> Pleased with the quality.</li>
            <li> great ad wet ones, just damp with water they do a great job....</li>
            <li> i love this one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember how many times we have purchased this</li>
            <li> and we love it.</li>
            <li> This gives our baby better protection with no doubt.</li>
            <li> They work great and are soft too!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, super soft cloths for makeup removal, face cleaning.</li>
            <li> Perfect size and super soft.</li>
            <li> great size and soft cloth</li>
            <li> The larger size is good too!</li>
            <li> They fit perfectly in a travel huggies container which makes them even better for me :) While I wish these where a little wider if they were they wouldn&#x27;t fit in the wipe case</li>
            <li> Cleans stained wall easily.</li>
            <li> They are so strong, they are intact after being run in the laundry.</li>
            <li> Really a good product and soft :)</li>
            <li> The quantity is huge.</li>
            <li> smaller than the one used b hospital, but works great.</li>
            <li> Smaller than the ones I ordered before, but still great quality.  </li>
            <li> Great size to use for cleaning the face and the hands and for use on wiping personal areas of the body.</li>
            <li> I love it that these wipes are so soft!!!!  </li>
            <li> They are soft and they fit nicely into our wipes dispenser.  </li>
            <li> And the price is must definitely right!</li>
            <li> They are quite large, which is awesome and the sheer amount of them makes it a smart purchase.</li>
            <li> Absolute favorite wipe for baby.</li>
            <li> I make my own baby wipes using these, all natural witch hazel and Dr. Bronners for babies.  </li>
            <li> these are nice and soft</li>
            <li> My daughter tends to use too many at time for her new baby</li>
            <li> shipped on time, good packaging, this is exactly the same product we were given in hospital after baby arrived.</li>
            <li> thanks for making it available...</li>
            <li> These are really useful.</li>
            <li> it came the next day, and I didn&#x27;t pay for that kind of shipping.</li>
            <li> I think these may become a permanent part of our household, even when our daughter grows up, they&#x27;re so useful.</li>
            <li> But the economics of disposals has to be right</li>
            <li> Just the right size for wiping baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li> I loved the dry wipes that we used in the hospital when my daughter was born and was glad that I found something similar.</li>
            <li> great quality, thats the only thing i use to clean baby butt with water, instead of using wet wipe.</li>
            <li> The shipping was super fast</li>
            <li> I am truly hoping that it is just a batch problem, I will give them a second chance and buy them one more time, but if the issue continues, I will have to shop around for another brandâ€¦.</li>
            <li> Love these medical wipes.  </li>
            <li> We like to wet a bunch and put into a wipes box to have them handy.</li>
            <li> we love these and definitely recommend them for use as baby wipes.</li>
            <li> They are great since you can just wet them and use them instead of regular wipes.  </li>
            <li> Disposability is good because constantly laundering several washcloths per day is a pain</li>
            <li> The price is outstanding compared with similar products, and it is very covenient and cost-effective to package them in large quantity.  </li>
            <li> We cut them in half and use this with warm water and the Honest Soothing Bottom spray to make Diaper Wipes as natural as possible at home.</li>
            <li> I chose the large size and distribute the packs as requested.</li>
            <li> They are folded lengthwise then width-wise, so you have to unfold them to really use the whole thing.</li>
            <li> so they are ready to use.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> This is much cheaper than buying &amp;#34;sensitive skin / fragrance free&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> These hold up really well</li>
            <li> They hold up really well, even through the wash.  </li>
            <li> Been making my own wipes for several months now and never looked back.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase these due to the softness and better care for mom.</li>
            <li> You get many wipes for less than the cost of wet wipes, and so staff can use as many as they need without worrying about running out.</li>
            <li> Also use it to clean his face, occasional spit up etc.</li>
            <li> Its perfect other than them being a little big.</li>
            <li> Just right  -  not too heavy not too wide - good price</li>
            <li> (&lt;br /&gt;You have to make sure you wet them well or add a lot of cream so that those wipes do not hurt baby&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more when we finally get through this giant box that I got.  </li>
            <li> Works very well to dry clean</li>
            <li> But the most recent box is different quality,</li>
            <li> Unlike the 10&amp;#34;x13&amp;#34; Medline Ultra-Soft wipes, these wipes aren&#x27;t very soft!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> but they are good for sponging or if the baby is allergic to other wet</li>
            <li> They are so soft and very sturdy.</li>
            <li> It is soft enough and absorbing enough to make that job easy.</li>
            <li> , I cut them in half to get more out of them as they are pretty big.  </li>
            <li> Nice thick quality and very soft.</li>
            <li> Use these each single day for my baby&#x27;s diaper changes, much better than regular baby wipers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted - the right size and consistency of material - I will use these for cleaning and other household chores.</li>
            <li> We actually wet an entire pack and place it in a wipe warmer to make them more convenient.</li>
            <li> My son has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My baby has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> These are just what I was looking for to use on my daughter&#x27;s very sensitive diaper area.</li>
            <li> Very soft, yet durable.  </li>
            <li> they are very soft.</li>
            <li> These were the exact same cloths used in our hospital NICU.  </li>
            <li> So soft!</li>
            <li> Fit&#x27;s perfectly in a typical wipe container.</li>
            <li> During our hospital stay the nurses used these exact wipes to care for our little one and our nurse was so kind to give us a few packs to bring home.</li>
            <li> My baby has never had diaper rash (unlike my two older children because I bought other store brand wet wipes ) and will continue to use these wipes. :-)</li>
            <li> They are large enough that one cloth can handle even the biggest diaper blowout.</li>
            <li> Using these along with the natural &amp;#34;wipes juice&amp;#34; I made to go with them, my baby has not even had the beginnings of any diaper rashes.</li>
            <li> Soft and just like the ones used in the hospital.  </li>
            <li> I use tem on my baby an find them soft and absorbent.</li>
            <li> The wipes are soft and fabric like.</li>
            <li> Within three days the rash that I had been battling for weeks was completely gone.</li>
            <li> The wipes are both durable and gentle, and overall, do the job well.  </li>
            <li> Soft, durable and hold moisture well.  </li>
            <li> wipes, which I would need to for my baby&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using them for a foster baby that was exposed to drugs at birth and has extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I never realized how much the chemicals in commercial wipes can have an effect on a baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> but it is not as soft as before.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these to any parent looking for an alternative to traditional store bought wipes.</li>
            <li> These are dry wipes that are much like the wipes you get in the hospital.  </li>
            <li> But other than that they are fine, healthier than the wet wipes you buy.</li>
            <li> They have solved the main problem, but if you compare them to the wet wipes I&#x27;d been using, they are not as soft.</li>
            <li> They are large enough and absorbant enough that I only need four a day</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t feed thru like regular wipes do, but they are super soft and cost slightly less than regular wipes, when you factor in the cost of the solution we use.  </li>
            <li> I highly suggest these for newborn infants or for babies who have sensitive skin so you can just wet them with water.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s 10 months old and not 1 rash that last longer than 12 hours.</li>
            <li> The one weird thing is the way they are folded lengthwise first, but I rip a small hole in the side of the pack and pull one out at a time like diaper wipes and the unfold fairly well for use.</li>
            <li> Not as thick as the big company prepackaged wipes but can&#x27;t complain as it absorbs the solution I make and wipes easily on baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li> We use it as wipes for our 2 year old and 6 month old we just get it wet with water.</li>
            <li> We cut them in half and BAM twice as much</li>
            <li> These are very absorbent dry and hold up well when wet.</li>
            <li> they used to be specially soft, now they are very rough and they scratch my baby if I am not careful enough.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are not as soft as the other type also carried by Medline, but these are cheaper.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend says it is more expensive than the big company pre-packaged wipes but since my baby&#x27;s skin is sensitive to the other wipes these dry wipes do the job.</li>
            <li> If you buy these expecting them to be as good as the 10&amp;#34;x13&amp;#34; wipes, you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this by mistake, thinking it was the regular size dry cloth.</li>
            <li> only issue is they dont soak well when dry.</li>
            <li> I got these because I developed contact dermatitis due to sensitivity to the preservatives in wet wipes.</li>
            <li> At the rate of four per day I&#x27;ll be using this box of 1500 for a long time</li>
            <li> We are using this to dry our baby after diaper change.</li>
            <li> I put water and 1 Tablespoon coconut oil and 1 tsp castille soap on the dry wipes.</li>
            <li> this is a NAPKIN-sized dry cloth.</li>
            <li> My twin girls used to get chronic diaper rashes, and as soon as I switched to homemade wipes, they have not gotten a single rash since.</li>
            <li> Pretty thin.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that is slightly bothersome is the way these are folded.  </li>
            <li> works as expected</li>
            <li> Does the job for baby cleaning but those are rather rough :</li>
            <li> Used them for baby to avoid chemicals in the wet wipes.</li>
            <li> I have used this wipes for three years now, have I written this review before january 2015 I would have given them 5 stars, but something happened with the batch I received in january the quality decreased so much...</li>
            <li> Softer then I expected.  </li>
            <li> so this is a practical alternative to wet ones for diaper changes.</li>
            <li> Wet with water &amp; witch hazel.</li>
            <li> have to wet it to use it well.</li>
            <li> we use this a lot of our baby to replace the wet wipes.</li>
            <li> I felt it a bit rough.</li>
            <li> I love that I cut them and get double the amount, but hate having to cut them.</li>
            <li> I pull them part way out of their plastic wrap and shoot a few quirts of peppermint castile soap from my foaming dispenser along with a couple ounces of witch hazel and 6 ounces of water, plunge the wipes back down in the bag and squeeze to distribute thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Only downside of these wipes is that they are a little hard to pull apart, since they individually folded.</li>
            <li> since other wipes with additives always seemed to cause rashes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as if the other ones are padded in a way that these are not (perhaps with a mix containing finer fibers).</li>
            <li> We also use them on the changing table since the wet wipes are SO wet, and sometimes we need to do a little drying before putting on a diaper.  </li>
            <li> I cut these in half and use them for drying my babies&#x27; bottoms after using wet wipes.</li>
            <li> my little ones butt after using wet wipes.</li>
            <li> we use them for baby care and the only complaint we have is the way they are folded.</li>
            <li> I cut them in half and use them as baby wipes.  </li>
            <li> so we cut them in half</li>
            <li> and I can usually use just one wipe per diaper change unless it&#x27;s really messy.</li>
            <li> I bought these to make homemade wipes for cloth diapering my little one!  </li>
            <li> Slightly small then the ones we got in the hospital</li>
            <li> Use instead of rough terry cloth on thin skin.</li>
            <li> i usually wash it 1-2 times to keep on wiping drool off my baby&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> I hate that they are so large.  </li>
            <li> I bought a box late December and add of today 2/16</li>
            <li> As if moms would not have enough on their plate already :( â€¦.</li>
            <li> Very hard to tear.</li>
            <li> She had bad rashes, and I read that these were less irritating.</li>
            <li> I am so sad with this change of qualityâ€¦.</li>
            <li> agree they are folded the wrong way.</li>
            <li> Bit expensive</li>
            <li> otherwise it gets very expensive.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Just right  -  not too heavy not too wide - good price</li>
            <li> shipped on time, good packaging, this is exactly the same product we were given in hospital after baby arrived. works as expected</li>
            <li> I got these so I could make my own wipes for my newborn and they are great! They are large enough that one cloth can handle even the biggest diaper blowout.

            <li> Used as baby wipes, make up wipes, everything. I love these. The larger size is good too!</li>
            <li> These are really useful. The quantity is huge. Disposability is good because constantly laundering several washcloths per day is a pain and I don&#x27;t like using washcloths on fecal matter. But the economics of disposals has to be right otherwise it gets very expensive. Do the math. At the rate of four per day I&#x27;ll be using this box of 1500 for a long time (I notice this item says 1200, but I thought my purchase was 1500 for about $31). They are large enough and absorbant enough that I only need four a day so that&#x27;s good. A very good purchase.</li>
            <li> Used them for baby to avoid chemicals in the wet wipes. This box lasted four months! I also use them on baby&#x27;s face after eating and in the bath. I even use them on my face at night to remove makeup.</li>
            <li> Use these instead of baby wipes. Softer on baby&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> Slightly small then the ones we got in the hospital but they work great</li>

            <li> These make great diaper wipes-just add water. Very strong, never rip.</li>
            <li> great quality, thats the only thing i use to clean baby butt with water, instead of using wet wipe.</li>
            <li> These are working quite well. I bought them for my mother who is in a facility where they were using paper towel!! I decided to purchase these due to the softness and better care for mom. I plan to purchase more when needed. I chose the large size and distribute the packs as requested. Thank you for a super product!!</li>
            <li> These wipes are awesome, I use these for my daughter&#x27;s homemade diaper wipes. They are so strong, they are intact after being run in the laundry.</li>
            <li> For wiping my baby&#x27;s butt I prefer these to regular baby wipes that have scents and perfumes. I just add water to these</li>
            <li> We use these as baby wipes, and they work perfectly.  We make our own solution and then pour it over these in a wipes container.  They don&#x27;t feed thru like regular wipes do, but they are super soft and cost slightly less than regular wipes, when you factor in the cost of the solution we use.  The only thing that is slightly bothersome is the way these are folded.  They are folded lengthwise then width-wise, so you have to unfold them to really use the whole thing.</li>

            <li> Excellent.  Soft and just like the ones used in the hospital.  I use them for sponge baths for my newborn, diaper wipes, bathroom hand towels, etc.</li>
            <li> Great and durable. Softer then I expected.  Very hard to tear. I love it! And the price is must definitely right!</li>
            <li> These are dry wipes that are much like the wipes you get in the hospital.  My son has very sensitive skin these wipes are wonderful, nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Great product!. I am a repeat customer. My baby has very sensitive skin so this is a practical alternative to wet ones for diaper changes.</li>
            <li> We are using this to dry our baby after diaper change. It is soft enough and absorbing enough to make that job easy.</li>
            <li> We use it as wipes for our 2 year old and 6 month old we just get it wet with water. The shipping was super fast it came the next day, and I didn&#x27;t pay for that kind of shipping. I&#x27;ve been using these wipes for almost four months, they do the job.</li>
            <li> Love these medical wipes.  They are great since you can just wet them and use them instead of regular wipes.  And the same ones that we used in the hospital.  And perfect for newborn&#x27;s sensitive skin with no chemicals or fragrances.  We actually wet an entire pack and place it in a wipe warmer to make them more convenient.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted - the right size and consistency of material - I will use these for cleaning and other household chores.</li>
            <li> Great wipes! These are very absorbent dry and hold up well when wet. we use them for baby care and the only complaint we have is the way they are folded. We like to wet a bunch and put into a wipes box to have them handy. They are folded like towels, not together in a tri fold like baby wipes. They are quite large, which is awesome and the sheer amount of them makes it a smart purchase.</li>
            <li> These were the wipes that were suggested by Kaiser during my &amp;#34;How to care for a Newborn&amp;#34; class I took. During our hospital stay the nurses used these exact wipes to care for our little one and our nurse was so kind to give us a few packs to bring home. I ordered these and the box was a lot more than I anticipated. They work great and are soft too!!! I highly suggest these for newborn infants or for babies who have sensitive skin so you can just wet them with water.</li>
            <li> I use these as baby wipes for my son. I love them! The 500 box has lasted us over two months. I used to make a solution and soak them, but now I just use water. I love being able to control what ingredients touch his skin. They are great and seller shipped them quickly!</li>
            <li> Saves money, but does a good job.</li>
            <li> These are great as disposable wipes. I use tem on my baby an find them soft and absorbent. They fit perfectly in a travel huggies container which makes them even better for me :) While I wish these where a little wider if they were they wouldn&#x27;t fit in the wipe case so I&#x27;m split ok how I feel about them being rectangular.</li>
            <li> Excellent but very costly</li>
            <li> Makes great baby wipes. We just use warm water and have had no issues with irritation on our twins&#x27; skin. The wipes are soft and fabric like.</li>
            <li> My daughter had a diaper rash that wouldn&#x27;t go away no matter what I used for baby wipes. I tried these and saw results almost immediately. Within three days the rash that I had been battling for weeks was completely gone. I put them in a wipes warmer with water so they are ready to use.</li>
            <li> We use these as wipes on our granddaughter.  Excellent wipes.  Just moisten them.</li>
            <li> Unlike the 10&amp;#34;x13&amp;#34; Medline Ultra-Soft wipes, these wipes aren&#x27;t very soft!  The 10x13 wipes are suitable as baby wipes, but these are way too abrasive for that purpose.  They are also thinner than the 10x13 wipes, in addition to being smaller overall.  If you buy these expecting them to be as good as the 10&amp;#34;x13&amp;#34; wipes, you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Excellent. We use these for my baby son all the time. I like that they do not have any fragrances, since other wipes with additives always seemed to cause rashes.</li>
            <li> I learned about this product from the hospital. We cut them in half and use this with warm water and the Honest Soothing Bottom spray to make Diaper Wipes as natural as possible at home. We use the Honest Wipes when we are out and about. We love it!</li>
            <li> I use these only for my baby by just wetting them, I don&#x27;t use the wipes from the baby store</li>
            <li> I have ordered several cases of these wipes for my mom at the nursing home. She had bad rashes, and I read that these were less irritating. I agree because there has been no rashes with these. You get many wipes for less than the cost of wet wipes, and so staff can use as many as they need without worrying about running out. Also, with these wipes, the nursing home wash clothes that are rewashed and used by everyone do not have to be used. A case lasts about three month.</li>
            <li> I was using the smaller size for baby wipes and accidentally got the 10 x13 size. They are PERFECT for making your own baby wipes!</li>
            <li> We have a newborn baby and we have put these all over the house... they are softer and more absorbent than tissues. We also use them on the changing table since the wet wipes are SO wet, and sometimes we need to do a little drying before putting on a diaper.  I will be ordering more when we finally get through this giant box that I got.  I think these may become a permanent part of our household, even when our daughter grows up, they&#x27;re so useful.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping &amp; great wipes! And I appreciate the coupon for next time.</li>
            <li> I cut these in half and use them for drying my babies&#x27; bottoms after using wet wipes. They help prevent diaper rash.</li>
            <li> I have a love/hate.  I love that they make great wipes.  I hate that they are so large.  I love that I cut them and get double the amount, but hate having to cut them.</li>
            <li> Use instead of rough terry cloth on thin skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a family member who was very pleased with it.  The wipes are both durable and gentle, and overall, do the job well.  The price is outstanding compared with similar products, and it is very covenient and cost-effective to package them in large quantity.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works very well to dry clean my little ones butt after using wet wipes. Also use it to clean his face, occasional spit up etc. smaller than the one used b hospital, but works great.</li>
            <li> Amazing quality. We have been using these on our newborn baby. We soak then with warm everytime we need to use them and work like a charm. No irritation no allergies. A much better alternative to any wipe out there. I bought a box late December and add of today 2/16 we still have some.</li>
            <li> Yes!. If you make your own wipes at home just buy this. Its perfect other than them being a little big. We cut them in half and BAM twice as much haha. Really a good product and soft :)</li>
            <li> I got these because I developed contact dermatitis due to sensitivity to the preservatives in wet wipes. I moisten these with water. They have solved the main problem, but if you compare them to the wet wipes I&#x27;d been using, they are not as soft. It&#x27;s as if the other ones are padded in a way that these are not (perhaps with a mix containing finer fibers). Still, until something else comes along, these are fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree they are folded the wrong way.</li>
            <li> Absolute favorite wipe for baby. Soft, durable and hold moisture well.  I run them under warm water from the tap and then put them in the wipe warmer.  They stay moist for about a week.</li>
            <li> Just the right size for wiping baby&#x27;s butt. Not as thick as the big company prepackaged wipes but can&#x27;t complain as it absorbs the solution I make and wipes easily on baby&#x27;s butt. My boyfriend says it is more expensive than the big company pre-packaged wipes but since my baby&#x27;s skin is sensitive to the other wipes these dry wipes do the job.</li>
            <li> Smaller than the ones I ordered before, but still great quality.  I cut them in half and use them as baby wipes.  I just moisten with water and sometimes some castile soap too, but often just water.  They stay moist in my Oxo wipes container.  This is much cheaper than buying &amp;#34;sensitive skin / fragrance free&amp;#34; wipes, which I would need to for my baby&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING! I use them in place of wipes for my daughter. They are so soft and very sturdy. Not to mention they arrived in only 2 days!! Will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> Zero, nada, no(!) diaper rashes for our baby with these! He&#x27;s 10 months old and not 1 rash that last longer than 12 hours. Wet with water &amp; witch hazel. I&#x27;ve ordered these several times and will continue to use them till he&#x27;s out of diapers.</li>
            <li> Great wipes for baby! I just place them in Tupperware with some water.</li>
            <li> These are a great alternative to pre-moistened wipes for babies. We have been using them since our daughter came home from the hospital 3 months ago.</li>
            <li> these are great! perfect for our spa</li>
            <li> These are just what I was looking for to use on my daughter&#x27;s very sensitive diaper area. They are also very nice for baths and the size is perfect.</li>
            <li> Great product!!! good for baby wipes. each box will last 5 months for my twins.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, super soft cloths for makeup removal, face cleaning. They have nothing added to them so you can add your own liquid to make baby wipes, makeup remove wipes, hand cloths, etc.</li>
            <li> These a great for my baby.  She has sensitive skin and cannot use wet wipes. We just wet these with warm water and they work perfectly!!</li>
            <li> perfect wipes for my daughter&#x27;s sensitive bottom. perfect size too. On time delivery</li>
            <li> Pretty thin.  Need to use two for cleaning counter&lt;br /&gt;tops.</li>
            <li> Perfect for newborns! Brought a wipes dispenser and these fit perfectly! Nice thick quality and very soft.</li>
            <li> I make my own baby wipes using these, all natural witch hazel and Dr. Bronners for babies.  these are nice and soft</li>
            <li> I loved the dry wipes that we used in the hospital when my daughter was born and was glad that I found something similar. These hold up really well and I can usually use just one wipe per diaper change unless it&#x27;s really messy.</li>
            <li> These are as inexpensive as any I&#x27;ve found so I am pleased with them. I pull them part way out of their plastic wrap and shoot a few quirts of peppermint castile soap from my foaming dispenser along with a couple ounces of witch hazel and 6 ounces of water, plunge the wipes back down in the bag and squeeze to distribute thoroughly. The one weird thing is the way they are folded lengthwise first, but I rip a small hole in the side of the pack and pull one out at a time like diaper wipes and the unfold fairly well for use.</li>
            <li> They are the best wipes! no chemicals no fragrance. :-) I put water and 1 Tablespoon coconut oil and 1 tsp castille soap on the dry wipes. My baby has never had diaper rash (unlike my two older children because I bought other store brand wet wipes ) and will continue to use these wipes. :-)</li>
            <li> I love it that these wipes are so soft!!!!  Great size to use for cleaning the face and the hands and for use on wiping personal areas of the body.</li>
            <li> Pleased with the quality. Purchased second carton. My daughter tends to use too many at time for her new baby so we cut them in half so they last longer.&lt;br /&gt;Happy Granny</li>
            <li> great size and soft cloth</li>
            <li> These were the exact same cloths used in our hospital NICU.  Very soft, yet durable.  Great for cleaning baby without having any chemicals on them.  We used them to drip water on the circumcision and also greta during bath time.  Also, perfect to have in the diaper bag.</li>
            <li> Great unscented wipes for my baby girl. Bit expensive but you get a lot.. thanks for making it available...great ad wet ones, just damp with water they do a great job....</li>
            <li> I use these for everything from the kids to cleaning.  My mother in law loves this product too.</li>
            <li> Works wonders. Good buy. Cleans stained wall easily.</li>
            <li> Love love love as baby water wipes!</li>
            <li> FYI this is a NAPKIN-sized dry cloth. I purchased this by mistake, thinking it was the regular size dry cloth. Please put the sizing on the product information!</li>
            <li> i love this one. they are very soft. and good quantity with very good price.&lt;br /&gt;the only issue is they dont soak well when dry. have to wet it to use it well. but they are good for sponging or if the baby is allergic to other wet wipes.&lt;br /&gt;very sturdy too. i usually wash it 1-2 times to keep on wiping drool off my baby&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> So soft! I&#x27;m using them for a foster baby that was exposed to drugs at birth and has extremely sensitive skin. We couldn&#x27;t even use unscented wipes without him getting an acid burn. They used these in the NICU. These have been great!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought these to make homemade wipes for cloth diapering my little one!  They work great, I cut them in half to get more out of them as they are pretty big.  They hold up really well, even through the wash.  I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I use these to make homemade wipes. Perfect size and super soft. Fit&#x27;s perfectly in a typical wipe container. Been making my own wipes for several months now and never looked back. My twin girls used to get chronic diaper rashes, and as soon as I switched to homemade wipes, they have not gotten a single rash since. I never realized how much the chemicals in commercial wipes can have an effect on a baby&#x27;s bottom. Only downside of these wipes is that they are a little hard to pull apart, since they individually folded.</li>
            <li> Love these for making our own baby wipes</li>
            <li> We bought these to use as wipes for our preemie baby. The NICU used these same disposable cloths and recommended using just soap and water over name brand wipes because they have chemicals that can hurt the baby&#x27;s tush. we love these and definitely recommend them for use as baby wipes.</li>
            <li> we use this a lot of our baby to replace the wet wipes. I don&#x27;t remember how many times we have purchased this and we love it. But the most recent box is different quality, the size and packaging are same but it is not as soft as before. I felt it a bit rough.</li>
            <li> These wipes are amazing! We use these as baby wipes. We have had no issue using these. Baby has no adverse reactions to these cloths. They are similar to the wipes the maternity ward used in the hospital. I highly recommend these to any parent looking for an alternative to traditional store bought wipes.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery very good quality!</li>
            <li> great serving as baby wipes! We use this with water instead of the regular wipes. This gives our baby better protection with no doubt.</li>
