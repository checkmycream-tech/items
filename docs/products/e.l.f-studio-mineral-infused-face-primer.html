            <li>I love it!!</li>
            <li>Love this!!</li>
            <li>and yes it does give the skin of your face a very nice silky feel.</li>
            <li>Very nice, my makeup goes on well and my face looks smoother than ever before.</li>
            <li>Very nice thank you to upscale deal</li>
            <li>Very nice.  </li>
            <li>And this primer feels very nice on the skin..</li>
            <li>I love it, great price, great product !</li>
            <li>My foundation looks flawless over this primer and it&#x27;s very light</li>
            <li>very smooth in my face, perfect before putting bb cream.</li>
            <li>this productt is amazing for the price!</li>
            <li>This face primer is absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>It is amazing stuff!</li>
            <li>This product is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>but this one is amazing for the price!</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>This primer is amazing!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing my mother in law said I looked well rested!</li>
            <li>My skin looked perfect :)</li>
            <li>I have been using this primer for a couple years and it gives you the perfect, smooth surface to apply your make up!</li>
            <li>But THIS, oh my my, it literally feels like silk and makes my 40+ skin look better than it has in years, fills in pesky lines, controls shine and keeps my makeup looking flawless all day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lovely product it makes applying your foundation looks flawless.</li>
            <li>i love elf products, the eye shadows are the best</li>
            <li>This primer is okay, its not the best or worst.&lt;br</li>
            <li>good price for great product&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
            <li>The difference is remarkable.</li>
            <li>I love this product and it is perfect for my oily skin, the purpose of a primer is to protect your face from the makeup and to reduce the shine and this product does just that</li>
            <li>which it does a better job than if i didn&#x27;t have a primer on, but its not the best.</li>
            <li>Using this on&lt;br /&gt;Clean skin before applying my foundation creates a flawless line free face!</li>
            <li>I use mineral powder foundation on top of this primer and am very happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use to borrow hers all the time, so i decided to buy my own &amp; replace hers!</li>
            <li>Elf have great products for a good price.</li>
            <li>And one more point of reference it works great with my pricier makeup brand!</li>
            <li>This had good reviews and a great price</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own instead of as an add on item!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful and gives you a great, smooth canvas to work on &amp;</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pleasant experience!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worth it !!!!</li>
            <li>great stuff --so smooth under foundation!!</li>
            <li>It is the elf mineral face primer, fills in fine lines and creates a flawless finish.</li>
            <li>The makeup does stay on and look nice and flawless for awhile, and thats what I love.    </li>
            <li>I have oily skin and huge pores and this works beautifully on my complexion, I would say give it a try because for the price you pay and the results that I have achieved, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li>It is so light it feels almost inexistent in your face, but it works perfectly!  </li>
            <li>and this is has been good for me.</li>
            <li>But it is a good primer that does keep makeup in place.</li>
            <li>It pumps out the perfect amount, it goes on silky smooth and makeup just glides on after.</li>
            <li>I loved it, i buy it everytime i can.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never tried a primer, but I had heard a lot of good things about this one.</li>
            <li>good stuff for the price.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it once before it broke and liked it, so if you could send me another one that would be great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good value.</li>
            <li>Good price, does a good job.  </li>
            <li>but then for the price,  i still think it is a good product and will get it again</li>
            <li>and I loved how hydrating it was.</li>
            <li>good</li>
            <li>makes the makeup stay on all day even through sweat, smells good and moisturizes.</li>
            <li>I loved it and will purchase again.</li>
            <li>Feels really good and works well but doesn&#x27;t hide pores.  </li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>Good size.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s good for my oily skin.</li>
            <li>Feels like silicone but in a good way.</li>
            <li>I have to scrape it out with a tool in order to get the primer (which is good stuff, but the design is just crappy).</li>
            <li>It makes my makeup application smooth and flawless.</li>
            <li>This product is cheap and is great!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good product, but mine stopped pumping the primer out</li>
            <li>It is smooth and works perfectly!</li>
            <li>This is a good product for the cost.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t believe how good it works for $6</li>
            <li>A dab will do you, but put in your foundation immediately afterward because it does soak into the skin (in a good way).</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s good</li>
            <li>The price was good.</li>
            <li>, It feels good on my skin  </li>
            <li>It goes on like silk &amp; feels so so good on my face.</li>
            <li>give it a fair shake</li>
            <li>The moisturizer I use does just as good as a job as this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m good.</li>
            <li>Good product for the price.</li>
            <li>This one is good if you want &amp;#34;just a primer&amp;#34; - not something tinted.  </li>
            <li>I literally used up this product so good &amp; def.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t expect it to be as good</li>
            <li>It was inexpensive and had really good reviews.</li>
            <li>I have fairly oily skin that is (even at 39) still inclined to breakouts now and then.</li>
            <li>but it is a good product.</li>
            <li>feels good going on</li>
            <li>I have bought one and loved it.</li>
            <li>This is really good face primer for the price.</li>
            <li>The primer does smooth your face, it covers your pores for a flawless application of your foundation.</li>
            <li>but the price is good.  </li>
            <li>When I finish rubbing it in it leaves my face silky smooth and in perfect condition to apply my makeup to.</li>
            <li>Keeps my face smooth before my makeup and my makeup stays on perfectly.</li>
            <li>this beats the price and is a good product.</li>
            <li>ELF products are consistently a good value for the price</li>
            <li>this face primer is another GOOD product frome.e.l.f.  </li>
            <li>The service was good</li>
            <li>seems to work good.....</li>
            <li>and it has worked good for me.</li>
            <li>This seems like a good primer.</li>
            <li>i loved this</li>
            <li>but when she uses it it&#x27;s really good.</li>
            <li>Not as matte as Arbonne&#x27;s, but darn good for $6.</li>
            <li>go for this.. good results in good price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fairly inexpensive product, but it makes my face oily within a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>This is a good steal for its price.</li>
            <li>So, this is a good one in my book.</li>
            <li>I get good product makeup.</li>
            <li>does it feel really good when you spray it on, but one spray will keep your makeup set all day</li>
            <li>No need for lotion after washing ur face, just apply this and ur make up and ur good to go.</li>
            <li>Keeps my makeup fairly noncomedogenic (doesn&#x27;t go into my pores).</li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on just as good as too</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good primer</li>
            <li>so when I apply my concealer, foundation, and powder it looks so even and gorgeous.</li>
            <li>loved it thank you</li>
            <li>Works surprisingly well for the price.</li>
            <li>It arrived on time and in good packaging.</li>
            <li>Dimethicone creates a barrier on the skin that gives you that flawless, pore free look.</li>
            <li>I heard about this face primer from someone on YouTube who had tried it and loved it.</li>
            <li>and it worked really good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always up for trying E.L.F. products because it&#x27;s an affordable yet good brand.</li>
            <li>Good,</li>
            <li>but I will say my makeup looks just as good after 8 hours of work.</li>
            <li>A good primer for the price.</li>
            <li>The product itself was good, but the pumped stopped working</li>
            <li>The price is fair for the amount you receive.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, feels so wonderful.</li>
            <li>really recommend it 100% excellent quality and 100% original brand really excellent very good product.</li>
            <li>The smell does disappear after a while but it makes me wonder what the ingredients are...and if they are doing more harm than good!</li>
            <li>Got this product, was so excited bcuz it was an awesome</li>
            <li>Favorite affordable and good quality!</li>
            <li>nice texture and my makeup goes on easily and flawlessly</li>
            <li>It shipped quickly and arrived packaged perfectly.</li>
            <li>This primer gives a super flawless look to make up.</li>
            <li>When I started running out, exceptionally soon, I unscrewed the housing and took the pump out and looked inside.</li>
            <li>Just as good as the brands that charge way more!</li>
            <li>my downside, Elf is a very cheap and great makeup line.</li>
            <li>Used once, very pleased.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this was going to be better quality for a great price...  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the product itself.</li>
            <li>After the seeing all the great reviews and price I decided to purchase this primer, and I&#x27;m so glad that I did.</li>
            <li>I have bougfht e.l.f. products and have been very pleased with the results.........</li>
            <li>The product itself is like smearing rainbows and kittens your face; it&#x27;s magical and works great.</li>
            <li>I like elf, and many of there products are great but not this one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and not greasy at all!</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>It works great, and many people noticed a difference after I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>and I am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>Works great with foundation and with finishing powder over the top.</li>
            <li>under any kind of foundation me and my mom loved it</li>
            <li>Nice product at a good price.</li>
            <li>This came in handy to use before my foundation and it felt good on my skin.</li>
            <li>Love this product, goes on silky smooth and preps my face for a flawless finish.</li>
            <li>Really good primer worked great on my severely sunburned face for my makeup to go in smooth</li>
            <li>Works great for diminishing the appearance of pores, very soft and smooth and does a great job keeping your makeup looking flawless all day!</li>

            <li>I liked the product... until it ran out within a handful of uses.  </li>
            <li>As others have stated, it&#x27;s honestly quite misleading.</li>
            <li>I like how it gives a nice finish after makeup is on.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve never used primer before, and honestly I didnt even know what it&#x27;s for.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin, so this primer didn&#x27;t work the best for me.</li>
            <li>and I have an &#x27;on your feet&#x27; kind of job), it also mattifies the sheen on your make</li>

            <li>I liked the product itself.</li>
            <li>and it gives me that nice matte finish.  </li>
            <li>, in summary, it&#x27;s a great product and will probably work for most skin types and blend well with most foundations</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to buy something that isn&#x27;t tinted which has been a problem for me.</li>
            <li>Makeup slid on really well and set perfectly.</li>
            <li>so I have to kind of ration it out for a while.&lt;br /&gt;Amazed</li>
            <li>Feels nice going on</li>
            <li>Found this primer to be effective and inexpensive.  </li>

            <li>Product itself was faultless, the main problem with it is the amount in one container.</li>

            <li>This goes on silky and very easily blended.</li>
            <li>It minimized the appearance of my pores, was very easy to apply and did not cause a break</li>

            <li>just shopping or running errands, but for important nights out I will be going for the good stuff.</li>
            <li>Perfect primer its reallly silky to the skin and keeps my makeup look natural and even.</li>
            <li>Gave me the flawless but natural look i was looking for(: thank you.</li>
            <li>I wanted to order the clear primer because this was intended to be applied before foundation, and I didn&#x27;t do anything but prime my face perfectly.</li>
            <li>Fill pores nicely for most of the day.</li>
            <li>For the price it&#x27;s good, but I feel it doesn&#x27;t provide that much of a smooth foundation finish.</li>
            <li>I am really happy that this product keeps my foundation looking fresh all day and it does not fade at the end of my 18 hour day.</li>
            <li>Perfect and sooo soft</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft and my makeup stays on perfect.</li>
            <li>The pump looks good, but isn&#x27;t great - still works, just not as good as the actual product.</li>
            <li>This is the one of the most effective and amazing products I found on Amazon, you have to use it, the tone and texture of your skin will be better after applying the product</li>
            <li>They both were near perfect and did not cause any breakouts.  </li>
            <li>By far the best primer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>It is by far the best primer I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>It creates a flawless look, my pores, which are the size of the grand canyon normally, literally vanish and it makes your skin look radiant.</li>
            <li>Best part is its light weight and it feels oily when you first put it on your face</li>
            <li>This product is ok, goes on easy, lasts a good chunk of time.</li>
            <li>(Or spending them on something way more fun!!!)</li>
            <li>Glides right on, if u have great skin</li>

            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s so nice to be able to buy excellent quality cosmetics at a reasonable price -- and rare!</li>
            <li>Currently, you have no idea when you&#x27;re going to run out, so it&#x27;s best to keep a backup bottle handy at all times.</li>
            <li>its light on the face, cheap, and has great staying power with liquid foundation or minerals.</li>
            <li>It lays the foundation for the foundation, which glides over easily, and the rest of the make up.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, my pictures come out great and I attribute it to the way the light bounces off my face, and I am sure it is because of the primer.</li>
            <li>primer is awesome, I really love how it feels in my skin and how soft and silky my skin gets after applying</li>
            <li>great silky application, my first primer ever</li>
            <li>But, the first thing I noticed when I applied it was that it feels sooooo great.  </li>
            <li>I have never used foundation primers before and decided to try this after hearing some pretty great reviews.</li>
            <li>this is the first time I decide to use primer and it turn out really great</li>
            <li>It also held up pretty well allowing my face between 6 and 8 hours of great wear.</li>
            <li>this product is great at first it feels greasy on your fingers</li>
            <li>It is very silky in finish and made my foundation look beautiful.</li>
            <li>LOL ;)</li>
            <li>This product is a pretty great primer.</li>
            <li>Infused Face Primer is first of all a great bargain and is a staple in any frugal beauty queen&#x27;s battlestation.</li>

            <li>Very light weight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking that this will help you makeup go on very smoothly as it feel like silk when applied.  </li>
            <li>Though the item feels very light on your face, I just don&#x27;t see the point of it.</li>
            <li>It has a very light scent</li>
            <li>But it goes on very smooth.</li>
            <li>so its very important</li>
            <li>This goes on very smooth and primes your face for makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My skin feels very smooth.  </li>
            <li>The pump seems very cheap.</li>
            <li>It comes in a nice pump bottle which makes it easy to dispense.</li>
            <li>It went on very smooth, was very light, and my CC cream went on much better than without it.</li>
            <li>primer applies so smoothly and it the makeup apply flawless!I just love it!</li>
            <li>Good primer for every day use if you&#x27;re looking for something cheap, but you could just as easily do without.</li>
            <li>Very smooth.. Love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very good on my extremely sensitive face and one dot on your finger can spread a lot.</li>
            <li>It is a silicone-based primer that fills in all the fine lines on your face leaving your skin feeling ultra-silky smooth and ready for a flawless application of foundation.</li>
            <li>, you have to push up on the bottom, there probably is more product inside that the pump cannot reach).</li>
            <li>glad I didn&#x27;t use it yet.</li>
            <li>I still need to wear it for another week to make sure it doesn&#x27;t break me out</li>

            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Put my makeup on top and it just just glided on.</li>
            <li>love it ,love it.</li>
            <li>even works for mineral makeup which is what I use!! :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are better primers out there, but for the cost, I&#x27;ve yet to find a better one.</li>
            <li>I really love this primer.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants a great primer at a cheap price!</li>
            <li>I love the satin feel to this product</li>
            <li>I wish it came with more in the bottle..</li>
            <li>I love it&lt;</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>and i was quite happy because despite my combination skin, my nose becomes very shiny.</li>
            <li>It works okay as a primer for the price, but I prefer something lighter and more moisturizing.</li>
            <li>This is smooth, but seems to melt my makeup in about an hour!  </li>
            <li>&amp; does help me apply my make up more evenly.</li>
            <li>a couple more dollars</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m sure you can get something better</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just okay,  </li>

            <li>The product feels wonderful when you apply it prior to putting on your makeup.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I have given up and taken off the top and just pounded the bottle into my hand.</li>
            <li>I love the way my skin feels when I put this on.</li>
            <li>My favorite.</li>
            <li>Meh...it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I had an issue with the makeup wearing off and even having difficulty coming off to the point I had to wash my face many times.</li>
            <li>It makes my makeup go on so smooth!</li>
            <li>I love using this primer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Difficult to get all product out of container, I have to take the top off and use a cotton swab.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, it does the job, but I have seen better primers.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin so smooth, and feels nice to the touch.</li>
            <li>Great quality and very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s sooo much more affordable.</li>
            <li>product and I love it.</li>
            <li>I use my finger tips mostly when I apply makeup and afterwards they felt like it was sealed up....</li>
            <li>Love ittt.</li>
            <li>I love how it feels and keeps my makeup from creasing.</li>
            <li>Why I love this Primer:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>I wish I bought more.</li>
            <li>and i love it</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>However, I can&#x27;t say this is my favorite primer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>I like a more &amp;#34;dense&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t settle into skin like better primers.</li>
            <li>I use this before putting on liquid foundation and it makes the makeup apply much more evenly.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel so soft and smooth, and my makeup goes on flawlessly...  </li>
            <li>So every time I want to use it, I have to take the top off.</li>
            <li>I think the reason this catches so many people is because of the price.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Favorite face primer.</li>
            <li>And the price makes it even better.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>but I love this</li>
            <li>Ok Ladies:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is nice and smooth and makes putting on makeup so much better.  </li>
            <li>i love the fact that it is SPF.</li>
            <li>what so ever. :)</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my skin look when I wear it alone without foundation.  </li>
            <li>I was really pleased with the quality of this primer for the price you pay.</li>
            <li>Elf really does seem to be a great product for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>But I moved on the smash box face primer which i like alot better.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>love the way it grabs my bronzers.</li>
            <li>Dometimes i use it alone or under makeup :) love it</li>
            <li>LOVE this primer.</li>
            <li>I am glad that I tried this one.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Using this over your moisturizer and then followed up by the e.l.f. makeup setting spray is almost magical.</li>
            <li>Oily/combo skin may be okay with this.  </li>
            <li>For me it just kind of sat on top of my face  and didn&#x27;t create the smooth canvas for make-up</li>
            <li>I think the pump containers just seem more hygienic to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also a friend pointed out to me that although the pump container seems better, the fact is that you cannot get all the product out like you can with the potted container</li>
            <li>and I think the potted container holds more as well so</li>
            <li>Since we both have oily skin, I think the L&#x27;Oreal product is the better choice.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on my makeup the days I use this primer</li>
            <li>I love this primer</li>
            <li>I feel like the formula has changed, though, because the latest one I&#x27;ve used feels thicker and takes a bit more time to rub in.</li>
            <li>LOVE that it doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li>absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>Make sure</li>
            <li>I love this product and it&#x27;s a steal for the price.</li>
            <li>this works ok, but i found it to be a bit sticky.</li>
            <li>and I already like the Elf Primer better.</li>
            <li>My make up looks so much better on my face</li>
            <li>I love it, it just seems a bit too greasy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m okay with it</li>
            <li>I love this face primer</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I use is on top of a moisturizing cream because I have combined type of skin and then apply foundation.</li>
            <li>I felt like some sort  of magic was going on when I used this product.</li>
            <li>I decided to order this primer, and boy am I glad I did.</li>
            <li>Love this primer goes on smooth an does what it says!</li>
            <li>I have combination skin, but more on the oily side.</li>
            <li>This stuff leaves my skin so soft and smooth, and my makeup goes on with a flawless finish.</li>
            <li>Makeup goes on so much better - smoother.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff?  </li>
            <li>I bought more for my girls.</li>
            <li>It was okay, I guess.</li>
            <li>It feels great on my skin, and I find that I do not use as much makeup as I use without the primer.  </li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>:) It gets the job done though and is affordable.</li>
            <li>I have been using Primer for months and tried many.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t shine as much and it feels great when applying to my face.  </li>
            <li>If your on the fence try it youll love it.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I really do love the product.</li>
            <li>I will give it one more try after I am done with this bottle, hopefully I just got an oddball pump that is wacky.</li>
            <li>one of my favorite drugstore primer.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>Illuminating Primer (Walmart) is $2 more for three times more product.  </li>
            <li>Smooth, silky, and effective.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll learn to deal :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering us BOTH more soon :)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love it, but it&#x27;s not horrible</li>
            <li>I have tried many different primers, and this one is the best I have tried.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Even though I love the product, I don&#x27;t like the fact that I can&#x27;t see the product in the bottle</li>
            <li>I love e.l.f. products and this one</li>
            <li>Makeup sits and blends much better with this product.</li>
            <li>I would say that was more than others stated.</li>
            <li>guessing it works better for her.</li>
            <li>I WANT ONE MORE...</li>
            <li>Love this Primer.  </li>
            <li>I am going to order 3 more :))</li>
            <li>Works well for being so cheap!</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t soak in at all, and made me have the most hellacious breakouts I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a handful of primers, and this one is definitely the best product for the price.</li>
            <li>Skip it and use the money to go towards a better one.</li>
            <li>when I started using it, I recognized that my make up stay longer...love it!:)</li>
            <li>I love the way it feels on my face.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product and would recommend.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I ordered it</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind using it, but I probably won&#x27;t be buying any more.</li>
            <li>Its the same as on the website except i got it here cheaper its a great product!</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I love the e.l f.</li>
            <li>it keeps my face looking smooth and the makeup never comes off, until I wipe it off that is!</li>
            <li>It makes the foundation look and settle better.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>At one point with this and acne treatment I felt confident I didn&#x27;t need makeup.</li>
            <li>I love all elf makeup.</li>
            <li>Okay so</li>
            <li>put a BB cream on top - the primer probably defeats the moisturizing purpose of the BB cream, but it matches my complexion better than any foundation.</li>
            <li>I just love this product</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product and will be purchasing again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I love this primer, and I will keep buying it...but maybe from the ELF website since it would be cheaper than Amazon</li>
            <li>Elf primer is the best low cost primer out there.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and using it has extended the durability of my make-up by hours!</li>

            <li>I feel like I&#x27;m touching talcum powder on my face.</li>
            <li>Helps foundation set in better ans stay longer.</li>
            <li>Love this primer</li>
            <li>This is one of the best Face Primers that I&#x27;ve ran across, it&#x27;ll last for most of my work day (about 6-7 hours) without having to touch up my makeup.</li>
            <li>My skin looks more even and polished and my makeup stays on all day.  </li>
            <li>I have rosacea and need something to make my foundation cover longer and better</li>
            <li>I love Elf.</li>
            <li>However it is so silky smooth and it makes my skin feel nice.</li>
            <li>and I find that using a mineral infused primer helps my mineral makeup wear better.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the elf.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite product to buy them.</li>
            <li>Love, love this product</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I LOOOOOOOVE using Arbonne&#x27;s primer, but at $40, I don&#x27;t love paying for it.  </li>
            <li>Love that I can also find it at Target too. :-)  </li>
            <li>and my face got 10x&#x27;s more coverage than ever before.</li>
            <li>I love elf products.</li>
            <li>My favorite part.....</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product but the pump didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smoother and makeup goes on a lot better.</li>
            <li>really enjoyed this primer.</li>
            <li>It slides across your fingers and face like the most slippery lubricant you can imagine.</li>
            <li>It looks, by its size, like there is a lot more product inside it.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>nd will probably work for most skin types and blend well with most foundations</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love the primer.</li>
            <li>The most I knew was foundation.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this stuff</li>
            <li>This is okay for the price</li>
            <li>I, myself, am not a big fan of face primer until I come across one that is absolutely flawless, which I have yet to find.</li>
            <li>: After this ran out, I purchased Cover Girl BB and no longer have the need for any sort of primer, as this BB is AMAZING as a lightweight moisturizer, primer and light foundation all in one.</li>
            <li>I think it stays a bit better when using primer versus without, but the jury is still out on that one.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>but are wayy more pricey  since I&#x27;ve been using this elf primer</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad i decided to order this product.</li>
            <li>applying the primer, it magically vanishes beneath my fingertips into skin with a satin finish.  </li>
            <li>Compares to BM primer just a better value</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and this works better and A LOT cheaper.</li>
            <li>Elf is one of my favorite make up brands</li>
            <li>and i usually love their products, this one however was not my favorite</li>
            <li>again i love it.</li>
            <li>Love the texture of the product.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my face feel and helps my makeup glide on.</li>
            <li>Ehh it&#x27;s okay, not all that</li>
            <li>this product rates &#x27;okay&#x27; for me</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Get another drug store brand for $5 it&#x27;ll be better.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work or not-</li>
            <li>Love love love it.</li>
            <li>so I was okay with paying the extra 3.00 and it really is awesome.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love the fact, that this is so creamy that it makes you feel like you&#x27;re not wearing nothing..</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>My makeup stayed on better and longer, and my face did not get oily.</li>
            <li>Allows foundation to stay on for many hours and is humidity-proof.</li>
            <li>This is okay</li>
            <li>I also have the elf eye concealer which is not as awesome as this facial primer</li>
            <li>Love the primer but the pumps NEVER work.  </li>
            <li>I wonder if that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so cheap!</li>
            <li>This works just as well for me as a top brand sold for a lot more.</li>
            <li>i love this product.  </li>
            <li>love the way it feels.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smooth as butter!  </li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d imagine it&#x27;d work well with most makeup brands.</li>
            <li>I just wish there was more of it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>My foundation application has never looked more smooth and even!  </li>
            <li>and yes it would last longer but this product for the price is awesome and i even like it better than sheercovers primer.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic, cost effective primer.</li>
            <li>Was hoping it would help more when I applied my foundation.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found a better primer for the price.</li>
            <li>LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>It DOES help fill in some pores and gives a bit more of a velvety look, but it&#x27;s no miracle.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of the primer.</li>
            <li>but I have to remove the top and use a qtip to get the product in the bottle.</li>
            <li>This was ok.</li>
            <li>I would check at your local Target, I&#x27;m a very happy customer!</li>
            <li>My makeup goes on so much better with this product.</li>
            <li>Nothing fancy but better than not using a primer.</li>
            <li>Many of ELF&#x27;s products I just love.</li>
            <li>Then I tried it again (just to be sure) and again</li>
            <li>This is my favorite primer.  </li>
            <li>I like it though, and it&#x27;s so cheap!</li>
            <li>Everything just goes on smoother and looks better.</li>
            <li>Bottom-line, for the price I doubt you will find anything better than this primer</li>
            <li>You shouldn&#x27;t need more than one or two pumps.</li>
            <li>its okay.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t able to get the rest of the product out.</li>
            <li>It gives the most crazy-thin, sheer mask of coverage over your face and smooths everything out to give you a flawless canvas to put your makeup on.</li>
            <li>glad I did bc</li>
            <li>and sure helps my makeup application go wonderfully and helps it last longer!  </li>
            <li>I love ELF&#x27;s products because they are always so affordable but they also get the job done, and their face primer seems like no exception.</li>
            <li>I love putting this on before putting any makeup on my face.</li>
            <li>most of the bottle is just show, (took it apart)</li>
            <li>I wouldnt go raving about it, but it&#x27;s better than no primer at all</li>
            <li>I like it much better than my MAC primer.</li>
            <li>I will order this again for sure.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It came in great condition and it is very silky when you put it on.</li>
            <li>Awesome same quality as sephora.. save your money!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This product is just ok, i have really had much better!!</li>
            <li>I loved how my foundation and powder glided right over this product.</li>
            <li>Good to use right before you are going out for the evening.</li>
            <li>It felt great coming out of the pump (like my Smashbox and BareMinerals primers) and it felt great on my skin (like silk - as a primer is expected to feel), but it literally did nothing for my pores and it made my makeup cakey!</li>
            <li>This is a very smoothe and light primer...makes your face feel so Good!</li>
            <li>but so far so good!</li>
            <li>While this is not the absolute BEST primer, it is pretty good and the price is right.  </li>
            <li>Very silky smooth makes my makeup go one beautifully</li>
            <li>this product is pretty good goes on smooth!</li>
            <li>, this is nice and clean.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVED the silky, smooth texture - it feels great between my fingers without leaving an oily or greasy residue and it actually made it easier to apply my makeup.</li>
            <li>- I normally don&#x27;t manhandle makeup lol.</li>
            <li>applys well real soft evens up skin and does lock your makeup no smell and great price</li>
            <li>It works pretty good.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used face primer, but it seems to be fairly good quality.</li>
            <li>The staying power of this is pretty good</li>
            <li>This primer does work pretty good.</li>
            <li>When I first opened and used this product, I loved it.</li>
            <li>Made my makeup look flawless all day long, no need to keep blotting or reapplying powder</li>
            <li>This one does a pretty good job at smoothing out your face and holding on your make up.</li>
            <li>When I first put this on my face, I really loved it.  </li>
            <li>When I first purchased this primer, I loved it.</li>
            <li>and it does do a pretty good job of making your makeup application go a bit smoother</li>
            <li>I got this after reading its as good as Smashbox, I&#x27;ve never used Smashbox but this primer feels higher quality than you would expect for the price if you didn&#x27;t already know about E.L.F.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i am in my 50s this product makes my skin smooth and silky so makeup adheres better, but is very light</li>
            <li>Love the smooth finish this product gives my skin under make-up, It&#x27;s very smooth and velvety feeling.</li>
            <li>I think it helps my makeup look more even and helps hide my pours and fine lines better.</li>
            <li>It makes your face feel so smooth and your foundation glides on easily!</li>
            <li>Well I ordered 5 more &amp; these 5 were all full!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth trying girls!!</li>
            <li>The best thing ever, keeps your skin fresh and natural looking</li>
            <li>It performed &amp;#34;Ok&amp;#34; where the lines are concerned, but didn&#x27;t help with flawless coverage in the dry spot areas.</li>
            <li>everything after that goes on more evenly and easily.  </li>
            <li>The price on the E.L.F. website is $6 before shipping, so it&#x27;s a good deal here if you don&#x27;t want to buy $35 worth of makeup from the E.L.F. site to get their free shipping.</li>
            <li>Also cant beat the price, ive used bare esscentuals that cost over $20 and this stuff works just as good!</li>
            <li>With a very light layer of this primer and a light layer of my foundation, I get magazine quality coverage.  </li>
            <li>Its very light and smooth.</li>
            <li>It is silky smooth and very light weight.</li>
            <li>But works fine, better than nothing.</li>
            <li>I love to use this when I&#x27;m just running out of the door quick!</li>
            <li>With foundations, it&#x27;s always about looking good but not feeling clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>Priced just right, love it!</li>
            <li>This product not only moisturized my skin, and evened out my skin tone; it filled in the fine lines leaving my face flawless.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t begin to describe how amazing this product is, it&#x27;s so easy to apply, you just need a little quantity to apply it because it spread out nicely, and the most amazing thing is that it have that satin finish, so lovely!</li>
            <li>Made my face appear super smooth and my foundation was much more even!</li>
            <li>So huge plus plus for that one :)</li>
            <li>but I like this one because it is cheap and does its job :)</li>
            <li>It lasted all day and when I washed it off the makeup came off much more smoothly then before.</li>
            <li>I love the smooth feeling when I apply this on</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked this okay on the first use</li>
            <li>I love the smooth way</li>
            <li>I love it this works like a charm and gives you a baby doll smooth finish.</li>
            <li>I love the how smooth it is</li>
            <li>, I mix some in with my foundation to make the foundation flow, blend, and cover much, much better -- makes my skin look smooth and dewy.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this face primer, it makes my face feel as smooth as silk.</li>
            <li>Sure, it went on smooth</li>
            <li>Glad it was cheap, I would not order again.  </li>

            <li>The product arrived on time and the pump makes it easy to put on your fingertips.</li>
            <li>However, I used it up very quickly.</li>
            <li>The product itself is easy to apply, however, I notice no difference between when I use the primer, and when I don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>The primer is easy to blend onto your face and can be used all over the face.  </li>
            <li>It makes you look finished, goes on easily because it is a gel</li>

            <li>so its easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is really quite a good primer, and it&#x27;s so cheap its unreal.  </li>

            <li>Allows foundation to be applied easily and you get a smooth finish.</li>
            <li>My pump works just fine</li>
            <li>This primer is pretty good, it helps fill in my smile wrinkles so that when I apply makeup it isn&#x27;t as visible but Target sells it for 3-5 dollars</li>
            <li>but I find this one to be silky smooth &amp; easy to apply.</li>
            <li>The website claims to do the things that makeup primers are supposed to do i.e. provide a smooth canvas for easy makeup application, diminish the appearance of pores etc.</li>
            <li>It glides on like silk and fills in your fine lines and minimizes your pores like spackle.  </li>
            <li>This product did help reduce the look of pores and fine lines</li>
            <li>Looks fine with me</li>
            <li>and it works just fine.</li>
            <li>Never used a primer before I am 48 fine lines not a lot but do like the difference in how my face and make up look.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know what to expect because the product was so inexpensive, but putting it on fine lines under my eyes, I did see improvement.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine for a primer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super inlove with this!</li>
            <li>Luckily Amazon has it!</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>This primer makes my skin looks and feels super smooth after applying!</li>
            <li>Finishes too quickly!</li>
            <li>Apply on a clean face before applying any of your other makeup for best results!</li>
            <li>I was able to apply the makeup effortlessly on top of my skin and it glided easily over my large pores.</li>
            <li>NYX is almost 4x more than the super cheap ELF</li>
            <li>Great texture- made my face super soft and velvety.</li>
            <li>It was not oily, nice consistency, absorbed &amp;#34;dried&amp;#34; quickly and smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Goes on silky smooth without having to use a ton of product ... makes foundation glide on and stay on.. without settling into fine lines.</li>
            <li>The bottle is kind of large, which helps in dispensing the product, but as others have said, there is not a lot of product in the bottle.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I chose this one as my first pick!</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this product on the first try!</li>

            <li>However, this is also the first primer I&#x27;ve ever used, so I don&#x27;t have a lot to compare it to, but at the price, it seems to be the most affordable one on the market.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>But my pores were huge after a couple days of use and full of gunk.</li>
            <li>I think this is totally worth it for $6 on the ELF website!</li>
            <li>I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>This primer is definetly worth the investment!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sold on this one, so worth the buy!</li>
            <li>I wore it one night when I was going dancing and did not think it made any significant difference with keeping my face from looking too oily.</li>
            <li>It helps my makeup stay fresh and stay on longer!</li>
            <li>5 stars it is so worth it!</li>
            <li>The texture is so Unique</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear it on real hot days.</li>
            <li>Ive had alot of face primers and was excited to try this one i admit the bottle made me buy it.</li>
            <li>I love this primer, makes my makeup long lasting, is smooth and light, my skin really love it!!!</li>
            <li>The product is great but it comes on a little greasy and leaves your hands greasy but it dries on you face and becomes better</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very good; make my skin look silky and set the perfect base for foundation.</li>
            <li>feels amazing as I&#x27;ve been newly using this for a week now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used so many brand name primers like Mac and Clinique and this ELF one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit of a greasy primer which is great for dry skin.</li>
            <li>But after a couple of seconds, everything became ok - my skin appeared to be smooth, non-fatty and ready for foundation.&lt;br /&gt;The foundation (I use a liquid one)</li>
            <li>This stuff goes on so smooth and makes me face nice and soft and even for applying make up over it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a bunch of primers and this one is by far my favorite:)</li>
            <li>Makes makeup go on super smooth.</li>
            <li>Great with making creases invisible, but when i put it all over the face it made my face greasy and I have dry skin.</li>
            <li>Heard good things about this one, especially since it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>very smooth very</li>
            <li>Other wise I love it</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything special about it.</li>
            <li>On any given day I will go without makeup, but on those special occasions where I know there are gonna be pictures</li>
            <li>nothing special.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special but did the job.</li>
            <li>- I was hoping it would create a better look then it does, however, it&#x27;s certainly acceptable.</li>
            <li>Lol my friends have said the exact same thing.</li>
            <li>noticed the container wasn&#x27;t full of primer</li>
            <li>overall good primer</li>
            <li>and since I got laid off I was looking for something just as good, and obviously cheaper.</li>
            <li>I love it, very silky.</li>
            <li>I love it so much I bought another.</li>
            <li>I really liked the product and the fact that it was clear</li>
            <li>Plus the bottle is deceptive giving the impression of a lot more product than is in there, so comparing the price per ounce tells the real story.  </li>
            <li>kind of gave me a sensitive feeling.</li>
            <li>give it a go ...who knows, you might love it as much as I do ...</li>
            <li>It is true, you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a full bottle sitting on my shelf for a year.</li>
            <li>I love this primer, I really do...</li>
            <li>Another thing is that I&#x27;m never going to be able to use the whole bottle.</li>
            <li>I give it 3 stars because it has been excellent in oil control, but it hasn&#x27;t really done much for my make up lasting!</li>
            <li>Works really well and applies SO smoothly!</li>
            <li>It makes my foundation last longer, makes my face feel good, and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily.</li>
            <li>The container appears to be full and unused.</li>
            <li>I loved the product after I finally got some out!</li>
            <li>This is a very silky primer, I&#x27;ve never tried an e.l.f. product before and was pleased by the quality of this one.</li>
            <li>Full foundation and powder lasts 18 hours with this, even with oily skin that likes to sweat everything off.</li>
            <li>My latest exploration was with a makeup setting mist, and since that seemed to work, I wondered how much I needed a face primer.</li>
            <li>Maybe they are using more than they really need.</li>
            <li>This face primer is ok, it doesn&#x27;t do much for me...</li>
            <li>Just as good as smash box only a fraction of the cost</li>
            <li>To be honest, I saw no difference in using this or going completely without primer.</li>
            <li>At about $6 a bottle, it works better than Smash Box which costs almost five times as much.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had no problems with breakouts, and it lasts a full day for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>I loved the way this product felt and the way it made my makeup look, but there is not enough product in this bottle.  </li>
            <li>and this keeps me looking cool all day.</li>
            <li>at least I haven&#x27;t found a perfect primer yet...</li>
            <li>so 2 pumps are good enough.</li>
            <li>this is a good product but not much different then my drug store on.</li>
            <li>it gives you a natural shine all day and it helps keep your make up looking nice</li>
            <li>Not as good as the one currently using.</li>
            <li>and i have seen no bad reactions.</li>
            <li>There is work which can be extended to the whole face and is perfectly made smooth in slight quantity!</li>
            <li>but.. you&#x27;d think its something oily though its also dry and anyway, whatever it is, it spreads so nicely!</li>
            <li>It has no weird smell, and washes off really easy.</li>
            <li>It has helped to actually smooth my skin out and make my pores smaller, I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>It holds back my oily skin all day, goes on smooth and my skin doesn&#x27;t break out any more!</li>
            <li>It makes it just glide on, and it really does smooth over pores and fine lines.</li>
            <li>But Perhaps too light for those needing a heavier primer for aging and fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;I have never broken out from Makeup before in all the years</li>
            <li>It is very easy and seems to make a small difference, in a good way.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other face primers and for the price this is a great purchase.  </li>
            <li>I love the product, but the bottle was too small, and I don&#x27;t see a more cost effective way of purchasing the product</li>
            <li>its a little much for the June thru October months in Florida but in.the winter its perfect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so hard to find good quality in cost effective products.</li>
            <li>I will most definitely use again. :)</li>
            <li>If I could describe the texture…its between a super lightweight powder &amp; a pearl feel.</li>
            <li>This dries quickly and did not clog my pores.</li>
            <li>Goes on silky smooth and really works at having your foundation appear smooth.  </li>
            <li>My oily skin isn&#x27;t aggrivated or made super greasy,  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel smoother, and it does make me look more vibrant.</li>
            <li>We love E.L.F. and started using it mainly because of the price and on the recommendation of a friend.  </li>
            <li>Sure, it&#x27;s on the cheap end as far as cosmetics go</li>
            <li>/&gt;Feels great going on (like satin!)&lt;br /&gt;Makeup last much longer compared to when I wasn&#x27;t using one&lt;br /&gt;Keeps</li>
            <li>Next time I rather spend a bit more and get something better.</li>
            <li>I just bought this item to bring my total to free shipping and it has proved to be a nice item to have.</li>
            <li>I am sure that different brands offer better primer though.</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick and item was packaged well.</li>
            <li>I use some expensive makeup and there is no way I&#x27;d pay more for a primer than this, because it works great!</li>
            <li>Other than that, the product does what it says it would, and for a pretty good price i might add!</li>
            <li>Anyway, my T-zone stays fresher and doesn&#x27;t shine too quickly.</li>
            <li>I wear this directly on top of my moisturizing face lotion and then put on my face powder and in this winter weather it helps keep my face looking and feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Runs out too quickly.</li>
            <li>I love it and will be ordering more when I start to get low.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this primer to anyone looking :)</li>
            <li>makes my skin silky smooth before makeup application although the amount in the bottle is deceptively small, very good product thank you very much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many primers high end and drugstore.  </li>
            <li>I use it daily under an HD foundation and it really does a good job of evening out fine lines.</li>
            <li>I have other primers and so far this is the best one.</li>
            <li>my foundation does go on pretty smooth.</li>
            <li>I agree wth most of the other reviewers, this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>However, today I wore the primer for the first time in the sun under some light mineral makeup and bronzer.</li>
            <li>I normally use a moisturizer and liquid foundation, but many YouTube makeup tutorials recommended a primer, so I just had to try it.  </li>
            <li>you just need a very very small amount and it goes along ways, and it feels like your putting on silk on your face, its very smooth and very nice feeling,</li>
            <li>While it does make my skin feel silky smooth and my makeup looks good over it, it doesn&#x27;t seem to work quite as well as the other two I mentioned.</li>
            <li>Overall very satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li>although makeup glides on smoothly after i applied it, I really dont see a significant difference after applying it vs not applying it.</li>
            <li>At the end of a long day where I&#x27;m running around and sweating, my makeup stays in place and my face is fairly matte.</li>
            <li>I use to purchase this about a year ago and it was great for my skin in keeping the shine down.  </li>
            <li>This ELF product is easily just as good as the Smashbox version and it costs waaay less.</li>
            <li>I use it for special occasions as I usually don&#x27;t wear foundation or anything, but this makes my skin so smooth and nice, I love it.</li>
            <li>I never used a &amp;#34;face primer&amp;#34; before, so I was kind of skeptical, but this product goes on smoothly and very nicely</li>
            <li>Works good to fill in pores and lasted me a long time!</li>
            <li>This primer works great, fills in pores, is so smooth going on and keeps my makeup (usually a BB cream and a mineral powder finish)</li>
            <li>Was concerned with sensitive skin that &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; product would irritate or not work for me, but I&#x27;ve gone through the whole bottle no issues and very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I have visible pores, and this primer does a great job of making them a lot less visible.  </li>
            <li>This is the first primer I have tried and it seemed to work very well to begin with, but now I am not so sure.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and it feels unbelievable on my skin and my makeup goes on flawlessly!!!!</li>
            <li>Not worth what it does to your face for the rest of the week even if it goes on smooth and feels good on the day you use it.  </li>
            <li>It was pretty cheap and definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and really does prime your face for denser makeups like concealer.</li>
            <li>makeup stays for a long time and it seems so much more healthy than using the oil based lotions</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive as well meaning that most products that I put on my face will break me out.</li>
            <li>and I think it could last me a year or more even!  </li>
            <li>:) Also makes my skin feel soft!</li>
            <li>I gave this primer to my mom (as a gift with some other beauty things she wanted) and she said she really liked it!</li>
            <li>I came back to amazon to order more primer and saw the elf setting spray!</li>
            <li>highly recomend, thsi item!!!</li>
            <li>After my shower, I put this on and my skin is ready and radiant for my make-up!!</li>
            <li>Feels sheer and light, pretty nice feeling on the skin.</li>
            <li>I noticed the first day I used it that I never needed to touch up my foundation or cover up at all!</li>
            <li>smoothens my make up for a more natural look!</li>
            <li>Goes on easily and smoothly with a silky finish that minimizes imperfections despite the fact that it&#x27;s clear.  </li>
            <li>This primer is very light, and it&#x27;s so soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Great product, doesn&#x27;t go very far-- just not enough to the bottle.</li>
            <li>My skin feels very smooth and my makeup looks as natural as ever.</li>
            <li>This primer feels very smooth and soft when I apply it to my skin.</li>
            <li>Lessens appearance of fine lines &amp; skin stays softer &amp; moisturized much longer.</li>
            <li>I is very light and silky and it goes on smoothly and last all day.  </li>
            <li>Great product but so little in bottle</li>
            <li>Without causing any irritaion it softly &amp;#34;fills in&amp;#34; the fine lines and wrinkles leaving a smooth surface to apply my foundation.</li>
            <li>but it is far from the best, being a little too sticky.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>Wow I just tried it and made a huge difference in the way my foundation came on and stayed!</li>
            <li>It really smooths out the face and allows my foundation to go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Again, I&#x27;m no makeup expert, but I can say that this primer makes my face feel really smooth and really does the job well in priming my face for foundation or tinted lotion or anything.</li>
            <li>This seems to fill in my pores and really makes my skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li>This stuff really seems to help smooth out my skin</li>
            <li>I really like how smooth this product goes on and it does indeed feel like silk.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight and gentle on skin.</li>
            <li>it literally covers ur whole face with one pump...leaves a smooth matte canvas to apply ur makeup...</li>
            <li>This primer goes on really smooth but doesn&#x27;t make my makeup stay on much longer than without.</li>
            <li>I was very amazed how smooth this was to apply on my face</li>
            <li>Great for everyday use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think they are cheap but work very well.  </li>
            <li>Revlon is very creamy whereas this one is like a jelly but not greasy and feels silky smooth.</li>
            <li>however i wouldnt recommend this product, the elf mist and set spray because it is amazing, not only</li>
            <li>It makes my pores literally disappear and really does feel like I&#x27;m applying something silky smooth to my skin.  </li>
            <li>Makes your face smooth and silky but there isnt much at all in the bottle</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light, but can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s really works.</li>
            <li>This is definitely worth every penny</li>
            <li>I rarely use primers so when I used this one, it was so yummy.</li>
            <li>Love this and so soft on face</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a nice primer.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>I love how soft and silky this makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>beyond that it is fairly clear and healthy.</li>
            <li>this price, it really is a worth trying product.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that its clear &amp; goes on like body lotion, so it blends well.</li>
            <li>sure that when you apply the primer you have a completely washed face.</li>
            <li>I recommend it, it&#x27;s worth a try &amp; you might like it too.</li>
            <li>but it is worth the money</li>
            <li>and it makes ur face so soft I love it</li>
            <li>i thought it was worth mentioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice simple primer.  </li>
            <li>but this goes on quite nicely and feels extra silky!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a bit of a makeup snob, so take that for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>but that was really the only good thing about it.</li>
            <li>Worth a try</li>
            <li>Aside from the size, I honestly have no complaints, and I would definitely buy again and would recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li>Without this primer, I need more makeup to cover my face but this helps me spread it around evenly and naturally.  </li>
            <li>: I rarely wear makeup, maybe 3-4 days a month.</li>
            <li>mostly laugh lines, around my mouth.</li>
            <li>It just kind of left an oily film on my face.  </li>
            <li>I Love How Soft It Makes My Face Feel &amp;&amp;</li>
            <li>When I can actually get the product out i love it and its silky smooth.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feelings airy, light and silky smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with how soft it is.</li>
            <li>Even better buying direct from the companies site.</li>
            <li>i think this product is worth</li>
            <li>I love how soft it feels when it goes on your skin.</li>
            <li>It keeps it on and looking fresh all day</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite e.l.f product.</li>
            <li>Also,  I go for the more natural look and don’t like to feel like I have anything on my face, this product feels weightless .</li>
            <li>I have used this product only once (I am waiting on my other makeup from amazon to come) but it works on great!</li>
            <li>the e.l.f. primer runs out pretty quickly, but for $5-6 a bottle I&#x27;m not complaining.</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;m just use to using what I use normally, which I guess is a bit thicker and fills in any large pore/scar a bit better.</li>
            <li>I have not used other primers but think that it is a good purchase for this price.</li>
            <li>I loved how even though it was hot outside, my face didn&#x27;t sweat much and didn&#x27;t get oily</li>
            <li>Other than that this product is good.</li>
            <li>and this is the only that holds of my oiliness for about a good 5 hrs and more if I do minor blotting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many primers that claim to be &amp;#34;high-end&amp;#34; but really just have a high price.  </li>
            <li>Make up and blush just glides right on and stays put all day.</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and this just seemed to make my foundation melt right off my face and leaves my skin looking splotchy and greasy.  </li>
            <li>but it melts right into my skin</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right</li>
            <li>I had read the reviews and they were right.  </li>
            <li>This primer right here is the bomb.</li>
            <li>It made my liquid foundation glide right over my pores.</li>
            <li>is always having promos so most likely, you won&#x27;t be paying full price.</li>
            <li>I looked in the mirror and sure enough, my forehead wasn&#x27;t as full coverage looking as I put it on, it did hold onto some of the makeup though.</li>
            <li>i use lees makeup than before and i looks more natural, am going to get another one pretty soon.</li>
            <li>It felt nice on my skin, sort of like Vaseline, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in how my makeup goes on or how long it looks fresh.  </li>
            <li>The primer is super light weight and goes on clear.  </li>
            <li>so applying my make up over it is easy, I do end up having to use more than I expected of it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I was expecting to like this product that much, but I found the product to be very lightweight and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>but when you rub it into your face it goes on smoothly and then makes your skin feel super soft, my make up now lasts all day</li>
            <li>Loving it so far... Goes only smoothly &amp; helps my foundation glide on just right.</li>
            <li>I have purchased four different primers in the last week and this one works the best so far.</li>
            <li>this primer is comparable to bare minerals&#x27; prime time in consistency and texture, but at a much more affordable price.</li>
            <li>Makes face a nice smooth canvas just be careful not to use too much</li>
            <li>I usually use Rimmel, but Elf is actually great.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and definitely helps the mineral foundation not collect in fine lines.</li>
            <li>I think this texture would be great for anyone with dry or normal skin as it is very silky</li>
            <li>but if you have a little more money to spend and are looking for something that will help with more size I recommend either Benefits \\&quot;Porefessional\\&quot; or Too Faced \\&quot;Primed and Poreless\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I applied with my right hand and used my clean left hand to make sure it really felt like that.</li>
            <li>what brand I&#x27;m wearing I&#x27;m certain you will see a boost in your sales!</li>
            <li>Normally, I think a travel size is overpriced and crazy, but in this case I plan to buy a travel sized of Smashbox to keep on hand for those special times when I really want to be sure my makeup is and stays flawless.  </li>
            <li>First time I used it, I could tell a difference right away.  </li>
            <li>This product was so much better than expected because the price was so cheap.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to spend money on a primer, I&#x27;d suggest spending a few more dollars on one that works better.  </li>
            <li>a great product, only thing about it that bothers me is that the quantity is not enough, so I have to buy 2 bottle every time.</li>
            <li>I have been using a primer for over a year that I liked, but that wasn&#x27;t holding back the oil from my oily skin very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy nor does it have any strong scent.</li>
            <li>Goes on as soft as pearls without feeling sticky or thick and holds my makeup on all day not to mention awesome price.</li>
            <li>but you get more product and most importantly, no breakouts.</li>
            <li>No harsh or floral smells, easy to apply</li>
            <li>It is a great alternative to more expensive products.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it is a good primer that spreads on clear.  </li>
            <li>The product went on like silk, made my skin feel so soft and smooth and kept my makeup looking fresh.  </li>
            <li>Very soft and skin after is realy smooth.</li>
            <li>Giving a smooth young skin look!</li>
            <li>Decent primer, nothing special.</li>
            <li>If you have dry patches, although this is nice and moisturizing, use lotion first.</li>
            <li>e.l.f. products comes with very reasonable price tag</li>
            <li>I plan to repurchase this product once I run out, which might take awhile because you also don&#x27;t need to use very much.</li>
            <li>The primer is extremely smooth on my skin and it works better than I expected!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I suggest you fix this, since many people&#x27;s comments reflect the same.</li>
            <li>Lasts all day, even when it&#x27;s hot out.</li>
            <li>My first time trying primer, and I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li>This was actually my first primer &amp; I like it.</li>
            <li>I use it mostly on my cheeks and around the areas of my eyes that are likely to get creases.</li>
            <li>I have tried several primers and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>My first primer</li>
            <li>Works exactly as it should.</li>
            <li>Intend to buy more on the future!</li>
            <li>This is the first time for me getting a primer</li>
            <li>Once the product is out I&#x27;m probably going to invest in a higher quality primer.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t go wrong with this, makeup goes on beautifully!</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it needs to do.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with primer.</li>
            <li>This is not only that, but it&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li>If these are issues that you&#x27;re trying to address, perhaps you&#x27;d be better served by purchasing a different product.</li>
            <li>If you get this primer make sure you keep the lid on to keep it from drying out, it will last longer!!</li>
            <li>I had never used a primer before so this was the first time for me.  </li>
            <li>This is my first primer</li>
            <li>It got clogged after the first use.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how light weight it was.</li>
            <li>but I can tell a big difference in the application of my face paint :)</li>
            <li>First time trying this</li>
            <li>This was my first time using primer</li>
            <li>If they are going to sell small stuff they better be more careful with this kind of orders because its easier to get lost if they send it separately.</li>
            <li>primer works better than the two I mentioned above.</li>
            <li>This is my first e.l.f.</li>
            <li>When I first bought it it came to me with a lot of the product in its box.</li>
            <li>and I had no weird skin reaction.</li>
            <li>They advertise in the details \\&quot;Why pay more when you can have the same quality for less?\\</li>
            <li>It just glides on your skin and makes it feel so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I tend to get very oily but with this primer, I hardely ever get oily anymore!</li>
            <li>I used this the first time when I went to a concert and amazed at how well it held up.</li>
            <li>Ladies, if you love makeup, I would definitely suggest this primer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried expensive primers but this one is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I put my whole hand over the nozzle when i go to use it, otherwise it gets on my wall!</li>
            <li>Let me first say I purchased this at Target</li>
            <li>I have never used a product like this before and for a first time</li>
            <li>It came fast!</li>
            <li>Purchased because I wanted to try primer for the first time.</li>
            <li>My makeup applied much smoother with the Elf Primer!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first of December</li>
            <li>Actually like it a lot more than the $$$ one.</li>
            <li>You can get much better primers for a similar price.</li>
            <li>when you first out it on.</li>
            <li>It actually makes my makeup smear more than without it.</li>
            <li>My first time using a primer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>pretty well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just received  the primer first day of use</li>
            <li>I never knew what a primer was until I started looking at make-up reviews on Amazon and saw where a lot of people were talking about using primer first.</li>
            <li>It spreads nicely, feels light and creates a great base for my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first day I got it, I applied it to my skin to see how it made it feel</li>
            <li>The first couple of times I used 1 pump</li>
            <li>I have already recommended it to several people who are also pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m quite satisfied.</li>
            <li>Love this primer.... especially for the price!!  </li>
            <li>There are a handful of (much) higher end products that I like better, but this achieves the same result while remaining wallet-friendly.</li>
            <li>I was an avid e.l.f.</li>
            <li>This is the first mineral infused primer I&#x27;ve tried, so I can&#x27;t compare it to others.  </li>
            <li>Works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it should.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>First used e.l.f.</li>
            <li>I have used many products that claim to help with oil control and this actually worked .</li>
            <li>I love the product itself, but the container is such a hassle that I&#x27;d rather use something else.</li>
            <li>when i saw this on amazon i thought it was worth the try for the reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>so it helps keep my day going without having me worry about how much oil had accumulated on my face!</li>
            <li>Regardless of the great quality, for $6 I was expecting to have received at least twice the amount of product.</li>
            <li>I bought this on the ELF website in order raise the price of my order total in order to comply with a promo deal, and I have to say that I was pretty much satisfied.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t exactly like was the layout of the bottle.</li>
            <li>So the pump stopped working after the first use.</li>
            <li>Not that big of a deal since I can still get to the make up, but an inconvience since i have to unscrew the top and use a q-tip or something to scoop some out.</li>
            <li>This is the first one I&#x27;ve ever bought</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s really saying something)!</li>
            <li>This is my first time I have ever used a primer in my life.</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more.</li>
            <li>First of all I purchased this product from ELF and not Amazon.  </li>
            <li>First time using primer ever</li>
            <li>My skin tends to be more on the dryer side, so after a basic exfoliation I apply this on</li>
            <li>This is my first time using primer</li>
            <li>Just give it a minute or 2 before applying the next product, i think it helps :)</li>
            <li>The only thing that I can say that I didn&#x27;t like was how small it is, but it&#x27;s ab awesome primer.</li>
            <li>It felt s pretty shiney with it on.</li>
            <li>and my makeup did not move on a hot sunny day.</li>
            <li>Its very similar and its more at $11</li>
            <li>Why pay more at the mall for the same results.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t use more than necessary.</li>
            <li>When I put the toothpick in, and it hit the bottom, MOST of the toothpick was still above the rim.</li>
            <li>One pump will be more than enough for your face.</li>
            <li>funny how construction terms made their way into the beauty</li>
            <li>I think the primer erases all friction and the skin becomes pretty even.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin SOOOOO soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using a product like this</li>
            <li>it does perfectly, EXACTLY what a primer is created to do.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because I heard it is a dupe of a higher end primer.</li>
            <li>so I definitely recommend this to others to try as see for themselves!:)</li>
            <li>This helps with that pretty well.</li>
            <li>it feels a bit greasy at first but does not break me out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>love it and can&#x27;t wait to get back to the States.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think that that tiny, sample-sized bit of product is worth 6 bucks, even though I enjoyed it while it lasted.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be sure to check my next bottle to see for the hose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Looks like there&#x27;s more than there actually is...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that there are more expensive primers that would work better</li>
            <li>It works so well for me though that I&#x27;m not even sure I&#x27;d want to try a different brand.</li>
            <li>Definitely going to order more.</li>
            <li>Specifically I use it with essence soft-touch mousse (relatively inexpensive), and faceatelier ultra foundation pro (more spendy).</li>
            <li>Did feel soft and smooth but COATED.</li>
            <li>Have recommended to pretty much everyone I know!</li>
            <li>i love it makes my eye shadow last longer.</li>
            <li>I opened it and immediately had to open the top and shake out the product.</li>
            <li>It does not come with much, so u have to ask yourself if it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t beat the price &amp; it works very well!</li>
            <li>Let me start off by saying this is the first primer I have used</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s kinda pretty.</li>
            <li>If for some weird reason I needed primer for my fingers or hands then it feels great!</li>
            <li>I really like this primer!</li>
            <li>This is the first primer I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the first time I used a primer</li>
            <li>My face is so smooth and soft after using it.</li>
            <li>It feels good on the skin, it&#x27;s not oily and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>
            <li>e.l.f. is plating some tricky little games in an effort to get more money, something that I strongly disapprove of.</li>
            <li>I am somewhat new to the make up world and decided to give this product a try since I had been hearing so much about why using a primer is important.</li>
            <li>Super smooth and does a terrific job.</li>
            <li>This has definatley made my foundations go on more smoothly and crease less.</li>
            <li>It really helps to even out my skin tone, reduce my pores, and provide just the right amount of moisture to my face.</li>
            <li>I am very prone to acne and peeling skin if I don&#x27;t use the right products.</li>
            <li>When I first apply it, it feels like heaven - super creamy, satiny, soft, excellent coverage, so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I am on some very strong prescription acne drugs, so my face gets very dry.  </li>
            <li>I would rather pay a little bit more to have the container actually filled up.</li>
            <li>(It most likely is purely magical for those with skin not nearly as problematic as mine.)</li>
            <li>I originally bought this product directly from e.l.f.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used some of Elf&#x27;s other products and liked them.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, make-up applies easily over it, and feels amazing!</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t get real wrinkles or crow&#x27;s feet, but it will smooth the natural texture and crinkles in your skin.</li>
            <li>Apparently, the primer bottle worked just fine.</li>
            <li>And it truly last all day, which is is surprising because it totally controls my my oily skin.</li>
            <li>I use this everyday and must say that I love the way it even outs my skin and allows makeup to be applied evenly and smoothly.</li>
            <li>the whole white bottle isn&#x27;t filled with it!</li>
            <li>The e.l.f. studio mineral infused face primer is such a nice primer, leaves your face feeling really really soft and make up (liquid foundation)</li>
            <li>Soft, smooth and very lightweight.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and seamless and dries fast.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and for being my first primer, this works pretty well.</li>
            <li>My order arrived early, and after using it the last two days, I am thrilled.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light and &#x27;soft&#x27;, it almost has a greasy feel to it, which I really don&#x27;t like..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather just pay the price for a GOOD primer that will last longer, you&#x27;ll end up spending the same price anyways.</li>
            <li>It certainly is cheaper than Smashbox and pretty comparable.  </li>
            <li>The actual primer is adequate, nothing special.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure what type of skin this is good for, but it definitely is not for sensitive/acne prone skin and most definitely does not hide any fine lines of any sort.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used primers in the past and they have been excellent at keeping the make up on my face for a long time - which is the main purpose of primers! -</li>
            <li>This was either drained of its product before being shipped to me, or comes with pretty much no product in it at all.  </li>
            <li>I had planned on ordering a primer from Nyx, and really should have gone with my first choice.</li>
            <li>clearly no one thought to check to see if the pump on the bottle would be able to handle it.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s better for me to get it from here, especially since I never buy enough makeup at one time to get the free shipping from the e.l.f. website.</li>
            <li>Sure, it works, but how long did you expect it to work for?</li>
            <li>Pretty much close to no &#x27;excess&#x27; sebum</li>
            <li>Very affordable and works as a primer for about 4 hours instead of 10 like higher priced brands.</li>
            <li>and it dries pretty fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how good it is for your skin.  </li>
            <li>Just as good, if not better, than the pricey primers I&#x27;ve purchased through Sephora or Department Stores.</li>
            <li>Let me tell you firsthand, I have seriously upgraded in the world of cosmetics and it was cheap!!!</li>
            <li>It was my first time to use a primer, and I will still be trying new primers, but I will most likely buy this again!</li>
            <li>OKAY - why has it taken me so long to use this?!</li>
            <li>all day long! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Should I be letting it dry more?</li>
            <li>I have red and discolored areas on my face, and this help my face look more normal.</li>
            <li>when buying this, I have a lot of skin allergies that easily get bothered with facial products.</li>
            <li>If I touch my skin now, it&#x27;s super soft.</li>
            <li>but this primer made my skin super soft and silky to the touch.  </li>
            <li>Someone with dry skin may have better results with it.</li>
            <li>It goes on silky and makes my makeup look smooth and fresh all day long.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, a little goes a long way, and the price is amazing.</li>
            <li>It makes my large pores almost invisible.</li>
            <li>I am still a MAC addict at heart, but since I would rather travel and pay my mortgage, certain sacrifices have to be made...</li>
            <li>I am hooked and have already purchased a few more!</li>
            <li>This is some good stuff.its soft and light.the bottle is somewhat on the small side, but it&#x27;s worth it when you apply it to your face.</li>
            <li>This makes the price literally cents a day for a product that smooths out the fine lines in my face, makes other products more effective and vibrant, and generally makes applying other makeup easier.</li>
            <li>however it didn&#x27;t last me very long, it is good for the price.</li>
            <li>th silky silicone that fills in fine lines and smooths out the larger ones.</li>
            <li>I know Amazon would have done a replacement but didnt seem necessary since the product inside was still fine.</li>
            <li>The well, from the bottom to the top of the mouth of it where the other bits screw onto it, it&#x27;s exactly 1 inch.  </li>
            <li>primer itself works fine, and I use it regularly.</li>
            <li>This gel primer is lightweight, and seems to work pretty decent at keeping the shine at bay, which my oily rosacea skin appreciates.</li>
            <li>The primer is nice and silky, and a little bit goes along way.</li>
            <li>It is an okay quality for a good price, but is nothing like urban decay or other mid or high end primers.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff, I use it every single morning!</li>
            <li>I do have large pores and it doesn&#x27;t really minimize pore size, but it smoothes my skin out so much.  </li>
            <li>This ELF primer smells great and only takes a little bit to get the coverage you need.</li>
            <li>It left my face smooth and foundation stay put the whole day.</li>
            <li>I noticed a HUGE improvement in the amount of time that my makeup would last.</li>
            <li>It glides onto my skin smoothly and I don&#x27;t need a whole lot to evenly cover my entire face.</li>
            <li>Also, to address the comments on the deceiving packaging... they&#x27;re accurate, but you&#x27;ll get the same thing if you buy it in store.</li>
            <li>Really, I was amazed with how well this works and</li>
            <li>I promptly opened the whole bottle to view the inside to see if it had been tampered with(by the way if you use it once</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve been caking on foundation to cover, you really need to drop that habit and get this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Very deceiving.  </li>
            <li>It seemed the bottle does not hold much</li>
            <li>It leaves the skin feeling silky and smooth, controls the shine and makes powder and foundation last longer.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t do much to even that out</li>
            <li>It made my foundation stay on very well</li>
            <li>Primer smooth my face out when mixed with cream foundation.</li>
            <li>it truly beats the whole purpose.     </li>
            <li>I think it works really well to put on before foundation.</li>
            <li>It improved the stay of my makeup and reduced how much oil i produce for a longer period</li>
            <li>It has this silky &amp;#34;silicone&amp;#34; feel to it, which I absolutely detest.</li>
            <li>It looks like I&#x27;ve been at the gym, but really I&#x27;ve just been sitting on the couch.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I have spend too much time tying to get the pump to work.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference.</li>
            <li>my face.&lt;br /&gt;i don&#x27;t really use foundation</li>
            <li>As for keeping your face oil free with the make up , not entirely.</li>
            <li>I really like this primer</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really misleading.</li>
            <li>I gave this product 5 stars because it seems to work just as well as my fav Vail primer which cost about 6x&#x27;s as much.  </li>
            <li>It really moisturized my skin.</li>
            <li>I use Mac Face powder which goes on very well</li>
            <li>, i found this at target and its really inexpensive.</li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t like the odor it emits.</li>
            <li>but I think it is causing me to break out on parts of my face that I accidentally use too much on.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin, and my forehead and cheeks tend to get real oily</li>
            <li>Even though is very inexpensive</li>
            <li>I do really like it.</li>
            <li>I have a very oily T-zone during fall/winter times - I have no idea</li>
            <li>When I took the top off to see if there was a clog I saw that the container was almost empty.</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t need much either; people say 2 pumps, I say 1 pump, so I guess it depends.</li>
            <li>this product leaves such a smooth finish.</li>
            <li>But after I apply this primer, it blends really well, my face feels so smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so greasy, it really isn&#x27;t meant for oily skins.</li>
            <li>This one is really working for me and helped my make-up stay longer.  </li>
            <li>If you use too much of this silicone based primer</li>
            <li>/&gt;Downsides are that it doesn&#x27;t have SPF protection and doesn&#x27;t really have much moisturizing qualities.</li>
            <li>i spent 50$ on more e.l.f. products.</li>
            <li>I really like this e.l.f.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do that much though.</li>
            <li>and I feel like I get my money&#x27;s worth out of it so far.</li>
            <li>If it wasn&#x27;t for the pump being broken I&#x27;d give it 5 stars because like I said this is a great product just screwed up packaging.</li>
            <li>very drying, but does its job</li>
            <li>REALLY</li>
            <li>I really like this one</li>
            <li>THANK YOU SO MUCH.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li>It looks like very liquidy goo, but once it touches your skin and you blend it out, it feels mineral-like.</li>
            <li>but I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>You get a smoother finish and don&#x27;t have to use as much product.</li>
            <li>it is very smoothing without being overbearingly greasy, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Just one pump does my whole face.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need to use as much foundation even.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really tell a difference with or without using it.</li>
            <li>I even have noticed that the make up doesn&#x27;t slip from my face as much as it use to.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li>My skin is very oily by itself, and the primer made my skin surface even greasier.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Didn&#x27;t really do much for my skin besides made it feel slippery</li>
            <li>One pump and ur ready...</li>
            <li>This primer has really helped prolong the wear of my make up.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know how much product is in there.</li>
            <li>The product is fabulous and you don&#x27;t need a lot, I just wish I could monitor how much is left.</li>
            <li>All the people complaining about how much you get like really??</li>
            <li>Feels really oily.</li>
            <li>I really like this face primer.</li>
            <li>The brush really does distribute the foundation evenly.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t put powder on immediately after foundation because your face is still really moist from the primer.</li>
            <li>It had a really greasy feeling on my skin and gave the feeling of caking it on.</li>
            <li>For the price I really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>i really can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s working&lt;</li>
            <li>(really that&#x27;s all you need</li>
            <li>up/skin - you look powder fresh nearly all day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would definitely re-buy this product because of the:&lt;br /&gt;- cheap price</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make the pores look smaller, but it does provide a smooth canvas for you to work with.</li>
            <li>My make-up stays on so much longer.  </li>
            <li>I can go the whole day without my eyebrows sliding off of my face.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to just give this a one star.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really complain about the quantity since they specifically told you how much product was in there on the product&#x27;s page.</li>
            <li>my whole life, no wonder</li>
            <li>I also use just 1 pump/drop for my whole face.</li>
            <li>Works very well with my makeup.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t say that very often.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>and it keeps my makeup put for the whole day.</li>
            <li>Do not put too much on or you will get greasy skin.  </li>
            <li>I really like this primer.</li>
            <li>I apply it before getting ready for work, have my coffee and read some</li>
            <li>one pump does my whole face including my eyelids, and if I&#x27;m going out</li>
            <li>You are now ready to paint your face.</li>
            <li>I wanted to purchase some then because it makes application of your make up so much easier.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really have much knowledge on them, but</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have much of an odor</li>
            <li>It holds my makeup in place and holds up well throughout the day (I have REALLY oily skin</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>the delievery fast and wrapped well too.  </li>
            <li>so  dont really have anything to compare it to</li>
            <li>but I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I really like ELF but when compared with Benefits $30 primer and it can&#x27;t stand up.</li>
            <li>I am very dissatisfied.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>did not report to customer service, the price was cheap enough</li>
            <li>The texture is really neat.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel even and make-up ready.</li>
            <li>makes your make up shine thru really fast.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for me.</li>
            <li>i would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Really like this.</li>
            <li>Makes skin silky smooth and blots excess oil (I have enough for 8 people) for hours and hours.</li>
            <li>This product works really well</li>
            <li>i dont really use primers.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed much of a difference in my skin after using it.</li>
            <li>there was nothing in it it pumped but absolutely nothing came out.</li>
            <li>Very deceiving.</li>
            <li>but it does nothing else really.  </li>
            <li>only faulty thing about it is its cheap bottle, the pump sticks</li>
            <li>As someone with skin that breaks out from time to time, this really helps cover patchy spots.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>Plus there isn&#x27;t much in the container</li>
            <li>But any help i can get is appreciated.</li>
            <li>Very comparable to Smashbox Primer..</li>
            <li>I used it for a week straight</li>
            <li>I like the product but did not see how it really improved the longevity of make-up on my face.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really work how I thought it would.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this.</li>
            <li>I really like this primer.  </li>
            <li>skin starts feeling very slippery after you put it</li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t expecting any miracles considering the price (under $4)</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks again</li>
            <li>It makes my face really matte (my skin is oily on the T zone) and my face doesn&#x27;t become shiny.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>Thus product worked really well.</li>
            <li>i have very oily skin</li>
            <li>I really like this primer.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t break me out, I really have had any problem with the content itself.</li>
            <li>This works really well.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>I have tried numerous primers from cheap drugstore to spendy department store brands and nothing</li>
            <li>I really like how the product feels on my face.</li>
            <li>The bottle is deceiving however it does say how much product you are getting</li>
            <li>my skin is still oily at my age &amp; seems to drink in my Bareminerals foundation - so much that I&#x27;d have to reapply again around lunchtime.</li>
            <li>Packaged very well.  </li>
            <li>Let me just say that this primer works really well.  </li>
            <li>The picture (and bottle) are very deceiving.</li>
            <li>but it runs out quite fast</li>
            <li>was that the pump doesn&#x27;t really work</li>
            <li>- I just use a Q-tip to scoop out how much I want</li>
            <li>makes my skin really oily and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Very lightweight feeling and makes it easier to appy and remove makeup.</li>
            <li>The bottle is misleading; you think there is a reasonable amount in the bottle, but</li>
            <li>really fast.&lt;br /&gt;Breakouts-</li>
            <li>Makeup blends and is so much prettier with this on under it.</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t seem very eco-friendly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a terrible product, but it&#x27;s not REALLY going to help your makeup stay on all day.</li>
            <li>I like this because it makes my skin feel smooth, but I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s actually doing anything to enhance the way my makeup looks at all.</li>
            <li>It also seemed to keep me relatively shine free as my day went on</li>
            <li>but with a bit it covers your whole face.</li>
            <li>I have never broken out because of this product (which happens with a lot of others)</li>
            <li>e.l.f. claims that the primer works as a smooth canvas upon which to place your makeup which allows it to help your makeup stay on longer and is also supposed to help diminish the look of larger pores.</li>
            <li>I noticed that my face was very greasy.</li>
            <li>was that I kept using too much.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I really do like elf products.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This primer really made the difference with how my liquid foundation goes on and how it looks when done.</li>
            <li>After i tryed it on it was just a very think oily product it litterly felt like i was rubbing</li>
            <li>its also very conveniently in a push-pump container (like lotion bottles are)</li>
            <li>yea it&#x27;s a good price, but it really sucks.</li>
            <li>Formula is decent enough but the bottle broke/got separated way too easily.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a few different face primers and I have to say this makes my face INCREDIBLY silky and soft and</li>
            <li>Not a everyday wear because I don&#x27;t wear makeup everyday but good buy.</li>
            <li>I had red spots on my face for months and used this for two days the red spots are completely gone good product for $6.00.</li>
            <li>I barely have to apply powder after working in full makeup all day.</li>
            <li>this product does a better job than the expensive kind I&amp;#34;ve tried.</li>
            <li>offers quite a few good products and this is one of them.</li>
            <li>looks a little bit better when it is applied over primer, than when it is applied on skin right after moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I did wish there was a little more in the bottle, but for the value and amount of product, it&#x27;s just right.</li>
            <li>Like all the other reviews say, great product, just not very much of it in one container.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear make-up that often, but I do take pride in my complexion, so this clear primer will fit right into my facial regimen.</li>
            <li>I USED to use a very similar primer from a well-known high end cosmetics company for several times more!  </li>
            <li>My Primer Came In 6 Days Early and Undamaged!!!</li>
            <li>This product would probably be better suited for someone with normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li>would reccommend this E.L.F. primer for people with normal skin (and maybe dry skin), but those with more oily or combination complexions might want to try something else.</li>
            <li>I use lots of other e.l.f cosmetics though and think they are a great deal for the price so perhaps that is why I am being lenient on the broken bottle pump.</li>
            <li>The price is unbelievably reasonable and the results are superior in comparison with other similar products I&#x27;ve purchased at department stores!!</li>
            <li>But it fills in my wrinkles, my pores, makes my super dry skin very moist, and makes my makeup glide on evenly!!</li>
            <li>Makes skin feel soft and foundation glides right on.</li>
            <li>; but then i started to smooth it on and was happy to find that i was wrong!</li>
            <li>easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;stay long</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant first time buying it because Elf has a reputation of having cheap quality products but this primer is defiantly not one of them!</li>
            <li>I love other e.l.f. products but would never buy this one again.</li>
            <li>so I am excited for my next girls night.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I decided to try E.L.Fs primer because I was satisfied with their other products, but I have to say that I won&#x27;t be purchasing this anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>High quality for such a cheap price?</li>
            <li>Light and silky, you can barely feel it putting it on but leaves your skin so soft.</li>
            <li>, I really was surprised, but I really like it!</li>
            <li>Not only does it make my face smooth, but it help my make up stay longer than normal.</li>
            <li>That cylinder is mostly empty, and there is barely anything in there, I don&#x27;t know why they even bothered honestly.</li>
            <li>It also lasts a long time, so its a good value for the money spent.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone trying to maintain a high end beauty routine for a much lower cost.</li>
            <li>It really changed how I do my makeup, and I would highly recommend it for any skin type on any budget.</li>
            <li>I only use this for weekends and special occasions as it does seem to cause a pimple or two if I wear it too often.</li>
            <li>It gives you skin a very matte look, completely fresh with not a single shine if you have oily skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use this every day, only on special occasions.</li>
            <li>I do not use any special matte products, I only use this primer, liquid foundation and</li>
            <li>swear by this primer even when most of their other cosmetics are high</li>
            <li>On my fingers and the back of my hand, once it&#x27;s had a minute to set and soak in, it feels very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I usually just do a light powder and bronzer for everyday, so I think I am more sensitive than most to heavier foundations.</li>
            <li>Maybe its better for normal day wear than for out wear when they may be dancing or other vigorous activity.</li>
            <li>I would recomment the clear primer because my face got pretty oily with the purple one.</li>
            <li>I purchase from Amazon a lot, more than the average person, and I figured I would buy my make-up from here too,</li>
            <li>If you ever choose to buy directly from e.l.f&#x27;s website, google promo/coupon codes first</li>
            <li>My box was also pretty banged up when It arrived so I wasn&#x27;t too surprised about this.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t improve the overall look of my skin that much, but makeup does last better.</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I read a review that said that prior to me buying it, its true.</li>
            <li>I was surprised when I used this the first time because of the color and texture.</li>
            <li>I am a 24 y/o african american with very oily skin (as in I can&#x27;t go more than 2 hours without using blotting papers or blotting powder to get rid of my shine).</li>
            <li>Overall, not bad.  </li>
            <li>My favorite primer hands down.  </li>
            <li>I was sort of able to get it to work by turning bottle upside down and shaking the product toward the top of bottle and using the pump holding bottle upside down.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love how quickly I go through it, and how little you&#x27;re actually getting vs how large the container appears.</li>
            <li>But overall I like this product and has a nice finished look and much lower cost than other name brands.</li>
            <li>i also live in a very hot/ humid country as well</li>
            <li>BUT I unscrewed the top to look inside as soon as I opened the package and the tube to the pump was snapped in half.</li>
            <li>So I have to let my face dry forever and then lightly put on powder.</li>
            <li>and you get so much more product for much less.</li>
            <li>I even tried waiting more than 10 minutes for this product to sink in only to have the same results.</li>
            <li>Decent product for the price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more expensive than much better brands.</li>
            <li>the price, I would definitely purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than the more expensive ones that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Stop paying these big name big brands when you get BETTER results with elf.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better primers - but they were much more expensive.  </li>
            <li>The entire reason I sought to purchase a primer is because I have super oily skin.  </li>
            <li>I gave it four stars because throughout my youth and into my college years, this was a dependable, decently priced item.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling and looking smooth and soft, and helps my makeup to last all day!</li>
            <li>I am a cosplayer who was looking for a decent primer that did not induce oil overload on my face.</li>
            <li>I think that it works better, but it is much more expensive.  </li>
            <li>The primer itself does a decent job.  </li>
            <li>but it does I recommend it and remember that any type of make up you use takes about 3 days or more to adjust to your skin so if you buy this don&#x27;t expect it to instantly work, but it does work it took me only like two days of using it to adjust .Also</li>
            <li>The pump works very well and you do not waste product at all!  </li>
            <li>My foundation goes on SO smoothly, and can last an ENTIRE day when I apply this primer first.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin very soft!</li>
            <li>One pump usually spreads well all over the face and leaves the face super smooth.</li>
            <li>I put it on after using a high end moisturizer</li>
            <li>This product goes on very smooth and does not feel heavy.  </li>
            <li>High quality drug store face primer.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I use that, add alittle of lotion (non scented, high moisturizing) to my foundation</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this if you&#x27;re on a budget.</li>
            <li>It is very light and does to feel heavy on my face at all.</li>
            <li>Before I begin the review, I want to say that I&#x27;ve never used high end make up, so take that into consideration!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>i had a sample of some primer through the mail (the high price ones).</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have high expectations of this primer</li>
            <li>I will highly recommend to friends and others.</li>
            <li>HIghly rec.</li>
            <li>Would highly reccommend.  </li>
            <li>High quality primer .It gets my thumbs up.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this primer.  </li>
            <li>I love a lot of their products such as eyeliners and brushes, and I keep coming back to see what&#x27;s new.</li>
            <li>product is great but the bottle only contains a very small amount</li>
            <li>first of all its super tiny barely the size of my pinky</li>
            <li>I got a little better result with M.A.C Prep and Prime.</li>
            <li>You can use and skip concealer and go with just a little powder this had become a part of my regimen love it truly recommend</li>
            <li>but it was a little greasy feeling so more.</li>
            <li>But for $6, you should get a little more product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other primers in the past (Too Faced and L&#x27;oreal Studio Magic) and this is not my favorite.</li>
            <li>It also dried up inside of the container super quick and started to sort of ball up when I tried to apply it to my face.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply and is a good base for my BB Cream &amp; foundation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll most likely use it just to apply eye shadow, it goes on much easier than a dry lid!</li>
            <li>This may sound a little funny, but I think I like this product.</li>
            <li>I live in New York where they just opened an e.l.f. store , goodbye Sephora!</li>
            <li>Very light weight, and no strong smell.</li>
            <li>However, I ran out of primer and was looking for a new primer at a decent price.</li>
            <li>It did not feel greasy or have a bad smell and best of all, I did not have any breakouts.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s inexpensive and works wonders; making my face extra smooth and even for my foundation to go on so much easier and last longer!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does absolutely nothing for my face.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, might as well just not buy it, because you&#x27;re not missing anything.</li>
            <li>I really like how soft it makes my face feel</li>
            <li>I really thought that I was probably going to breakout by using this since I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I think it may be  concealer side effect in general, but this was one was pretty oily.</li>
            <li>My face normally gets oily mid-day</li>
            <li>When I use this product my makeup will stay fresh looking for the entire workday.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product i use it everyday</li>
            <li>I have tried other primers but since I have loved the other elf products I have, I figured I would give this a shot.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is a good size, but the actual product (primer) is in a small stick inside the bottle.</li>
            <li>and whenever I include the primer to my makeup regimen, my skin is not as oily as it normally is.</li>
            <li>It keeps my makeup in place longer that it normally does.</li>
            <li>Love this, only thing is you cannot keep it that long, as it ashes</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it as a basic primer.</li>
            <li>not sure if this is useful at all  -  makes skin smooth but makeup dont hold longer at all -</li>
            <li>the pump will not work and it isn&#x27;t worth the money for shipping it back.  </li>
            <li>This is worth a try especially for the price.</li>
            <li>It was more then just a few pimples.</li>
            <li>gross but true life isn&#x27;t always pretty) became swaths of red raised inflamed areas.</li>
            <li>Whether it was freshly put onto my face or left to sit, foundation over it just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several different primers and so far I love the ELF</li>
            <li>Well priced, the quality is as good as my Victoria&#x27;s Secret primer.</li>
            <li>It is no longer thick and it appears to be some kind of oderless oil.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it helps to keep the oil down, but as an initial primer, it feels nice to apply.</li>
            <li>Other than that it worked fine the one time I tried it.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive skin, when I put it on, it feels smooth on face but it would not really cover up the pore.</li>
            <li>I ordered this looking for a cheaper alternative to the high end primers that you can get at MAC or Sephora and I was pleasantly surprised at how well this worked!</li>
            <li>Oily skin doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not dry and in need of good moisturizers.</li>
            <li>Although it didn&#x27;t make my skin as soft as this primer did, Revlon&#x27;s primer kept my makeup looking fresh all day with no touchups, and for only a few dollars more (depending on where you buy it)</li>
            <li>All the other reviews on this product are accurate.  </li>
            <li>I have used a couple of other primers before, but none as light as this one.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to wear much since one full pump seems enough but this has become the only primer I use now.</li>
            <li>Could live without it.</li>
            <li>New fav.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I could live without it now</li>
            <li>My new go to product.</li>
            <li>I heard the new batch of primers has an improved pump, so I&#x27;d repurchase it.</li>
            <li>Foundation slides on smoothly and  all the more expensive  primers in my makeup box that didn&#x27;t live up</li>
            <li>(you&#x27;d think the entire container was filled, but really it&#x27;s a tiny tube inside.  </li>
            <li>you know how much you&#x27;re buying as the size of the container compared to how much is actually inside is very misleading.</li>
            <li>This product is very inexpensive but very good!I alternate with my Cover Girl &amp; Olay primer!</li>
            <li>Stating That The Bottles Are Only Half Full Which Is Mostly True</li>
            <li>/&gt;Leaving the old review even though it mainly shows that I am a doofus.&lt;br</li>
            <li>foundation on top needless to say my skin looked very soft, smooth  even skin tone.</li>
            <li>It feels a little greasy at first, but it dries quickly and it leaves a super-smooth and silky face that you can use as a canvass for your makeup.</li>
            <li>Works very well... Not quite as smooth as BareMinerals Prime Time, but for half the price I&#x27;m not complaining!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft and velvet feeling.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It make my skin very soft</li>
            <li>Very smooth and silky, Feels exactly like primers I have had in the past from Sephora, and does the job just the same.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, though.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive and acne prone skin</li>
            <li>I dont have very sensitive skin either, but it works.</li>
            <li>It does leave your skin very soft.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, acne-prone skin</li>
            <li>Also, I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My makeup routine, due to all of my personal issues is somewhat time consuming and particular, I really love that this still allows my makeup to look fresh after very long days.(approximately 17 hours)</li>
            <li>Less than one full pump is all that&#x27;s needed to do a whole face -</li>
            <li>While the product may feel a bit greasy during the first few seconds but it quickly absorbs into the skin.</li>
            <li>A few clogged pores on super hot days.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>I have tried some other&#x27;s with tint, ad I like the fact that this is clear, it goes on so smooth.</li>
            <li>I have no complain with them, they acted absolutely great with me, sent an apology and even refund the product value due the late arrive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I gotta say, wow!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s like the exact opposite of what a primer is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought primer before and paid a pretty penny for smaller jars than this.</li>
            <li>This works pretty well as a basic primer.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better than all others I used in the past, for me it&#x27;s a keeper!!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The container is fairly small, but for the price, I don&#x27;t mind buying a couple at a time - it&#x27;s still cheaper than 1 bottle of a top of the line face primer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ihave never been one who was willing to go outside with no makeup on.</li>
            <li>It seems to do exactly the opposite of what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>It is pretty lightweight but still enough coverage.</li>
            <li>I actually believe that this primer is better than the more expensive one.</li>
            <li>I feel as though I&#x27;ve had to use MORE of this product though to do the same thing as other primers-</li>
            <li>The bottle looks pretty enough that I can leave it out on the counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Exact same price on Amazon as it is on Elf&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li>It feels so soft, like silk!</li>
            <li>After searching on amazon for the exact ounce measurement, I discovered it was only 0.47 ounces.</li>
            <li>Also, for those of you with sensitive skin like me, this doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or make me break out at all!</li>
            <li>After the first use the next day I had severe break out all over my face.</li>
            <li>I have actually bought several bottles of this since I made my original review and realize that the problem was me and not the bottle.</li>
            <li>I never wore it more than a couple times a week because it left my skin very red and irritated the next day.</li>
            <li>The only problem I had when I first received this product</li>
            <li>I swear it feels exactly the same</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what the consistency was SUPPOSED to be like, but when I got it, the primer was like a congealed gel and I have to remove the top whenever I want to use it.</li>
            <li>A little goes a LONG way, and the product is actually of a nice size.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, and it spreads so nicely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used one other face primer, but so far I love the e.l.f.</li>
            <li>I have to use moisturizer constantly, and I still get a lot of creases in my makeup where the fine lines are dry.  </li>
            <li>This is my fav primer helps to makes wrinkles less visible and makes my skin feel baby bottom smooth no build up</li>
            <li>Typical primer, nothing fantastic</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first because I thought surely a product you pay $25 for would work better than a primer I paid less than $5 for.</li>
            <li>I usually use L&#x27;Oreal, Studio Secrets Professional Magic</li>
            <li>Pretty much false advertisement if you will but its okay... not re-purchasing..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clear gel and it made my skin feel very soft and</li>
            <li>(I originally gave it 5 stars but bumped it down to two stars.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little thicker, almost gel like, and goes on so smooth.</li>
            <li>So with the recent break out spots I started to wear concealer and a little more foundation.</li>
            <li>I am going to try some other products, because this seems to run out quickly.</li>
            <li>Its clear like a gel</li>
            <li>I ordered the clear primer, the site gives you 3 options to choose from, I went with the clear.</li>
            <li>just because it&#x27;s easier to feel where it goes since it&#x27;s clear.</li>
            <li>I have used Bareminerals Clear Primer for over a year, which cost $26 plus tax BTW, and this e.l.f.</li>
            <li>I got the clear.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear and I don&#x27;t have to worry about glitter or such&lt;</li>
            <li>Goes on clear and keeps my makeup in place all day without any creasing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a clear face primer.</li>
            <li>I know this didn&#x27;t cost that much to begin with but arriving almost empty, really?</li>
            <li>and I have to unscrew the clear part off and push it up manually</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear, so it goes with anyone&#x27;s skin tone.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product in the color clear in mid-September of 2013 for the upcoming school year.</li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s well worth it because it has the feel of a much more expensive product.</li>
            <li>Goes on clear.</li>
            <li>The primer is clear and smells like nothing.</li>
            <li>It was clear like I thought</li>
            <li>The clear feels and seems oily</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear and gel-like in texture.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the clear primer, it just feels like lotion</li>
            <li>I also like the fact that it was clear, so I didn&#x27;t have to worry about matching my skin or anything like that.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t work its definitely clear but let me tell you just go</li>
            <li>Although it reminds me of Vaseline, it looks clear but feels like Vaseline.</li>
            <li>love the primer at least (: the product I could try</li>
            <li>It makes my pores smaller and really changes the way make up looks on your skin.</li>
            <li>This really does fill in pores and you can totally tell the difference when you&#x27;ve got it on versus when its not on.</li>
            <li>My face looks like its been edited with the soft feature.</li>
            <li>came early tho</li>
            <li>It has a sort of soft powder feel too it, although it&#x27;s a liquid.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have irritation with some primers but not this one.</li>
            <li>This makes my face so soft.</li>
            <li>For the price I was surprised at how well it worked.  </li>
            <li>It made my skin really soft before applying any makeup and it did not feel oily or greasy to the touch.  </li>
            <li>I love this primer, but gave it 3 stars because the pump sucks.</li>
            <li>Prevents natural skin oils from making your face look &amp;#34;shiny&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>and so far I have no doubts in this brand.</li>
            <li>I do make up professionally.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the value of this primer.</li>
            <li>But overall, I do like the product and would probably buy it again, but not from Amazon -$10 is way too much.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not broken, don&#x27;t fix it&amp;#34; so I am back to my e.l.f.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive acne prone skin</li>
            <li>It was smaller than I expected, but overall, it made my face feel smooth!</li>
            <li>Oily, old, acne prone,tanning.</li>
            <li>but I completely disagree (and I have oily skin).  </li>
            <li>have sensitive skin)</li>
            <li>and I got the package a day early</li>
            <li>considering that I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen some people complain about the amount of actual product in the bottle, but I think they may just be using too much of it.  </li>
            <li>Using this product, my make up looks last so much longer than they use to.</li>
            <li>My skin become so soft after the application, it&#x27;s incrdible.</li>
            <li>Non-irritating on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and I have sensitive skin and no outbreak</li>
            <li>I just started back using it and didn&#x27;t realize how much I missed it.  </li>
            <li>You will be surprised at what&#x27;s left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used a face primer before, so I can&#x27;t compare this to professional makeup primer.</li>
            <li>I have nothing to compare it to, but I noticed a marked difference between how my makeup went on, blended &amp; wore throughout the day when using the elf primer underneath.</li>
            <li>#34;smooth on&amp;#34; for a natural look when wearing make up.</li>
            <li>When I remove it after a day out, my skin feels sensitive and tinging.</li>
            <li>Ordered this product about a month ago...and wow.</li>
            <li>Very simple and fast to use.</li>
            <li>After a bit of powder, your skin feels so soft and velvet</li>
            <li>I was surprised however this did not break me out or cause a hellish rash.</li>
            <li>but nothing near how my skin is without the primer.</li>
            <li>Really helps to make the makeup last on the skin.</li>
            <li>But having finally tried it out, I can say that I really like it.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that it pumps way too much primer.</li>
            <li>It allowed my makeup to lay naturally.</li>
            <li>I have been looking of a primer that was like the old smash box primer.  </li>
            <li>Not heavy.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and have had no breakouts.  </li>
            <li>Makeup goes on effortlessly, there is no smell to the product, and it makes skin baby soft without effecting dry/oily skin.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s make my skin really really soft</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and didn&#x27;t have any problems with this product.</li>
            <li>Somehow, it was out of the box, and completely out of the packaging when it arrived.</li>
            <li>Only downside is there isn&#x27;t much product in the bottle.</li>
            <li>It does not irritate or break out my sensitive skin and goes on smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am 30 yrs old</li>
            <li>I bought this because it was on the cheaper end, and I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I marked the toothpick and measured it.</li>
            <li>suffice to say i was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>It makes the foundation or powder stay for much longer, and I use it definitely with mineral makeup.</li>
            <li>Also, one pump is enough for your whole face.</li>
            <li>and I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>or if it just was missed completely.</li>
            <li>and my skin doesn&#x27;t get nearly as oily throughout the day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other reviewers were correct that the container is deceiving as the actual amount of product is really small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My foundation goes on easier, looks smoother and I don&#x27;t get anywhere near as shiny in my t-zone as I used to.</li>
            <li>I wear my makeup for nearly 12 hours a day and it stays flawless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found it at a Target store and was surprised at how well it</li>
            <li>but it just doesn&#x27;t do much for me and it makes my skin extra greasy.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t need too much to cover your entire face.</li>
            <li>Visually it looks like a gel, but it feels much lighter and softer, almost silky.</li>
            <li>I was so surprised.</li>
            <li>The Elf mineral primer works much like the Smashbox primer, only for a quarter of the price.</li>
            <li>Leave my skin soft and even with a velvet sensation that prepare for a foundation.</li>
            <li>Your skin is so soft when you use this.</li>
            <li>Goes on clear and feels so soft and silky on my skin.</li>
            <li>Plus, the amount of product you get is so minimal that it just wasn&#x27;t worth the $6 at Wal-Mart - there&#x27;s like</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use up my two bottles (don&#x27;t want to waste it), but will look for a better quality next time.  </li>
            <li>though it&#x27;s a bit more expensive, it&#x27;s worth it to me because it doesn&#x27;t break my face out like the e.l.f.</li>
            <li>Provdes excellent base for your makeup.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a thick, silky cream.</li>
            <li>It is a good primer, don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li>Sister is also very impressed with product, and it&#x27;s ability to rpovide a base fr</li>
            <li>I love how long it holds my makeup for ecspecially in the heat Down south.</li>
            <li>It is very affordable and it lasted me a long time before having to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>No little straw on inside to make pump work.</li>
            <li>I needed a primer because my skin&#x27;s texture is never very smooth (and it&#x27;s SUPER sensitive)</li>
            <li>Yeah, not really considering other primers have a ton more in them.</li>
            <li>Look further into other primers before deciding to buy this one because it is cheap...</li>
            <li>but you don&#x27;t need to use much at all, and it&#x27;s very inexpensive compared to other brands.</li>
            <li>Just dab a little at first to see how much you will need.</li>
            <li>My makeup goes on smooth and makes my 43 yr old skin look younger and brighter, it also cuts down on my T-Zone oily skin from showing through.</li>
            <li>But, you really only need a very little of the product, as is the case with most face primers.</li>
            <li>My daughter has gone through no less than probably 12 of these and continues to use it.  </li>
            <li>This is my second time ordering elf studio mineral primer and it still feels like the same exact smashbox formula to me.</li>
            <li>smell is a bit odd but fades quickly.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this product given its very low price......</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a high school student who wears makeup to school daily</li>
            <li>Its affordable and works the same as any high end product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it especially if you&#x27;re in my situation.    </li>
            <li>because I&#x27;ll tell you right now it does not last long</li>
            <li>Disclaimer: My make-up knowledge isn&#x27;t that extensive I&#x27;ve just recently found myself getting into it a little more.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical because it is so super cheap</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s true what the other reviewer said, the pump is not that great - it will squirt out on ya if you&#x27;re not careful, but not too bad.  </li>
            <li>While there isn&#x27;t a whole lot of product in the bottle, it does go a long way.</li>
            <li>I know it sounds strange, but it almost made my face feel like a canvas, ready to soak up the makeup!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other reviews say that It&#x27;s too small, as a light makeup user I will test this myself and post an update.</li>
            <li>have dry, sensitive skin and everything seems to either oxidize quickly or makes me dry.</li>
            <li>First I thought my bottle was empty.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used any other kind of face primer, so I am not sure how it is on a scale, but I like it.</li>
            <li>I love how it&#x27;s very similar to one of my other more expensive face primer.</li>
            <li>The bottle may seem large, but the reservoir that actually holds the product is tiny.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend it to others, especially if you have large pores like I do</li>
            <li>With the help of a little finishing powder i&#x27;m good to go from 8am to at least 4pm if not longer.  </li>
            <li>This ELF Face primer is fairly long lasting, applies smoothly, and works better on my skin than the expensive smashbox product.  </li>
            <li>Previously I have purchased some of their mineral makeup and was satisfied other than finding it was not made in the USA.  </li>
            <li>My skin is dry &amp; sensitive, but this product leaves my skin feeling extremely hydrated &amp; super soft.</li>
            <li>This is a manufacturing issue and as a regular amazon shopper I expect a new one to be delivered.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am new to using primer and the stuff i was using before (Revlon) was white and almost like lotion</li>
            <li>I always want to try something new but come back to this one every time.  </li>
            <li>With really crappy skin you could touch up once-twice during a very long day.</li>
            <li>I use this product everyday and it keeps my makeup long lasting and very smooth.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel this product made my pores look smaller, but I DO notice a much smoother finish overall.</li>
            <li>I work long hours at work and after a long day at work, my face still looks fresh.</li>
            <li>But, this is definitely helping your make up to last for a much longer time.</li>
            <li>My makeup stays on just as long, and the consistency of the product is exactly the same.</li>
            <li>The primer is good, but unfortunately there is not enough in the bottle.</li>
            <li>I dont like to waste it on a quick outing.</li>
            <li>The formula is clear and goes on really smooth, it wasn&#x27;t too runny, thick, sticky or smelly like others I have tried.</li>
            <li>Primer helps a lot when you have a long work day or night ahead and want to look relatively the same as you did when you first put your makeup on!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and am alergic to several things including latex and adhesives and this product did not cause a reaction</li>
            <li>was a major plus.  </li>
            <li>which is a major plus.</li>
            <li>I will only use this since I left my HD Primer from Makeup Forever from Sephora, which I compare to and to me they look, feel and cover the exact same!</li>
            <li>Exactly what i expected!</li>
            <li>I like some other primers a little more.</li>
            <li>And you need a really small amount to last you the entire day! :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes more time to dry than other primers do.&lt;br /&gt;The only foundations it works well with are Elf foundations - everything else came out cakey or just didn&#x27;t last throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Primers can get waaaaaaay too expensive for someone that needs it like I need it, but I gave this one a chane recently, applied it first on a clean face, then put on my favorite foundation, then topped it off with a makeup setting spray (my usual routine)</li>
            <li>and it makes you face feel like it has a super soft slick surface for you makeup to be applied onto.</li>
            <li>It definitely does improve the way liquid foundation goes on, and how your complexion looks, but this primer requires a powder on top to finish off, otherwise your face will feel very slick.  </li>
            <li>This primer gave me a very good base line for my mineral makeup to sit on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several primers, high end, low end.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve searched high and low for a primer that actually made a difference and didn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li>your makeuo goes on so smooth and dewy, and heres a little tip ,  after your makeup is applied and done, add a tiny drop of primer in the palm of your hand and apply to any areas that you would like be extra dewy looking....</li>
            <li>It works as expected but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s my favorite of this type of product.  </li>
            <li>got this for $3 here on amazon - it is $6 at my local target and between prime and never making small orders, I get free shipping</li>
            <li>The bottle isn&#x27;t as small as I expected it to be, but no complaints there :)</li>
            <li>It really helps the foundation and makeup last for a long time.  </li>
            <li>It is a clear facial primer.</li>
            <li>as far as blending different colors of your skin tone?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably go back to my old vendor who sells a thinner viscosity primer.</li>
            <li>but so far it works well on my face especially in the morning</li>
            <li>I gave it to a younger person as glitter does not belong in a professional office environment.</li>
            <li>Only tried it with liquid foundation thus far hope it works well with the cream to powder</li>
            <li>, yes there is still obviously some production naturally</li>
            <li>Also there&#x27;s barely any product in the container.  </li>
            <li>But with elf I barely do touch ups</li>
            <li>I will pirchase this product from Amazon in the near future.</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel soft will defiantly be buying in the future.</li>
            <li>I will stick with my bare minerals primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have purchased several ELF products direct from their website.</li>
            <li>I have only used it a couple of time so far</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t last all day but for the price, it makes my skin look and feel absolutely soft.</li>
            <li>At the same time, the texture of it is SOOO soft and silky.</li>
            <li>When I ran out I tried Bare Minerals primer for oil control.  </li>
            <li>and i use to use the bare minerals primer and then a powder afterwards so that my makeup would hold all day</li>
            <li>However, it was quite apparent some of the primer leaked out during transport.  </li>
            <li>it simply feels wow on skin.</li>
            <li>It compares favorably to bare minerals primer which I swear by.</li>
            <li>My 17 yr old daughter actually got me started with this.</li>
            <li>I have only used the product once so far.</li>
            <li>Make my face feels so soft and definitely gives my Makeup  a radiant look.</li>
            <li>I would definitely buy again if the pump issue was fixed.</li>
            <li>and I can barely feel it going on my face.</li>
            <li>After a week or two of no makeup, I&#x27;m finally back to normal and will go back to Hourglass.</li>
            <li>It just kind of sits on your skin and leaves it not oily, but weird, unnatural feeling</li>
            <li>I love putting on make-up, Im not great at it</li>
            <li>Like many others, mine arrived broken as well.</li>
            <li>so I ended up having to screw off the top and try to fish some out with the end of a thin makeup brush.</li>
            <li>It seemed to be broken when I opened up the top.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a whole lot of money out of the pocket, and it&#x27;s worth a shot before you commit to buying something much more expensive.</li>
            <li>The only down side is that it doesn&#x27;t come with much, but, you don&#x27;t need a whole lot to cover the entire face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>But I think it is finally starting to calm down today after putting ACV on my face.</li>
            <li>I want my money back or a new one that actually work, and I just dont know how to proceed</li>
            <li>I unscrewed the top and the primer is in this teeny tiny little tube!!!</li>
            <li>I have used the higher end products before as well and they also cause slight breakouts for me, so</li>
            <li>It is small and runs out quickly</li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes such a major difference!  </li>
            <li>, they always have multiple deals going on that can usually either score you free shipping or a % off your total price!</li>
            <li>and I had heard other reviews saying that you don&#x27;t get as much product as the bottle makes it seem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I would say this would last me at least a good 6 months if not more.</li>
            <li>I would not buy this product again because I was expecting more of a dramatic result/</li>
            <li>I have combination, acne prone skin and am currently using topical clindamycin (from my dermatologist) to keep my skin clear.  </li>
            <li>Suddenly it is not the same product as when you buy it directly from e.l.f.  </li>
            <li>I have normal skin, not terribly sensitive, occasional breakouts, occassional oiliness.</li>
            <li>It does not dry oily though.</li>
            <li>or else it forces your pores and little hairs on your face right out into the open) after I moisturize</li>
            <li>Also, right after you wash and moisturize your face (and wait about 5 minutes for the moisturizer to absorb into your skin) you are suppose to just apply a little pump to the back of your hand.</li>
            <li>I take care of my skin which is very sensitive and dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wondering why no other similar product comes close to it&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li>I did not use primers before, so when I first applied this one, I became a little bit scared.</li>
            <li>I did notice my skin peeled a little bit a couple of days after I used it the first time.  </li>
            <li>It took a little getting used to because it was the first primer I&#x27;d ever used.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hold very much and was missing the inside piece to the pump....</li>
            <li>I have been using a powder base for the last few weeks or so due to the humidity, feels great and stays on using the primer :)</li>
            <li>Thanks to the Drugstore Princess on Tumbler for recommending as well as several other dupe sites.</li>
            <li>Surely not as long as the primer you purchased at MAC for 3x the price.</li>
            <li>I actually use Bare Minerals Powder/Foundation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been getting more into makeup these days, trying out what used to seem like unnecessary extra steps in my daily makeup regime.</li>
            <li>I like to have two full sets of my must-have makeup products--one set of more expensive items (usually NARS, Chanel, Benefit, Smashbox) and one set of items that I can buy at the drug store.</li>
            <li>The only down side is that the pump did break on me after several uses, but mine was part of the first batch that ELF put on the market and they have improved the pump since (according to their website).</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re so inclined, once the pump stops working you can usually get a little more out of the bottle if you take off the lid.</li>
            <li>hope they make other colours to adjust to tones although elf has a palette of the 4 main tone adjusting concealers.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other (more expensive) primers, and they felt much heavier.</li>
            <li>importantly, this primer can stay long time, at least from 8am to 5pm.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how this product worked wonders for my dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>You DO want to let this dry completely before applying anything else, otherwise you could end up with smears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use moisturizer (LUSH - celestial) and let that dry, then apply this.</li>
            <li>I used to buy primer that cost  4 times as much for  half the size here.  </li>
            <li>tries to mislead people by making the bottle bigger when inside there is a smaller tube about half full of primer.</li>
            <li>it spreads very well its very silky and it does make the makeup last a very long time, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>I only wear a loose mineral powder foundation to work, and it would normally wear off by 10 am, but now it lasts all day with just 1.5 pumps total for my entire face.</li>
            <li>I really liked the product but was disappointed in the small amount; the large container was very misleading!</li>
            <li>It only lasted about 5 days snd that is not long at all.  </li>
            <li>I tried other primers and my foundation looked normal again...</li>
            <li>I received it quickly but when I went to pump some out hardly anything came out so the only way I can use it is by digging my pinky finger in the bottle and only way it works</li>
            <li>This can definitely go as a dupe for multiple other high cost primers.</li>
            <li>It seems to make my foundation last a bit longer than without but not long enough that I fell obligated to use it every day.  </li>
            <li>A little bit really goes a loooong way with this primer.  </li>
            <li>only complaint is that i have to use a little more than i feel i should in order to cover my entire face</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> This primer is amazing!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing my mother in law said I looked well rested!</li>
            <li> My skin looked perfect :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this primer for a couple years and it gives you the perfect, smooth surface to apply your make up!</li>
            <li> But THIS, oh my my, it literally feels like silk and makes my 40+ skin look better than it has in years, fills in pesky lines, controls shine and keeps my makeup looking flawless all day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lovely product it makes applying your foundation looks flawless.</li>
            <li> i love elf products, the eye shadows are the best</li>
            <li> This primer is okay, its not the best or worst.&lt;br</li>
            <li> good price for great product&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
            <li> The difference is remarkable.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it is perfect for my oily skin, the purpose of a primer is to protect your face from the makeup and to reduce the shine and this product does just that</li>
            <li> which it does a better job than if i didn&#x27;t have a primer on, but its not the best.</li>
            <li> Using this on&lt;br /&gt;Clean skin before applying my foundation creates a flawless line free face!</li>

            <li> Elf have great products for a good price.</li>
            <li> And one more point of reference it works great with my pricier makeup brand!</li>
            <li> This had good reviews and a great price</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own instead of as an add on item!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful and gives you a great, smooth canvas to work on &amp;</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pleasant experience!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worth it !!!!</li>
            <li> great stuff --so smooth under foundation!!</li>
            <li> It is the elf mineral face primer, fills in fine lines and creates a flawless finish.</li>
            <li> The makeup does stay on and look nice and flawless for awhile, and thats what I love.    </li>
            <li> I have oily skin and huge pores and this works beautifully on my complexion, I would say give it a try because for the price you pay and the results that I have achieved, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> It is so light it feels almost inexistent in your face, but it works perfectly!  </li>
            <li> and this is has been good for me.</li>
            <li> But it is a good primer that does keep makeup in place.</li>
            <li> It pumps out the perfect amount, it goes on silky smooth and makeup just glides on after.</li>
            <li> I loved it, i buy it everytime i can.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried a primer, but I had heard a lot of good things about this one.</li>
            <li> good stuff for the price.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it once before it broke and liked it, so if you could send me another one that would be great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good value.</li>
            <li> Good price, does a good job.  </li>
            <li> but then for the price,  i still think it is a good product and will get it again</li>
            <li> and I loved how hydrating it was.</li>
            <li> good</li>
            <li> makes the makeup stay on all day even through sweat, smells good and moisturizes.</li>
            <li> I loved it and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Feels really good and works well but doesn&#x27;t hide pores.  </li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> Good size.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s good for my oily skin.</li>
            <li> Feels like silicone but in a good way.</li>
            <li> I have to scrape it out with a tool in order to get the primer (which is good stuff, but the design is just crappy).</li>
            <li> It makes my makeup application smooth and flawless.</li>
            <li> This product is cheap and is great!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good product, but mine stopped pumping the primer out</li>
            <li> It is smooth and works perfectly!</li>
            <li> This is a good product for the cost.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t believe how good it works for $6</li>
            <li> A dab will do you, but put in your foundation immediately afterward because it does soak into the skin (in a good way).</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> The price was good.</li>
            <li> , It feels good on my skin  </li>
            <li> It goes on like silk &amp; feels so so good on my face.</li>
            <li> give it a fair shake</li>
            <li> The moisturizer I use does just as good as a job as this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m good.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price.</li>
            <li> This one is good if you want &amp;#34;just a primer&amp;#34; - not something tinted.  </li>
            <li> I literally used up this product so good &amp; def.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t expect it to be as good</li>
            <li> It was inexpensive and had really good reviews.</li>
            <li> I have fairly oily skin that is (even at 39) still inclined to breakouts now and then.</li>
            <li> but it is a good product.</li>
            <li> feels good going on</li>
            <li> I have bought one and loved it.</li>
            <li> This is really good face primer for the price.</li>
            <li> The primer does smooth your face, it covers your pores for a flawless application of your foundation.</li>
            <li> but the price is good.  </li>
            <li> When I finish rubbing it in it leaves my face silky smooth and in perfect condition to apply my makeup to.</li>
            <li> Keeps my face smooth before my makeup and my makeup stays on perfectly.</li>
            <li> this beats the price and is a good product.</li>
            <li> ELF products are consistently a good value for the price</li>
            <li> this face primer is another GOOD product frome.e.l.f.  </li>
            <li> The service was good</li>
            <li> seems to work good.....</li>
            <li> and it has worked good for me.</li>
            <li> This seems like a good primer.</li>
            <li> i loved this</li>
            <li> but when she uses it it&#x27;s really good.</li>
            <li> Not as matte as Arbonne&#x27;s, but darn good for $6.</li>
            <li> go for this.. good results in good price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fairly inexpensive product, but it makes my face oily within a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> This is a good steal for its price.</li>
            <li> So, this is a good one in my book.</li>
            <li> I get good product makeup.</li>
            <li> does it feel really good when you spray it on, but one spray will keep your makeup set all day</li>
            <li> No need for lotion after washing ur face, just apply this and ur make up and ur good to go.</li>
            <li> Keeps my makeup fairly noncomedogenic (doesn&#x27;t go into my pores).</li>
            <li> /&gt;It goes on just as good as too</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good primer</li>
            <li> so when I apply my concealer, foundation, and powder it looks so even and gorgeous.</li>
            <li> loved it thank you</li>
            <li> Works surprisingly well for the price.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and in good packaging.</li>
            <li> Dimethicone creates a barrier on the skin that gives you that flawless, pore free look.</li>
            <li> I heard about this face primer from someone on YouTube who had tried it and loved it.</li>
            <li> and it worked really good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always up for trying E.L.F. products because it&#x27;s an affordable yet good brand.</li>
            <li> Good,</li>
            <li> but I will say my makeup looks just as good after 8 hours of work.</li>
            <li> A good primer for the price.</li>
            <li> The product itself was good, but the pumped stopped working</li>
            <li> The price is fair for the amount you receive.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, feels so wonderful.</li>
            <li> really recommend it 100% excellent quality and 100% original brand really excellent very good product.</li>
            <li> The smell does disappear after a while but it makes me wonder what the ingredients are...and if they are doing more harm than good!</li>
            <li> Got this product, was so excited bcuz it was an awesome</li>
            <li> Favorite affordable and good quality!</li>
            <li> nice texture and my makeup goes on easily and flawlessly</li>
            <li> It shipped quickly and arrived packaged perfectly.</li>
            <li> This primer gives a super flawless look to make up.</li>
            <li> When I started running out, exceptionally soon, I unscrewed the housing and took the pump out and looked inside.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the brands that charge way more!</li>
            <li> my downside, Elf is a very cheap and great makeup line.</li>
            <li> Used once, very pleased.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this was going to be better quality for a great price...  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the product itself.</li>
            <li> After the seeing all the great reviews and price I decided to purchase this primer, and I&#x27;m so glad that I did.</li>
            <li> I have bougfht e.l.f. products and have been very pleased with the results.........</li>
            <li> The product itself is like smearing rainbows and kittens your face; it&#x27;s magical and works great.</li>
            <li> I like elf, and many of there products are great but not this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light and not greasy at all!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> am very pleased.  </li>
            <li> It works great, and many people noticed a difference after I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> and I am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> Works great with foundation and with finishing powder over the top.</li>
            <li> under any kind of foundation me and my mom loved it</li>
            <li> Nice product at a good price.</li>
            <li> This came in handy to use before my foundation and it felt good on my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product, goes on silky smooth and preps my face for a flawless finish.</li>
            <li> Really good primer worked great on my severely sunburned face for my makeup to go in smooth</li>
            <li> Works great for diminishing the appearance of pores, very soft and smooth and does a great job keeping your makeup looking flawless all day!</li>

            <li> The product also has a nice scent as well.</li>
            <li> It kind of had an oily finish to it.</li>
            <li> The price was perfect, considering I wanted to try a primer without spending too much money.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and goes on well</li>

            <li> It evens out my skin tone/makeup and gives a nice look when I&#x27;m all done.</li>
            <li> Honestly one of the primers I have ever used stays on keeps make up does wonders .I&#x27;d</li>
            <li> and it goes on so smooth and makes foundation smooth and flawless</li>
            <li> It dispenses the perfect amount of primer for your whole face.</li>
            <li> any kind of foundation/blush/bronzer and</li>
            <li> i love it, it works so good</li>
            <li> This is a really nice primer, and does the job.</li>

            <li> woooo helps my foundation look nice and stays on longer then before  almost gone need a refill</li>
            <li> This stuff is so nice</li>
            <li> I liked the product... until it ran out within a handful of uses.  </li>
            <li> As others have stated, it&#x27;s honestly quite misleading.</li>
            <li> I like how it gives a nice finish after makeup is on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used primer before, and honestly I didnt even know what it&#x27;s for.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, so this primer didn&#x27;t work the best for me.</li>
            <li> and I have an &#x27;on your feet&#x27; kind of job), it also mattifies the sheen on your make</li>
            <li> This prime is amazing, feels really good on skin and is mineral :)</li>
            <li> Keeps everything feeling lightweight and makes your face so touchable and nice.</li>
            <li> If not, just insert one of your own.</li>
            <li> Liked the product.</li>
            <li> I do notice that when I wear this under my foundation, my skin really looks flawless.</li>
            <li> Really nice texture.</li>
            <li> and I really liked it.  </li>
            <li> Bottle looks nice too.</li>
            <li> The consistency is nice and not overly silicony.</li>
            <li> It smothes out my face nicely.</li>
            <li> Nothing will make it not shine at all...let&#x27;s be honest.</li>
            <li> I liked the product itself.</li>
            <li> and it gives me that nice matte finish.  </li>
            <li> , in summary, it&#x27;s a great product and will probably work for most skin types and blend well with most foundations</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to buy something that isn&#x27;t tinted which has been a problem for me.</li>
            <li> Makeup slid on really well and set perfectly.</li>
            <li> so I have to kind of ration it out for a while.&lt;br /&gt;Amazed</li>
            <li> Feels nice going on</li>
            <li> Found this primer to be effective and inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> It was a really nice</li>
            <li> Still, it&#x27;s a nice product just be prepared to replace often.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really loving this primer.</li>

            <li> Product itself was faultless, the main problem with it is the amount in one container.</li>

            <li> I cant say that I am super experienced with face primers</li>
            <li> This goes on silky and very easily blended.</li>
            <li> It minimized the appearance of my pores, was very easy to apply and did not cause a break</li>
            <li> My favorite primer, and I have tried many (all price ranges)!  </li>
            <li> pretty good, i am going to buy another one!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very light, but works effectively.</li>
            <li> this product is amazing, my make up lasted all day, and my face was very smooth..</li>

            <li> It does do a great job of keeping my make up looking fresh tho</li>
            <li> It is clear and goes on perfect.</li>
            <li> just shopping or running errands, but for important nights out I will be going for the good stuff.</li>
            <li> Perfect primer its reallly silky to the skin and keeps my makeup look natural and even.</li>
            <li> Gave me the flawless but natural look i was looking for(: thank you.</li>
            <li> I wanted to order the clear primer because this was intended to be applied before foundation, and I didn&#x27;t do anything but prime my face perfectly.</li>
            <li> Fill pores nicely for most of the day.</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s good, but I feel it doesn&#x27;t provide that much of a smooth foundation finish.</li>
            <li> I am really happy that this product keeps my foundation looking fresh all day and it does not fade at the end of my 18 hour day.</li>
            <li> Perfect and sooo soft</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so soft and my makeup stays on perfect.</li>
            <li> The pump looks good, but isn&#x27;t great - still works, just not as good as the actual product.</li>
            <li> This is the one of the most effective and amazing products I found on Amazon, you have to use it, the tone and texture of your skin will be better after applying the product</li>
            <li> They both were near perfect and did not cause any breakouts.  </li>
            <li> By far the best primer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> It is by far the best primer I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> It creates a flawless look, my pores, which are the size of the grand canyon normally, literally vanish and it makes your skin look radiant.</li>
            <li> Best part is its light weight and it feels oily when you first put it on your face</li>
            <li> This product is ok, goes on easy, lasts a good chunk of time.</li>
            <li> (Or spending them on something way more fun!!!)</li>
            <li> Glides right on, if u have great skin</li>
            <li> absolutely love, love, love this primer!  </li>
            <li> I just love love love this product !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve absolutely always loved this primer and on here it&#x27;s cheaper than target!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s so nice to be able to buy excellent quality cosmetics at a reasonable price -- and rare!</li>
            <li> Currently, you have no idea when you&#x27;re going to run out, so it&#x27;s best to keep a backup bottle handy at all times.</li>
            <li> its light on the face, cheap, and has great staying power with liquid foundation or minerals.</li>
            <li> It lays the foundation for the foundation, which glides over easily, and the rest of the make up.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, my pictures come out great and I attribute it to the way the light bounces off my face, and I am sure it is because of the primer.</li>
            <li> primer is awesome, I really love how it feels in my skin and how soft and silky my skin gets after applying</li>
            <li> great silky application, my first primer ever</li>
            <li> But, the first thing I noticed when I applied it was that it feels sooooo great.  </li>
            <li> I have never used foundation primers before and decided to try this after hearing some pretty great reviews.</li>
            <li> this is the first time I decide to use primer and it turn out really great</li>
            <li> It also held up pretty well allowing my face between 6 and 8 hours of great wear.</li>
            <li> this product is great at first it feels greasy on your fingers</li>
            <li> It is very silky in finish and made my foundation look beautiful.</li>
            <li> LOL ;)</li>
            <li> This product is a pretty great primer.</li>
            <li> Infused Face Primer is first of all a great bargain and is a staple in any frugal beauty queen&#x27;s battlestation.</li>
            <li> It fills in fine lines and extends my make up to all day!</li>
            <li> This product glides onto the skin very smoothly and is not gluggy.</li>
            <li> Goes on very smooth and lasts all day, even if you are sweating.</li>
            <li> Your makeup goes on very smoothly.</li>
            <li> Very light weight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking that this will help you makeup go on very smoothly as it feel like silk when applied.  </li>
            <li> Though the item feels very light on your face, I just don&#x27;t see the point of it.</li>
            <li> It has a very light scent</li>
            <li> But it goes on very smooth.</li>
            <li> so its very important</li>
            <li> This goes on very smooth and primes your face for makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My skin feels very smooth.  </li>
            <li> The pump seems very cheap.</li>
            <li> It comes in a nice pump bottle which makes it easy to dispense.</li>
            <li> It went on very smooth, was very light, and my CC cream went on much better than without it.</li>
            <li> primer applies so smoothly and it the makeup apply flawless!I just love it!</li>
            <li> Good primer for every day use if you&#x27;re looking for something cheap, but you could just as easily do without.</li>
            <li> Very smooth.. Love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good on my extremely sensitive face and one dot on your finger can spread a lot.</li>
            <li> It is a silicone-based primer that fills in all the fine lines on your face leaving your skin feeling ultra-silky smooth and ready for a flawless application of foundation.</li>
            <li> , you have to push up on the bottom, there probably is more product inside that the pump cannot reach).</li>
            <li> glad I didn&#x27;t use it yet.</li>
            <li> I still need to wear it for another week to make sure it doesn&#x27;t break me out</li>
            <li> I Love this product,&lt;br /&gt;Makes</li>
            <li> It absorbs in seconds and your make up will slide perfectly on top of it without looking cakey or anything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m def no make up pro, and I bet there are better ones out there</li>
            <li> I got mine at target for $2 so might want to check there :)</li>
            <li> feels kind of greasy as you put it on, but goes on smooth and lasts hours.</li>
            <li> LOVE this face</li>
            <li> LOVE love love this face</li>
            <li> :)</li>

            <li> Love this stuff...</li>
            <li> I need to get more.</li>
            <li> I love this primer and most of the elf products.  </li>
            <li> Let the skin really smooth!  </li>
            <li> Also many of my friends ask me what makeup I use</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Put my makeup on top and it just just glided on.</li>
            <li> love it ,love it.</li>
            <li> even works for mineral makeup which is what I use!! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are better primers out there, but for the cost, I&#x27;ve yet to find a better one.</li>
            <li> I really love this primer.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants a great primer at a cheap price!</li>
            <li> I love the satin feel to this product</li>
            <li> I wish it came with more in the bottle..</li>
            <li> I love it&lt;</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> and i was quite happy because despite my combination skin, my nose becomes very shiny.</li>
            <li> It works okay as a primer for the price, but I prefer something lighter and more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This is smooth, but seems to melt my makeup in about an hour!  </li>
            <li> &amp; does help me apply my make up more evenly.</li>
            <li> a couple more dollars</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m sure you can get something better</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just okay,  </li>
            <li> Best primer I have ever used and a low price.</li>
            <li> The product feels wonderful when you apply it prior to putting on your makeup.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I have given up and taken off the top and just pounded the bottle into my hand.</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels when I put this on.</li>
            <li> My favorite.</li>
            <li> Meh...it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I had an issue with the makeup wearing off and even having difficulty coming off to the point I had to wash my face many times.</li>
            <li> It makes my makeup go on so smooth!</li>
            <li> I love using this primer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Difficult to get all product out of container, I have to take the top off and use a cotton swab.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, it does the job, but I have seen better primers.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so smooth, and feels nice to the touch.</li>
            <li> Great quality and very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s sooo much more affordable.</li>
            <li> product and I love it.</li>
            <li> I use my finger tips mostly when I apply makeup and afterwards they felt like it was sealed up....</li>
            <li> Love ittt.</li>
            <li> I love how it feels and keeps my makeup from creasing.</li>
            <li> Why I love this Primer:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> I wish I bought more.</li>
            <li> and i love it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> However, I can&#x27;t say this is my favorite primer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> I like a more &amp;#34;dense&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t settle into skin like better primers.</li>
            <li> I use this before putting on liquid foundation and it makes the makeup apply much more evenly.</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel so soft and smooth, and my makeup goes on flawlessly...  </li>
            <li> So every time I want to use it, I have to take the top off.</li>
            <li> I think the reason this catches so many people is because of the price.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Favorite face primer.</li>
            <li> And the price makes it even better.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> but I love this</li>
            <li> Ok Ladies:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is nice and smooth and makes putting on makeup so much better.  </li>
            <li> i love the fact that it is SPF.</li>
            <li> what so ever. :)</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my skin look when I wear it alone without foundation.  </li>
            <li> I was really pleased with the quality of this primer for the price you pay.</li>
            <li> Elf really does seem to be a great product for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> But I moved on the smash box face primer which i like alot better.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> love the way it grabs my bronzers.</li>
            <li> Dometimes i use it alone or under makeup :) love it</li>
            <li> LOVE this primer.</li>
            <li> I am glad that I tried this one.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Using this over your moisturizer and then followed up by the e.l.f. makeup setting spray is almost magical.</li>
            <li> Oily/combo skin may be okay with this.  </li>
            <li> For me it just kind of sat on top of my face  and didn&#x27;t create the smooth canvas for make-up</li>
            <li> I think the pump containers just seem more hygienic to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also a friend pointed out to me that although the pump container seems better, the fact is that you cannot get all the product out like you can with the potted container</li>
            <li> and I think the potted container holds more as well so</li>
            <li> Since we both have oily skin, I think the L&#x27;Oreal product is the better choice.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on my makeup the days I use this primer</li>
            <li> I love this primer</li>
            <li> I feel like the formula has changed, though, because the latest one I&#x27;ve used feels thicker and takes a bit more time to rub in.</li>
            <li> LOVE that it doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li> absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> Make sure</li>
            <li> I love this product and it&#x27;s a steal for the price.</li>
            <li> this works ok, but i found it to be a bit sticky.</li>
            <li> and I already like the Elf Primer better.</li>
            <li> My make up looks so much better on my face</li>
            <li> I love it, it just seems a bit too greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m okay with it</li>
            <li> I love this face primer</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I use is on top of a moisturizing cream because I have combined type of skin and then apply foundation.</li>
            <li> I felt like some sort  of magic was going on when I used this product.</li>
            <li> I decided to order this primer, and boy am I glad I did.</li>
            <li> Love this primer goes on smooth an does what it says!</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, but more on the oily side.</li>
            <li> This stuff leaves my skin so soft and smooth, and my makeup goes on with a flawless finish.</li>
            <li> Makeup goes on so much better - smoother.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff?  </li>
            <li> I bought more for my girls.</li>
            <li> It was okay, I guess.</li>
            <li> It feels great on my skin, and I find that I do not use as much makeup as I use without the primer.  </li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> :) It gets the job done though and is affordable.</li>
            <li> I have been using Primer for months and tried many.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t shine as much and it feels great when applying to my face.  </li>
            <li> If your on the fence try it youll love it.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I really do love the product.</li>
            <li> I will give it one more try after I am done with this bottle, hopefully I just got an oddball pump that is wacky.</li>
            <li> one of my favorite drugstore primer.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Illuminating Primer (Walmart) is $2 more for three times more product.  </li>
            <li> Smooth, silky, and effective.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll learn to deal :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be ordering us BOTH more soon :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love it, but it&#x27;s not horrible</li>
            <li> I have tried many different primers, and this one is the best I have tried.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Even though I love the product, I don&#x27;t like the fact that I can&#x27;t see the product in the bottle</li>
            <li> I love e.l.f. products and this one</li>
            <li> Makeup sits and blends much better with this product.</li>
            <li> I would say that was more than others stated.</li>
            <li> guessing it works better for her.</li>
            <li> I WANT ONE MORE...</li>
            <li> Love this Primer.  </li>
            <li> I am going to order 3 more :))</li>
            <li> Works well for being so cheap!</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t soak in at all, and made me have the most hellacious breakouts I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a handful of primers, and this one is definitely the best product for the price.</li>
            <li> Skip it and use the money to go towards a better one.</li>
            <li> when I started using it, I recognized that my make up stay longer...love it!:)</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels on my face.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product and would recommend.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I ordered it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind using it, but I probably won&#x27;t be buying any more.</li>
            <li> Its the same as on the website except i got it here cheaper its a great product!</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> I love the e.l f.</li>
            <li> it keeps my face looking smooth and the makeup never comes off, until I wipe it off that is!</li>
            <li> It makes the foundation look and settle better.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> At one point with this and acne treatment I felt confident I didn&#x27;t need makeup.</li>
            <li> I love all elf makeup.</li>
            <li> Okay so</li>
            <li> put a BB cream on top - the primer probably defeats the moisturizing purpose of the BB cream, but it matches my complexion better than any foundation.</li>
            <li> I just love this product</li>

            <li> Love this primer</li>
            <li> This is one of the best Face Primers that I&#x27;ve ran across, it&#x27;ll last for most of my work day (about 6-7 hours) without having to touch up my makeup.</li>
            <li> My skin looks more even and polished and my makeup stays on all day.  </li>
            <li> I have rosacea and need something to make my foundation cover longer and better</li>
            <li> I love Elf.</li>
            <li> However it is so silky smooth and it makes my skin feel nice.</li>
            <li> and I find that using a mineral infused primer helps my mineral makeup wear better.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love the elf.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite product to buy them.</li>
            <li> Love, love this product</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I LOOOOOOOVE using Arbonne&#x27;s primer, but at $40, I don&#x27;t love paying for it.  </li>
            <li> Love that I can also find it at Target too. :-)  </li>
            <li> and my face got 10x&#x27;s more coverage than ever before.</li>
            <li> I love elf products.</li>
            <li> My favorite part.....</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product but the pump didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smoother and makeup goes on a lot better.</li>
            <li> really enjoyed this primer.</li>
            <li> It slides across your fingers and face like the most slippery lubricant you can imagine.</li>
            <li> It looks, by its size, like there is a lot more product inside it.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> nd will probably work for most skin types and blend well with most foundations</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> but I love it.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love the primer.</li>
            <li> The most I knew was foundation.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this stuff</li>
            <li> This is okay for the price</li>
            <li> I, myself, am not a big fan of face primer until I come across one that is absolutely flawless, which I have yet to find.</li>
            <li> : After this ran out, I purchased Cover Girl BB and no longer have the need for any sort of primer, as this BB is AMAZING as a lightweight moisturizer, primer and light foundation all in one.</li>
            <li> I think it stays a bit better when using primer versus without, but the jury is still out on that one.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> but are wayy more pricey  since I&#x27;ve been using this elf primer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad i decided to order this product.</li>
            <li> applying the primer, it magically vanishes beneath my fingertips into skin with a satin finish.  </li>
            <li> Compares to BM primer just a better value</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> and this works better and A LOT cheaper.</li>
            <li> Elf is one of my favorite make up brands</li>
            <li> and i usually love their products, this one however was not my favorite</li>
            <li> again i love it.</li>
            <li> Love the texture of the product.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my face feel and helps my makeup glide on.</li>
            <li> Ehh it&#x27;s okay, not all that</li>
            <li> this product rates &#x27;okay&#x27; for me</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Get another drug store brand for $5 it&#x27;ll be better.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work or not-</li>
            <li> Love love love it.</li>
            <li> so I was okay with paying the extra 3.00 and it really is awesome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I love the fact, that this is so creamy that it makes you feel like you&#x27;re not wearing nothing..</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> My makeup stayed on better and longer, and my face did not get oily.</li>
            <li> Allows foundation to stay on for many hours and is humidity-proof.</li>
            <li> This is okay</li>
            <li> I also have the elf eye concealer which is not as awesome as this facial primer</li>
            <li> Love the primer but the pumps NEVER work.  </li>
            <li> I wonder if that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so cheap!</li>
            <li> This works just as well for me as a top brand sold for a lot more.</li>
            <li> i love this product.  </li>
            <li> love the way it feels.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smooth as butter!  </li>
            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d imagine it&#x27;d work well with most makeup brands.</li>
            <li> I just wish there was more of it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> My foundation application has never looked more smooth and even!  </li>
            <li> and yes it would last longer but this product for the price is awesome and i even like it better than sheercovers primer.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic, cost effective primer.</li>
            <li> Was hoping it would help more when I applied my foundation.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found a better primer for the price.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> It DOES help fill in some pores and gives a bit more of a velvety look, but it&#x27;s no miracle.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of the primer.</li>
            <li> but I have to remove the top and use a qtip to get the product in the bottle.</li>
            <li> This was ok.</li>
            <li> I would check at your local Target, I&#x27;m a very happy customer!</li>
            <li> My makeup goes on so much better with this product.</li>
            <li> Nothing fancy but better than not using a primer.</li>
            <li> Many of ELF&#x27;s products I just love.</li>
            <li> Then I tried it again (just to be sure) and again</li>
            <li> This is my favorite primer.  </li>
            <li> I like it though, and it&#x27;s so cheap!</li>
            <li> Everything just goes on smoother and looks better.</li>
            <li> Bottom-line, for the price I doubt you will find anything better than this primer</li>
            <li> You shouldn&#x27;t need more than one or two pumps.</li>
            <li> its okay.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t able to get the rest of the product out.</li>
            <li> It gives the most crazy-thin, sheer mask of coverage over your face and smooths everything out to give you a flawless canvas to put your makeup on.</li>
            <li> glad I did bc</li>
            <li> and sure helps my makeup application go wonderfully and helps it last longer!  </li>
            <li> I love ELF&#x27;s products because they are always so affordable but they also get the job done, and their face primer seems like no exception.</li>
            <li> I love putting this on before putting any makeup on my face.</li>
            <li> most of the bottle is just show, (took it apart)</li>
            <li> I wouldnt go raving about it, but it&#x27;s better than no primer at all</li>
            <li> I like it much better than my MAC primer.</li>
            <li> I will order this again for sure.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It came in great condition and it is very silky when you put it on.</li>
            <li> Awesome same quality as sephora.. save your money!</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>

            <li> This product is just ok, i have really had much better!!</li>
            <li> I loved how my foundation and powder glided right over this product.</li>
            <li> Good to use right before you are going out for the evening.</li>
            <li> It felt great coming out of the pump (like my Smashbox and BareMinerals primers) and it felt great on my skin (like silk - as a primer is expected to feel), but it literally did nothing for my pores and it made my makeup cakey!</li>
            <li> This is a very smoothe and light primer...makes your face feel so Good!</li>
            <li> but so far so good!</li>
            <li> While this is not the absolute BEST primer, it is pretty good and the price is right.  </li>
            <li> Very silky smooth makes my makeup go one beautifully</li>
            <li> this product is pretty good goes on smooth!</li>
            <li> , this is nice and clean.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVED the silky, smooth texture - it feels great between my fingers without leaving an oily or greasy residue and it actually made it easier to apply my makeup.</li>
            <li> - I normally don&#x27;t manhandle makeup lol.</li>
            <li> applys well real soft evens up skin and does lock your makeup no smell and great price</li>
            <li> It works pretty good.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used face primer, but it seems to be fairly good quality.</li>
            <li> The staying power of this is pretty good</li>
            <li> This primer does work pretty good.</li>
            <li> When I first opened and used this product, I loved it.</li>
            <li> Made my makeup look flawless all day long, no need to keep blotting or reapplying powder</li>
            <li> This one does a pretty good job at smoothing out your face and holding on your make up.</li>
            <li> When I first put this on my face, I really loved it.  </li>
            <li> When I first purchased this primer, I loved it.</li>
            <li> and it does do a pretty good job of making your makeup application go a bit smoother</li>
            <li> I got this after reading its as good as Smashbox, I&#x27;ve never used Smashbox but this primer feels higher quality than you would expect for the price if you didn&#x27;t already know about E.L.F.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i am in my 50s this product makes my skin smooth and silky so makeup adheres better, but is very light</li>
            <li> Love the smooth finish this product gives my skin under make-up, It&#x27;s very smooth and velvety feeling.</li>
            <li> I think it helps my makeup look more even and helps hide my pours and fine lines better.</li>
            <li> It makes your face feel so smooth and your foundation glides on easily!</li>
            <li> Well I ordered 5 more &amp; these 5 were all full!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth trying girls!!</li>
            <li> The best thing ever, keeps your skin fresh and natural looking</li>
            <li> It performed &amp;#34;Ok&amp;#34; where the lines are concerned, but didn&#x27;t help with flawless coverage in the dry spot areas.</li>
            <li> everything after that goes on more evenly and easily.  </li>
            <li> The price on the E.L.F. website is $6 before shipping, so it&#x27;s a good deal here if you don&#x27;t want to buy $35 worth of makeup from the E.L.F. site to get their free shipping.</li>
            <li> Also cant beat the price, ive used bare esscentuals that cost over $20 and this stuff works just as good!</li>
            <li> With a very light layer of this primer and a light layer of my foundation, I get magazine quality coverage.  </li>
            <li> Its very light and smooth.</li>
            <li> It is silky smooth and very light weight.</li>
            <li> But works fine, better than nothing.</li>
            <li> I love to use this when I&#x27;m just running out of the door quick!</li>
            <li> With foundations, it&#x27;s always about looking good but not feeling clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> Priced just right, love it!</li>
            <li> This product not only moisturized my skin, and evened out my skin tone; it filled in the fine lines leaving my face flawless.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t begin to describe how amazing this product is, it&#x27;s so easy to apply, you just need a little quantity to apply it because it spread out nicely, and the most amazing thing is that it have that satin finish, so lovely!</li>
            <li> Made my face appear super smooth and my foundation was much more even!</li>
            <li> So huge plus plus for that one :)</li>
            <li> but I like this one because it is cheap and does its job :)</li>
            <li> It lasted all day and when I washed it off the makeup came off much more smoothly then before.</li>
            <li> I love the smooth feeling when I apply this on</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked this okay on the first use</li>
            <li> I love the smooth way</li>
            <li> I love it this works like a charm and gives you a baby doll smooth finish.</li>
            <li> I love the how smooth it is</li>
            <li> , I mix some in with my foundation to make the foundation flow, blend, and cover much, much better -- makes my skin look smooth and dewy.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this face primer, it makes my face feel as smooth as silk.</li>
            <li> Sure, it went on smooth</li>
            <li> Glad it was cheap, I would not order again.  </li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s so cheap though, it&#x27;s still pretty good value.</li>
            <li> Only gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s not the best product I&#x27;ve used, but great product especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Great primer, it leaves your face so soft and silky</li>
            <li> Love how silky and smooth this feels on my face.</li>
            <li> The packaging makes it look like it&#x27;s a more fancy/expensive product (thought the plastic FEELS cheap).</li>
            <li> and I can say this primer is better because its cheap and does the job.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good to go for the whole day.</li>
            <li> I loved the feel of it and it wears very well for all day activity.</li>
            <li> It looks flawless in all kinds of light and has worn well through extremely long days.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much.</li>
            <li> i was sceptical about purchasing this primer, because of the cheap price., but low and behold it is amazing!!</li>
            <li> Better than MAC primer and much cheaper!!!</li>
            <li> This primer blends onto your skin smoothly and helps minimize / smooth out any problem areas making a nice clean and workable palette to do what you will makeup-wise.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to wash your face very well at the end of the day to make sure it doesn&#x27;t clog up your pores!</li>
            <li> It goes on very nicely and clear</li>
            <li> I promise you will not be dissappointed# please don&#x27;t stop making this product its been a true blessing to me!</li>
            <li> Not exactly the best.</li>
            <li> I wish they made a full body lotion that made me skin feel this way!</li>
            <li> Not bad!</li>
            <li> My makeup goes on easy and comes off easy.</li>
            <li> ELF IS A GREAT MAKEUP LINE, ONE OF MY FAVORITE ACTUALLY.</li>
            <li> seems to do the trick doesnt clog pores and is easy to wash off</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and makes your foundation stay put</li>
            <li> Goes on easy and feels silky&lt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used primer before and for me, it was easy</li>
            <li> Smooths your face for an easy application</li>

            <li> Amazing most smoothest serum... Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This product go on easily and is not sticky.</li>
            <li> WOW, great face primer, made my face feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li> However, at the price it&#x27;s easy to replace.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and the pump makes it easy to put on your fingertips.</li>
            <li> However, I used it up very quickly.</li>
            <li> The product itself is easy to apply, however, I notice no difference between when I use the primer, and when I don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> The primer is easy to blend onto your face and can be used all over the face.  </li>
            <li> It makes you look finished, goes on easily because it is a gel</li>
            <li> My foundation goes on so easily.  </li>
            <li> For an affordable, easy to use Primer.</li>
            <li> I really recommend it if you are looking for something cheap and that works good.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t just pump it out easily.  </li>
            <li> so its easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is really quite a good primer, and it&#x27;s so cheap its unreal.  </li>
            <li> Just as good as the high end products.</li>
            <li> Loved this product got it because it was highly recommended product primer for</li>
            <li> I love it, and the price is just right!</li>
            <li> Cheap and great, skin feels awesome, just like when I used to use my expensive Lancome primer</li>
            <li> It goes great with my Bare Escentuals Mineral Foundation.</li>
            <li> I love this primer and for the price of it, I love it more haha.</li>
            <li> and when I woke up I found my face full of softness, now  this product is my favorite</li>
            <li> This is the first primer I&#x27;ve ever used, and it feels quite nice.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best primer I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s silky smooth and spread easily.</li>
            <li> I still get concealer in the fine lines under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Allows foundation to be applied easily and you get a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> My pump works just fine</li>
            <li> This primer is pretty good, it helps fill in my smile wrinkles so that when I apply makeup it isn&#x27;t as visible but Target sells it for 3-5 dollars</li>
            <li> but I find this one to be silky smooth &amp; easy to apply.</li>
            <li> The website claims to do the things that makeup primers are supposed to do i.e. provide a smooth canvas for easy makeup application, diminish the appearance of pores etc.</li>
            <li> It glides on like silk and fills in your fine lines and minimizes your pores like spackle.  </li>
            <li> This product did help reduce the look of pores and fine lines</li>
            <li> Looks fine with me</li>
            <li> and it works just fine.</li>
            <li> Never used a primer before I am 48 fine lines not a lot but do like the difference in how my face and make up look.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect because the product was so inexpensive, but putting it on fine lines under my eyes, I did see improvement.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine for a primer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super inlove with this!</li>
            <li> Luckily Amazon has it!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> This primer makes my skin looks and feels super smooth after applying!</li>
            <li> Finishes too quickly!</li>
            <li> Apply on a clean face before applying any of your other makeup for best results!</li>
            <li> I was able to apply the makeup effortlessly on top of my skin and it glided easily over my large pores.</li>
            <li> NYX is almost 4x more than the super cheap ELF</li>
            <li> Great texture- made my face super soft and velvety.</li>
            <li> It was not oily, nice consistency, absorbed &amp;#34;dried&amp;#34; quickly and smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Goes on silky smooth without having to use a ton of product ... makes foundation glide on and stay on.. without settling into fine lines.</li>
            <li> The bottle is kind of large, which helps in dispensing the product, but as others have said, there is not a lot of product in the bottle.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I chose this one as my first pick!</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this product on the first try!</li>

            <li> Such an amazing product!</li>
            <li> When this primer first arrived I wasn&#x27;t sure what to think, but</li>
            <li> but it is well worth it!</li>
            <li> I was excited to use this product because I have never used a primer before.  </li>
            <li> worth it for the $ i save!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to, and I love the price.</li>
            <li> And surprisingly, I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> The first time I purchased it was in a Target store, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find it since.  </li>
            <li> My foundation routine originally did not include face primers, but over time, I noticed that my face makeup would start to rub off after about three hours.</li>
            <li> So, I was really excited when I ordered this.</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I paid for and so much more.</li>
            <li> Since my first order, I have ordered more bottles, so I&#x27;m always stocked up.</li>
            <li> However, this is also the first primer I&#x27;ve ever used, so I don&#x27;t have a lot to compare it to, but at the price, it seems to be the most affordable one on the market.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> But my pores were huge after a couple days of use and full of gunk.</li>
            <li> I think this is totally worth it for $6 on the ELF website!</li>
            <li> I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> This primer is definetly worth the investment!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sold on this one, so worth the buy!</li>
            <li> I wore it one night when I was going dancing and did not think it made any significant difference with keeping my face from looking too oily.</li>
            <li> It helps my makeup stay fresh and stay on longer!</li>
            <li> 5 stars it is so worth it!</li>
            <li> The texture is so Unique</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear it on real hot days.</li>
            <li> Ive had alot of face primers and was excited to try this one i admit the bottle made me buy it.</li>
            <li> I love this primer, makes my makeup long lasting, is smooth and light, my skin really love it!!!</li>
            <li> The product is great but it comes on a little greasy and leaves your hands greasy but it dries on you face and becomes better</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very good; make my skin look silky and set the perfect base for foundation.</li>
            <li> feels amazing as I&#x27;ve been newly using this for a week now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many brand name primers like Mac and Clinique and this ELF one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit of a greasy primer which is great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> But after a couple of seconds, everything became ok - my skin appeared to be smooth, non-fatty and ready for foundation.&lt;br /&gt;The foundation (I use a liquid one)</li>
            <li> This stuff goes on so smooth and makes me face nice and soft and even for applying make up over it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a bunch of primers and this one is by far my favorite:)</li>
            <li> Makes makeup go on super smooth.</li>
            <li> Great with making creases invisible, but when i put it all over the face it made my face greasy and I have dry skin.</li>
            <li> Heard good things about this one, especially since it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> very smooth very</li>
            <li> Other wise I love it</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything special about it.</li>
            <li> On any given day I will go without makeup, but on those special occasions where I know there are gonna be pictures</li>
            <li> nothing special.  </li>
            <li> Nothing special but did the job.</li>
            <li> - I was hoping it would create a better look then it does, however, it&#x27;s certainly acceptable.</li>
            <li> Lol my friends have said the exact same thing.</li>
            <li> noticed the container wasn&#x27;t full of primer</li>
            <li> overall good primer</li>
            <li> and since I got laid off I was looking for something just as good, and obviously cheaper.</li>
            <li> I love it, very silky.</li>
            <li> I love it so much I bought another.</li>
            <li> I really liked the product and the fact that it was clear</li>
            <li> Plus the bottle is deceptive giving the impression of a lot more product than is in there, so comparing the price per ounce tells the real story.  </li>
            <li> kind of gave me a sensitive feeling.</li>
            <li> give it a go ...who knows, you might love it as much as I do ...</li>
            <li> It is true, you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a full bottle sitting on my shelf for a year.</li>
            <li> I love this primer, I really do...</li>
            <li> Another thing is that I&#x27;m never going to be able to use the whole bottle.</li>
            <li> I give it 3 stars because it has been excellent in oil control, but it hasn&#x27;t really done much for my make up lasting!</li>
            <li> Works really well and applies SO smoothly!</li>
            <li> It makes my foundation last longer, makes my face feel good, and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily.</li>
            <li> The container appears to be full and unused.</li>
            <li> I loved the product after I finally got some out!</li>
            <li> This is a very silky primer, I&#x27;ve never tried an e.l.f. product before and was pleased by the quality of this one.</li>
            <li> Full foundation and powder lasts 18 hours with this, even with oily skin that likes to sweat everything off.</li>
            <li> My latest exploration was with a makeup setting mist, and since that seemed to work, I wondered how much I needed a face primer.</li>
            <li> Maybe they are using more than they really need.</li>
            <li> This face primer is ok, it doesn&#x27;t do much for me...</li>
            <li> Just as good as smash box only a fraction of the cost</li>
            <li> To be honest, I saw no difference in using this or going completely without primer.</li>
            <li> At about $6 a bottle, it works better than Smash Box which costs almost five times as much.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no problems with breakouts, and it lasts a full day for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> I loved the way this product felt and the way it made my makeup look, but there is not enough product in this bottle.  </li>
            <li> and this keeps me looking cool all day.</li>
            <li> at least I haven&#x27;t found a perfect primer yet...</li>
            <li> so 2 pumps are good enough.</li>
            <li> this is a good product but not much different then my drug store on.</li>
            <li> it gives you a natural shine all day and it helps keep your make up looking nice</li>
            <li> Not as good as the one currently using.</li>
            <li> and i have seen no bad reactions.</li>
            <li> There is work which can be extended to the whole face and is perfectly made smooth in slight quantity!</li>
            <li> but.. you&#x27;d think its something oily though its also dry and anyway, whatever it is, it spreads so nicely!</li>
            <li> It has no weird smell, and washes off really easy.</li>
            <li> It has helped to actually smooth my skin out and make my pores smaller, I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> It holds back my oily skin all day, goes on smooth and my skin doesn&#x27;t break out any more!</li>
            <li> It makes it just glide on, and it really does smooth over pores and fine lines.</li>
            <li> But Perhaps too light for those needing a heavier primer for aging and fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;I have never broken out from Makeup before in all the years</li>
            <li> It is very easy and seems to make a small difference, in a good way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other face primers and for the price this is a great purchase.  </li>
            <li> I love the product, but the bottle was too small, and I don&#x27;t see a more cost effective way of purchasing the product</li>
            <li> its a little much for the June thru October months in Florida but in.the winter its perfect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so hard to find good quality in cost effective products.</li>
            <li> I will most definitely use again. :)</li>
            <li> If I could describe the texture…its between a super lightweight powder &amp; a pearl feel.</li>
            <li> This dries quickly and did not clog my pores.</li>
            <li> Goes on silky smooth and really works at having your foundation appear smooth.  </li>
            <li> My oily skin isn&#x27;t aggrivated or made super greasy,  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel smoother, and it does make me look more vibrant.</li>
            <li> We love E.L.F. and started using it mainly because of the price and on the recommendation of a friend.  </li>
            <li> Sure, it&#x27;s on the cheap end as far as cosmetics go</li>
            <li> /&gt;Feels great going on (like satin!)&lt;br /&gt;Makeup last much longer compared to when I wasn&#x27;t using one&lt;br /&gt;Keeps</li>
            <li> Next time I rather spend a bit more and get something better.</li>
            <li> I just bought this item to bring my total to free shipping and it has proved to be a nice item to have.</li>
            <li> I am sure that different brands offer better primer though.</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick and item was packaged well.</li>
            <li> I use some expensive makeup and there is no way I&#x27;d pay more for a primer than this, because it works great!</li>
            <li> Other than that, the product does what it says it would, and for a pretty good price i might add!</li>
            <li> Anyway, my T-zone stays fresher and doesn&#x27;t shine too quickly.</li>
            <li> I wear this directly on top of my moisturizing face lotion and then put on my face powder and in this winter weather it helps keep my face looking and feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Runs out too quickly.</li>
            <li> I love it and will be ordering more when I start to get low.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this primer to anyone looking :)</li>
            <li> makes my skin silky smooth before makeup application although the amount in the bottle is deceptively small, very good product thank you very much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many primers high end and drugstore.  </li>
            <li> I use it daily under an HD foundation and it really does a good job of evening out fine lines.</li>
            <li> I have other primers and so far this is the best one.</li>
            <li> my foundation does go on pretty smooth.</li>
            <li> I agree wth most of the other reviewers, this product is amazing.</li>
            <li> However, today I wore the primer for the first time in the sun under some light mineral makeup and bronzer.</li>
            <li> I normally use a moisturizer and liquid foundation, but many YouTube makeup tutorials recommended a primer, so I just had to try it.  </li>
            <li> you just need a very very small amount and it goes along ways, and it feels like your putting on silk on your face, its very smooth and very nice feeling,</li>
            <li> While it does make my skin feel silky smooth and my makeup looks good over it, it doesn&#x27;t seem to work quite as well as the other two I mentioned.</li>
            <li> Overall very satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li> although makeup glides on smoothly after i applied it, I really dont see a significant difference after applying it vs not applying it.</li>
            <li> At the end of a long day where I&#x27;m running around and sweating, my makeup stays in place and my face is fairly matte.</li>
            <li> I use to purchase this about a year ago and it was great for my skin in keeping the shine down.  </li>
            <li> This ELF product is easily just as good as the Smashbox version and it costs waaay less.</li>
            <li> I use it for special occasions as I usually don&#x27;t wear foundation or anything, but this makes my skin so smooth and nice, I love it.</li>
            <li> I never used a &amp;#34;face primer&amp;#34; before, so I was kind of skeptical, but this product goes on smoothly and very nicely</li>
            <li> Works good to fill in pores and lasted me a long time!</li>
            <li> This primer works great, fills in pores, is so smooth going on and keeps my makeup (usually a BB cream and a mineral powder finish)</li>
            <li> Was concerned with sensitive skin that &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; product would irritate or not work for me, but I&#x27;ve gone through the whole bottle no issues and very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have visible pores, and this primer does a great job of making them a lot less visible.  </li>
            <li> This is the first primer I have tried and it seemed to work very well to begin with, but now I am not so sure.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and it feels unbelievable on my skin and my makeup goes on flawlessly!!!!</li>
            <li> Not worth what it does to your face for the rest of the week even if it goes on smooth and feels good on the day you use it.  </li>
            <li> It was pretty cheap and definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and really does prime your face for denser makeups like concealer.</li>
            <li> makeup stays for a long time and it seems so much more healthy than using the oil based lotions</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive as well meaning that most products that I put on my face will break me out.</li>
            <li> and I think it could last me a year or more even!  </li>
            <li> :) Also makes my skin feel soft!</li>
            <li> I gave this primer to my mom (as a gift with some other beauty things she wanted) and she said she really liked it!</li>
            <li> I came back to amazon to order more primer and saw the elf setting spray!</li>
            <li> highly recomend, thsi item!!!</li>
            <li> After my shower, I put this on and my skin is ready and radiant for my make-up!!</li>
            <li> Feels sheer and light, pretty nice feeling on the skin.</li>
            <li> I noticed the first day I used it that I never needed to touch up my foundation or cover up at all!</li>
            <li> smoothens my make up for a more natural look!</li>
            <li> Goes on easily and smoothly with a silky finish that minimizes imperfections despite the fact that it&#x27;s clear.  </li>
            <li> This primer is very light, and it&#x27;s so soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Great product, doesn&#x27;t go very far-- just not enough to the bottle.</li>
            <li> My skin feels very smooth and my makeup looks as natural as ever.</li>
            <li> This primer feels very smooth and soft when I apply it to my skin.</li>
            <li> Lessens appearance of fine lines &amp; skin stays softer &amp; moisturized much longer.</li>
            <li> I is very light and silky and it goes on smoothly and last all day.  </li>
            <li> Great product but so little in bottle</li>
            <li> Without causing any irritaion it softly &amp;#34;fills in&amp;#34; the fine lines and wrinkles leaving a smooth surface to apply my foundation.</li>
            <li> but it is far from the best, being a little too sticky.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> Wow I just tried it and made a huge difference in the way my foundation came on and stayed!</li>
            <li> It really smooths out the face and allows my foundation to go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Again, I&#x27;m no makeup expert, but I can say that this primer makes my face feel really smooth and really does the job well in priming my face for foundation or tinted lotion or anything.</li>
            <li> This seems to fill in my pores and really makes my skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li> This stuff really seems to help smooth out my skin</li>
            <li> I really like how smooth this product goes on and it does indeed feel like silk.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight and gentle on skin.</li>
            <li> it literally covers ur whole face with one pump...leaves a smooth matte canvas to apply ur makeup...</li>
            <li> This primer goes on really smooth but doesn&#x27;t make my makeup stay on much longer than without.</li>
            <li> I was very amazed how smooth this was to apply on my face</li>
            <li> Great for everyday use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think they are cheap but work very well.  </li>
            <li> Revlon is very creamy whereas this one is like a jelly but not greasy and feels silky smooth.</li>
            <li> however i wouldnt recommend this product, the elf mist and set spray because it is amazing, not only</li>
            <li> It makes my pores literally disappear and really does feel like I&#x27;m applying something silky smooth to my skin.  </li>
            <li> Makes your face smooth and silky but there isnt much at all in the bottle</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so light, but can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s really works.</li>
            <li> This is definitely worth every penny</li>
            <li> I rarely use primers so when I used this one, it was so yummy.</li>
            <li> Love this and so soft on face</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a nice primer.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love how soft and silky this makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> beyond that it is fairly clear and healthy.</li>
            <li> this price, it really is a worth trying product.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that its clear &amp; goes on like body lotion, so it blends well.</li>
            <li> sure that when you apply the primer you have a completely washed face.</li>
            <li> I recommend it, it&#x27;s worth a try &amp; you might like it too.</li>
            <li> but it is worth the money</li>
            <li> and it makes ur face so soft I love it</li>
            <li> i thought it was worth mentioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice simple primer.  </li>
            <li> but this goes on quite nicely and feels extra silky!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit of a makeup snob, so take that for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> but that was really the only good thing about it.</li>
            <li> Worth a try</li>
            <li> Aside from the size, I honestly have no complaints, and I would definitely buy again and would recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> Without this primer, I need more makeup to cover my face but this helps me spread it around evenly and naturally.  </li>
            <li> : I rarely wear makeup, maybe 3-4 days a month.</li>
            <li> mostly laugh lines, around my mouth.</li>
            <li> It just kind of left an oily film on my face.  </li>
            <li> I Love How Soft It Makes My Face Feel &amp;&amp;</li>
            <li> When I can actually get the product out i love it and its silky smooth.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feelings airy, light and silky smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with how soft it is.</li>
            <li> Even better buying direct from the companies site.</li>
            <li> i think this product is worth</li>
            <li> I love how soft it feels when it goes on your skin.</li>
            <li> It keeps it on and looking fresh all day</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite e.l.f product.</li>
            <li> Also,  I go for the more natural look and don’t like to feel like I have anything on my face, this product feels weightless .</li>
            <li> I have used this product only once (I am waiting on my other makeup from amazon to come) but it works on great!</li>
            <li> the e.l.f. primer runs out pretty quickly, but for $5-6 a bottle I&#x27;m not complaining.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m just use to using what I use normally, which I guess is a bit thicker and fills in any large pore/scar a bit better.</li>
            <li> I have not used other primers but think that it is a good purchase for this price.</li>
            <li> I loved how even though it was hot outside, my face didn&#x27;t sweat much and didn&#x27;t get oily</li>
            <li> Other than that this product is good.</li>
            <li> and this is the only that holds of my oiliness for about a good 5 hrs and more if I do minor blotting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many primers that claim to be &amp;#34;high-end&amp;#34; but really just have a high price.  </li>
            <li> Make up and blush just glides right on and stays put all day.</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and this just seemed to make my foundation melt right off my face and leaves my skin looking splotchy and greasy.  </li>
            <li> but it melts right into my skin</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right</li>
            <li> I had read the reviews and they were right.  </li>
            <li> This primer right here is the bomb.</li>
            <li> It made my liquid foundation glide right over my pores.</li>
            <li> is always having promos so most likely, you won&#x27;t be paying full price.</li>
            <li> I looked in the mirror and sure enough, my forehead wasn&#x27;t as full coverage looking as I put it on, it did hold onto some of the makeup though.</li>
            <li> i use lees makeup than before and i looks more natural, am going to get another one pretty soon.</li>
            <li> It felt nice on my skin, sort of like Vaseline, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in how my makeup goes on or how long it looks fresh.  </li>
            <li> The primer is super light weight and goes on clear.  </li>
            <li> so applying my make up over it is easy, I do end up having to use more than I expected of it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I was expecting to like this product that much, but I found the product to be very lightweight and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> but when you rub it into your face it goes on smoothly and then makes your skin feel super soft, my make up now lasts all day</li>
            <li> Loving it so far... Goes only smoothly &amp; helps my foundation glide on just right.</li>
            <li> I have purchased four different primers in the last week and this one works the best so far.</li>
            <li> this primer is comparable to bare minerals&#x27; prime time in consistency and texture, but at a much more affordable price.</li>
            <li> Makes face a nice smooth canvas just be careful not to use too much</li>
            <li> I usually use Rimmel, but Elf is actually great.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and definitely helps the mineral foundation not collect in fine lines.</li>
            <li> I think this texture would be great for anyone with dry or normal skin as it is very silky</li>
            <li> but if you have a little more money to spend and are looking for something that will help with more size I recommend either Benefits \\&quot;Porefessional\\&quot; or Too Faced \\&quot;Primed and Poreless\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I applied with my right hand and used my clean left hand to make sure it really felt like that.</li>
            <li> what brand I&#x27;m wearing I&#x27;m certain you will see a boost in your sales!</li>
            <li> Normally, I think a travel size is overpriced and crazy, but in this case I plan to buy a travel sized of Smashbox to keep on hand for those special times when I really want to be sure my makeup is and stays flawless.  </li>
            <li> First time I used it, I could tell a difference right away.  </li>
            <li> This product was so much better than expected because the price was so cheap.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to spend money on a primer, I&#x27;d suggest spending a few more dollars on one that works better.  </li>
            <li> a great product, only thing about it that bothers me is that the quantity is not enough, so I have to buy 2 bottle every time.</li>
            <li> I have been using a primer for over a year that I liked, but that wasn&#x27;t holding back the oil from my oily skin very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy nor does it have any strong scent.</li>
            <li> Goes on as soft as pearls without feeling sticky or thick and holds my makeup on all day not to mention awesome price.</li>
            <li> but you get more product and most importantly, no breakouts.</li>
            <li> No harsh or floral smells, easy to apply</li>
            <li> It is a great alternative to more expensive products.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it is a good primer that spreads on clear.  </li>
            <li> The product went on like silk, made my skin feel so soft and smooth and kept my makeup looking fresh.  </li>
            <li> Very soft and skin after is realy smooth.</li>
            <li> Giving a smooth young skin look!</li>
            <li> Decent primer, nothing special.</li>
            <li> If you have dry patches, although this is nice and moisturizing, use lotion first.</li>
            <li> e.l.f. products comes with very reasonable price tag</li>
            <li> I plan to repurchase this product once I run out, which might take awhile because you also don&#x27;t need to use very much.</li>
            <li> The primer is extremely smooth on my skin and it works better than I expected!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I suggest you fix this, since many people&#x27;s comments reflect the same.</li>
            <li> Lasts all day, even when it&#x27;s hot out.</li>
            <li> My first time trying primer, and I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li> This was actually my first primer &amp; I like it.</li>
            <li> I use it mostly on my cheeks and around the areas of my eyes that are likely to get creases.</li>
            <li> I have tried several primers and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> My first primer</li>
            <li> Works exactly as it should.</li>
            <li> Intend to buy more on the future!</li>
            <li> This is the first time for me getting a primer</li>
            <li> Once the product is out I&#x27;m probably going to invest in a higher quality primer.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this, makeup goes on beautifully!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it needs to do.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with primer.</li>
            <li> This is not only that, but it&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li> If these are issues that you&#x27;re trying to address, perhaps you&#x27;d be better served by purchasing a different product.</li>
            <li> If you get this primer make sure you keep the lid on to keep it from drying out, it will last longer!!</li>
            <li> I had never used a primer before so this was the first time for me.  </li>
            <li> This is my first primer</li>
            <li> It got clogged after the first use.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how light weight it was.</li>
            <li> but I can tell a big difference in the application of my face paint :)</li>
            <li> First time trying this</li>
            <li> This was my first time using primer</li>
            <li> If they are going to sell small stuff they better be more careful with this kind of orders because its easier to get lost if they send it separately.</li>
            <li> primer works better than the two I mentioned above.</li>
            <li> This is my first e.l.f.</li>
            <li> When I first bought it it came to me with a lot of the product in its box.</li>
            <li> and I had no weird skin reaction.</li>
            <li> They advertise in the details \\&quot;Why pay more when you can have the same quality for less?\\</li>
            <li> It just glides on your skin and makes it feel so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I tend to get very oily but with this primer, I hardely ever get oily anymore!</li>
            <li> I used this the first time when I went to a concert and amazed at how well it held up.</li>
            <li> Ladies, if you love makeup, I would definitely suggest this primer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried expensive primers but this one is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I put my whole hand over the nozzle when i go to use it, otherwise it gets on my wall!</li>
            <li> Let me first say I purchased this at Target</li>
            <li> I have never used a product like this before and for a first time</li>
            <li> It came fast!</li>
            <li> Purchased because I wanted to try primer for the first time.</li>
            <li> My makeup applied much smoother with the Elf Primer!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first of December</li>
            <li> Actually like it a lot more than the $$$ one.</li>
            <li> You can get much better primers for a similar price.</li>
            <li> when you first out it on.</li>
            <li> It actually makes my makeup smear more than without it.</li>
            <li> My first time using a primer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> pretty well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just received  the primer first day of use</li>
            <li> I never knew what a primer was until I started looking at make-up reviews on Amazon and saw where a lot of people were talking about using primer first.</li>
            <li> It spreads nicely, feels light and creates a great base for my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first day I got it, I applied it to my skin to see how it made it feel</li>
            <li> The first couple of times I used 1 pump</li>
            <li> I have already recommended it to several people who are also pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love this primer.... especially for the price!!  </li>
            <li> There are a handful of (much) higher end products that I like better, but this achieves the same result while remaining wallet-friendly.</li>
            <li> I was an avid e.l.f.</li>
            <li> This is the first mineral infused primer I&#x27;ve tried, so I can&#x27;t compare it to others.  </li>
            <li> Works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it should.</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> First used e.l.f.</li>
            <li> I have used many products that claim to help with oil control and this actually worked .</li>
            <li> I love the product itself, but the container is such a hassle that I&#x27;d rather use something else.</li>
            <li> when i saw this on amazon i thought it was worth the try for the reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> so it helps keep my day going without having me worry about how much oil had accumulated on my face!</li>
            <li> Regardless of the great quality, for $6 I was expecting to have received at least twice the amount of product.</li>
            <li> I bought this on the ELF website in order raise the price of my order total in order to comply with a promo deal, and I have to say that I was pretty much satisfied.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t exactly like was the layout of the bottle.</li>
            <li> So the pump stopped working after the first use.</li>
            <li> Not that big of a deal since I can still get to the make up, but an inconvience since i have to unscrew the top and use a q-tip or something to scoop some out.</li>
            <li> This is the first one I&#x27;ve ever bought</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s really saying something)!</li>
            <li> This is my first time I have ever used a primer in my life.</li>
            <li> I will definitely order more.</li>
            <li> First of all I purchased this product from ELF and not Amazon.  </li>
            <li> First time using primer ever</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be more on the dryer side, so after a basic exfoliation I apply this on</li>
            <li> This is my first time using primer</li>
            <li> Just give it a minute or 2 before applying the next product, i think it helps :)</li>
            <li> The only thing that I can say that I didn&#x27;t like was how small it is, but it&#x27;s ab awesome primer.</li>
            <li> It felt s pretty shiney with it on.</li>
            <li> and my makeup did not move on a hot sunny day.</li>
            <li> Its very similar and its more at $11</li>
            <li> Why pay more at the mall for the same results.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t use more than necessary.</li>
            <li> When I put the toothpick in, and it hit the bottom, MOST of the toothpick was still above the rim.</li>
            <li> One pump will be more than enough for your face.</li>
            <li> funny how construction terms made their way into the beauty</li>
            <li> I think the primer erases all friction and the skin becomes pretty even.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin SOOOOO soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a product like this</li>
            <li> it does perfectly, EXACTLY what a primer is created to do.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because I heard it is a dupe of a higher end primer.</li>
            <li> so I definitely recommend this to others to try as see for themselves!:)</li>
            <li> This helps with that pretty well.</li>
            <li> it feels a bit greasy at first but does not break me out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> love it and can&#x27;t wait to get back to the States.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think that that tiny, sample-sized bit of product is worth 6 bucks, even though I enjoyed it while it lasted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be sure to check my next bottle to see for the hose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Looks like there&#x27;s more than there actually is...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that there are more expensive primers that would work better</li>
            <li> It works so well for me though that I&#x27;m not even sure I&#x27;d want to try a different brand.</li>
            <li> Definitely going to order more.</li>
            <li> Specifically I use it with essence soft-touch mousse (relatively inexpensive), and faceatelier ultra foundation pro (more spendy).</li>
            <li> Did feel soft and smooth but COATED.</li>
            <li> Have recommended to pretty much everyone I know!</li>
            <li> i love it makes my eye shadow last longer.</li>
            <li> I opened it and immediately had to open the top and shake out the product.</li>
            <li> It does not come with much, so u have to ask yourself if it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price &amp; it works very well!</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying this is the first primer I have used</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s kinda pretty.</li>
            <li> If for some weird reason I needed primer for my fingers or hands then it feels great!</li>
            <li> I really like this primer!</li>
            <li> This is the first primer I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the first time I used a primer</li>
            <li> My face is so smooth and soft after using it.</li>
            <li> It feels good on the skin, it&#x27;s not oily and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>
            <li> e.l.f. is plating some tricky little games in an effort to get more money, something that I strongly disapprove of.</li>
            <li> I am somewhat new to the make up world and decided to give this product a try since I had been hearing so much about why using a primer is important.</li>
            <li> Super smooth and does a terrific job.</li>
            <li> This has definatley made my foundations go on more smoothly and crease less.</li>
            <li> It really helps to even out my skin tone, reduce my pores, and provide just the right amount of moisture to my face.</li>
            <li> I am very prone to acne and peeling skin if I don&#x27;t use the right products.</li>
            <li> When I first apply it, it feels like heaven - super creamy, satiny, soft, excellent coverage, so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I am on some very strong prescription acne drugs, so my face gets very dry.  </li>
            <li> I would rather pay a little bit more to have the container actually filled up.</li>
            <li> (It most likely is purely magical for those with skin not nearly as problematic as mine.)</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product directly from e.l.f.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used some of Elf&#x27;s other products and liked them.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, make-up applies easily over it, and feels amazing!</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t get real wrinkles or crow&#x27;s feet, but it will smooth the natural texture and crinkles in your skin.</li>
            <li> Apparently, the primer bottle worked just fine.</li>
            <li> And it truly last all day, which is is surprising because it totally controls my my oily skin.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and must say that I love the way it even outs my skin and allows makeup to be applied evenly and smoothly.</li>
            <li> the whole white bottle isn&#x27;t filled with it!</li>
            <li> The e.l.f. studio mineral infused face primer is such a nice primer, leaves your face feeling really really soft and make up (liquid foundation)</li>
            <li> Soft, smooth and very lightweight.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and seamless and dries fast.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and for being my first primer, this works pretty well.</li>
            <li> My order arrived early, and after using it the last two days, I am thrilled.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so light and &#x27;soft&#x27;, it almost has a greasy feel to it, which I really don&#x27;t like..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather just pay the price for a GOOD primer that will last longer, you&#x27;ll end up spending the same price anyways.</li>
            <li> It certainly is cheaper than Smashbox and pretty comparable.  </li>
            <li> The actual primer is adequate, nothing special.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure what type of skin this is good for, but it definitely is not for sensitive/acne prone skin and most definitely does not hide any fine lines of any sort.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used primers in the past and they have been excellent at keeping the make up on my face for a long time - which is the main purpose of primers! -</li>
            <li> This was either drained of its product before being shipped to me, or comes with pretty much no product in it at all.  </li>
            <li> I had planned on ordering a primer from Nyx, and really should have gone with my first choice.</li>
            <li> clearly no one thought to check to see if the pump on the bottle would be able to handle it.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s better for me to get it from here, especially since I never buy enough makeup at one time to get the free shipping from the e.l.f. website.</li>
            <li> Sure, it works, but how long did you expect it to work for?</li>
            <li> Pretty much close to no &#x27;excess&#x27; sebum</li>
            <li> Very affordable and works as a primer for about 4 hours instead of 10 like higher priced brands.</li>
            <li> and it dries pretty fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how good it is for your skin.  </li>
            <li> Just as good, if not better, than the pricey primers I&#x27;ve purchased through Sephora or Department Stores.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you firsthand, I have seriously upgraded in the world of cosmetics and it was cheap!!!</li>
            <li> It was my first time to use a primer, and I will still be trying new primers, but I will most likely buy this again!</li>
            <li> OKAY - why has it taken me so long to use this?!</li>
            <li> all day long! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Should I be letting it dry more?</li>
            <li> I have red and discolored areas on my face, and this help my face look more normal.</li>
            <li> when buying this, I have a lot of skin allergies that easily get bothered with facial products.</li>
            <li> If I touch my skin now, it&#x27;s super soft.</li>
            <li> but this primer made my skin super soft and silky to the touch.  </li>
            <li> Someone with dry skin may have better results with it.</li>
            <li> It goes on silky and makes my makeup look smooth and fresh all day long.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, a little goes a long way, and the price is amazing.</li>
            <li> It makes my large pores almost invisible.</li>
            <li> I am still a MAC addict at heart, but since I would rather travel and pay my mortgage, certain sacrifices have to be made...</li>
            <li> I am hooked and have already purchased a few more!</li>
            <li> This is some good stuff.its soft and light.the bottle is somewhat on the small side, but it&#x27;s worth it when you apply it to your face.</li>
            <li> This makes the price literally cents a day for a product that smooths out the fine lines in my face, makes other products more effective and vibrant, and generally makes applying other makeup easier.</li>
            <li> however it didn&#x27;t last me very long, it is good for the price.</li>
            <li> th silky silicone that fills in fine lines and smooths out the larger ones.</li>
            <li> I know Amazon would have done a replacement but didnt seem necessary since the product inside was still fine.</li>
            <li> The well, from the bottom to the top of the mouth of it where the other bits screw onto it, it&#x27;s exactly 1 inch.  </li>
            <li> primer itself works fine, and I use it regularly.</li>
            <li> This gel primer is lightweight, and seems to work pretty decent at keeping the shine at bay, which my oily rosacea skin appreciates.</li>
            <li> The primer is nice and silky, and a little bit goes along way.</li>
            <li> It is an okay quality for a good price, but is nothing like urban decay or other mid or high end primers.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff, I use it every single morning!</li>
            <li> I do have large pores and it doesn&#x27;t really minimize pore size, but it smoothes my skin out so much.  </li>
            <li> This ELF primer smells great and only takes a little bit to get the coverage you need.</li>
            <li> It left my face smooth and foundation stay put the whole day.</li>
            <li> I noticed a HUGE improvement in the amount of time that my makeup would last.</li>
            <li> It glides onto my skin smoothly and I don&#x27;t need a whole lot to evenly cover my entire face.</li>
            <li> Also, to address the comments on the deceiving packaging... they&#x27;re accurate, but you&#x27;ll get the same thing if you buy it in store.</li>
            <li> Really, I was amazed with how well this works and</li>
            <li> I promptly opened the whole bottle to view the inside to see if it had been tampered with(by the way if you use it once</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve been caking on foundation to cover, you really need to drop that habit and get this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Very deceiving.  </li>
            <li> It seemed the bottle does not hold much</li>
            <li> It leaves the skin feeling silky and smooth, controls the shine and makes powder and foundation last longer.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t do much to even that out</li>
            <li> It made my foundation stay on very well</li>
            <li> Primer smooth my face out when mixed with cream foundation.</li>
            <li> it truly beats the whole purpose.     </li>
            <li> I think it works really well to put on before foundation.</li>
            <li> It improved the stay of my makeup and reduced how much oil i produce for a longer period</li>
            <li> It has this silky &amp;#34;silicone&amp;#34; feel to it, which I absolutely detest.</li>
            <li> It looks like I&#x27;ve been at the gym, but really I&#x27;ve just been sitting on the couch.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have spend too much time tying to get the pump to work.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference.</li>
            <li> my face.&lt;br /&gt;i don&#x27;t really use foundation</li>
            <li> As for keeping your face oil free with the make up , not entirely.</li>
            <li> I really like this primer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really misleading.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 5 stars because it seems to work just as well as my fav Vail primer which cost about 6x&#x27;s as much.  </li>
            <li> It really moisturized my skin.</li>
            <li> I use Mac Face powder which goes on very well</li>
            <li> , i found this at target and its really inexpensive.</li>
            <li> but I really don&#x27;t like the odor it emits.</li>
            <li> but I think it is causing me to break out on parts of my face that I accidentally use too much on.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, and my forehead and cheeks tend to get real oily</li>
            <li> Even though is very inexpensive</li>
            <li> I do really like it.</li>
            <li> I have a very oily T-zone during fall/winter times - I have no idea</li>
            <li> When I took the top off to see if there was a clog I saw that the container was almost empty.</li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t need much either; people say 2 pumps, I say 1 pump, so I guess it depends.</li>
            <li> this product leaves such a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> But after I apply this primer, it blends really well, my face feels so smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so greasy, it really isn&#x27;t meant for oily skins.</li>
            <li> This one is really working for me and helped my make-up stay longer.  </li>
            <li> If you use too much of this silicone based primer</li>
            <li> /&gt;Downsides are that it doesn&#x27;t have SPF protection and doesn&#x27;t really have much moisturizing qualities.</li>
            <li> i spent 50$ on more e.l.f. products.</li>
            <li> I really like this e.l.f.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do that much though.</li>
            <li> and I feel like I get my money&#x27;s worth out of it so far.</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t for the pump being broken I&#x27;d give it 5 stars because like I said this is a great product just screwed up packaging.</li>
            <li> very drying, but does its job</li>
            <li> REALLY</li>
            <li> I really like this one</li>
            <li> THANK YOU SO MUCH.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li> It looks like very liquidy goo, but once it touches your skin and you blend it out, it feels mineral-like.</li>
            <li> but I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> You get a smoother finish and don&#x27;t have to use as much product.</li>
            <li> it is very smoothing without being overbearingly greasy, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Just one pump does my whole face.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need to use as much foundation even.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really tell a difference with or without using it.</li>
            <li> I even have noticed that the make up doesn&#x27;t slip from my face as much as it use to.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My skin is very oily by itself, and the primer made my skin surface even greasier.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Didn&#x27;t really do much for my skin besides made it feel slippery</li>
            <li> One pump and ur ready...</li>
            <li> This primer has really helped prolong the wear of my make up.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how much product is in there.</li>
            <li> The product is fabulous and you don&#x27;t need a lot, I just wish I could monitor how much is left.</li>
            <li> All the people complaining about how much you get like really??</li>
            <li> Feels really oily.</li>
            <li> I really like this face primer.</li>
            <li> The brush really does distribute the foundation evenly.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t put powder on immediately after foundation because your face is still really moist from the primer.</li>
            <li> It had a really greasy feeling on my skin and gave the feeling of caking it on.</li>
            <li> For the price I really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> i really can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s working&lt;</li>
            <li> (really that&#x27;s all you need</li>
            <li> up/skin - you look powder fresh nearly all day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would definitely re-buy this product because of the:&lt;br /&gt;- cheap price</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make the pores look smaller, but it does provide a smooth canvas for you to work with.</li>
            <li> My make-up stays on so much longer.  </li>
            <li> I can go the whole day without my eyebrows sliding off of my face.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to just give this a one star.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really complain about the quantity since they specifically told you how much product was in there on the product&#x27;s page.</li>
            <li> my whole life, no wonder</li>
            <li> I also use just 1 pump/drop for my whole face.</li>
            <li> Works very well with my makeup.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t say that very often.</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> and it keeps my makeup put for the whole day.</li>
            <li> Do not put too much on or you will get greasy skin.  </li>
            <li> I really like this primer.</li>
            <li> I apply it before getting ready for work, have my coffee and read some</li>
            <li> one pump does my whole face including my eyelids, and if I&#x27;m going out</li>
            <li> You are now ready to paint your face.</li>
            <li> I wanted to purchase some then because it makes application of your make up so much easier.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t really have much knowledge on them, but</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have much of an odor</li>
            <li> It holds my makeup in place and holds up well throughout the day (I have REALLY oily skin</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> the delievery fast and wrapped well too.  </li>
            <li> so  dont really have anything to compare it to</li>
            <li> but I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I really like ELF but when compared with Benefits $30 primer and it can&#x27;t stand up.</li>
            <li> I am very dissatisfied.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> did not report to customer service, the price was cheap enough</li>
            <li> The texture is really neat.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel even and make-up ready.</li>
            <li> makes your make up shine thru really fast.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for me.</li>
            <li> i would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Really like this.</li>
            <li> Makes skin silky smooth and blots excess oil (I have enough for 8 people) for hours and hours.</li>
            <li> This product works really well</li>
            <li> i dont really use primers.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed much of a difference in my skin after using it.</li>
            <li> there was nothing in it it pumped but absolutely nothing came out.</li>
            <li> Very deceiving.</li>
            <li> but it does nothing else really.  </li>
            <li> only faulty thing about it is its cheap bottle, the pump sticks</li>
            <li> As someone with skin that breaks out from time to time, this really helps cover patchy spots.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> Plus there isn&#x27;t much in the container</li>
            <li> But any help i can get is appreciated.</li>
            <li> Very comparable to Smashbox Primer..</li>
            <li> I used it for a week straight</li>
            <li> I like the product but did not see how it really improved the longevity of make-up on my face.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really work how I thought it would.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this.</li>
            <li> I really like this primer.  </li>
            <li> skin starts feeling very slippery after you put it</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t expecting any miracles considering the price (under $4)</li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> Thanks again</li>
            <li> It makes my face really matte (my skin is oily on the T zone) and my face doesn&#x27;t become shiny.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> Thus product worked really well.</li>
            <li> i have very oily skin</li>
            <li> I really like this primer.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t break me out, I really have had any problem with the content itself.</li>
            <li> This works really well.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous primers from cheap drugstore to spendy department store brands and nothing</li>
            <li> I really like how the product feels on my face.</li>
            <li> The bottle is deceiving however it does say how much product you are getting</li>
            <li> my skin is still oily at my age &amp; seems to drink in my Bareminerals foundation - so much that I&#x27;d have to reapply again around lunchtime.</li>
            <li> Packaged very well.  </li>
            <li> Let me just say that this primer works really well.  </li>
            <li> The picture (and bottle) are very deceiving.</li>
            <li> but it runs out quite fast</li>
            <li> was that the pump doesn&#x27;t really work</li>
            <li> - I just use a Q-tip to scoop out how much I want</li>
            <li> makes my skin really oily and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Very lightweight feeling and makes it easier to appy and remove makeup.</li>
            <li> The bottle is misleading; you think there is a reasonable amount in the bottle, but</li>
            <li> really fast.&lt;br /&gt;Breakouts-</li>
            <li> Makeup blends and is so much prettier with this on under it.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t seem very eco-friendly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a terrible product, but it&#x27;s not REALLY going to help your makeup stay on all day.</li>
            <li> I like this because it makes my skin feel smooth, but I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s actually doing anything to enhance the way my makeup looks at all.</li>
            <li> It also seemed to keep me relatively shine free as my day went on</li>
            <li> but with a bit it covers your whole face.</li>
            <li> I have never broken out because of this product (which happens with a lot of others)</li>
            <li> e.l.f. claims that the primer works as a smooth canvas upon which to place your makeup which allows it to help your makeup stay on longer and is also supposed to help diminish the look of larger pores.</li>
            <li> I noticed that my face was very greasy.</li>
            <li> was that I kept using too much.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I really do like elf products.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This primer really made the difference with how my liquid foundation goes on and how it looks when done.</li>
            <li> After i tryed it on it was just a very think oily product it litterly felt like i was rubbing</li>
            <li> its also very conveniently in a push-pump container (like lotion bottles are)</li>
            <li> yea it&#x27;s a good price, but it really sucks.</li>
            <li> Formula is decent enough but the bottle broke/got separated way too easily.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different face primers and I have to say this makes my face INCREDIBLY silky and soft and</li>
            <li> Not a everyday wear because I don&#x27;t wear makeup everyday but good buy.</li>
            <li> I had red spots on my face for months and used this for two days the red spots are completely gone good product for $6.00.</li>
            <li> I barely have to apply powder after working in full makeup all day.</li>
            <li> this product does a better job than the expensive kind I&amp;#34;ve tried.</li>
            <li> offers quite a few good products and this is one of them.</li>
            <li> looks a little bit better when it is applied over primer, than when it is applied on skin right after moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I did wish there was a little more in the bottle, but for the value and amount of product, it&#x27;s just right.</li>
            <li> Like all the other reviews say, great product, just not very much of it in one container.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear make-up that often, but I do take pride in my complexion, so this clear primer will fit right into my facial regimen.</li>
            <li> I USED to use a very similar primer from a well-known high end cosmetics company for several times more!  </li>
            <li> My Primer Came In 6 Days Early and Undamaged!!!</li>
            <li> This product would probably be better suited for someone with normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li> would reccommend this E.L.F. primer for people with normal skin (and maybe dry skin), but those with more oily or combination complexions might want to try something else.</li>
            <li> I use lots of other e.l.f cosmetics though and think they are a great deal for the price so perhaps that is why I am being lenient on the broken bottle pump.</li>
            <li> The price is unbelievably reasonable and the results are superior in comparison with other similar products I&#x27;ve purchased at department stores!!</li>
            <li> But it fills in my wrinkles, my pores, makes my super dry skin very moist, and makes my makeup glide on evenly!!</li>
            <li> Makes skin feel soft and foundation glides right on.</li>
            <li> ; but then i started to smooth it on and was happy to find that i was wrong!</li>
            <li> easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;stay long</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant first time buying it because Elf has a reputation of having cheap quality products but this primer is defiantly not one of them!</li>
            <li> I love other e.l.f. products but would never buy this one again.</li>
            <li> so I am excited for my next girls night.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I decided to try E.L.Fs primer because I was satisfied with their other products, but I have to say that I won&#x27;t be purchasing this anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> High quality for such a cheap price?</li>
            <li> Light and silky, you can barely feel it putting it on but leaves your skin so soft.</li>
            <li> , I really was surprised, but I really like it!</li>
            <li> Not only does it make my face smooth, but it help my make up stay longer than normal.</li>
            <li> That cylinder is mostly empty, and there is barely anything in there, I don&#x27;t know why they even bothered honestly.</li>
            <li> It also lasts a long time, so its a good value for the money spent.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone trying to maintain a high end beauty routine for a much lower cost.</li>
            <li> It really changed how I do my makeup, and I would highly recommend it for any skin type on any budget.</li>
            <li> I only use this for weekends and special occasions as it does seem to cause a pimple or two if I wear it too often.</li>
            <li> It gives you skin a very matte look, completely fresh with not a single shine if you have oily skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this every day, only on special occasions.</li>
            <li> I do not use any special matte products, I only use this primer, liquid foundation and</li>
            <li> swear by this primer even when most of their other cosmetics are high</li>
            <li> On my fingers and the back of my hand, once it&#x27;s had a minute to set and soak in, it feels very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I usually just do a light powder and bronzer for everyday, so I think I am more sensitive than most to heavier foundations.</li>
            <li> Maybe its better for normal day wear than for out wear when they may be dancing or other vigorous activity.</li>
            <li> I would recomment the clear primer because my face got pretty oily with the purple one.</li>
            <li> I purchase from Amazon a lot, more than the average person, and I figured I would buy my make-up from here too,</li>
            <li> If you ever choose to buy directly from e.l.f&#x27;s website, google promo/coupon codes first</li>
            <li> My box was also pretty banged up when It arrived so I wasn&#x27;t too surprised about this.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t improve the overall look of my skin that much, but makeup does last better.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I read a review that said that prior to me buying it, its true.</li>
            <li> I was surprised when I used this the first time because of the color and texture.</li>
            <li> I am a 24 y/o african american with very oily skin (as in I can&#x27;t go more than 2 hours without using blotting papers or blotting powder to get rid of my shine).</li>
            <li> Overall, not bad.  </li>
            <li> My favorite primer hands down.  </li>
            <li> I was sort of able to get it to work by turning bottle upside down and shaking the product toward the top of bottle and using the pump holding bottle upside down.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love how quickly I go through it, and how little you&#x27;re actually getting vs how large the container appears.</li>
            <li> But overall I like this product and has a nice finished look and much lower cost than other name brands.</li>
            <li> i also live in a very hot/ humid country as well</li>
            <li> BUT I unscrewed the top to look inside as soon as I opened the package and the tube to the pump was snapped in half.</li>
            <li> So I have to let my face dry forever and then lightly put on powder.</li>
            <li> and you get so much more product for much less.</li>
            <li> I even tried waiting more than 10 minutes for this product to sink in only to have the same results.</li>
            <li> Decent product for the price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more expensive than much better brands.</li>
            <li> the price, I would definitely purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than the more expensive ones that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Stop paying these big name big brands when you get BETTER results with elf.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better primers - but they were much more expensive.  </li>
            <li> The entire reason I sought to purchase a primer is because I have super oily skin.  </li>
            <li> I gave it four stars because throughout my youth and into my college years, this was a dependable, decently priced item.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling and looking smooth and soft, and helps my makeup to last all day!</li>
            <li> I am a cosplayer who was looking for a decent primer that did not induce oil overload on my face.</li>
            <li> I think that it works better, but it is much more expensive.  </li>
            <li> The primer itself does a decent job.  </li>
            <li> but it does I recommend it and remember that any type of make up you use takes about 3 days or more to adjust to your skin so if you buy this don&#x27;t expect it to instantly work, but it does work it took me only like two days of using it to adjust .Also</li>
            <li> The pump works very well and you do not waste product at all!  </li>
            <li> My foundation goes on SO smoothly, and can last an ENTIRE day when I apply this primer first.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin very soft!</li>
            <li> One pump usually spreads well all over the face and leaves the face super smooth.</li>
            <li> I put it on after using a high end moisturizer</li>
            <li> This product goes on very smooth and does not feel heavy.  </li>
            <li> High quality drug store face primer.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I use that, add alittle of lotion (non scented, high moisturizing) to my foundation</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this if you&#x27;re on a budget.</li>
            <li> It is very light and does to feel heavy on my face at all.</li>
            <li> Before I begin the review, I want to say that I&#x27;ve never used high end make up, so take that into consideration!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li> i had a sample of some primer through the mail (the high price ones).</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high expectations of this primer</li>
            <li> I will highly recommend to friends and others.</li>
            <li> HIghly rec.</li>
            <li> Would highly reccommend.  </li>
            <li> High quality primer .It gets my thumbs up.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this primer.  </li>
            <li> I love a lot of their products such as eyeliners and brushes, and I keep coming back to see what&#x27;s new.</li>
            <li> product is great but the bottle only contains a very small amount</li>
            <li> first of all its super tiny barely the size of my pinky</li>
            <li> I got a little better result with M.A.C Prep and Prime.</li>
            <li> You can use and skip concealer and go with just a little powder this had become a part of my regimen love it truly recommend</li>
            <li> but it was a little greasy feeling so more.</li>
            <li> But for $6, you should get a little more product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other primers in the past (Too Faced and L&#x27;oreal Studio Magic) and this is not my favorite.</li>
            <li> It also dried up inside of the container super quick and started to sort of ball up when I tried to apply it to my face.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply and is a good base for my BB Cream &amp; foundation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll most likely use it just to apply eye shadow, it goes on much easier than a dry lid!</li>
            <li> This may sound a little funny, but I think I like this product.</li>
            <li> I live in New York where they just opened an e.l.f. store , goodbye Sephora!</li>
            <li> Very light weight, and no strong smell.</li>
            <li> However, I ran out of primer and was looking for a new primer at a decent price.</li>
            <li> It did not feel greasy or have a bad smell and best of all, I did not have any breakouts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive and works wonders; making my face extra smooth and even for my foundation to go on so much easier and last longer!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does absolutely nothing for my face.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, might as well just not buy it, because you&#x27;re not missing anything.</li>
            <li> I really like how soft it makes my face feel</li>
            <li> I really thought that I was probably going to breakout by using this since I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I think it may be  concealer side effect in general, but this was one was pretty oily.</li>
            <li> My face normally gets oily mid-day</li>
            <li> When I use this product my makeup will stay fresh looking for the entire workday.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product i use it everyday</li>
            <li> I have tried other primers but since I have loved the other elf products I have, I figured I would give this a shot.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is a good size, but the actual product (primer) is in a small stick inside the bottle.</li>
            <li> and whenever I include the primer to my makeup regimen, my skin is not as oily as it normally is.</li>
            <li> It keeps my makeup in place longer that it normally does.</li>
            <li> Love this, only thing is you cannot keep it that long, as it ashes</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it as a basic primer.</li>
            <li> not sure if this is useful at all  -  makes skin smooth but makeup dont hold longer at all -</li>
            <li> the pump will not work and it isn&#x27;t worth the money for shipping it back.  </li>
            <li> This is worth a try especially for the price.</li>
            <li> It was more then just a few pimples.</li>
            <li> gross but true life isn&#x27;t always pretty) became swaths of red raised inflamed areas.</li>
            <li> Whether it was freshly put onto my face or left to sit, foundation over it just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different primers and so far I love the ELF</li>
            <li> Well priced, the quality is as good as my Victoria&#x27;s Secret primer.</li>
            <li> It is no longer thick and it appears to be some kind of oderless oil.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it helps to keep the oil down, but as an initial primer, it feels nice to apply.</li>
            <li> Other than that it worked fine the one time I tried it.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive skin, when I put it on, it feels smooth on face but it would not really cover up the pore.</li>
            <li> I ordered this looking for a cheaper alternative to the high end primers that you can get at MAC or Sephora and I was pleasantly surprised at how well this worked!</li>
            <li> Oily skin doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not dry and in need of good moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Although it didn&#x27;t make my skin as soft as this primer did, Revlon&#x27;s primer kept my makeup looking fresh all day with no touchups, and for only a few dollars more (depending on where you buy it)</li>
            <li> All the other reviews on this product are accurate.  </li>
            <li> I have used a couple of other primers before, but none as light as this one.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to wear much since one full pump seems enough but this has become the only primer I use now.</li>
            <li> Could live without it.</li>
            <li> New fav.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I could live without it now</li>
            <li> My new go to product.</li>
            <li> I heard the new batch of primers has an improved pump, so I&#x27;d repurchase it.</li>
            <li> Foundation slides on smoothly and  all the more expensive  primers in my makeup box that didn&#x27;t live up</li>
            <li> (you&#x27;d think the entire container was filled, but really it&#x27;s a tiny tube inside.  </li>
            <li> you know how much you&#x27;re buying as the size of the container compared to how much is actually inside is very misleading.</li>
            <li> This product is very inexpensive but very good!I alternate with my Cover Girl &amp; Olay primer!</li>
            <li> Stating That The Bottles Are Only Half Full Which Is Mostly True</li>
            <li> /&gt;Leaving the old review even though it mainly shows that I am a doofus.&lt;br</li>
            <li> foundation on top needless to say my skin looked very soft, smooth  even skin tone.</li>
            <li> It feels a little greasy at first, but it dries quickly and it leaves a super-smooth and silky face that you can use as a canvass for your makeup.</li>
            <li> Works very well... Not quite as smooth as BareMinerals Prime Time, but for half the price I&#x27;m not complaining!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft and velvet feeling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It make my skin very soft</li>
            <li> Very smooth and silky, Feels exactly like primers I have had in the past from Sephora, and does the job just the same.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, though.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive and acne prone skin</li>
            <li> I dont have very sensitive skin either, but it works.</li>
            <li> It does leave your skin very soft.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, acne-prone skin</li>
            <li> Also, I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My makeup routine, due to all of my personal issues is somewhat time consuming and particular, I really love that this still allows my makeup to look fresh after very long days.(approximately 17 hours)</li>
            <li> Less than one full pump is all that&#x27;s needed to do a whole face -</li>
            <li> While the product may feel a bit greasy during the first few seconds but it quickly absorbs into the skin.</li>
            <li> A few clogged pores on super hot days.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> I have tried some other&#x27;s with tint, ad I like the fact that this is clear, it goes on so smooth.</li>
            <li> I have no complain with them, they acted absolutely great with me, sent an apology and even refund the product value due the late arrive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I gotta say, wow!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s like the exact opposite of what a primer is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought primer before and paid a pretty penny for smaller jars than this.</li>
            <li> This works pretty well as a basic primer.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s better than all others I used in the past, for me it&#x27;s a keeper!!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The container is fairly small, but for the price, I don&#x27;t mind buying a couple at a time - it&#x27;s still cheaper than 1 bottle of a top of the line face primer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ihave never been one who was willing to go outside with no makeup on.</li>
            <li> It seems to do exactly the opposite of what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> It is pretty lightweight but still enough coverage.</li>
            <li> I actually believe that this primer is better than the more expensive one.</li>
            <li> I feel as though I&#x27;ve had to use MORE of this product though to do the same thing as other primers-</li>
            <li> The bottle looks pretty enough that I can leave it out on the counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Exact same price on Amazon as it is on Elf&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li> It feels so soft, like silk!</li>
            <li> After searching on amazon for the exact ounce measurement, I discovered it was only 0.47 ounces.</li>
            <li> Also, for those of you with sensitive skin like me, this doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or make me break out at all!</li>
            <li> After the first use the next day I had severe break out all over my face.</li>
            <li> I have actually bought several bottles of this since I made my original review and realize that the problem was me and not the bottle.</li>
            <li> I never wore it more than a couple times a week because it left my skin very red and irritated the next day.</li>
            <li> The only problem I had when I first received this product</li>
            <li> I swear it feels exactly the same</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the consistency was SUPPOSED to be like, but when I got it, the primer was like a congealed gel and I have to remove the top whenever I want to use it.</li>
            <li> A little goes a LONG way, and the product is actually of a nice size.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and it spreads so nicely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used one other face primer, but so far I love the e.l.f.</li>
            <li> I have to use moisturizer constantly, and I still get a lot of creases in my makeup where the fine lines are dry.  </li>
            <li> This is my fav primer helps to makes wrinkles less visible and makes my skin feel baby bottom smooth no build up</li>
            <li> Typical primer, nothing fantastic</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because I thought surely a product you pay $25 for would work better than a primer I paid less than $5 for.</li>
            <li> I usually use L&#x27;Oreal, Studio Secrets Professional Magic</li>
            <li> Pretty much false advertisement if you will but its okay... not re-purchasing..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clear gel and it made my skin feel very soft and</li>
            <li> (I originally gave it 5 stars but bumped it down to two stars.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thicker, almost gel like, and goes on so smooth.</li>
            <li> So with the recent break out spots I started to wear concealer and a little more foundation.</li>
            <li> I am going to try some other products, because this seems to run out quickly.</li>
            <li> Its clear like a gel</li>
            <li> I ordered the clear primer, the site gives you 3 options to choose from, I went with the clear.</li>
            <li> just because it&#x27;s easier to feel where it goes since it&#x27;s clear.</li>
            <li> I have used Bareminerals Clear Primer for over a year, which cost $26 plus tax BTW, and this e.l.f.</li>
            <li> I got the clear.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear and I don&#x27;t have to worry about glitter or such&lt;</li>
            <li> Goes on clear and keeps my makeup in place all day without any creasing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a clear face primer.</li>
            <li> I know this didn&#x27;t cost that much to begin with but arriving almost empty, really?</li>
            <li> and I have to unscrew the clear part off and push it up manually</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear, so it goes with anyone&#x27;s skin tone.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product in the color clear in mid-September of 2013 for the upcoming school year.</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s well worth it because it has the feel of a much more expensive product.</li>
            <li> Goes on clear.</li>
            <li> The primer is clear and smells like nothing.</li>
            <li> It was clear like I thought</li>
            <li> The clear feels and seems oily</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear and gel-like in texture.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the clear primer, it just feels like lotion</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that it was clear, so I didn&#x27;t have to worry about matching my skin or anything like that.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work its definitely clear but let me tell you just go</li>
            <li> Although it reminds me of Vaseline, it looks clear but feels like Vaseline.</li>
            <li> love the primer at least (: the product I could try</li>
            <li> It makes my pores smaller and really changes the way make up looks on your skin.</li>
            <li> This really does fill in pores and you can totally tell the difference when you&#x27;ve got it on versus when its not on.</li>
            <li> My face looks like its been edited with the soft feature.</li>
            <li> came early tho</li>
            <li> It has a sort of soft powder feel too it, although it&#x27;s a liquid.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have irritation with some primers but not this one.</li>
            <li> This makes my face so soft.</li>
            <li> For the price I was surprised at how well it worked.  </li>
            <li> It made my skin really soft before applying any makeup and it did not feel oily or greasy to the touch.  </li>
            <li> I love this primer, but gave it 3 stars because the pump sucks.</li>
            <li> Prevents natural skin oils from making your face look &amp;#34;shiny&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> and so far I have no doubts in this brand.</li>
            <li> I do make up professionally.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the value of this primer.</li>
            <li> But overall, I do like the product and would probably buy it again, but not from Amazon -$10 is way too much.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not broken, don&#x27;t fix it&amp;#34; so I am back to my e.l.f.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive acne prone skin</li>
            <li> It was smaller than I expected, but overall, it made my face feel smooth!</li>
            <li> Oily, old, acne prone,tanning.</li>
            <li> but I completely disagree (and I have oily skin).  </li>
            <li> have sensitive skin)</li>
            <li> and I got the package a day early</li>
            <li> considering that I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen some people complain about the amount of actual product in the bottle, but I think they may just be using too much of it.  </li>
            <li> Using this product, my make up looks last so much longer than they use to.</li>
            <li> My skin become so soft after the application, it&#x27;s incrdible.</li>
            <li> Non-irritating on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and I have sensitive skin and no outbreak</li>
            <li> I just started back using it and didn&#x27;t realize how much I missed it.  </li>
            <li> You will be surprised at what&#x27;s left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a face primer before, so I can&#x27;t compare this to professional makeup primer.</li>
            <li> I have nothing to compare it to, but I noticed a marked difference between how my makeup went on, blended &amp; wore throughout the day when using the elf primer underneath.</li>
            <li> #34;smooth on&amp;#34; for a natural look when wearing make up.</li>
            <li> When I remove it after a day out, my skin feels sensitive and tinging.</li>
            <li> Ordered this product about a month ago...and wow.</li>
            <li> Very simple and fast to use.</li>
            <li> After a bit of powder, your skin feels so soft and velvet</li>
            <li> I was surprised however this did not break me out or cause a hellish rash.</li>
            <li> but nothing near how my skin is without the primer.</li>
            <li> Really helps to make the makeup last on the skin.</li>
            <li> But having finally tried it out, I can say that I really like it.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it pumps way too much primer.</li>
            <li> It allowed my makeup to lay naturally.</li>
            <li> I have been looking of a primer that was like the old smash box primer.  </li>
            <li> Not heavy.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and have had no breakouts.  </li>
            <li> Makeup goes on effortlessly, there is no smell to the product, and it makes skin baby soft without effecting dry/oily skin.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s make my skin really really soft</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and didn&#x27;t have any problems with this product.</li>
            <li> Somehow, it was out of the box, and completely out of the packaging when it arrived.</li>
            <li> Only downside is there isn&#x27;t much product in the bottle.</li>
            <li> It does not irritate or break out my sensitive skin and goes on smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am 30 yrs old</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was on the cheaper end, and I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I marked the toothpick and measured it.</li>
            <li> suffice to say i was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> It makes the foundation or powder stay for much longer, and I use it definitely with mineral makeup.</li>
            <li> Also, one pump is enough for your whole face.</li>
            <li> and I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> or if it just was missed completely.</li>
            <li> and my skin doesn&#x27;t get nearly as oily throughout the day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other reviewers were correct that the container is deceiving as the actual amount of product is really small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My foundation goes on easier, looks smoother and I don&#x27;t get anywhere near as shiny in my t-zone as I used to.</li>
            <li> I wear my makeup for nearly 12 hours a day and it stays flawless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found it at a Target store and was surprised at how well it</li>
            <li> but it just doesn&#x27;t do much for me and it makes my skin extra greasy.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t need too much to cover your entire face.</li>
            <li> Visually it looks like a gel, but it feels much lighter and softer, almost silky.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised.</li>
            <li> The Elf mineral primer works much like the Smashbox primer, only for a quarter of the price.</li>
            <li> Leave my skin soft and even with a velvet sensation that prepare for a foundation.</li>
            <li> Your skin is so soft when you use this.</li>
            <li> Goes on clear and feels so soft and silky on my skin.</li>
            <li> Plus, the amount of product you get is so minimal that it just wasn&#x27;t worth the $6 at Wal-Mart - there&#x27;s like</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use up my two bottles (don&#x27;t want to waste it), but will look for a better quality next time.  </li>
            <li> though it&#x27;s a bit more expensive, it&#x27;s worth it to me because it doesn&#x27;t break my face out like the e.l.f.</li>
            <li> Provdes excellent base for your makeup.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a thick, silky cream.</li>
            <li> It is a good primer, don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> Sister is also very impressed with product, and it&#x27;s ability to rpovide a base fr</li>
            <li> I love how long it holds my makeup for ecspecially in the heat Down south.</li>
            <li> It is very affordable and it lasted me a long time before having to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> No little straw on inside to make pump work.</li>
            <li> I needed a primer because my skin&#x27;s texture is never very smooth (and it&#x27;s SUPER sensitive)</li>
            <li> Yeah, not really considering other primers have a ton more in them.</li>
            <li> Look further into other primers before deciding to buy this one because it is cheap...</li>
            <li> but you don&#x27;t need to use much at all, and it&#x27;s very inexpensive compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> Just dab a little at first to see how much you will need.</li>
            <li> My makeup goes on smooth and makes my 43 yr old skin look younger and brighter, it also cuts down on my T-Zone oily skin from showing through.</li>
            <li> But, you really only need a very little of the product, as is the case with most face primers.</li>
            <li> My daughter has gone through no less than probably 12 of these and continues to use it.  </li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering elf studio mineral primer and it still feels like the same exact smashbox formula to me.</li>
            <li> smell is a bit odd but fades quickly.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this product given its very low price......</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a high school student who wears makeup to school daily</li>
            <li> Its affordable and works the same as any high end product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it especially if you&#x27;re in my situation.    </li>
            <li> because I&#x27;ll tell you right now it does not last long</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: My make-up knowledge isn&#x27;t that extensive I&#x27;ve just recently found myself getting into it a little more.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical because it is so super cheap</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s true what the other reviewer said, the pump is not that great - it will squirt out on ya if you&#x27;re not careful, but not too bad.  </li>
            <li> While there isn&#x27;t a whole lot of product in the bottle, it does go a long way.</li>
            <li> I know it sounds strange, but it almost made my face feel like a canvas, ready to soak up the makeup!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other reviews say that It&#x27;s too small, as a light makeup user I will test this myself and post an update.</li>
            <li> have dry, sensitive skin and everything seems to either oxidize quickly or makes me dry.</li>
            <li> First I thought my bottle was empty.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used any other kind of face primer, so I am not sure how it is on a scale, but I like it.</li>
            <li> I love how it&#x27;s very similar to one of my other more expensive face primer.</li>
            <li> The bottle may seem large, but the reservoir that actually holds the product is tiny.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend it to others, especially if you have large pores like I do</li>
            <li> With the help of a little finishing powder i&#x27;m good to go from 8am to at least 4pm if not longer.  </li>
            <li> This ELF Face primer is fairly long lasting, applies smoothly, and works better on my skin than the expensive smashbox product.  </li>
            <li> Previously I have purchased some of their mineral makeup and was satisfied other than finding it was not made in the USA.  </li>
            <li> My skin is dry &amp; sensitive, but this product leaves my skin feeling extremely hydrated &amp; super soft.</li>
            <li> This is a manufacturing issue and as a regular amazon shopper I expect a new one to be delivered.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am new to using primer and the stuff i was using before (Revlon) was white and almost like lotion</li>
            <li> I always want to try something new but come back to this one every time.  </li>
            <li> With really crappy skin you could touch up once-twice during a very long day.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday and it keeps my makeup long lasting and very smooth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel this product made my pores look smaller, but I DO notice a much smoother finish overall.</li>
            <li> I work long hours at work and after a long day at work, my face still looks fresh.</li>
            <li> But, this is definitely helping your make up to last for a much longer time.</li>
            <li> My makeup stays on just as long, and the consistency of the product is exactly the same.</li>
            <li> The primer is good, but unfortunately there is not enough in the bottle.</li>
            <li> I dont like to waste it on a quick outing.</li>
            <li> The formula is clear and goes on really smooth, it wasn&#x27;t too runny, thick, sticky or smelly like others I have tried.</li>
            <li> Primer helps a lot when you have a long work day or night ahead and want to look relatively the same as you did when you first put your makeup on!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and am alergic to several things including latex and adhesives and this product did not cause a reaction</li>
            <li> was a major plus.  </li>
            <li> which is a major plus.</li>
            <li> I will only use this since I left my HD Primer from Makeup Forever from Sephora, which I compare to and to me they look, feel and cover the exact same!</li>
            <li> Exactly what i expected!</li>
            <li> I like some other primers a little more.</li>
            <li> And you need a really small amount to last you the entire day! :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes more time to dry than other primers do.&lt;br /&gt;The only foundations it works well with are Elf foundations - everything else came out cakey or just didn&#x27;t last throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Primers can get waaaaaaay too expensive for someone that needs it like I need it, but I gave this one a chane recently, applied it first on a clean face, then put on my favorite foundation, then topped it off with a makeup setting spray (my usual routine)</li>
            <li> and it makes you face feel like it has a super soft slick surface for you makeup to be applied onto.</li>
            <li> It definitely does improve the way liquid foundation goes on, and how your complexion looks, but this primer requires a powder on top to finish off, otherwise your face will feel very slick.  </li>
            <li> This primer gave me a very good base line for my mineral makeup to sit on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several primers, high end, low end.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve searched high and low for a primer that actually made a difference and didn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li> your makeuo goes on so smooth and dewy, and heres a little tip ,  after your makeup is applied and done, add a tiny drop of primer in the palm of your hand and apply to any areas that you would like be extra dewy looking....</li>
            <li> It works as expected but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s my favorite of this type of product.  </li>
            <li> got this for $3 here on amazon - it is $6 at my local target and between prime and never making small orders, I get free shipping</li>
            <li> The bottle isn&#x27;t as small as I expected it to be, but no complaints there :)</li>
            <li> It really helps the foundation and makeup last for a long time.  </li>
            <li> It is a clear facial primer.</li>
            <li> as far as blending different colors of your skin tone?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably go back to my old vendor who sells a thinner viscosity primer.</li>
            <li> but so far it works well on my face especially in the morning</li>
            <li> I gave it to a younger person as glitter does not belong in a professional office environment.</li>
            <li> Only tried it with liquid foundation thus far hope it works well with the cream to powder</li>
            <li> , yes there is still obviously some production naturally</li>
            <li> Also there&#x27;s barely any product in the container.  </li>
            <li> But with elf I barely do touch ups</li>
            <li> I will pirchase this product from Amazon in the near future.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel soft will defiantly be buying in the future.</li>
            <li> I will stick with my bare minerals primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have purchased several ELF products direct from their website.</li>
            <li> I have only used it a couple of time so far</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last all day but for the price, it makes my skin look and feel absolutely soft.</li>
            <li> At the same time, the texture of it is SOOO soft and silky.</li>
            <li> When I ran out I tried Bare Minerals primer for oil control.  </li>
            <li> and i use to use the bare minerals primer and then a powder afterwards so that my makeup would hold all day</li>
            <li> However, it was quite apparent some of the primer leaked out during transport.  </li>
            <li> it simply feels wow on skin.</li>
            <li> It compares favorably to bare minerals primer which I swear by.</li>
            <li> My 17 yr old daughter actually got me started with this.</li>
            <li> I have only used the product once so far.</li>
            <li> Make my face feels so soft and definitely gives my Makeup  a radiant look.</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy again if the pump issue was fixed.</li>
            <li> and I can barely feel it going on my face.</li>
            <li> After a week or two of no makeup, I&#x27;m finally back to normal and will go back to Hourglass.</li>
            <li> It just kind of sits on your skin and leaves it not oily, but weird, unnatural feeling</li>
            <li> I love putting on make-up, Im not great at it</li>
            <li> Like many others, mine arrived broken as well.</li>
            <li> so I ended up having to screw off the top and try to fish some out with the end of a thin makeup brush.</li>
            <li> It seemed to be broken when I opened up the top.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a whole lot of money out of the pocket, and it&#x27;s worth a shot before you commit to buying something much more expensive.</li>
            <li> The only down side is that it doesn&#x27;t come with much, but, you don&#x27;t need a whole lot to cover the entire face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> But I think it is finally starting to calm down today after putting ACV on my face.</li>
            <li> I want my money back or a new one that actually work, and I just dont know how to proceed</li>
            <li> I unscrewed the top and the primer is in this teeny tiny little tube!!!</li>
            <li> I have used the higher end products before as well and they also cause slight breakouts for me, so</li>
            <li> It is small and runs out quickly</li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes such a major difference!  </li>
            <li> , they always have multiple deals going on that can usually either score you free shipping or a % off your total price!</li>
            <li> and I had heard other reviews saying that you don&#x27;t get as much product as the bottle makes it seem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I would say this would last me at least a good 6 months if not more.</li>
            <li> I would not buy this product again because I was expecting more of a dramatic result/</li>
            <li> I have combination, acne prone skin and am currently using topical clindamycin (from my dermatologist) to keep my skin clear.  </li>
            <li> Suddenly it is not the same product as when you buy it directly from e.l.f.  </li>
            <li> I have normal skin, not terribly sensitive, occasional breakouts, occassional oiliness.</li>
            <li> It does not dry oily though.</li>
            <li> or else it forces your pores and little hairs on your face right out into the open) after I moisturize</li>
            <li> Also, right after you wash and moisturize your face (and wait about 5 minutes for the moisturizer to absorb into your skin) you are suppose to just apply a little pump to the back of your hand.</li>
            <li> I take care of my skin which is very sensitive and dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering why no other similar product comes close to it&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> I did not use primers before, so when I first applied this one, I became a little bit scared.</li>
            <li> I did notice my skin peeled a little bit a couple of days after I used it the first time.  </li>
            <li> It took a little getting used to because it was the first primer I&#x27;d ever used.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold very much and was missing the inside piece to the pump....</li>
            <li> I have been using a powder base for the last few weeks or so due to the humidity, feels great and stays on using the primer :)</li>
            <li> Thanks to the Drugstore Princess on Tumbler for recommending as well as several other dupe sites.</li>
            <li> Surely not as long as the primer you purchased at MAC for 3x the price.</li>
            <li> I actually use Bare Minerals Powder/Foundation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting more into makeup these days, trying out what used to seem like unnecessary extra steps in my daily makeup regime.</li>
            <li> I like to have two full sets of my must-have makeup products--one set of more expensive items (usually NARS, Chanel, Benefit, Smashbox) and one set of items that I can buy at the drug store.</li>
            <li> The only down side is that the pump did break on me after several uses, but mine was part of the first batch that ELF put on the market and they have improved the pump since (according to their website).</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re so inclined, once the pump stops working you can usually get a little more out of the bottle if you take off the lid.</li>
            <li> hope they make other colours to adjust to tones although elf has a palette of the 4 main tone adjusting concealers.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other (more expensive) primers, and they felt much heavier.</li>
            <li> importantly, this primer can stay long time, at least from 8am to 5pm.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how this product worked wonders for my dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> You DO want to let this dry completely before applying anything else, otherwise you could end up with smears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use moisturizer (LUSH - celestial) and let that dry, then apply this.</li>
            <li> I used to buy primer that cost  4 times as much for  half the size here.  </li>
            <li> tries to mislead people by making the bottle bigger when inside there is a smaller tube about half full of primer.</li>
            <li> it spreads very well its very silky and it does make the makeup last a very long time, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I only wear a loose mineral powder foundation to work, and it would normally wear off by 10 am, but now it lasts all day with just 1.5 pumps total for my entire face.</li>
            <li> I really liked the product but was disappointed in the small amount; the large container was very misleading!</li>
            <li> It only lasted about 5 days snd that is not long at all.  </li>
            <li> I tried other primers and my foundation looked normal again...</li>
            <li> I received it quickly but when I went to pump some out hardly anything came out so the only way I can use it is by digging my pinky finger in the bottle and only way it works</li>
            <li> This can definitely go as a dupe for multiple other high cost primers.</li>
            <li> It seems to make my foundation last a bit longer than without but not long enough that I fell obligated to use it every day.  </li>
            <li> A little bit really goes a loooong way with this primer.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is that i have to use a little more than i feel i should in order to cover my entire face</li>
            <li> Feels soft and equal to any other more expensive primers</li>
            <li> A little smaller than i expected but very reasonable for the price.</li>
            <li> Studio high definition powder translucent, my skin is not an oily mess by midday.</li>
            <li> Tried other face primers before all the expensive brands but this one is truly amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a subtle thing, but it makes fine lines less apparent too.</li>
            <li> and I have started to notice a few (small) fine lines..</li>
            <li> /&gt;There isn&#x27;t a lot of product in the bottle, but a little drop goes a long way on the whole face and neck</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I recommend buying it directly from ELF&#x27;s website because they often have promos for their studio line.</li>
            <li> Extremely lightweight and soft...</li>
            <li> I have found it to be just as effective as the expensive brands!</li>
            <li> , I applied it several times with different methods -- with and without moisturizer, immediately after applying moisturizer, waiting several minutes for moisturizer to dry and THEN applying it, and I tried it with two different foundations (Loreal TruMatch and Covergirl) -</li>
            <li> but I mean you get what you pay for right?</li>
            <li> My friend suggested a primer but the ones I tried were to heavy and irated me due to my sensitive skin, I wanted to start buying high end ones but the price turned me off</li>
            <li> The only negative I have for it is that it&#x27;s pretty oily.</li>
            <li> I used this primer evening, and I was so tired to clean my face , so I slept</li>
            <li> I have an active job and noticed that by early afternoon, my mineral make-up was waning.  </li>
            <li> Elf is a brand that allways bring quality in the product, you can trust with a close eyes buying elf products, they always has long lasting and a big quality in compare to the prince.</li>
            <li> Actually, although, no make up last for that long..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought expensive primers and this is just as good, if not better.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers commented that there is little product in the bottle, which is true, but as for the quality, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Its hard to tell how much is inside, and it takes up a little to much room in my make up bag.</li>
            <li> I did notice that i had a new pimple on my cheeck a few hours later</li>
            <li> it seems to do the same job for far less  </li>
            <li> I was hoping for a less expensive alternative to the other good brands.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure it does that much for me.</li>
            <li> After I received this one,  I see the quantity is small, that I don’t like much.</li>
            <li> Not sure it&#x27;s really doing anything when I put it on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much they were using, I was using about 1½ pumps per use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and I use it every day, so I ran out fast (about 2-3 weeks).</li>
            <li> I guess the whole point of the primer is to even out any dings and dents on the skin though I am not sure if its meant for bumps or for people with pimples/acne.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> and I can imagine that it wouldn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in how long my makeup has been lasting.</li>
            <li> it smooths the texture of your skin so you have a flat surface to apply your makeup if you have any imperfections or indentions in skin</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t last as long, I recommend using a setting spray if you plan on using this all day.</li>
            <li> it was not soft enough.</li>
            <li> a teensy bit goes such a long way.  </li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> and it last for a long time.</li>
            <li> Tiny dot goes a long way, and it didn&#x27;t make me break out at all.</li>
            <li> so the bottle doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> My makeup last as long as it always do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cool looking bottle, but mine had the tube inside broken</li>
            <li> : not a very large amt in this big bottle but will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> So what exactly does this mean?</li>
            <li> have used other elf products - love and use their mascaras daily, but this is a fail.  </li>
            <li> I gave it a few days, but each day it left my face a greasy mess and certainly didn&#x27;t help my make-up last.</li>
            <li> Very little product, but also lasts a pretty long time (over 3 months) because a single drop goes a long way.</li>
            <li> There is actually far less in the bottle than seems to be pictured.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s cheap, but I waste at least 1/4 of the jar every time.  </li>
            <li> My only suggestion is to let it set or dry before applying make-up.  </li>
            <li> guess my only complaint is that i didn&#x27;t really notice the oz listed on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i.e. blue veins or red spots not really</li>
            <li> little goes a long way (so you have to be careful with how much you put on)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With just one single pump I can cover my entire face.</li>
            <li> and, my makeup barely lasts till midday in extreme heat.</li>
            <li> The first few pumps from the bottle were just like the product when purchased directly from e.l.f. , which is thick and makes your face feel silky and helps your make-up glide on.  </li>
            <li> but it may be due to factors other than the new primer....</li>
            <li> a sheer loose</li>
            <li> Smooth, hypo-allergenic (even for SUPER sensitive skin) and works as a base for makeup!</li>
            <li> I typically stay away from Elf products particularly because i feel like they are noticably sub-par and that they do not perform well or hold up as well as other brands.</li>
            <li> primer works just as well as other more expensive products I have used from Sephora and others.</li>
            <li> /&gt;My only other \\&quot;issue\\&quot; would be the price, I found this at target for only $3 vs. almost $9 on amazon!</li>
            <li> so i was a little put off when i saw that it was like a clear gel, i thought &amp;#34;okay</li>
            <li> no more high prices primers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell if it gets all of the product out, but it&#x27;s really convenient for every day use.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because it was so cheap compared to every thing else out there.  </li>
            <li> The consistence is so strange</li>
            <li> The second time I went to use it, it was empty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for as long as I can remember, but it has a hefty price tag of $40</li>
            <li> Gets Cakey/flaky if rubbed in too long.</li>
            <li> I use another product where I have my larger pores (nose and partial cheek area), and this one everywhere else</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying different products out of curiously.</li>
            <li> I have literally spent 100&#x27;s of dollars trying various products.....</li>
            <li> still comes off after long day .</li>
            <li> It actually made my makeup harder to apply and it rubbed off a lot easier afterwards.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER the website also offers other versions of their primers (SPF 20, Mineral, Hydrating, and Poreless) and the Mineral comes in other colors - Clear, Tone-Correcting Green, Brightening Lavender, and Radiant Glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my makeup stay long as the smashbox primer does</li>
            <li> It keeps the minimal foundation I use on my nose and chin looking smoother, and lasting longer.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money for the quantity received.</li>
            <li> Living overseas I have to wait so long to get packages</li>
            <li> the actually container that holds the primer is not much.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time on the skin.</li>
            <li> Creates a good base for foundation.</li>
            <li> I have found this product to be equal to or surpassed the others in performance and you can certainly not beat the price.</li>
            <li> , I look natural, no fine lines and my makeup stays on all day.</li>
            <li> I had previously used a much more expensive brand of face primer.</li>
            <li> it does the same thing and same coverage for less money</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ultimately, it doesn&#x27;t last as long or work as well as other primers.</li>
            <li> You can go spend $50+ on high end primers, or buy this that will work the same (if not better) and save yourself $45 dollars to spend on other products!</li>
            <li> is other areas such as around my mouth or chin).  </li>
            <li> I am not a big fan of makeup, but recently due to break outs</li>
            <li> Now if only it would keep my lipstick on as well, and I would never buy any other primers!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same as all the other stuff out there.  </li>
            <li> Bought a second and as other reviews, it came without the inside pump straw.</li>
            <li> totally messed up, won&#x27;t buy this or any other elf products again.</li>
            <li> It left her face extremely greasy and caused her to break out.</li>
            <li> goes a LONG way!</li>
            <li> One other point the bottle was short on product!!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has an off smell, I was maybe about to apply it to my entire face 3 4 times before it was empty!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first for the low price low quality assumption</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how it compares to other primers as I&#x27;ve really only tried this one.</li>
            <li> I did not even know primers for things other than walls, especially not faces, existed.</li>
            <li> my bottle was like half full, that sucks.......... wont buy again!</li>
            <li> I have combo skin (oily in the T zone &amp; somewhat dry</li>
            <li> that area looks dry &amp; flaky.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin dry</li>
            <li> , that also tends to dry out in the winter.</li>
            <li> It was not a matte nor completely dry finish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late-50&#x27;s, and I was hoping this would be a product that would prevent my foundation from highlighting my dry spots and lines.</li>
            <li> , it did not irate my dry skin, and because of it my skin is looking a lot healthier</li>
            <li> For those with dry skin like me</li>
            <li> I apply the primer, dry my hair, then apply the foundation.</li>
            <li> I let it dry for a minute then apply everything else.</li>
            <li> I moisturized and let that dry, then used this product before my foundation.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin so this worked for me.</li>
            <li> This made my face so dry</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work well with some foundations makes your skin look dry and flake.</li>
            <li> I tend to have dry skin</li>
            <li> It was dry when I opened the bottle</li>
            <li> This will only last you a few applications.</li>
            <li> I have only used eyeshadow primer but only a few times.</li>
            <li> First if you compare the price per ounce, Lancome La Base is less expensive and far superior.  </li>
            <li> I apply very little, let it dry completely, and it will lasts until I wash everything off before bed.</li>
            <li> I still like this primer, but literally EVERY SINGLE TIME</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that even though a little does go a long way, there isn&#x27;t as much in the bottle as expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clear gel form and not entirely sure if I would purchase again</li>
            <li> and I am actually seeing my hyper pigmentation fade slightly due to the make up no longer slipping into my pores.</li>
            <li> At first thought the pump was broken</li>
            <li> This one feels too loose and doesn&#x27;t seem to even my pores out.  </li>
            <li> I have used it before applying liquid foundation and also when I just want to wear a loose mineral makeup and it works well.  </li>
            <li> When I forget to put it on, the make up looks less natural and glows less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black woman with an oily T-zone, but dry skin, overall.</li>
            <li> This is fine for smoothing out small wrinkles but just not great.  </li>
            <li> So once you&#x27;ve used it enough for it to go down about 1/2 of an inch, the rest won&#x27;t come out anymore.</li>
            <li> I took the pump off only to discover that the size of the container is extremely deceiving - the white cylinder that you see is an empty outer shell, containing a very small second container of actual product, about a TENTH of the size of what I thought I was getting.  </li>
            <li> But I advise that a little goes a long way especially for my ladies who have oiler skin.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely something you don&#x27;t need to apply generously because it spreads itself out (A little goes a long way).</li>
            <li> am also new to the use of primers so not really able to compare to other brands&#x27; primers</li>
            <li> My face tends to oil up really easily so this primer really helped me out on my bad days!</li>
            <li> there is very very little for such a big bottle..</li>
            <li> You Shine Primer, 1 Ounce]] and a few other more expensive primers</li>
            <li> The inner housing thing is like only 1/4 as small as all of the area inside of it, and for some reason the one that came to me had no straw or anything to pump the product out.  </li>
            <li> I only need half a pump of the product for my face</li>
            <li> I was half way expecting this to make my face either oily or give it extra lines and it did neither of those things.  </li>
            <li> I can feel a slight different when I put this stuff in</li>
            <li> but now I&#x27;m using a pump and a half to get the same amount of product.</li>
            <li> , my pores look smaller, the wrinkles under my eyes are less visible</li>
            <li> i didnt want to splurge on expensive ones without first knowing how different it would make my makeup look..</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I ran out really quickly</li>
            <li> I took it apart and noticed that on the pump, there&#x27;s no tube going down the center of the bottle to actually GET the product up and out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Price is decently affordable, at least compared to all other brands&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (my skin is very dry but acne prone)</li>
            <li> I only used it four times, in small amount, and it was empty the next time I planned to use it.</li>
            <li> My bottle came all dry and broken very upset</li>
            <li> if you have some very hard to cover blemishes that you want to cover this is really does the trick</li>
            <li> I also tend to have very dry skin, and this (unlike some other primers I have used) doesn&#x27;t cling to my dry spots, and make my makeup look cakey.</li>
            <li> You only need to use a little bit.</li>
            <li> I give it only 3 stars because there is so little product in this container that it should be sold as a sample.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a miracle product, I only noticed a little difference after I applied my MAC foundation.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mixing it with tiny little with my sunblock.</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit.</li>
            <li> The delivery was a little slower than i was hoping for, it was 3 days later than i was told it would be here.</li>
            <li> it begins to get &amp;#34;goopy&amp;#34; and does not distribute evenly over your face and leaves little gross balls on your face</li>
            <li> I will moisterize my face after getting out of the shower and use only a little bit of primer and cover up</li>
            <li> why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is that there is so little -actual- product in this pump.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any difference and the smell is a little different.</li>
            <li> My make up did seem to last longer even getting a little sweaty in the sun.</li>
            <li> You only need a little to cover the face, and it can be used for the lids of eyes if you don&#x27;t have an eyeshadow primer.  </li>
            <li> I have combination dry oily skin with my T-zone being extremely oily  </li>
            <li> I am your typical twenty something female who has tried endless amounts of beauty/makeup products.</li>
            <li> Due to all of these factors that impact the longevity of makeup wear, it has become increasingly difficult to find a primer that is worthy.</li>
            <li> After a nine hour workday with no touch-ups, I looked in the mirror and, although it wasn&#x27;t as bad as I was expecting, my face did look more oily and the foundation seemed to have worn off.  </li>
            <li> That was the cherry on top of a bad primer sundae.</li>
            <li> Its crazy smooth.</li>
            <li> i am shocked with the tippy top quality of this primer.  </li>
            <li> so it literally takes up so much space which ends up leaving you small amounts of the product :/</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small amount that you get, so if you use it every day it won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the bottle seems so much bigger than it needs to be for the amount of makeup you get.</li>
            <li> Feels like it never really dries on your face.</li>
            <li> and it seems empty</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s partially empty and looks like it has been used.</li>
            <li> The bottle was EMPTY  when I received it. ....</li>
            <li> when I noticed the bottle was empty after I took it out of the package it came in</li>
            <li> I just wish they would include some way to indicate when the bottle is almost empty.</li>
            <li> I have never really been into primers.</li>
            <li> Empty bottle almost when received</li>
            <li> I usually use bare minerals face primer but bought this as an add on item on a whim.</li>
            <li> A few hours later we both noticed that the cheek with the e.l.f.</li>
            <li> but it always dried and beaded up, especially in the folds around my nose and on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I may come back to it though after trying a few others because i do like the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> There are a few different Elf mineral infused primers on here.</li>
            <li> I used it everyday, reapplied several times throughout the day, and it worked.</li>
            <li> I have spent tones of money of products and this will be my go to.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s empty.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Just be careful to let it soak in before putting on powder make up.</li>
            <li> Empty bottle.</li>
            <li> this was one of e.l.f.&#x27;s $1 - $3 products, I&#x27;d have absolutely no problem with that.</li>
            <li> After a few hours my face felt sticky and like it was starting to get oily.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s really not oily though</li>
            <li> Around 3/4 of the bottle is empty space.</li>
            <li> I never really noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> I had no idea how much face primer could change my makeup game.</li>
            <li> You really only need one, maybe two, pumps and you will have plenty to cover your face without saturating it or missing spots.</li>
            <li> so I used it again the next day and by that evening, my cheeks had broken out despite the fact that I took my makeup off the night before completely.</li>
            <li> It keeps the makeup on your face well by providing a nice base.</li>
            <li> This provided a nice base before applying bronzer or makeup.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the other reviews, I was prepared for how small the package was, less than half an ounce.</li>
            <li> However, the price is right and this stuff works just as well as the expensive stuff.</li>
            <li> It goes from a gel to a weird stiffer gel and will come right off your face.</li>
            <li> I have used quite a few other facial primers and I have to say this is one of my favorites.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, works as expected.</li>
            <li> It creates a really smooth base for my foundation, and makes it last a long time.</li>
            <li> I like it due to the fact, that this makes you feel like youre not really wearing anything..</li>
            <li> Be prepared to flip it upside down (with the lid on) and smack the *&amp;^% out of it against your palm before every single pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was a little surprised at how small it is but other than that</li>
            <li> I use my fingers to apply it to my face, starting from the center of my face (my nose) and working out to even the edges and neck, moving in small circular motions.</li>
            <li> I would definitely buy it again but not worth paying the amount for a few uses.</li>
            <li> I would especially recommend this to anyone who suffers from oily skin, it kept me shine-free the whole day!</li>
            <li> I would buy again, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> : a little goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> Foundation applies smoothy over the primer and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little will take you a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way anyways.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this primer</li>
            <li> This is now a must have in my makeup bag, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> It takes so very little product to cover the entire face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- very little of the actual product.</li>
            <li> As terrific as this product is, there is VERY little of it.</li>
            <li> So I would get it, unless you are looking for something to make a more dramatic change, because this is very, very, very, subtle.</li>
            <li> Also, the areas of my skin that are really dry (around my mouth, eyes and cheeks) don&#x27;t feel tight or itchy like some primers cause.</li>
            <li> I am EXTREMELY dissatisfied with the e.l.f.</li>
            <li> And I will never order make-up - let alone any other product - from Amazon again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for endless months now</li>
            <li> I have a lot of imperfections due to aging and sun exposure.</li>
            <li> Well.. I&#x27;m disappointed that I can&#x27;t say I love this.</li>
            <li> My wife ordered this item with other  make up articles, hoping that this way nothing would get lost</li>
            <li> This is due to the fact that I can&#x27;t use the pump and have to fight just to get the product out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> on the other</li>
            <li> The ONLY small thing that made it a 4 star is it flaked at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> My make up lasted for the entire day when it usually fades and sweats off.  </li>
            <li> It also helps out to bring out the colors of other beauty products you use simultaneously (eye shadows, eyebrow products, lipstick etc).</li>
            <li> The price on Amazon is comparable to other retail stores.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend, but it may just be my skin type and the other products I use, so...</li>
            <li> Theres a small thing in the bottle where you actual product is.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive compared to other products out there.  </li>
            <li> It does not leave my skin feeling oily afterward however, for me, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> and I had no idea when I was going to be out of it due to the way its packaged (hence the 4 stars).</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> I like the way it feels on my face and doesn&#x27;t feel as \\&quot;filmmy\\&quot; as other primers.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot compared to other &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; texture primers.</li>
            <li> So where is the other 4/5ths that I paid for?</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I have to update my review and give this product 4 stars due to the amount of product in the bottle.</li>
            <li> Although I haven&#x27;t tried any other primers.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so be careful!</li>
            <li> I know this sounds crazy, but it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> Go ahead and buy the expensive primers if you want to, but you&#x27;ll find that this one stacks up pretty well against them for 1/4 the price.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give my face that photoshopped look that I get with other primers.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Received faster than expected and packaging was just as if I purchased it in a store!</li>
            <li> I do agree with the other reviews in that</li>
            <li> It last a while also it&#x27;s in a small container</li>
            <li> other reviews gave it a try.  </li>
            <li> I used it maybe every other day for about a month.</li>
            <li> (a little does go a long way though!)</li>
            <li> However a little bit goes a very long way  </li>
            <li> However because of this flaw I feel like much of the product will be wasted seeing as it will be very hard to get out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I put it on, let it dry a little bit then</li>
            <li> In fairness I&#x27;ve only been using this product for two days, but as someone who suffers from very oily skin</li>
            <li> The diameter is less than 2 cm wide</li>
            <li> why not, right?</li>
            <li> Helps fills in pore a little, not much.</li>
            <li> It is hard to go back to just applying makeup without a primer once you start using one.  </li>
            <li> I have a habit of resting my hands on my face and scratching my nose all the time and wiping sweat from my forehead and upper lip, so it&#x27;s hard for my makeup to stay ON MY FACE and not on my sleeve or on a Kleenex.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s hard to do considering I use Differin daily.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this product, and I&#x27;ve found that a bottle lasts me a few months.</li>
            <li> i couldn&#x27;t even use it, it came open with hardly anything in it.</li>
            <li> Very little quantity is needed, and it stays for long.</li>
            <li> My only issue was the pump part stopped working, I&#x27;m not sure if there was a little hose that reached down in the bottom or</li>
            <li> However it also creates a barrier that traps all the dirt and oil underneath it.&lt;br /&gt;Simply scrubbing your skin and using a light moisturizer prevent anything bad I&#x27;ve found to happen when using this product.</li>
            <li> so my skin is prone to dark marks but</li>
            <li> and it is not worth it.</li>
            <li> It was not worth the price.</li>
            <li> This helps to make a small amount of foundation to go a long way.  </li>
            <li> It does not hide any wrinkles or cover blemishes or dark spots.  </li>
            <li> But the fact that it doesn&#x27;t work 80% of the time makes it not worth it.</li>
            <li> I see no laugh lines</li>
            <li> I expected something heavy and for my skin to start itching but</li>
            <li> half an ounce - Hard Candy Sheer Envy</li>
            <li> It also tones down the shine on your face.</li>
            <li> After that, just take the primer and press the knob down once.</li>
            <li> definitley hasnt let me down.</li>
            <li> make up lasts and doesn&#x27;t run down your face or anything.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It means some of the other reviewers were correct: used or tampered bottles are sometimes being sent to buyers!</li>
            <li> I might try the other versions of this just to review them, but not until my skin heals!</li>
            <li> Other reviews had mentioned how little was in the container.</li>
            <li> I mean very tiny.</li>
            <li> The next day I used it I went along my business as usual, but rubbed my face against my arm at some point because I noticed I had makeup on my sleeve!</li>
            <li> would recommend it to 20-somethings with oily skin, however I am not sure if this product would suit someone over 30 or with dry skin.</li>
            <li> At the time I ordered it, I took it off the e.l.f. website because it was cheaper there as well as a few other products</li>
            <li> A little goes a LONG way, so though this is a small bottle it lasts.</li>
            <li> I have really bad combination skin and with this product my whole face felt the same and foundation application has never been easier.</li>
            <li> and it requires less make-up to cover.</li>
            <li> I finished it in less than a month</li>
            <li> It also makes my skin appear less oily too.</li>
            <li> Maybe even less.  </li>
            <li> but this went away when she started using less when she applied it.</li>
            <li> But I find that I do shine a lot less</li>
            <li> I have been using this primer for a year after more expensive brands failed me.  </li>
            <li> The redness around my nose stays hidden until after work, sometimes beyond.</li>
            <li> I typically would use Avon Magix</li>
            <li> I have some slight scarring on my face and when I use this product with and then my mineral powder, you can&#x27;t see any of the scarring.</li>
            <li> so your foundation goes on easier and you use less.  </li>
            <li> I Have Read Previous Reviews</li>
            <li> Its like half the container.</li>
            <li> It took like a month and a half to arrive, but it wasn&#x27;t the seller&#x27;s fault.</li>
            <li> The tiny amount of product you get is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I have way less acne</li>
            <li> and i use about half the amount of foundation.</li>
            <li> face primer and cost alot less.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a lot less in there than appears.</li>
            <li> The areas of the skin that were even slightly inflamed or pimples that were popped</li>
            <li> (probably has alot to do with the fact that it&#x27;s silicone based), however, I suffer from slightly enlarged pores on my cheeks and nose</li>
            <li> goes on Clear, and dosent have that weird smell that other primers have.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product at a crazy value - I will be using/buying this for a loooong time!</li>
            <li> wow, wish I had purchased this before buying other expensive products.</li>
            <li> which is a little less than 3/4 of an inch.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s dull and dry.</li>
            <li> The reason I do like it is mainly because I have issues with other primers making my face break-out very badly (and I&#x27;m not prone to break-outs normally).  </li>
            <li> Less creases, less smudges, less mess!</li>
            <li> I have used some higher end products that also failed in this department as well though, so I can&#x27;t bash on e.l.f. too hard.</li>
            <li> It made the texture weird and the foundation didn&#x27;t last long at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> only bad thing about it is how little product comes in the bottle, less than half ounce (0.49 ounce) doesn’t last very long.</li>
            <li> but all you need is a little bit.</li>
            <li> I have to put a little bit of moisturizer around my mouth &amp; chin before I apply the primer or else</li>
            <li> Would give it 5 stars, but it&#x27;s a little deceptive</li>
            <li> I helped my foundation not fall into those little wrinkles on my face.</li>
            <li> This product does the job but is a little thicker than I prefer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too &amp;#34;liquidy&amp;#34; for me.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s just a little too &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; for my liking.  </li>
            <li> I was a little bummed when I noticed that is was running out</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little greasy on my fingers while putting it on</li>
            <li> I also experience less shine and - in the end - less breakouts believe it or not!</li>
            <li> little product needed to get the job done</li>
            <li> it does the trick, keeps makeup on a little longer</li>
            <li> I just wished it lasted a little longer.</li>
            <li> I was a little unsure when I bought this</li>
            <li> my make-up seems to stay on a little longer than without it.  </li>
            <li> I was using the smashbox one that was 4 times the price of this little keeper.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a little stub.</li>
            <li> So I conducted a little experiment.</li>
            <li> Another plus, a little bit goes along way.  </li>
            <li> Do not purchase here, it is far less expensive elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Around 2 pm and after scorching heat, I was shocked to hear my companions say how fresh and finished my face had looked, despite me sweating profusely and having done no touch-ups since 9 am.</li>
            <li> The primer has tiny sparkles, which I did not like at all, and I noticed that every time I used it, my foundation did not go on smoothly, would look streaky and looked awful.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m truly amazed at how it literally primes your face into a smooth velvety base.  </li>
            <li> It has a really weird feel when you&#x27;re applying it, but afterwards your face is soo soft...</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t wear make-up everyday.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> My face is not used to having a lot of makeup on everyday.</li>
            <li> My skin is oily and my makeup tends to fade after a few hours.  </li>
            <li> I strongly disliked this product.</li>
            <li> It evened out my skin tone and it also helped cover a few blemishes.</li>
            <li> I tried fishing it out with some tweezers but couldn&#x27;t get it and wasted some of the product.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of trouble finding it in stores.  </li>
            <li> I read a few review that recommended time for the primer to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; and this seems to work for me.</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday, and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it, I have used it for a few months.</li>
            <li> My makeup definately lasts longer with this product, also tried the green elf mineral primer for redness, it diminished my redness but not fully.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, this primer gives me such confidence that it is not uncommon for me to do so anymore.</li>
            <li> Have used this product a few times.  </li>
            <li> Btw this is at target for $3 don&#x27;t waste your money online.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am no longer shiny a few hours into my day.</li>
            <li> EVERYDAY...</li>
            <li> It reminds me of dried up fat but, slapped onto my face.</li>
            <li> This primer seemed heavy to me.  </li>
            <li> but if you get it green</li>
            <li> Not cheaply made but</li>
            <li> I have used it everyday since ive got it</li>
            <li> I havent tried it with my heavy duty foundation yet</li>
            <li> I could not believe it was already out within a few weeks of using it.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly, no irritation.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I have uneven, acne-prone skin</li>
            <li> I used it a few times just didn&#x27;t go well on my skin</li>
            <li> this hold my makeup in place all day and creates a smooth and silky base before i put my foundation on.</li>
            <li> I like how it keeps makeup in tact, but I started to get holes and acne on my face after wearing this a few days in a row (and yes I do wash my makeup off at night).</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t buy again or recommend, waste of six dollars.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t give me the smooth base or staying power</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
            <li> Also my pachage arrived with the box all broken open and damaged.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday under my make up.  </li>
            <li> It does what it say&#x27;s it will do, does not feel heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li> My blush stayed where I put it and my trouble spots remained out of sight and out of mind.</li>
            <li> a few hours after I put it on it was like my makeup had already worn off.</li>
            <li> the base for make up is used for better appearenca of your skeen even without any pouder after , but you should use it in complex with foundation</li>
            <li> The tube has a false bottom to make it look larger.</li>
            <li> I have compared this to at least five other products including one for over thirty dollars and with the cheapest being twelve dollars.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 30&#x27;s and needed a primer due to skin changes.</li>
            <li> but I used it pretty much everyday and ended up sharing it with my sister and it lasted about a 1 1/2 -2 months which I don&#x27;t consider that bad.  </li>
            <li> but I still recommend a little per application because of the small bottle.</li>
            <li> I also used it under my eyes and it settled into my lines pretty badly there.</li>
            <li> no matter mineral or not) make my skin break out, and my oily skin and large pores makes it impossible to &amp;</li>
            <li> It only works half the time and is very irritating.</li>
            <li> also, after only a few uses i am unable to pump the product out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I use under my foundation, and also a little just before applying eyeshadows: a two for one!</li>
            <li> its probably like a little passed the silver part!</li>
            <li> a little blush and maybe a bronzer and go!</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that a little (one pump!)</li>
            <li> just a little slow.</li>
            <li> but it is very little product inside</li>
            <li> Very little product needed for application.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use that much, but I was shocked to see how little product was in the package!</li>
            <li> What a waste of material for hardly any product.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does contain a small oz</li>
            <li> (all few hundred of them!)</li>
            <li> I used a small amount and made me break out</li>
            <li> I applied it before foundation application used a small amount, felt silky on my skin, than I applied the e.l.f.</li>
            <li> small amount)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is oily, but it leaves this gross oily feeling on your face before you apply your product and it is just uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> usually about 2-3 hours after I put make up on</li>
            <li> After I bought this I read some negative reviews and thought I might have wasted my money.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll have an oil slick on your hands.  </li>
            <li> With the L&#x27;Oreal product, it&#x27;s a small  &amp;#34;pot&amp;#34; container</li>
            <li> but the bottle is alittle small</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> and this is a miracle in a bottle small bottle</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll be buying this stuff again.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a small bottle, but I used 5 days a week for 2 months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small bottle</li>
            <li> Dried out my skin and was overly greasy!</li>
            <li> I usually use creamy primers.  </li>
            <li> As others have said, it&#x27;s a small amount in misleading packaging.</li>
            <li> The only issue is that it feels weird, almost greasy.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, for this reason, I&#x27;ve chosen a low rating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m going to buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable price.  </li>
            <li> I should,but i usually forget and realise if after i apply foundation.</li>
            <li> No more skimping on this one.</li>
            <li> I have used Sephora and Tart primer in the past.</li>
            <li> Just what she asked for and amazon, as usual, a breeze to order from.</li>
            <li> Not sure what it was suppose too look like when i wear it under foundation.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve found that this works just as well, if not better.</li>
            <li> (though I&#x27;m not sure if it would work well under powder foundation).</li>
            <li> However, the small amount of product you get might not be work the $6 price tag depending on how you use it and what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> (though I&#x27;m not sure if it would work well under powder foundation).</li>
            <li> However, the small amount of product you get might not be work the $6 price tag depending on how you use it and what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> Even the you will only see a faint trace.</li>
            <li> It looks like a gel once you pump a small amount out onto your hand</li>
            <li> what, so I usually have to scrap it out.</li>
            <li> and I do see a difference in the oil on my face when wearing this product but the amount you get is SO small.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it at all :/</li>
            <li> Not sure if its my combo skin</li>
            <li> So slick and silky on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too oily and its difficult to get solid pumps out of the container.</li>
            <li> So many products like this are outrageously priced.</li>
            <li> No more drugstore products for me....</li>
            <li> You will be disappointed if you take the pump out of the bottle and really see how very little product there is.</li>
            <li> It gives my face a good base to apply makeup without makeup going in every pore and looking bad.</li>
            <li> Putting it in this larger container, making it a struggle to get the last 50% of it is just annoying.</li>
            <li> Not very good for all day, though.</li>
            <li> Some have complained about it being a small quantity</li>
            <li> It IS in a small bottle but very little is needed per application!</li>
            <li> Only con is there is not much in it :(</li>
            <li> I ran out in about three weeks and after about two weeks the primer started getting gooey and was hard to apply.</li>
            <li> But it is so hard to remove, it takes 4 wash&#x27;s on my hands to fully remove it.</li>
            <li> I like it but is hard to pump it out it</li>
            <li> I took the bottle apart so that I could get an -approximate- measurement for the inside of that little well.</li>
            <li> Highly upset with this purchase :(</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t hydrate my skin the least bit.</li>
            <li> I never liked primer before this: it made my skin feel cakey</li>
            <li> My skin has not reacted negatively to it&lt;</li>
            <li> Nope, the pump absolutely sucks.</li>
            <li> I should have made a complaint at the time of purchase</li>
            <li> I recommend it for everyone to at least try.</li>
            <li> ( I&#x27;ve been having a problem with that lately).</li>
            <li> I would at least try it out if I were you.</li>
            <li> At least that&#x27;s MY opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like they should have at least put it in a tub</li>
            <li> The bottle looks like it must hold at LEAST 2.5.</li>
            <li> All it does for me is cause my pressed powder foundation to clump up and get all icky.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel thick or clogging the pores, lets the face breathe.</li>
            <li> This product does provide a good base towards the start of your makeup base.</li>
            <li> The pump is broken and I cannot use it, I have to use a qtip to get the product out which also wastes a ton.  </li>
            <li> Very little warning that you&#x27;re about to run out!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had hardly any serious outbreaks lately and for that I&#x27;m beyond thankful.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The other reviews were correct when they say something is wrong with that pump.</li>
            <li> I really mean it.</li>
            <li> What you have is very very small in quantity.</li>
            <li> If you remove the lid the chamber is very small</li>
            <li> You need a very small amount of this product to do</li>
            <li> Feels and looks just like smash box but for WAY WAY LESS!!!</li>
            <li> Did I seriously wear make up with out primer?</li>
            <li> Product works well enough but the bottle makes it impossible to use all the primer in the bottle.</li>
            <li> and when it finally did, it spurted out very little at a time (which was annoying).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a good product.</li>
            <li> This is NOT a good deal for $6.</li>
            <li> But, I noticed over a few weeks its texture gets weird.</li>
            <li> This product was no good at all, I used it to prevent my face from getting greasy from my cover up and at the end of the day</li>
            <li> i would have completely wasted my money had i bought the expensive one.</li>
            <li> I like this primer a lot; and for the price, it&#x27;s hard to beat!</li>
            <li> I hate to give such a negative review, but I just don&#x27;t get this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am literally only disappointed that I did not find this sooner.</li>
            <li> Washing my face after scrubbing with a chemical remover is still difficult, since I need to apply acne lotion to the skin this makes it bothersome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in all, if you can get past these flaws, go for it.</li>
            <li> I usually use this primer on my casual days.</li>
            <li> This is very thick primer and</li>
            <li> Not sure if does what it says.!!  </li>
            <li> Some reviewers said they&#x27;re unhappy with how little comes in this bottle, but I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Beware of broken pump.</li>
            <li> Even your game on day face would benefit.</li>
            <li> Not great.</li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s just another layer and another hassle, which I do not want to add to the already tired makeup routine.</li>
            <li> Came broken and with almost nothing inside</li>
            <li> con is the product is a bit to thin for my taste.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gives you a base filling for the open pores and a slippery texture to the skin&#x27;s surface, helping you with a easier makeup application.</li>
            <li> This may just be me, but I had poor experience with this primer.</li>
            <li> The green took the redness out of my skin permanently which is crazy.</li>
            <li> Pump has broken when received.  </li>
            <li> My sister who has oily skin had a worse experience with it.</li>
            <li> But about 3 days into the bottle provided by this seller, something thin and oily starts coming out.  </li>
            <li> Either the pump is broken or I got bamboozled.</li>
            <li> so this makes it even worse.</li>
            <li> would get it again, and if that pump was broken as well then I would not ever get it again.</li>
            <li> The pump is broken.  </li>
            <li> I like this product but need to get one that isn&#x27;t broken.</li>
            <li> I dont like the texture of it too thin and the makeup doesnt stay on all day.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my sister and she was having such a hard time using the pump, the packaging is terrible.</li>
            <li> When I say weird, I definitely mean weird.</li>
            <li> This stuff dried my face out so badly</li>
            <li> (but I don&#x27;t wear makeup everyday so this isn&#x27;t so bad)</li>
            <li> Its all about saving those hard earned bucks!!</li>
            <li> Sadly, it also broke my skin out terribly which surprised me.</li>
            <li> But it crumbles up after I apply foundation and looks disgusting, and I got a bad skin infection on my left cheek after using it a couple of times, so it appeared to have clogged my pores heavily as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Painted ladies, you&#x27;ve been doing it wrong...  </li>
            <li> Was not impressed with product and bottle was broke when it arrived</li>
            <li> It works as well as the expensive ones I have used.</li>
            <li> and I could never figure out what I did wrong.</li>
            <li> I feel like my skin is suffocating when I put this stuff on.</li>
            <li> Really mediocre.  </li>
            <li> needless to say</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used expensive primers and this one seems to work just as well for a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li> Sorry Arden.</li>
            <li> I could be using this for the wrong purpose</li>
            <li> They say you get what you pay for, well that saying was wrong in this case.</li>
            <li> I normaly use my lorac primer but seeing as how that&#x27;s quite expensive</li>
            <li> Just weird.....</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used expensive primer before.</li>
            <li> I dont need to buy expensive makeup or skin care products.</li>
            <li> , I decided to order one from Amazon for my flawed skin.</li>
            <li> Works as well as the expensive brands.</li>
            <li> i was skeptical about this primer &amp;</li>
            <li> At $6 you can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, the price here on Amazon really is unfair.</li>
            <li> Sorry, it went in the trash.</li>
            <li> My face looks horrible and the outbreaks kept coming even on the 3rd day.</li>
            <li> This one, sadly, I did not.&lt;br</li>
            <li> let me try and explain the weird texture of this stuff...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been useing expensive primers for along time like the smash box  and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say that my makeup lasts 10 times longer without this crappy product.</li>
            <li> I hate that the amount of product is so small.</li>
            <li> i have read some reviews that it came broken or the packageing was bad but it was all in one peice....</li>
            <li> Perfecting Base Primer which comes in a very small container (0.5 ounces).</li>
            <li> On the other, its pump is absolutely awful.</li>
            <li> Very, very disappointing -- not to mention appalling -- that products get tampered with and then sold.</li>
            <li> my face face after 1-2 h looks even worse then without this primer...very disappointed</li>
            <li> e.l.f. is affordable but here you have to pay crazy shipping and they overprice the products and e.l.f</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t be afraid to try it just for the price, i&#x27;ve used expensive primers (smashbox, bareminerals) and this works just as well!</li>
            <li> I was very wrong.</li>
            <li> I hate products that smell weird or too purfume-y</li>
            <li> and when i didnt, also its a very weird texture.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER it smells so bad</li>
            <li> It would get so bad that my makeup would literally start melting off within 3 hours.</li>
            <li> and I know it&#x27;s bad</li>
            <li> This stuff isn&#x27;t bad as a primer.</li>
            <li> so I guess it&#x27;s like putting silk on your face, which can&#x27;t really be a bad thing,</li>
            <li> It was that bad.</li>
            <li> So I attribute my foundation looking bad to this primer</li>
            <li> so I opened it and was totally shocked...</li>
            <li> When I went to the bathroom I was indeed shocked to see that though my lipstick had worn off, my makeup looked almost 100% intact.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Again I say, why spend crazy money when you dont have to!</li>
            <li> and my foundation basically melted off. :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in no way disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed about</li>
            <li> However, I was sorely disappointed when I went to pump some out</li>
            <li> However I hate the pump.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a lightweight feel and it works well as a base for my makeup on the weekends.</li>
            <li> Makes a silky base for make-up.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have anything to base experience on</li>
            <li> The worst part is that covering acne spots and scars is almost impossible.  </li>
            <li> So frustrated!</li>
            <li> I hated it.</li>
            <li> So disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Try this - you will not be sorry and WILL be quite as amazed as I was/still am!!!</li>
            <li> Ummm holy crap!</li>
            <li> It was awful.</li>
            <li> It was horrible!</li>
            <li> Totally disgusting.</li>
            <li> the pump mechanism is terrible.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: This product made me break out so badly!!</li>
            <li> I think it is horrible that e.l.f.</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst primers I have ever used !</li>
            <li> I have horrible skin.</li>
            <li> This made me skin break out horribly and feel greasy.</li>
            <li> the reviews I&#x27;ve read do not mention this, but this primer has an awful smell.</li>
            <li> Horrible product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t wait, then it looks awful.</li>
            <li> It feels disgusting.</li>
            <li> The pump is terrible and often struggles and sputters.</li>
            <li> it is not the worst primer i have ever used</li>
            <li> horrible</li>
            <li> but the pump is horrible.</li>
            <li> horrible..</li>
            <li> This product was Awful for</li>
            <li> Even leaving it for a while to soak into my skin it still felt horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product. Skin feels nice and smooth and make-up goes on great and it requires less make-up to cover.</li>
            <li> Used once, very pleased. Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Perfect! I am a huge fan of all thing E.L.F. But it&#x27;s because their stuff works! This primer is awesome. I was like what&#x27;s all the fuss about when I saw primer recommended on a Pinterest tip board. When you wear this it smoothes your skin and makes your pores look smaller. When you apply your makeup over it your make up it adds a finished/polished look. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> The pump didn&#x27;t work when I got it, so I have to scoop the product out with a Q-tip every morning. Feels like it never really dries on your face.</li>
            <li> Creates a wonderfully smooth &#x27;canvas&#x27; for make-up application. Really, I was amazed with how well this works and how great it feels (like satin). I will be ordering from them again in the future.</li>
            <li> My bottle came all dry and broken very upset</li>
            <li> I really liked the product but was disappointed in the small amount; the large container was very misleading!</li>
            <li> This is the first primer I have tried and it seemed to work very well to begin with, but now I am not so sure. I am going to try some other products, because this seems to run out quickly.</li>
            <li> I am EXTREMELY dissatisfied with the e.l.f. Primer. I purchase from Amazon a lot, more than the average person, and I figured I would buy my make-up from here too, why not, right? I have before on some make-up items, more expensive things, Sephora or MAC products. BUT NO. Never again, Amazon. This primer had been opened. There was spots, like finger prints of the primer, on the inside of the cap of the bottle (on the shiny metallic part). I promptly opened the whole bottle to view the inside to see if it had been tampered with(by the way if you use it once and it seems empty, you have to push up on the bottom, there probably is more product inside that the pump cannot reach). It&#x27;s partially empty and looks like it has been used. Frankly, that&#x27;s gross, because who knows what you guys put in there and I would be putting it on my face, glad I didn&#x27;t use it yet. And I will never order make-up - let alone any other product - from Amazon again. I suggest you fix this, since many people&#x27;s comments reflect the same. Very, very disappointing -- not to mention appalling -- that products get tampered with and then sold.</li>
            <li> It feels like silk on my face.</li>
            <li> I have purchased four different primers in the last week and this one works the best so far. This primer also had the smallest price tag. I still need to wear it for another week to make sure it doesn&#x27;t break me out but so far so good!</li>
            <li> I love this primer! Best one I&#x27;ve used. Yes, it does contain a small oz but all you need is a little bit. If you order it through the elf website it will contain the same amount as well.</li>
            <li> OMG, LOVE this product! Feels amazing and does it&#x27;s job. In combination with e.l.f.Studio high definition powder translucent, my skin is not an oily mess by midday. Definitely give it a try, hope it works for you.</li>
            <li> The bottle was EMPTY  when I received it. .... purposely emptied. ...the product had a hole drilled in the bottom of it.... when I noticed the bottle was empty after I took it out of the package it came in</li>
            <li> Magic! Didn&#x27;t expect it to be this great!&lt;br /&gt;Perfect under any kind of foundation me and my mom loved it</li>
            <li> The product is great but it comes on a little greasy and leaves your hands greasy but it dries on you face and becomes better</li>
            <li> Painted ladies, you&#x27;ve been doing it wrong...  With a very light layer of this primer and a light layer of my foundation, I get magazine quality coverage.  I can&#x27;t believe how this makes a difference!  If you&#x27;ve been caking on foundation to cover, you really need to drop that habit and get this stuff.  I&#x27;m truly amazed at how it literally primes your face into a smooth velvety base.  Amazing stuff; I will never put on foundation without it again!</li>
            <li> It works pretty good. My makeup goes on easy and comes off easy.</li>
            <li> When this primer first arrived I wasn&#x27;t sure what to think, but once I used it I could feel the difference! It goes on smooth and feel great on my face.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this primer! You only need to use a little bit. It makes my large pores almost invisible. It doesn&#x27;t make my face oily. Lasts all day, even when it&#x27;s hot out. And you can&#x27;t beat the price. I just wish they made them in bigger bottles.</li>
            <li> I Love this product,&lt;br /&gt;Makes my skin feel smoothe like velvet. I would definately recommend this product to women who wear makeup!!</li>
            <li> My first time trying primer, and I&#x27;m sold. Instead of reapplying my makeup 3 times throughout the day, it truly stays put. Therefore I&#x27;m saving money on my makeup now! It has a funky smell, but goes on smooth and hasn&#x27;t bothered my acne-prone skin. Will buy again when I run out.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not enough in the container.  Very deceiving.  Otherwise, really enjoy the light application it provides and doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out.</li>
            <li> This was actually my first primer &amp; I like it. (I originally gave it 5 stars but bumped it down to two stars. See update below.)  I have combo skin (oily in the T zone &amp; somewhat dry is other areas such as around my mouth or chin).  My face normally gets oily mid-day but this primer keeps it at bay.  I have to put a little bit of moisturizer around my mouth &amp; chin before I apply the primer or else that area looks dry &amp; flaky.  Makeup seems to last all day too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update*&lt;br /&gt;I noticed the container wasn&#x27;t full of primer but I just thought that was deceptive marketing/packaging (tall container with only 1/3 of the actual product). Well I ordered 5 more &amp; these 5 were all full! So what exactly does this mean? It means some of the other reviewers were correct: used or tampered bottles are sometimes being sent to buyers! Yuck! I even saw fingerprints on some of the bottles like someone else commented. You get what you pay for (or maybe even less)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of returning the primers but I definitely won&#x27;t be purchasing these primers through Amazon in the future. In fact, I probably won&#x27;t be purchasing ELF primer ever again. I tried NYX Photo-Loving Primer &amp; it&#x27;s much better! NYX is almost 4x more than the super cheap ELF but it is well worth it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. This is the first time I&#x27;ve used face primer, but it seems to be fairly good quality. It has a really weird feel when you&#x27;re applying it, but afterwards your face is soo soft...</li>
            <li> Got mine, pump wouldn&#x27;t work..&lt;br /&gt;Have to stick my finger in the primer to get the remaining product.&lt;br /&gt;Not  the best &amp; what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;Not the best saler.&lt;br /&gt;I love the primer at least (: the product I could try was awesome.&lt;br /&gt;Beware of broken pump.</li>
            <li> The consistence is so strange I can&#x27;t quite describe if it actually feels like a cream or what! Its clear like a gel but.. you&#x27;d think its something oily though its also dry and anyway, whatever it is, it spreads so nicely! It absorbs in seconds and your make up will slide perfectly on top of it without looking cakey or anything. It is so light it feels almost inexistent in your face, but it works perfectly!  Less creases, less smudges, less mess! A little goes a LONG way, and the product is actually of a nice size. I&#x27;ve had it for endless months now and I think it could last me a year or more even!  The pump works very well and you do not waste product at all!  I just LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m def no make up pro, and I bet there are better ones out there but I like this one because it is cheap and does its job :)</li>
            <li> I was excited to use this product because I have never used a primer before.  I was able to use it one time, and I liked it.  The second time I went to use it, it was empty.</li>
            <li> I got mine at target for $2 so might want to check there :)&lt;br /&gt;But overall good primer</li>
            <li> HAVEN&#x27;T RECIEVED THE PRODCUT TO THIS DAY.</li>
            <li> Did I seriously wear make up with out primer? It makes my pores smaller and really changes the way make up looks on your skin. Oh and I have oily skin kinda t-zone area and this is has been good for me.</li>
            <li> feels kind of greasy as you put it on, but goes on smooth and lasts hours.</li>
            <li> Was not impressed with product and bottle was broke when it arrived</li>
            <li> Nice product as advertised</li>
            <li> Ummm holy crap! This really does fill in pores and you can totally tell the difference when you&#x27;ve got it on versus when its not on. My face looks like its been edited with the soft feature. I&#x27;ve never used anything like it. Definitely repurchasing this when I&#x27;m done</li>
            <li> Love it! Works perfect!</li>
            <li> It makes my skin dry and I have oily skin. But it is a good primer that does keep makeup in place.</li>
            <li> wish i could find it in larger container</li>
            <li> LOVE this face primer!!!! This is definitely worth every penny (all few hundred of them!). I bought this primer several months ago and I still haven&#x27;t run out!!! It pumps out the perfect amount, it goes on silky smooth and makeup just glides on after. LOVE love love this face primer. :) Thank you ELF for making affordable CRUELTY-FREE products!!!! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> I bought this and it was ok, It felt like silicone? It seemed the bottle does not hold much I finished it in less than a month and I don&#x27;t wear make-up everyday.</li>
            <li> Lovely feeling. Great price.</li>
            <li> OK- I am your typical twenty something female who has tried endless amounts of beauty/makeup products. I have oily/combo skin, that also tends to dry out in the winter. I was recommended e.l.f. products by a friend, and when I checked them out I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt trying because they were SO cheap so I had nothing to lose. I ordered this primer, and have been using it ever since. It really helps to even out my skin tone, reduce my pores, and provide just the right amount of moisture to my face. I use it mostly on my cheeks and around the areas of my eyes that are likely to get creases. My foundation goes on SO smoothly, and can last an ENTIRE day when I apply this primer first. It also makes my skin appear less oily too. For $4 I literally feel like I am stealing this product. You can go spend $50+ on high end primers, or buy this that will work the same (if not better) and save yourself $45 dollars to spend on other products! If you ever choose to buy directly from e.l.f&#x27;s website, google promo/coupon codes first, they always have multiple deals going on that can usually either score you free shipping or a % off your total price!</li>
            <li> Very little product, but also lasts a pretty long time (over 3 months) because a single drop goes a long way. It leaves the skin feeling silky and smooth, controls the shine and makes powder and foundation last longer. I loved it, i buy it everytime i can.</li>
            <li> Made me look greasy even tho I used a small amount and made me break out came early tho</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I have tried several primers and this is my favorite. It goes on silky and makes my makeup look smooth and fresh all day long. I swear I look younger and prettier. I think it also might help me look thinner. But seriously, I love this product!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love! I&#x27;ve never tried a primer, but I had heard a lot of good things about this one. I gave this a try, and I absolutely love it! My first primer and it was great!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff...I need to get more. Works exactly as it should. Thank you e.l.f.</li>
            <li> Very good product will be buying again.</li>
            <li> good stuff for the price.</li>
            <li> I love this primer and most of the elf products.  This primer gives you that matt finish you want when you start your makeup.  Great price and great product.</li>
            <li> Love this product, goes on silky smooth and preps my face for a flawless finish. I just wish they would include some way to indicate when the bottle is almost empty. Currently, you have no idea when you&#x27;re going to run out, so it&#x27;s best to keep a backup bottle handy at all times. Great product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> This product not only moisturized my skin, and evened out my skin tone; it filled in the fine lines leaving my face flawless.  Huge difference it made on my appearance my makeup lasted all day.  I&#x27;m hooked.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Let the skin really smooth!  Intend to buy more on the future!</li>
            <li> the tubing connected to the applicator broke off and I cannot access the product in the manner it is intended to be. This is a manufacturing issue and as a regular amazon shopper I expect a new one to be delivered. It is the elf mineral face primer, fills in fine lines and creates a flawless finish. On the bottom of the bottle there is a sticker that reads&lt;br /&gt;83401&lt;br /&gt;clear&lt;br /&gt;4F01YZ&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it once before it broke and liked it, so if you could send me another one that would be great. Also many of my friends ask me what makeup I use and then they go buy it. If you could send me some free samples so I call tell mt gifs what brand I&#x27;m wearing I&#x27;m certain you will see a boost in your sales! Thank You!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I rarely use primers so when I used this one, it was so yummy. Put my makeup on top and it just just glided on. Nice.</li>
            <li> This is the first time for me getting a primer and I gotta say, wow! It&#x27;s inexpensive and works wonders; making my face extra smooth and even for my foundation to go on so much easier and last longer! It has helped to actually smooth my skin out and make my pores smaller, I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> i was sceptical about purchasing this primer, because of the cheap price., but low and behold it is amazing!!.. your makeuo goes on so smooth and dewy, and heres a little tip ,  after your makeup is applied and done, add a tiny drop of primer in the palm of your hand and apply to any areas that you would like be extra dewy looking.... cant say enough about the feel of this on your skin.... love it ,love it.</li>
            <li> Love this and so soft on face</li>
            <li> This stuff dried my face out so badly I looked like I had some kind of skin disease for 3 days. It was awful. Boo on you E.L.F.</li>
            <li> SILKY SMOOTH FACE after application</li>
            <li> I like the feeling of this primer. It has a sort of soft powder feel too it, although it&#x27;s a liquid. I have blotchy red cheeks and it didn&#x27;t do much to even that out, however it helped my foundation last longer so it was an even trade.</li>
            <li> AWESOME PRODUCT BUT NOT ENOUGH IN THE BOTTLE</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a nice primer. It&#x27;s not greasy and can definitely hold up when going head to head with more expensive brands. It&#x27;s a good value.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t put a night time face on without this product! Even your game on day face would benefit. This product aids in the application of foundation and leaves your skin looking smoother and a bit glowing. I would buy again, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is a great primer.  It works as well as the expensive ones I have used. Only problem, sometimes doesn&#x27;t pump well. I just open it up and shake it out.  worth it for the $ i save!</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and it feels unbelievable on my skin and my makeup goes on flawlessly!!!! even works for mineral makeup which is what I use!! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are better primers out there, but for the cost, I&#x27;ve yet to find a better one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super inlove with this!</li>
            <li> this is the best primer i have ever used. helps fill in all those imperfections, and helps make the makeup stick and last longer. awesome product!</li>
            <li> This was either drained of its product before being shipped to me, or comes with pretty much no product in it at all.  The inner housing thing is like only 1/4 as small as all of the area inside of it, and for some reason the one that came to me had no straw or anything to pump the product out.  I don&#x27;t know if this was defective, but I&#x27;m not going to trust buying this again.  Returned.</li>
            <li> I am using my husbands account! I really love this primer. It is great for the price! It makes my foundation looks smotth and flawless. I use it under both my foundation and bb cream. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a great primer at a cheap price! I keep it stocked about 3 bottles at a time!</li>
            <li> Good price, does a good job.  Would give it 5 stars, but it&#x27;s a little deceptive (you&#x27;d think the entire container was filled, but really it&#x27;s a tiny tube inside.  Very little warning that you&#x27;re about to run out!</li>
            <li> This product glides onto the skin very smoothly and is not gluggy. The product also has a nice scent as well. It made my foundation stay on very well and I use a liquid foundation. I went out clubbing with some friends and went back to a friends house and we did not have any makeup wipes so I could not take my makeup off and the next morning, my foundation was still on. My skin looked perfect :)</li>
            <li> this is wonderful.  it feels like silk when you put it on and helps your makeup last longer. as far as blending different colors of your skin tone? i.e. blue veins or red spots not really but then for the price,  i still think it is a good product and will get it again</li>
            <li> This primer is comparable to Arbonne or DHC&#x27;s make up primer at a fraction of the cost! So very excited to find this!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of imperfections due to aging and sun exposure. Primer smooth my face out when mixed with cream foundation. Pump malfunctions. Would buy again since it really works pretty good. I have other primers and so far this is the best one.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  I use it everyday.  Goes on very smooth and lasts all day, even if you are sweating. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> It don&#x27;t work like it says it do</li>
            <li> Love it! It is very easy and seems to make a small difference, in a good way.</li>
            <li> I have used a couple of other primers before, but none as light as this one. It takes so very little product to cover the entire face. Make up and blush just glides right on and stays put all day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft and velvet feeling. I think it helps my makeup look more even and helps hide my pours and fine lines better. I have found that it can be a bit heavy if you apply too much. I only use this for weekends and special occasions as it does seem to cause a pimple or two if I wear it too often. I have used the higher end products before as well and they also cause slight breakouts for me, so I know it&#x27;s not just this product. My face is not used to having a lot of makeup on everyday. I usually just do a light powder and bronzer for everyday, so I think I am more sensitive than most to heavier foundations. But overall I like this product and has a nice finished look and much lower cost than other name brands.</li>
            <li> Product as advertised</li>
            <li> I love how soft and silky this makes my skin feel. And it truly last all day, which is is surprising because it totally controls my my oily skin. Awesome product!!!</li>
            <li> I returned this product the day after buying it. I used it twice and both times I hated it. It felt great coming out of the pump (like my Smashbox and BareMinerals primers) and it felt great on my skin (like silk - as a primer is expected to feel), but it literally did nothing for my pores and it made my makeup cakey! Like my makeup was sticking to this primer. It was horrible! I even tried waiting more than 10 minutes for this product to sink in only to have the same results. That&#x27;s like the exact opposite of what a primer is supposed to do. It felt drying and it caused me to get zits on my chin almost immediately, so back it went to the store. Plus, the amount of product you get is so minimal that it just wasn&#x27;t worth the $6 at Wal-Mart - there&#x27;s like NO product inside the pump and I can imagine that it wouldn&#x27;t last long. I don&#x27;t even use that much, but I was shocked to see how little product was in the package! I use my Smashbox primer for 6 plus months before it runs out, so you&#x27;re saying that I&#x27;m going to have to go out and buy this ELF product every couple of weeks?? Heck no. Not a fan and I will never purchase again. I might try the other versions of this just to review them, but not until my skin heals!</li>
            <li> I love it! It&#x27;s so soft</li>
            <li> I love the satin feel to this product but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything special about it. I use it out of habit. Once the product is out I&#x27;m probably going to invest in a higher quality primer. Any suggestions?</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s a great price, and it works great. I wish it came with more in the bottle..</li>
            <li> Lightweight primer lightly masks flaws and evens out some redness. I have sensitive skin and have irritation with some primers but not this one. It also tones down the shine on your face. I put it on after using a high end moisturizer</li>
            <li> I love this primer! It goes on very nicely and clear so no need to have to match it with your foundation. The makeup does stay on and look nice and flawless for awhile, and thats what I love.    my downside, Elf is a very cheap and great makeup line. I dont think buying it on amazon is such a great idea because in the stores elf makeup goes from either $1,$3 or $5...On amazon they do sell it the same but you pay for shipping and handeling..it truly beats the whole purpose.     I could have got this in the store for $5 bucks, I paid on amazon $11.00 after everything.     ELF IS A GREAT MAKEUP LINE, ONE OF MY FAVORITE ACTUALLY. Buying elf online isnt a great idea... wont do it again (:</li>
            <li> This is the silkiest primer I&#x27;ve ever used, and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it. I&#x27;ve tried other (more expensive) primers, and they felt much heavier. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this, makeup goes on beautifully!</li>
            <li> Great product. Does exactly what it needs to do.</li>
            <li> I love it&lt;br /&gt;It make my skin very soft</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with primer. for the price, it did a great job. I got a little better result with M.A.C Prep and Prime. This one got flaky once or twice and I could never figure out what I did wrong. May be my skin was still a bit damp from the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I wish they were bigger! It glides smoothly to cover your pores and what not. Amazing. I&#x27;m wondering why no other similar product comes close to it&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> This makes my face so soft. I think it works really well to put on before foundation. The only problem I&#x27;ve had with it is that sometimes after I apply it, it will turn my face red.</li>
            <li> consistently good product which leaves a smooth finish of my makeup</li>
            <li> Flawless Primer! Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to, and I love the price. I will most definitely use again. :)</li>
            <li> Love the product. Just as good as the high end products. Recommend for every girl. Makes my face feels flawless and beautiful.</li>
            <li> For the price I was surprised at how well it worked.  I helped my foundation not fall into those little wrinkles on my face.</li>
            <li> This is the first face primer I&#x27;ve purchased and I was very impressed.  My skin is oily and my makeup tends to fade after a few hours.  This product goes on very smooth and does not feel heavy.  When I use this product my makeup will stay fresh looking for the entire workday.  I only need half a pump of the product for my face so the bottle has lasted a while.  Like other reviewers, I recommend buying it directly from ELF&#x27;s website because they often have promos for their studio line.</li>
            <li> I strongly disliked this product. It kind of had an oily finish to it. It was not a matte nor completely dry finish. Don&#x27;t get if you have oily skin.</li>
            <li> This product was so much better than expected because the price was so cheap. At the time I ordered it, I took it off the e.l.f. website because it was cheaper there as well as a few other products and they are great quality. This primer was soo silky and velvety and smooth and I loved how hydrating it was. It improved the stay of my makeup and reduced how much oil i produce for a longer period and i was quite happy because despite my combination skin, my nose becomes very shiny. Some reviewers commented that there is little product in the bottle, which is true, but as for the quality, a little goes a long way. And also, can you complain for the price?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope they make other colours to adjust to tones although elf has a palette of the 4 main tone adjusting concealers.&lt;br /&gt;I am also new to the use of primers so not really able to compare to other brands&#x27; primers</li>
            <li> Well.. I&#x27;m disappointed that I can&#x27;t say I love this. I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the Smashbox Photo Finish Hydrating Primer and hoped this would be it. While there isn&#x27;t a whole lot of product in the bottle, it does go a long way. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month now and I still have plenty left. This doesn&#x27;t hydrate my skin the least bit. It has this silky &amp;#34;silicone&amp;#34; feel to it, which I absolutely detest. I feel like my skin is suffocating when I put this stuff on. Almost like I&#x27;m rubbing butter on my face that dries to a powdery finish. Yuck. It works okay as a primer for the price, but I prefer something lighter and more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for as long as I can remember, but it has a hefty price tag of $40+ ... and since I got laid off I was looking for something just as good, and obviously cheaper. This is not only that, but it&#x27;s better. I will never use smashbox again, job or no job</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product i use it everyday</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late-50&#x27;s, and I was hoping this would be a product that would prevent my foundation from highlighting my dry spots and lines. It performed &amp;#34;Ok&amp;#34; where the lines are concerned, but didn&#x27;t help with flawless coverage in the dry spot areas. If these are issues that you&#x27;re trying to address, perhaps you&#x27;d be better served by purchasing a different product. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love it! will buy it over and over again. goes on smooth and gives me a smooth look all day. My eye shadow no longer creases!</li>
            <li> I unscrewed the top and the primer is in this teeny tiny little tube!!! It also left my skin oily and my pores were as visible as if I had nothing on. I didn&#x27;t like this at all</li>
            <li> good but, couldn&#x27;t vasoline do the same thing?</li>
            <li> This is a great primer for the price! I was using smashbox photo finish and this works just as well for about 1/3 of the price. Maybe even less.  This is a must before foundation. Really smooths the skin for a nice foundation application.</li>
            <li> Have heard of this products rave reviews decided to try it. I ordered the clear primer, the site gives you 3 options to choose from, I went with the clear. I applied it before foundation application used a small amount, felt silky on my skin, than I applied the e.l.f. foundation on top needless to say my skin looked very soft, smooth  even skin tone. Like the product.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to spend money on a primer, I&#x27;d suggest spending a few more dollars on one that works better.  This is smooth, but seems to melt my makeup in about an hour!  It looks like I&#x27;ve been at the gym, but really I&#x27;ve just been sitting on the couch.  Not great.</li>
            <li> This stuff is soooo smooth. If I could describe the texture…its between a super lightweight powder &amp; a pearl feel. Its crazy smooth. &amp; does help me apply my make up more evenly. Will buy again for this price!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it!</li>
            <li> I love it, very silky.</li>
            <li> seems to do the trick doesnt clog pores and is easy to wash off</li>
            <li> Tried other face primers before all the expensive brands but this one is truly amazing.Feels very powdery sheer silky smooth and leave the face looking flawless.Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> a couple more dollars and i&#x27;m sure you can get something better</li>
            <li> This is a great primer for a great price! I have been using this primer for a couple years and it gives you the perfect, smooth surface to apply your make up!</li>
            <li> This product works great alone or under makeup. It gives you skin a very matte look, completely fresh with not a single shine if you have oily skin. It also last all day. I love it so much I bought another.</li>
            <li> This is some good stuff.its soft and light.the bottle is somewhat on the small side, but it&#x27;s worth it when you apply it to your face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just okay,  it makes your face feel really smooth HOWEVER it smells so bad I can&#x27;t stand using it.  It literally smells like bug spray and motor oil.  Totally disgusting.</li>
            <li> Best primer I have ever used and a low price. This dries quickly and did not clog my pores. Lasted me about 2 months, one squirt is plenty.</li>
            <li> Arrived as stated and on time</li>
            <li> This is my favorite primer! I recommend it to all of my friend&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Love it!! The product feels wonderful when you apply it prior to putting on your makeup. Gives you a beautiful matte finish.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like the softest lotion that leaves no oiliness.</li>
            <li> This works as well as the $40 primers I&#x27;ve bought at makeup stores. It&#x27;s silky smooth and spread easily.</li>
            <li> This stuff is simply AMAZING! !! I never liked primer before this: it made my skin feel cakey and i never saw any benefit.  But THIS, oh my my, it literally feels like silk and makes my 40+ skin look better than it has in years, fills in pesky lines, controls shine and keeps my makeup looking flawless all day. And a great price to boot!! Ladies, im telling you- BUY THIS!!! I truly dont ever wanna be without this again! (And i hope they dont raise the price!)</li>
            <li> It shipped quickly and arrived packaged perfectly. The primer itself is great however it didn&#x27;t last me very long, it is good for the price. I ran out in about three weeks and after about two weeks the primer started getting gooey and was hard to apply. My second tube lasted me a bit longer. If you get this primer make sure you keep the lid on to keep it from drying out, it will last longer!!</li>
            <li> I had never used a face primer before, and now I can say that I will never go without it again. I&#x27;ve always had oily skin, especially when I put on makeup. It would get so bad that my makeup would literally start melting off within 3 hours. Tonight, my makeup lasted 7 hours (and then I washed it off), with no shine. I never needed a touch up and my face felt comfortable. It evened out my skin tone and it also helped cover a few blemishes. The price was perfect, considering I wanted to try a primer without spending too much money. This is going to stay in my daily routine.</li>
            <li> excellent product, exceeded all my expectations</li>
            <li> With just one single pump I can cover my entire face. I love this product.</li>
            <li> the pump mechanism is terrible. I have spend too much time tying to get the pump to work. I have given up and taken off the top and just pounded the bottle into my hand.</li>
            <li> Gets Cakey/flaky if rubbed in too long. Could live without it.</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels when I put this on.</li>
            <li> Had to give mine away because it made me break out.</li>
            <li> Better than MAC primer and much cheaper!!! My favorite.</li>
            <li> Meh...it&#x27;s ok. You will be disappointed if you take the pump out of the bottle and really see how very little product there is. The bottle may seem large, but the reservoir that actually holds the product is tiny. Way to pull the wool over elf!</li>
            <li> This stuff is comparable to smash box primer, no doubt! It keeps my makeup in place all day despite my oily skin - I can definitely tell a difference wearing it vs not!</li>
            <li> Cheap and great, skin feels awesome, just like when I used to use my expensive Lancome primer</li>
            <li> I had never used a primer before so this was the first time for me.  I really liked the product and the fact that it was clear was a major plus.  It made my skin really soft before applying any makeup and it did not feel oily or greasy to the touch.  I will be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> This is my first primer and I have read that it is wonderful, but I&#x27;m not sure it does that much for me. Should I be letting it dry more? I still get concealer in the fine lines under my eyes. It smells nice and goes on well but I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference. Maybe I don&#x27;t know what to look for.</li>
            <li> I love this primer, but gave it 3 stars because the pump sucks. It got clogged after the first use. I have to stick a qtip in the bottle to get why product.</li>
            <li> It certainly is cheaper than Smashbox and pretty comparable.  I would not say it is as good, but this is a good day to day primer to use if you want to save your Smashbox for special occasions!  Normally, I think a travel size is overpriced and crazy, but in this case I plan to buy a travel sized of Smashbox to keep on hand for those special times when I really want to be sure my makeup is and stays flawless.  I&#x27;ll continue to use elf for the days I&#x27;m just in the office.</li>
            <li> yea it&#x27;s a good price, but it really sucks. This is only the second primer I&#x27;ve ever owned and I know it&#x27;s bad</li>
            <li> makes the makeup stay on all day even through sweat, smells good and moisturizes. this productt is amazing for the price!</li>
            <li> I have never really been into primers. I am not a big fan of makeup, but recently due to break outs I got some hyper pigmentation on my skin ( I have a milk chocolate complexion) so my skin is prone to dark marks but beyond that it is fairly clear and healthy. I take care of my skin which is very sensitive and dry. So with the recent break out spots I started to wear concealer and a little more foundation. I had an issue with the makeup wearing off and even having difficulty coming off to the point I had to wash my face many times. My friend suggested a primer but the ones I tried were to heavy and irated me due to my sensitive skin, I wanted to start buying high end ones but the price turned me off so I finally settled to try elf mineral primer.&lt;br /&gt;When I applied it (  small amount) I was surprised how light weight it was. I expected something heavy and for my skin to start itching but nothing. I was able to apply the makeup effortlessly on top of my skin and it glided easily over my large pores. It lasted all day and when I washed it off the makeup came off much more smoothly then before. I tried it again almost every day and I did not break out once, it did not irate my dry skin, and because of it my skin is looking a lot healthier and I am actually seeing my hyper pigmentation fade slightly due to the make up no longer slipping into my pores. I can&#x27;t believe how this product worked wonders for my dry sensitive skin. I recommend it. But I advise that a little goes a long way especially for my ladies who have oiler skin.  My sister who has oiler skin used it and it works great for her and left some shine but this went away when she started using less when she applied it. For those with dry skin like me this is not an issue but I still recommend a little per application because of the small bottle. It leaves a nice dewing finish and I love it!</li>
            <li> I love the smooth feeling when I apply this on my face.&lt;br /&gt;i don&#x27;t really use foundation and I was amazed that it&#x27;s work in just powder.</li>
            <li> I absolutly love this face primer! It makes my makeup go on so smooth! It also leaves my face feeling silky smooth. I will for sure be buying this again!</li>
            <li> I was half way expecting this to make my face either oily or give it extra lines and it did neither of those things.  It&#x27;s genius and I can&#x27;t begin to explain how it works but I can tell a big difference in the application of my face paint :)</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work as well as described</li>
            <li> I love using this primer. If you have dry patches, although this is nice and moisturizing, use lotion first. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using brushes for this, (wash your hands!) just because it&#x27;s easier to feel where it goes since it&#x27;s clear. It makes my skin feel amazing and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in how long my makeup has been lasting.</li>
            <li> this makes my face feel silky smooth and it works.. I recommend this and I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Makes my makeup stay on all day and looks so smooth. I loved it and will purchase again. Great product</li>
            <li> Had a oily feel but it isnt oily at all!</li>
            <li> This Primer is Claire and colorless. It goes on smoothly and yes it does give the skin of your face a very nice silky feel. As for keeping your face oil free with the make up , not entirely. But I find that I do shine a lot less so it is working to some extent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: This product made me break out so badly!! it took 2 weeks to clear-up once I stop using it!!</li>
            <li> This product does the job but is a little thicker than I prefer.  I&#x27;ll probably go back to my old vendor who sells a thinner viscosity primer.</li>
            <li> I have tried other primers but since I have loved the other elf products I have, I figured I would give this a shot.  First time I used it, I could tell a difference right away.  It was not oily, nice consistency, absorbed &amp;#34;dried&amp;#34; quickly and smoothly.  I have been using a powder base for the last few weeks or so due to the humidity, feels great and stays on using the primer :)</li>
            <li> works as well as more expensive brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Difficult to get all product out of container, I have to take the top off and use a cotton swab.</li>
            <li> Is causes some irritation, so I will not be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any change to makeup staying on longer, but it does smooth out the surface of your skin</li>
            <li> Empty bottle almost when received</li>
            <li> Nice product at a good price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lovely product it makes applying your foundation looks flawless. I recommend it for purchase</li>
            <li> First time trying this and I love it.  Your makeup goes on very smoothly.</li>
            <li> Decent product for the price</li>
            <li> Great primer for the price. Feels like silk going on your face. Not very good for all day, though. It&#x27;s a cool looking bottle, but mine had the tube inside broken so the pump doesn&#x27;t work. I tried fishing it out with some tweezers but couldn&#x27;t get it and wasted some of the product. I&#x27;ll most likely use it just to apply eye shadow, it goes on much easier than a dry lid!</li>
            <li> I really like this primer (: It goes onto skin flawlessly and it feels as if nothing is there once its put on.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using primer and I&#x27;m glad I chose this one as my first pick! It&#x27;s very silky and smooth. I have oily skin and it doesn&#x27;t put a lot of weight on my skin at all. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I am still a MAC addict at heart, but since I would rather travel and pay my mortgage, certain sacrifices have to be made... And surprisingly, I am not disappointed. This goes on silky and very easily blended. Bravo E.L.F. for a within budget primer! I use under my foundation, and also a little just before applying eyeshadows: a two for one! Now if only it would keep my lipstick on as well, and I would never buy any other primers!&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: a little goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Allows foundation to be applied easily and you get a smooth finish. Prevents natural skin oils from making your face look &amp;#34;shiny&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The primer is good, but unfortunately there is not enough in the bottle. In my opinion,this is just a sample size. The bottle is a good size, but the actual product (primer) is in a small stick inside the bottle. This will only last you a few applications.</li>
            <li> I am giving this product 4 stars instead of 5 because it feels oily. I don&#x27;t think it is oily, but it leaves this gross oily feeling on your face before you apply your product and it is just uncomfortable. Otherwise, it does the job, but I have seen better primers.</li>
            <li> My wife ordered this item with other  make up articles, hoping that this way nothing would get lost but they sent the items separately and this one got lost. We went to pick it up at the post office but they said it was already delivered. If they are going to sell small stuff they better be more careful with this kind of orders because its easier to get lost if they send it separately.</li>
            <li> This is a great primer for the price.  It goes on easily and makes your foundation stay put so what&#x27;s not to like about it?</li>
            <li> Really mediocre.  First if you compare the price per ounce, Lancome La Base is less expensive and far superior.  Second, this primer always makes my face break out.  I know because I have several brands and when I use this one the break-outs start the next day.  Not worth what it does to your face for the rest of the week even if it goes on smooth and feels good on the day you use it.  Plus the bottle is deceptive giving the impression of a lot more product than is in there, so comparing the price per ounce tells the real story.  It&#x27;s more expensive than much better brands.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin very soft!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great alternative to the Smashbox primer. Very light weight. Not oily. Makes my skin so smooth, and feels nice to the touch. I have red and discolored areas on my face, and this help my face look more normal. Great quality and very inexpensive. I have used Bareminerals Clear Primer for over a year, which cost $26 plus tax BTW, and this e.l.f. primer works better than the two I mentioned above. And it&#x27;s sooo much more affordable. Will be purchasing again! This is my first e.l.f. product and I love it.</li>
            <li> e.l.f. products comes with very reasonable price tag and so far I have no doubts in this brand. This primer gave me a very good base line for my mineral makeup to sit on. It filled my pores and fine lines for a super smooth finished look. I use my finger tips mostly when I apply makeup and afterwards they felt like it was sealed up....kind of gave me a sensitive feeling. As always washed my hands and the feeling receded.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t begin to describe how amazing this product is, it&#x27;s so easy to apply, you just need a little quantity to apply it because it spread out nicely, and the most amazing thing is that it have that satin finish, so lovely!</li>
            <li> I got the clear.  Feels really good and works well but doesn&#x27;t hide pores.  I give it only 3 stars because there is so little product in this container that it should be sold as a sample.  It&#x27;s really misleading.</li>
            <li> This does what I need it to do. When I first bought it it came to me with a lot of the product in its box. My box was also pretty banged up when It arrived so I wasn&#x27;t too surprised about this. Amazon promptly sent me another one and I&#x27;ve been buying and using this face primer ever since!</li>
            <li> the studio mineral infused primer has made a huge difference in the appearance of my skin after I apply my make-up. It creates a flawless look, my pores, which are the size of the grand canyon normally, literally vanish and it makes your skin look radiant. I have oily skin and huge pores and this works beautifully on my complexion, I would say give it a try because for the price you pay and the results that I have achieved, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> Good primer, its cheap and has made a noticeable difference in my makeup&#x27;s smoothness.</li>
            <li> OKAY - why has it taken me so long to use this?! I&#x27;ve used so many brand name primers like Mac and Clinique and this ELF one is by far my favorite. It leaves my face feeling...flawless! I use Revlon ColorStay foundation with it. Love ittt.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 5 stars because it seems to work just as well as my fav Vail primer which cost about 6x&#x27;s as much.  So my ratings were based on the fact it was a smoking deal, compared well to my norm and I had no weird skin reaction.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very light, but works effectively. I wish it came in a bigger bottle but so far it works well on my face especially in the morning, I have not used it at night. but I&#x27;m starting to feel the effects already.</li>
            <li> the base for make up is used for better appearenca of your skeen even without any pouder after , but you should use it in complex with foundation</li>
            <li> It really moisturized my skin. I love how it feels and keeps my makeup from creasing. I would recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> Why I love this Primer:&lt;br /&gt;1. The price&lt;br /&gt;2. Goes on easy and feels silky&lt;br /&gt;3. I use Mac Face powder which goes on very well&lt;br /&gt;4. The size is compact, great for travel&lt;br /&gt;5. My skin has not reacted negatively to it&lt;br /&gt;6. It&#x27;s clear and I don&#x27;t have to worry about glitter or such&lt;br /&gt;7. My face doesn&#x27;t get oily around the T zone any more, looks fresh all day even under air conditioned office environment.&lt;br /&gt;8. I&#x27;ve never used primer before and for me, it was easy and I didn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;d been through the wringer at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say ... give it a go ...who knows, you might love it as much as I do ... Ended up buying a second bottle cause I&#x27;m in Australia and don&#x27;t want to run out or pay $50 for primer locally.</li>
            <li> This is silky and soft, good color. Good price. I wish I bought more. Great coverage. Goes on evenly. Good size.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and must say that I love the way it even outs my skin and allows makeup to be applied evenly and smoothly.</li>
            <li> great silky application, my first primer ever and i love it, i found this at target and its really inexpensive. target has a ton of ELF products</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It goes on so light &amp; airy. Doesn&#x27;t feel thick or clogging the pores, lets the face breathe.</li>
            <li> For a smooth foundation application use this before applying your foundation.  It minimized the appearance of my pores, was very easy to apply and did not cause a break out.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love, love, love this primer!  Did I say enough loves?  Goes on silky smooth and really works at having your foundation appear smooth.  I will continue to buy this primer over and over again!</li>
            <li> I seemed to have &amp;#34;accidentally&amp;#34; ordered two of these...so I&#x27;m trying to use it up.  However, I can&#x27;t say this is my favorite primer.  It&#x27;s okay.  It&#x27;s a little too &amp;#34;liquidy&amp;#34; for me.  I like a more &amp;#34;dense&amp;#34; primer.  This one feels too loose and doesn&#x27;t seem to even my pores out.  I use another product where I have my larger pores (nose and partial cheek area), and this one everywhere else and on my neck.  Once it &amp;#34;dries&amp;#34; it does have a nice feel to it.  But it&#x27;s just a little too &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; for my liking.  I&#x27;ll use up my two bottles (don&#x27;t want to waste it), but will look for a better quality next time.  It is true, you get what you pay for.  I was hoping this was going to be better quality for a great price...  It is an okay quality for a good price, but is nothing like urban decay or other mid or high end primers.</li>
            <li> product is great but the bottle only contains a very small amount</li>
            <li> I do make up professionally. I&#x27;ve been trying different products out of curiously. I was pleasantly surprised by the value of this primer.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for the price. Beware of the size though, the bottle is misleading. There is actually far less in the bottle than seems to be pictured. However, the price is right and this stuff works just as well as the expensive stuff. Goes on clear and keeps my makeup in place all day without any creasing. 4 stars from me!</li>
            <li> I guess I don&#x27;t get the point. I don&#x27;t feel like it did anything for me. I&#x27;ve had a full bottle sitting on my shelf for a year.</li>
            <li> Only $3 at Target. Helps fills in pore a little, not much. Goes on smoothly but I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s good for my oily skin. Make up doesn&#x27;t last well either.</li>
            <li> High quality drug store face primer. Would compare to urban decay</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t settle into skin like better primers. It just kind of sits on your skin and leaves it not oily, but weird, unnatural feeling</li>
            <li> The primer does its job-smoothing facial surface to help keep makeup even but I really don&#x27;t like the odor it emits. The smell does disappear after a while but it makes me wonder what the ingredients are...and if they are doing more harm than good!</li>
            <li> I use this before putting on liquid foundation and it makes the makeup apply much more evenly. And it&#x27;s a great price as an add-on item.</li>
            <li> I love this primer, I really do... It makes my face feel so soft and smooth, and my makeup goes on flawlessly...  But you can get it on the Elf website for only $6...</li>
            <li> Feels like silicone but in a good way. Primes my skin great under my face makeup!</li>
            <li> So I ordered this because it was Amazon Mom eligible. I had planned on ordering a primer from Nyx, and really should have gone with my first choice. This stuff isn&#x27;t bad as a primer. Here comes the big HOWEVER. First I thought my bottle was empty. Nope, the pump absolutely sucks. This is very thick primer and clearly no one thought to check to see if the pump on the bottle would be able to handle it. So every time I want to use it, I have to take the top off. Another thing is that I&#x27;m never going to be able to use the whole bottle. This is due to the fact that I can&#x27;t use the pump and have to fight just to get the product out of the bottle. It&#x27;s a bit of a greasy primer which is great for dry skin. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone trying to fight shine.</li>
            <li> I think the reason this catches so many people is because of the price. But what people don&#x27;t look at is that this is only 0.48 oz... The rest of the primers that go for about 10-15 dollars are double the price but also double the size!!! They advertise in the details \\&quot;Why pay more when you can have the same quality for less?\\&quot; Yeah, not really considering other primers have a ton more in them. I think it is horrible that e.l.f. tries to mislead people by making the bottle bigger when inside there is a smaller tube about half full of primer. What a waste of material for hardly any product. Look further into other primers before deciding to buy this one because it is cheap... because I&#x27;ll tell you right now it does not last long and it is not worth it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this primer on a whim when I saw it in Meijer&#x27;s store this weekend.  I&#x27;m always hunting for a primer that makes my skin look flawless (still looking).  But, the first thing I noticed when I applied it was that it feels sooooo great.  It just glides on your skin and makes it feel so soft and smooth.  I&#x27;d keep using it for that reason alone! lol.  It wasn&#x27;t a miracle product, I only noticed a little difference after I applied my MAC foundation.  But overall, I do like the product and would probably buy it again, but not from Amazon -$10 is way too much.  Like I said, I purchased it at a Meijer&#x27;s store and it was only $6.00.  Also, it&#x27;s true what the other reviewer said, the pump is not that great - it will squirt out on ya if you&#x27;re not careful, but not too bad.  I just started using elf products and I&#x27;m impressed with the products they provide for the price they charge. Not bad!</li>
            <li> Formula is decent enough but the bottle broke/got separated way too easily.  I have to scrape it out with a tool in order to get the primer (which is good stuff, but the design is just crappy).</li>
            <li> Very smooth and silky, Feels exactly like primers I have had in the past from Sephora, and does the job just the same. Primer helps a lot when you have a long work day or night ahead and want to look relatively the same as you did when you first put your makeup on!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Favorite face primer. And the price makes it even better. Super smooth and does a terrific job.</li>
            <li> okay this stuff is amazing! I use it everyday!! I put it on before I put on my makeup. it smooths the texture of your skin so you have a flat surface to apply your makeup if you have any imperfections or indentions in skin, it&#x27;s great for bags under the eyes in the morning also. I love it!</li>
            <li> Wow I just tried it and made a huge difference in the way my foundation came on and stayed! DEFINITELY repurchasing</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m a dude, but I got my wife this and she said &amp;#34;Ohh myy gooddd, it&#x27;s like putting silk on my face!&amp;#34; so I guess it&#x27;s like putting silk on your face, which can&#x27;t really be a bad thing, right?</li>
            <li> Smooths your face for an easy application but I think it is causing me to break out on parts of my face that I accidentally use too much on.</li>
            <li> I like this primer a lot; and for the price, it&#x27;s hard to beat! It really smooths out the face and allows my foundation to go on smoothly. The only negative I have for it is that it&#x27;s pretty oily. So if you have oily skin, this may not be the best product for you.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and it works and is absolutely amazing. I had considered changing to another brand of primer but they say &amp;#34;if it&#x27;s not broken, don&#x27;t fix it&amp;#34; so I am back to my e.l.f. primer. I have combination skin, and my forehead and cheeks tend to get real oily and whenever I include the primer to my makeup regimen, my skin is not as oily as it normally is. I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> This ELF Face primer is fairly long lasting, applies smoothly, and works better on my skin than the expensive smashbox product.  Foundation applies smoothy over the primer and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Even though is very inexpensive it&#x27;s very good; make my skin look silky and set the perfect base for foundation.</li>
            <li> I am on my 2nd bottle now &amp; I have to say, I do really like it. goes on so smooth &amp; I can&#x27;t even feel it. ugh, love!</li>
            <li> This is my second or third reorder I can&#x27;t remember which but I love this primer!The primer applies so smoothly and it the makeup apply flawless!I just love it!</li>
            <li> Bought this because I read that it helped control oily skin. I have a very oily T-zone during fall/winter times - I have no idea why - but this definitely helps! It controls it and usually about 2-3 hours after I put make up on I tend to get very oily but with this primer, I hardely ever get oily anymore! I&#x27;ve used primers in the past and they have been excellent at keeping the make up on my face for a long time - which is the main purpose of primers! - but with this primer, I don&#x27;t seem to see the difference between using this primer and not using a primer at all prior make up. I give it 3 stars because it has been excellent in oil control, but it hasn&#x27;t really done much for my make up lasting!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this product given its very low price......I was very wrong. I adore this product. It makes my makeup application smooth and flawless. Everyone should have some</li>
            <li> This primer keeps my makeup perfect all day. I use it over my moisturizer and the foundation stays put for hours.</li>
            <li> Ok Ladies:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a clear face primer. I&#x27;ve used it and if you have oily skin as I do, this does the job of mattifying the face to prevent that oily look.  I don&#x27;t wear make-up that often, but I do take pride in my complexion, so this clear primer will fit right into my facial regimen. If you do wear make-up I&#x27;m thinking that this will help you makeup go on very smoothly as it feel like silk when applied.  Finally! a product which does what it claim&#x27;s for a very very great price!  Buying another just to keep on hand.</li>
            <li> After I bought this I read some negative reviews and thought I might have wasted my money. However, it works great for me! I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AWESOME! I&#x27;ve bought primer before and paid a pretty penny for smaller jars than this. This product is cheap and is great! I will buy this product again!!</li>
            <li> I thought a primer was supposed to help keep your make up on longer through out the day. I started using this ELF studio mineral face primer and i didn&#x27;t notice any change from when I wasn&#x27;t using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks and still no improvement nor changes. Though the item feels very light on your face, I just don&#x27;t see the point of it.</li>
            <li> When this bottle came it pumped the primer only 2 times. When I took the top off to see if there was a clog I saw that the container was almost empty. There was dome primer on the sides of the container so I had to scoop that with a q-tip. I know this didn&#x27;t cost that much to begin with but arriving almost empty, really? I should have made a complaint at the time of purchase but I am now just getting around to reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I used this the first time when I went to a concert and amazed at how well it held up. Definite a must !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different face primers and I have to say this makes my face INCREDIBLY silky and soft and my foundation does go on pretty smooth. Everyone is talking about the pump and it stops working after awhile.. My pump works just fine I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it. It&#x27;s a clear gel form and not entirely sure if I would purchase again but it works for now.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good product, but mine stopped pumping the primer out and I have to unscrew the clear part off and push it up manually</li>
            <li> I have used this product only once (I am waiting on my other makeup from amazon to come) but it works on great! it is nice and smooth and makes putting on makeup so much better.  i love the fact that it is SPF. Ladies, if you love makeup, I would definitely suggest this primer.  it is cheap and works great :)</li>
            <li> I usually use bare minerals face primer but bought this as an add on item on a whim. So glad I did! It is smooth and works perfectly! Doesn&#x27;t make my face feel greasy what so ever. :)</li>
            <li> This is a great primer.  It&#x27;s inexpensive and works better than a lot of expensive brands...and I&#x27;ve tried them all.  I have sensitive acne prone skin and this primer doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  I love how it makes my skin look when I wear it alone without foundation.  I have a lot of trouble finding it in stores.  The first time I purchased it was in a Target store, but I haven&#x27;t been able to find it since.  Luckily Amazon has it!</li>
            <li> Works really well and applies SO smoothly! My foundation looks flawless over this primer and it&#x27;s very light so I don&#x27;t feel like I have a lot of product on my face.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m a teenage girl, I have basically zero experience with makeup. On any given day I will go without makeup, but on those special occasions where I know there are gonna be pictures, I put some makeup on. Again, I&#x27;m no makeup expert, but I can say that this primer makes my face feel really smooth and really does the job well in priming my face for foundation or tinted lotion or anything. You really don&#x27;t need much either; people say 2 pumps, I say 1 pump, so I guess it depends.</li>
            <li> My face tends to oil up really easily so this primer really helped me out on my bad days! It was smaller than I expected, but overall, it made my face feel smooth! It was my first time to use a primer, and I will still be trying new primers, but I will most likely buy this again!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I ran out of my Smashbox primer and didn&#x27;t feel like spending an arm and a leg to repurchase it. I was really pleased with the quality of this primer for the price you pay. The formula seems really similar to the Smashbox primer and applies the same way. The staying power of this is pretty good and I like that it has a pump applicator. It&#x27;s hard to tell if it gets all of the product out, but it&#x27;s really convenient for every day use. It&#x27;s more expensive here on Amazon, so if you can try to purchase it online or in-store (Target and others carry ELF).</li>
            <li> this product is pretty good goes on smooth! but just know... the whole white bottle isn&#x27;t filled with it! its probably like a little passed the silver part! I was a little bummed when I noticed that is was running out so I opened it and was totally shocked... there is very very little for such a big bottle.. Pretty much false advertisement if you will but its okay... not re-purchasing.. now using por-fessional from benefit!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand makeup that leaves a coating and makes your skin feel greasy.  With foundations, it&#x27;s always about looking good but not feeling clean and fresh.  This is no miracle product.  It&#x27;s the same as all the other stuff out there.  It definitely does improve the way liquid foundation goes on, and how your complexion looks, but this primer requires a powder on top to finish off, otherwise your face will feel very slick.  Some people are calling it &amp;#34;silky smooth&amp;#34; but I would call it greasy.  I will only use this periodically.  For me, it&#x27;s just another layer and another hassle, which I do not want to add to the already tired makeup routine.</li>
            <li> This has glitter in it. I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it if I had known that. Other than that it worked fine the one time I tried it. I gave it to a younger person as glitter does not belong in a professional office environment.</li>
            <li> Product was just as described and does as intended. I personally have not had issues with any clogged pores or breaking out from using the primer. Elf really does seem to be a great product for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for the cost. I recommend it to anybody for purchase. Also a very good price.</li>
            <li> Great product. It keeps my makeup in place longer that it normally does.</li>
            <li> Always a great product!</li>
            <li> a great product, only thing about it that bothers me is that the quantity is not enough, so I have to buy 2 bottle every time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other face primers and for the price this is a great purchase.  Does not leave your face feeling oily.</li>
            <li> i am in my 50s this product makes my skin smooth and silky so makeup adheres better, but is very light</li>
            <li> I feel oily when I use this although on my face it doesn&#x27;t show. It does do a great job of keeping my make up looking fresh tho so im happy with that. But I moved on the smash box face primer which i like alot better.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling silky smooth. I absolutely love it. It&#x27;s lightweight and great under your make up. Definitely will buy again</li>
            <li> Great buy, great price</li>
            <li> The white part you see on the bottle Is not the stuff you&#x27;re using, it plastic cover. What you have is very very small in quantity. The white-looking container is misleading</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve rebought this primer twice and I love it! Great price. I was a little hesitant first time buying it because Elf has a reputation of having cheap quality products but this primer is defiantly not one of them! After applying, my makeup lasts all day! I&#x27;ve tried expensive primers but this one is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I recommend it for everyone to at least try.</li>
            <li> feels amazing as I&#x27;ve been newly using this for a week now. love the way it grabs my bronzers. this product leaves such a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> I have big pores and this seems to help cover them. The feel is silky and it feels nice on the skin. Dometimes i use it alone or under makeup :) love it</li>
            <li> This product is ok, goes on easy, lasts a good chunk of time. However I hate the pump. It squirts out everywhere! I put my whole hand over the nozzle when i go to use it, otherwise it gets on my wall!</li>
            <li> I love this primer and for the price of it, I love it more haha. It doesn&#x27;t feel like a $6 primer. It&#x27;s very good on my extremely sensitive face and one dot on your finger can spread a lot. Only downfall is that the bottle has a big hole in the middle of the bottle so it literally takes up so much space which ends up leaving you small amounts of the product :/ but overall it&#x27;s a great product for the price and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> LOVE this primer. I only sporadically used a primer before and decided to try one again and this stuff is great. It evens out my skin tone/makeup and gives a nice look when I&#x27;m all done. I apply the primer, dry my hair, then apply the foundation. I read a few review that recommended time for the primer to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; and this seems to work for me. I will continue to use the product!</li>
            <li> I never use this brand before, I want to change my primer, so , seeing this affordable price, then I feel like there is no harm to try it. After I received this one,  I see the quantity is small, that I don’t like much. But after I apply this primer, it blends really well, my face feels so smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More importantly, this primer can stay long time, at least from 8am to 5pm.  I really happy that that primer can makes my skin looks smooth and silky all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this price, it really is a worth trying product. I am glad that I tried this one.</li>
            <li> Came broken and with almost nothing inside</li>
            <li> now my foundation doesnt look flacky anymore!! it is very easy to distribute in the face and the feeling of smoothness is incredible!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Provdes excellent base for your makeup. Silky smooth.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst primers I have ever used ! It&#x27;s so greasy, it really isn&#x27;t meant for oily skins.When I apply it, I feel like I&#x27;m greasing my entire  face. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone with oily skin.</li>
            <li> I never used a face primer before.  This one is really working for me and helped my make-up stay longer.  I definitely plan to continue using it.</li>
            <li> Goes on silky smooth without having to use a ton of product ... makes foundation glide on and stay on.. without settling into fine lines. My oily skin isn&#x27;t aggrivated or made super greasy,  which is a major plus. I use it as an eyeshadow primer too.. really glides on nice and sticks. I love it, and the price is just right!</li>
            <li> Let me first say I purchased this at Target so I didn&#x27;t have to wait after reading reviews. I have tried multiple low-end to high-dollar face primers. I have horrible skin. Oily, old, acne prone,tanning. Due to all of these factors that impact the longevity of makeup wear, it has become increasingly difficult to find a primer that is worthy. I have literally spent 100&#x27;s of dollars trying various products.....needless to say, I wish I would have found this sooner. Using this over your moisturizer and then followed up by the e.l.f. makeup setting spray is almost magical. (It most likely is purely magical for those with skin not nearly as problematic as mine.) I have tested this out for a week before deciding to review this. Did I still touch up with my pressed powder, YES, but the necessity was not there, I feel I almost did it out of habit. With really crappy skin you could touch up once-twice during a very long day. My makeup routine, due to all of my personal issues is somewhat time consuming and particular, I really love that this still allows my makeup to look fresh after very long days.(approximately 17 hours) I am literally only disappointed that I did not find this sooner.</li>
            <li> which is what I have.  If you use too much of this silicone based primer you&#x27;ll have an oil slick on your hands.  Oily/combo skin may be okay with this.  For me it just kind of sat on top of my face  and didn&#x27;t create the smooth canvas for make-up I was looking for.  e.l.f. has some great products, they&#x27;ve just released a hydrating and oily skin primer.  This was eh.</li>
            <li> I usually use L&#x27;Oreal, Studio Secrets Professional Magic Perfecting Base Primer which comes in a very small container (0.5 ounces). I decided to try this brand because I like the pump container it comes in. With the L&#x27;Oreal product, it&#x27;s a small  &amp;#34;pot&amp;#34; container and you use your fingertip to dip it out. I think the pump containers just seem more hygienic to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked this okay on the first use so I used it again the next day and by that evening, my cheeks had broken out despite the fact that I took my makeup off the night before completely. Also a friend pointed out to me that although the pump container seems better, the fact is that you cannot get all the product out like you can with the potted container and I think the potted container holds more as well so though it&#x27;s a bit more expensive, it&#x27;s worth it to me because it doesn&#x27;t break my face out like the e.l.f. and I get to use the entire container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thing: my friend let me try both these product on her. I used the L&#x27;Oreal on one cheek and the e.l.f. on the other and we went out shopping. A few hours later we both noticed that the cheek with the e.l.f. product on it (under her foundation) was noticeably shinier than the L&#x27;Oreal side. Since we both have oily skin, I think the L&#x27;Oreal product is the better choice.</li>
            <li> This primer is pretty good, it helps fill in my smile wrinkles so that when I apply makeup it isn&#x27;t as visible but Target sells it for 3-5 dollars... same brand just look for it there before you come here.</li>
            <li> I bought this to cover a scar on my nose that hasn&#x27;t healed 100% and it worked well.  The ONLY small thing that made it a 4 star is it flaked at the end of the day.  But for the price I&#x27;ll use it and reapply when it gets to that!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for primer. I was skeptical because it is so super cheap but this is the only thing I use now. I have bought it for my family and friends to try too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a great texture of silicon and goes on sooooo incredibly smooth. I notice the difference when I don&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downsides are that it doesn&#x27;t have SPF protection and doesn&#x27;t really have much moisturizing qualities.</li>
            <li> It is clear and goes on perfect. My face looks so smooth!&lt;br /&gt;I liked this product so much i spent 50$ on more e.l.f. products. &amp;lt;3 This is a must try product. I will never use anything else for primer.</li>
            <li> This appears to be identical to the much more expensive brand I used to buy.  My daughter and I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this e.l.f. make up primer!  I have never used a product like this before and for a first time user I&#x27;m very satisfied.  The primer is super light weight and goes on clear.  I saw reviews of people saying this product makes your face greasy but I completely disagree (and I have oily skin).  My make up lasted for the entire day when it usually fades and sweats off.  I thought it was a good deal!</li>
            <li> This ELF primer smells great and only takes a little bit to get the coverage you need. I use it under my makeup when going out and it totally polishes off my look and makes all the difference! I get so many compliments on my makeup the days I use this primer and I can&#x27;t believe how good it works for $6</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used any other kind of face primer, so I am not sure how it is on a scale, but I like it. It doesn&#x27;t do that much though. It makes my skin feel smoother, and it does make me look more vibrant. It&#x27;s clear, so it goes with anyone&#x27;s skin tone. I wear it everyday, and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it, I have used it for a few months. So I would get it, unless you are looking for something to make a more dramatic change, because this is very, very, very, subtle.</li>
            <li> This seems to fill in my pores and really makes my skin feel smooth. It was pretty cheap and definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li> The goods which do not have a smell at gell transparent at this price, either are seldom seen in Japan! There is work which can be extended to the whole face and is perfectly made smooth in slight quantity!</li>
            <li> Honestly one of the primers I have ever used stays on keeps make up does wonders .I&#x27;d highly recommend this primer to anyone looking :)</li>
            <li> Just like the title says I LOVE THIS PRIMER!! I makes my face feel silky when I put it on. It makes me want to keep rubbing my face it is so smooth. Lol my friends have said the exact same thing. I have also noticed that my makeup will last me all day now! Yay for this mineral infused primer! Thank you e.l.f keep it up!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this based off a &amp;#34;Splurge vs Save&amp;#34; magazine review. My concealer stays on so much better than before!</li>
            <li> It came fast! I was a little surprised at how small it is but other than that, it does the job and makes my face smooth and canvas like for makeup</li>
            <li> keeps your makeup in place all day and takes away shine</li>
            <li> this stuff makes my face peel. It&#x27;s not a good product. I bought it, but wont buy it again. I put it on, let it dry a little bit then put my make up on. And it just made my concealer peel and not stay on.</li>
            <li> While this is not the absolute BEST primer, it is pretty good and the price is right.  I will probably go back to my more expensive/higher quality brand but keep this on hand for days that I will not need as good of coverage ie. just shopping or running errands, but for important nights out I will be going for the good stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this primer omg I would recomind it and it goes on so smooth and makes foundation smooth and flawless</li>
            <li> I used this primer evening, and I was so tired to clean my face , so I slept and when I woke up I found my face full of softness, now  this product is my favorite I&#x27;m using it daily even morning I&#x27;m mixing it with tiny little with my sunblock.</li>
            <li> i love elf products, the eye shadows are the best but this i just used and it made me feel like my face was oily.</li>
            <li> Made my face appear super smooth and my foundation was much more even! my make up stayed on all day!</li>
            <li> This works pretty well as a basic primer. I feel like the formula has changed, though, because the latest one I&#x27;ve used feels thicker and takes a bit more time to rub in. I preferred the lighter feeling primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE that it doesn&#x27;t break me out. I don&#x27;t love how quickly I go through it, and how little you&#x27;re actually getting vs how large the container appears.</li>
            <li> The trick to this product is not to dilly dally. A dab will do you, but put in your foundation immediately afterward because it does soak into the skin (in a good way). If you wait to put on foundation, the primer may have already gone into your skin and thus making it slightly more difficult to apply the rest of your makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love this product. It makes my foundation last longer, makes my face feel good, and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily. Highly recommended. I&#x27;m buying more right now.</li>
            <li> We love E.L.F. and started using it mainly because of the price and on the recommendation of a friend.  My daughter has gone through no less than probably 12 of these and continues to use it.  She loves this and the eye lash primer and the eye shadow primer.</li>
            <li> i think it works great.</li>
            <li> I do love this product, it is smooth silky and light and works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT!!!! Make sure you know how much you&#x27;re buying as the size of the container compared to how much is actually inside is very misleading. The clearish outer part comes off and inside is another white cylinder. That cylinder is mostly empty, and there is barely anything in there, I don&#x27;t know why they even bothered honestly. I have uploaded an image to show this. I would rather pay a little bit more to have the container actually filled up.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, works as expected. Purchased because I wanted to try primer for the first time.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it&#x27;s a steal for the price.</li>
            <li> Goes on light and makes my face extremely smooth. goes on Clear, and dosent have that weird smell that other primers have.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the brands that charge way more! I will buy it again! It is silky and wears well!</li>
            <li> as a primer this works ok, but i found it to be a bit sticky.</li>
            <li> My skin is dry &amp; sensitive, but this product leaves my skin feeling extremely hydrated &amp; super soft. For the price, it&#x27;s a great buy! My makeup definately lasts longer with this product, also tried the green elf mineral primer for redness, it diminished my redness but not fully. For $6, I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this! I will only use this since I left my HD Primer from Makeup Forever from Sephora, which I compare to and to me they look, feel and cover the exact same! just way more affordable!</li>
            <li> I like the primer. It goes on smooth, hasn&#x27;t broken out my skin(I have sensitive skin) and I feel like I get my money&#x27;s worth out of it so far. I have been using the product for over three months &amp; it great. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the primer is the chalky texture. It doesn&#x27;t seem to have a impact on how it goes on my face though. I love the fact that its clear &amp; goes on like body lotion, so it blends well. I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time, and packaged well.  The container appears to be full and unused. The product applies well, seems to even out skin, and not add any shine. The primer is nice and silky, and a little bit goes along way. I&#x27;ve been using a more expensive primer (Lancome) and I already like the Elf Primer better. My makeup applied much smoother with the Elf Primer! Its been several hours since I applied my makeup and it still looks great. I will recommend this product to all my friends who wear makeup. If I could change one thing about this primer it would be the container that it comes in. Its hard to tell how much is inside, and it takes up a little to much room in my make up bag. Other wise I love it</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the product itself. My make up looks so much better on my face and it does stay on a lot longer than without it so that&#x27;s good and I got the package a day early I believe and that&#x27;s great!... BUT I unscrewed the top to look inside as soon as I opened the package and the tube to the pump was snapped in half. I have no Idea how that could&#x27;ve happened but it did. I&#x27;ve searched how to send the seller a private message to let them know but I think sine it was shipped from &#x27;amazon&#x27; itself it won&#x27;t let me. I guess I&#x27;ll get the product out with a tooth pick or something, it&#x27;s just an inconvenience. If it wasn&#x27;t for the pump being broken I&#x27;d give it 5 stars because like I said this is a great product just screwed up packaging. I will definitely order it again despite the fact though.</li>
            <li> it feels greasy...make up slides off during the day....I will try it with a different make up to see the outcome</li>
            <li> This stuff feels so pleasant going on and makes your skin feel so silky!  I would wear it even if I wasn&#x27;t wearing makeup.  I am on some very strong prescription acne drugs, so my face gets very dry.  I have to use moisturizer constantly, and I still get a lot of creases in my makeup where the fine lines are dry.  The worst part is that covering acne spots and scars is almost impossible.  If I use concealer, it just dries out and looks caked and clumpy. I can&#x27;t wear lipstick at all, only Aquaphor.  This stuff really seems to help smooth out my skin so I don&#x27;t have these issues.  I still need my moisturizer, but this works with it to keep my makeup looking great! The bottle is tiny, but you don&#x27;t need to use a lot.  For the price, it&#x27;s still a steal.</li>
            <li> very drying, but does its job</li>
            <li> This primer feels great going on.  I don&#x27;t think it helps to keep the oil down, but as an initial primer, it feels nice to apply.</li>
            <li> I love it, it just seems a bit too greasy. I&#x27;m okay with it but some people may not be.</li>
            <li> I love this face primer it&#x27;s better than all others I used in the past, for me it&#x27;s a keeper!!!!&lt;br /&gt;  Jackie Watson</li>
            <li> This stuff makes your face feel like satin REALLY I love it. I use use it before I apply my makeup and it sets like butter and stays on all day. 2 thumbs up!</li>
            <li> It works as expected but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s my favorite of this type of product.  It is hard to go back to just applying makeup without a primer once you start using one.  The price was good.</li>
            <li> Amazing most smoothest serum... Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Perfect primer its reallly silky to the skin and keeps my makeup look natural and even. I really like this one but the bottle is alittle small</li>
            <li> I BROUGHT THIS FOR A PHOTO SHOOT AND THIS WORKED PERFECT. I WILL BUY AGAIN. GREAT PRODUCT. THANK YOU SO MUCH.</li>
            <li> This primer is okay, its not the best or worst.&lt;br /&gt;It does deliver a smooth surface for applying foundation..&lt;br /&gt;The con is the product is a bit to thin for my taste.&lt;br /&gt;But, its great for cosmetic beginners.</li>
            <li> A little smaller than i expected but very reasonable for the price. Gave me the flawless but natural look i was looking for(: thank you. New fav. Will buy again and recommend</li>
            <li> This product go on easily and is not sticky. it doesn&#x27;t take much. Make-up seems to stay on longer. So, I like this product.&lt;br /&gt;Jewell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used expensive primers and this one seems to work just as well for a fraction of the cost.  Have bought several times and will continue to use and recommend.  UPDATE:  I still like this primer, but literally EVERY SINGLE TIME the pump breaks and I end up scraping primer out of the jar with the tube of the pump.  I know it&#x27;s cheap, but I waste at least 1/4 of the jar every time.  :/</li>
            <li> I like this primer, It feels good on my skin  considering that I have sensitive skin. I use is on top of a moisturizing cream because I have combined type of skin and then apply foundation. I have not used other primers but think that it is a good purchase for this price.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this product on the first try! It left my face smooth and foundation stay put the whole day. I loved how even though it was hot outside, my face didn&#x27;t sweat much and didn&#x27;t get oily</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what a primer does but let me say, I felt like some sort  of magic was going on when I used this product. While rubbing it on, it felt like I was rubbing oil on my face, yet, there was no oil. My hand and face was so smooth to the touch. I like.</li>
            <li> I loved the product after I finally got some out! There was no straw or tube in it to make it go into the dispensing head, so I just took it off and have to beat it until it comes out or use a qtip.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product in the color clear in mid-September of 2013 for the upcoming school year. It&#x27;s the first of December and I just finished my first bottle of the Mineral Infused Face Primer after using it daily for the past months. I&#x27;m a high school student who wears makeup to school daily and this product is perfect for keeping your foundation and face makeup on for hours. My foundation routine originally did not include face primers, but over time, I noticed that my face makeup would start to rub off after about three hours. It really bugged me because I&#x27;m not the kind of girl who likes to carry around my foundation, powder, and blush to school just so I can re-apply them in the bathroom. I decided to order this primer, and boy am I glad I did. I noticed a HUGE improvement in the amount of time that my makeup would last. I did not have to carry around foundation, powder, concealer, etc. because my makeup would last all day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure that when you apply the primer you have a completely washed face. After that, just take the primer and press the knob down once. It dispenses the perfect amount of primer for your whole face. This is definitely something you don&#x27;t need to apply generously because it spreads itself out (A little goes a long way). I wanted to order the clear primer because this was intended to be applied before foundation, and I didn&#x27;t do anything but prime my face perfectly. It looks like very liquidy goo, but once it touches your skin and you blend it out, it feels mineral-like. I know it sounds strange, but it almost made my face feel like a canvas, ready to soak up the makeup!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re anything like me and you want your foundation and powder to stay on your face for over 5 hours, then this is the perfect product for you! I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this product, and I&#x27;m positive I will order it again!</li>
            <li> this product is amazing, my make up lasted all day, and my face was very smooth.. you can wear it alone or with makeup any kind of foundation/blush/bronzer and it will stay on your face!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because it was so cheap compared to every thing else out there.  But I will definable buy again.</li>
            <li> The container is fairly small, but for the price, I don&#x27;t mind buying a couple at a time - it&#x27;s still cheaper than 1 bottle of a top of the line face primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the texture. It&#x27;s not liquidy like SmashBox. It&#x27;s more of a thick, silky cream. It keeps my foundation on all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I would definitely purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> The e.l.f. studio mineral infused face primer is such a nice primer, leaves your face feeling really really soft and make up (liquid foundation) applies sooo smoothly!&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing about it is how little product comes in the bottle, less than half ounce (0.49 ounce) doesn’t last very long.</li>
            <li> Sure, it&#x27;s on the cheap end as far as cosmetics go but I really like this stuff. I&#x27;ve tried others but I find this one to be silky smooth &amp; easy to apply. I recommend it, it&#x27;s worth a try &amp; you might like it too.</li>
            <li> I love this primer!!!!! It&#x27;s better than the more expensive ones that I&#x27;ve tried. It makes my skin look like porcelain under my makeup. I have to order online because the local stores are always sold out!</li>
            <li> This product does provide a good base towards the start of your makeup base. It’s made out of a silicone blend. It gives you a base filling for the open pores and a slippery texture to the skin&#x27;s surface, helping you with a easier makeup application. You get a smoother finish and don&#x27;t have to use as much product. It also helps out to bring out the colors of other beauty products you use simultaneously (eye shadows, eyebrow products, lipstick etc). It hasn&#x27;t caused me to break out, and it is moisturizing. The price on Amazon is comparable to other retail stores. I do not use this on a daily basis so I would say this would last me at least a good 6 months if not more.</li>
            <li> this primer is comparable to bare minerals&#x27; prime time in consistency and texture, but at a much more affordable price. it is very smoothing without being overbearingly greasy, in my opinion. i adore it.</li>
            <li> The perfect primer that keeps your makeup all in one place. I even use it under my BB cream and it keeps that still also. Its affordable and works the same as any high end product.</li>
            <li> Love this primer goes on smooth an does what it says! Only tried it with liquid foundation thus far hope it works well with the cream to powder</li>
            <li> good price for great product&lt;br /&gt;on time&lt;br /&gt;good packing&lt;br /&gt;will order more&lt;br /&gt;good for beginner MUA&lt;br /&gt;Amazing. easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;stay long</li>
            <li> Same price as Target so you might as well go there, but it&#x27;s a great product either way. Makes your skin feel amazing and helps keep your makeup flawless all day! E.L.F makes great products all around, and they are always at a great price. I recommend to all my friends. A must have for anyone who enjoys using makeup!</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday and it keeps my makeup long lasting and very smooth. Great value for the effect!</li>
            <li> When i got this I realized that it had leaked while it was being shipped. The bottle was all slimy and i only got two uses out of it. So disappointed! I do not recommend having it shipped to your home.</li>
            <li> Very smooth.. Love it.</li>
            <li> Works great. Makes my makeup look smoother. :) Also makes my skin feel soft!</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, but more on the oily side. My skin is very sensitive as well meaning that most products that I put on my face will break me out. Not this. This stuff leaves my skin so soft and smooth, and my makeup goes on with a flawless finish. I love it!</li>
            <li> I USED to use a very similar primer from a well-known high end cosmetics company for several times more!  Not any longer. I absolutely love this primer!! Actually like it a lot more than the $$$ one. Just one pump does my whole face. It goes on like silk &amp; feels so so good on my face. Makeup goes on so much better - smoother. Lessens appearance of fine lines &amp; skin stays softer &amp; moisturized much longer. Ideal if you like powder mineral foundation - it goes on evenly &amp; stays on longer. Don&#x27;t need to use as much foundation even. Did I tell you I LOVE this stuff?  So does my friends who&#x27;ve tried it too. Won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best product I have EVER purchased, with no exaggeration! Ihave never been one who was willing to go outside with no makeup on.HOWEVER, this primer gives me such confidence that it is not uncommon for me to do so anymore. It smoothes my lines, makes my pores DISSAPPEAR, and believe me, that&#x27;s a tall order, as well as leaving my skin with a beautiful velvet like feel. Stop paying these big name big brands when you get BETTER results with elf.I promise you will not be dissappointed# please don&#x27;t stop making this product its been a true blessing to me!</li>
            <li> This made me skin break out horribly and feel greasy. I would definitely not repurchase. You can get much better primers for a similar price.</li>
            <li> Like all the other reviews say, great product, just not very much of it in one container.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really tell a difference with or without using it.</li>
            <li> Great product, This is a high-end primer with a price that can&#x27;t be beat! I&#x27;ve used many primers that claim to be &amp;#34;high-end&amp;#34; but really just have a high price.  Works great for diminishing the appearance of pores, very soft and smooth and does a great job keeping your makeup looking flawless all day! I tend to have oily skin and this is the perfect cure! I&#x27;ve seen some people complain about the amount of actual product in the bottle, but I think they may just be using too much of it.  I apply very little, let it dry completely, and it will lasts until I wash everything off before bed. Overall, a Great product.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Just as described.</li>
            <li> i love it, it works so good</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not for the oily skin.</li>
            <li> This may just be me, but I had poor experience with this primer. When I first apply it, it feels like heaven - super creamy, satiny, soft, excellent coverage, so a little goes a long way. But it crumbles up after I apply foundation and looks disgusting, and I got a bad skin infection on my left cheek after using it a couple of times, so it appeared to have clogged my pores heavily as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To give it a fair shake, I applied it several times with different methods -- with and without moisturizer, immediately after applying moisturizer, waiting several minutes for moisturizer to dry and THEN applying it, and I tried it with two different foundations (Loreal TruMatch and Covergirl) - but it always dried and beaded up, especially in the folds around my nose and on my cheeks. Looked awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I would not recommend, but it may just be my skin type and the other products I use, so... Good luck!</li>
            <li> I am somewhat new to the make up world and decided to give this product a try since I had been hearing so much about why using a primer is important. I really like how smooth this product goes on and it does indeed feel like silk. Using this product, my make up looks last so much longer than they use to. I even have noticed that the make up doesn&#x27;t slip from my face as much as it use to.</li>
            <li> My skin become so soft after the application, it&#x27;s incrdible. It does the job. I bought more for my girls. I recommand this product!</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and this just seemed to make my foundation melt right off my face and leaves my skin looking splotchy and greasy.  I think this texture would be great for anyone with dry or normal skin as it is very silky when you first out it on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a primer before this one. It was okay, I guess. It&#x27;s a clear gel and it made my skin feel very soft and almost slippery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t wear foundation very often because I have trouble with it caking up (my skin is very dry but acne prone) and I bought this hoping it would help give me that flawless finish. Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference. A tiny improvement, if that. I do have troublesome skin, however, so maybe it&#x27;s just me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be repurchasing this primer.</li>
            <li> It actually makes my makeup smear more than without it. I really don&#x27;t recommend this product. It seems to do exactly the opposite of what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> This face primer is like silk! I never thought I needed a primer.  I always thought primers were a waist of money.  I believed moisturizer was primer enough.  Well, this is a great product.  It feels great on my skin, and I find that I do not use as much makeup as I use without the primer.  I love this.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my daughter as a stocking stuffer for Christmas. Great price, speedy delivery. I&#x27;ll write another review after I get feedback as how she likes it&#x27;s preformance.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice primer, and does the job. But it is so hard to remove, it takes 4 wash&#x27;s on my hands to fully remove it. I tried make up only and came to conclusion, it is the primer. Washing my face after scrubbing with a chemical remover is still difficult, since I need to apply acne lotion to the skin this makes it bothersome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in all, if you can get past these flaws, go for it.</li>
            <li> I did not use primers before, so when I first applied this one, I became a little bit scared. My skin is very oily by itself, and the primer made my skin surface even greasier. But after a couple of seconds, everything became ok - my skin appeared to be smooth, non-fatty and ready for foundation.&lt;br /&gt;The foundation (I use a liquid one) looks a little bit better when it is applied over primer, than when it is applied on skin right after moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to 20-somethings with oily skin, however I am not sure if this product would suit someone over 30 or with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Similar to the smashbox oil-free primer&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t really do much for my skin besides made it feel slippery/silicone&lt;br /&gt;Did not fill in my pores! After 2 hours it actually made my foundation break up and look cakey.&lt;br /&gt;I would not repurchess this product.</li>
            <li> Have used this product a few times.  It leaves the skin  smooth.  Makeup goes on evenly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this face primer.</li>
            <li> I used to wear Elizabeth Ardens Primer, then I found this. Love it! Seems like the same product, but $20 cheaper. Sorry Arden.</li>
            <li> It feels greasy, I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> Best primer I&#x27;ve used and liked so far</li>
            <li> My first time using a primer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;Feels great going on (like satin!)&lt;br /&gt;Makeup last much longer compared to when I wasn&#x27;t using one&lt;br /&gt;Keeps my oiliness at bay pretty well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;Small amount of product (but I don&#x27;t wear makeup everyday so this isn&#x27;t so bad)</li>
            <li> Your face will feel like porcelain, its great!</li>
            <li> This is a very silky primer, I&#x27;ve never tried an e.l.f. product before and was pleased by the quality of this one. My only complaint is that even though a little does go a long way, there isn&#x27;t as much in the bottle as expected.</li>
            <li> Just received  the primer first day of use and this is a miracle in a bottle small bottle but it is worth the money</li>
            <li> Fill pores nicely for most of the day. Non-irritating on my sensitive skin. Doesn&#x27;t improve the overall look of my skin that much, but makeup does last better.</li>
            <li> I already have really smooth skin to begin with. I can feel a slight different when I put this stuff in but I don&#x27;t see why I need it. The moisturizer I use does just as good as a job as this. (St Ive Timeless Skin). I use that, add alittle of lotion (non scented, high moisturizing) to my foundation then the Elf Setting Spray and I&#x27;m good. My foundation goes on smooth, I look natural, no fine lines and my makeup stays on all day. Maybe this is for people with blemishes or acne scars. It is a good primer, don&#x27;t get me wrong but I don&#x27;t think I need it. :) It gets the job done though and is affordable. You don&#x27;t need to spend a bunch of money to get food products. Buy this!</li>
            <li> Good product for the price. I don&#x27;t often wear makeup, so I wanted something that worked well but wouldn&#x27;t hurt my budget. This was perfect.</li>
            <li> Works well. Makes my makeup almost flawless. Covers pores and helps with oil. One thing i didn&#x27;t like is the bottles bigger than what you get.. Theres a small thing in the bottle where you actual product is. Thought you don&#x27;t need a lot, so I guess it works.</li>
            <li> This primer is one of my favorites!</li>
            <li> I have been using Primer for months and tried many.  Elf has the best primer for the price and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is light as a feather on my face. Without causing any irritaion it softly &amp;#34;fills in&amp;#34; the fine lines and wrinkles leaving a smooth surface to apply my foundation. The difference is remarkable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better primers - but they were much more expensive.  This one is good if you want &amp;#34;just a primer&amp;#34; - not something tinted.  It had worked well with both my moisturizer and my mineral makeup.  Goes on smoothly and definitely helps the mineral foundation not collect in fine lines.</li>
            <li> I literally used up this product so good &amp; def. didn&#x27;t expect it to be as good but it was &amp; I&#x27;ll def. buy this product again &amp; again &amp; again</li>
            <li> Great dupe for Smashbox photofinish primer</li>
            <li> You can use and skip concealer and go with just a little powder this had become a part of my regimen love it truly recommend and I have sensitive skin and no outbreak YEAH!!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell if it works . I feel it go on and seems to add film over face but make up still comes off after long day .</li>
            <li> I use to purchase this about a year ago and it was great for my skin in keeping the shine down.  I just started back using it and didn&#x27;t realize how much I missed it.  I don&#x27;t shine as much and it feels great when applying to my face.  My makeup last longer too.  When you run out, it&#x27;s still a lot left inside.  Use something like a staw, makeup pencil, etc to get it out.  You will be surprised at what&#x27;s left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product at this great price.</li>
            <li> Feels nice to me and it works so no complaints</li>
            <li> This stuff is great !! Makes my skin smooth and pore free before I apply my foundation. It&#x27;s light weight and gentle on skin. It give you a glowing look. Def recommend</li>
            <li> One of the best primers I have ever used. Have introduced it to all my clients as well as on my blog.</li>
            <li> This primer is great!  It is silicone based and goes on so silky. I let it dry for a minute then apply everything else. It has a very light scent but I did not find it troublesome.</li>
            <li> I thought this would help me with not getting oily. I still get oily. I could be using this for the wrong purpose</li>
            <li> WOW, great face primer, made my face feel silky smooth. Also cant beat the price, ive used bare esscentuals that cost over $20 and this stuff works just as good! If your on the fence try it youll love it.</li>
            <li> I have compared this to at least five other products including one for over thirty dollars and with the cheapest being twelve dollars. I have found this product to be equal to or surpassed the others in performance and you can certainly not beat the price.</li>
            <li> I love this primer! It is very reminiscent of the smash box primer. I highly recommend this if you&#x27;re on a budget.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a face primer before, so I can&#x27;t compare this to professional makeup primer. I looooove it though.  It makes the difference between foundation lasting 2 hours before my face gets greasy or, literally, ALL day, no grease.  I&#x27;m not sure how good it is for your skin.  It says it has minerals and stuff.  I did notice my skin peeled a little bit a couple of days after I used it the first time.  I have very sensitive skin, though.  I don&#x27;t use this every day, only on special occasions.</li>
            <li> Love it woo woo woooo helps my foundation look nice and stays on longer then before  almost gone need a refill</li>
            <li> This works just as well as smasbox primers, for a fraction of the price AND a generously sized bottle. I like a lot of ELF products and they are so cheap its almost no -risk to try.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. I only wear a loose mineral powder foundation to work, and it would normally wear off by 10 am, but now it lasts all day with just 1.5 pumps total for my entire face. Full foundation and powder lasts 18 hours with this, even with oily skin that likes to sweat everything off. I really do love the product. On the other, its pump is absolutely awful. I even took the encasing off and pushed the inner bottom up (it is movable like a syringe bottom) and it didn&#x27;t help despite having no air space in the inside now. Be prepared to flip it upside down (with the lid on) and smack the *&amp;^% out of it against your palm before every single pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this for $3 here on amazon - it is $6 at my local target and between prime and never making small orders, I get free shipping so it&#x27;s better for me to get it from here, especially since I never buy enough makeup at one time to get the free shipping from the e.l.f. website. I will give it one more try after I am done with this bottle, hopefully I just got an oddball pump that is wacky.</li>
            <li> one of my favorite drugstore primer.</li>
            <li> Love it! I&#x27;ve only purchased two primers in my life -- this one and Smashbox, and I can say that this one gives Smashbox a run for its money for only pennies on the dollar. It&#x27;s essentially the same product. I have a habit of resting my hands on my face and scratching my nose all the time and wiping sweat from my forehead and upper lip, so it&#x27;s hard for my makeup to stay ON MY FACE and not on my sleeve or on a Kleenex. Primers can get waaaaaaay too expensive for someone that needs it like I need it, but I gave this one a chane recently, applied it first on a clean face, then put on my favorite foundation, then topped it off with a makeup setting spray (my usual routine) and I&#x27;m good to go for the whole day. LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> nice texture and my makeup goes on easily and flawlessly</li>
            <li> I like it over all, leaves a smooth finish so applying my make up over it is easy, I do end up having to use more than I expected of it. Fantastic product for the price. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so nice and it makes ur face so soft I love it</li>
            <li> One pump and ur ready...it literally covers ur whole face with one pump...leaves a smooth matte canvas to apply ur makeup...</li>
            <li> This is really quite a good primer, and it&#x27;s so cheap its unreal.  I use it daily under an HD foundation and it really does a good job of evening out fine lines.</li>
            <li> Soft, smooth and very lightweight.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I liked the product... until it ran out within a handful of uses.  I took the pump off only to discover that the size of the container is extremely deceiving - the white cylinder that you see is an empty outer shell, containing a very small second container of actual product, about a TENTH of the size of what I thought I was getting.  I would never buy this again because I felt so deceived by the packaging.  The pump could not even get all of the product out, so I missed out even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is $6 for half an ounce - Hard Candy Sheer Envy Illuminating Primer (Walmart) is $2 more for three times more product.  Plus, it is in a tube so you can cut the tube to get every bit of product.  I love other e.l.f. products but would never buy this one again.</li>
            <li> This gel primer is lightweight, and seems to work pretty decent at keeping the shine at bay, which my oily rosacea skin appreciates. It&#x27;s a little greasy on my fingers while putting it on but it melts right into my skin and it doesn&#x27;t even feel like I&#x27;m wearing anything.It&#x27;s a small amount that you get, so if you use it every day it won&#x27;t last long. However, at the price it&#x27;s easy to replace. I&#x27;ll be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Great and smooth coverage. Feels soft and equal to any other more expensive primers</li>
            <li> I like it. There&#x27;s a lightweight feel and it works well as a base for my makeup on the weekends. My face is oily and I can&#x27;t say that it totally controls the shine in humidity, but it helps.</li>
            <li> I never knew what a primer was until I started looking at make-up reviews on Amazon and saw where a lot of people were talking about using primer first. I then proceeded to research face primers and came across this one. It was inexpensive and had really good reviews. I decided to give it a try and I am so amazed! It smooths my face like I never knew something could. It is a must have! Apply on a clean face before applying any of your other makeup for best results!</li>
            <li> Btw this is at target for $3 don&#x27;t waste your money online. Great product though!</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: My make-up knowledge isn&#x27;t that extensive I&#x27;ve just recently found myself getting into it a little more.  The entire reason I sought to purchase a primer is because I have super oily skin.  An hour or two after applying foundation it would be running off my face and my entire T-zone would almost look like it was sweating.  This primer has really helped prolong the wear of my make up.  With the help of a little finishing powder i&#x27;m good to go from 8am to at least 4pm if not longer.  Some have complained about it being a small quantity but I used it pretty much everyday and ended up sharing it with my sister and it lasted about a 1 1/2 -2 months which I don&#x27;t consider that bad.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like this primer better than the $60 primer I got at Macys!! The price is awesome and so is the product. It makes my make up last all day and it&#x27;s so smooth!! I will never use anything else!</li>
            <li> If you do not want to spend 25.00+ on brand name primer, but want somewhat of the same result as a brand name primer.......buy this. I usually use this primer on my casual days. On the weekend, I wear the brand name primer. Smooth, silky, and effective.</li>
            <li> This stuff goes on so smooth and makes me face nice and soft and even for applying make up over it.  You don&#x27;t need to use a product like this every day, only when you are planning to use foundation and stuff.  For the price, it&#x27;s well worth it because it has the feel of a much more expensive product.</li>
            <li> I typically stay away from Elf products particularly because i feel like they are noticably sub-par and that they do not perform well or hold up as well as other brands. However, I ran out of primer and was looking for a new primer at a decent price. I decided to give Elf another shot because the price fit my budget but had planned to be dissapointed. I was pleasantly surprised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am new to using primer and the stuff i was using before (Revlon) was white and almost like lotion so i was a little put off when i saw that it was like a clear gel, i thought &amp;#34;okay its going to be like putting snot on my face...&amp;#34; but then i started to smooth it on and was happy to find that i was wrong! It spreads nicely, feels light and creates a great base for my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that i have to use a little more than i feel i should in order to cover my entire face but I&#x27;ll learn to deal :) I did notice that i had a new pimple on my cheeck a few hours later but it may be due to factors other than the new primer....i thought it was worth mentioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am happy with my purchase but i&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll be buying this stuff again. I may come back to it though after trying a few others because i do like the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I have fairly oily skin that is (even at 39) still inclined to breakouts now and then. I don&#x27;t feel this product made my pores look smaller, but I DO notice a much smoother finish overall. I also experience less shine and - in the end - less breakouts believe it or not! This has become a &amp;#34;MUST&amp;#34; in my daily routine!</li>
            <li> I gave this primer to my mom (as a gift with some other beauty things she wanted) and she said she really liked it! I&#x27;ll be ordering us BOTH more soon :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love it, but it&#x27;s not horrible neither. I guess I&#x27;m just use to using what I use normally, which I guess is a bit thicker and fills in any large pore/scar a bit better. Didn&#x27;t seem to break my face out any though!!! So huge plus plus for that one :)</li>
            <li> I have tried many different primers, and this one is the best I have tried. And the price is great too!</li>
            <li> Nice simple primer.  No shades to match and my foundation and powder flair.</li>
            <li> excellent very happy with the product really recommend it 100% excellent quality and 100% original brand really excellent very good product.</li>
            <li> It feels so lightweight but gives my skin a smoothness that makes makeup go on like a dream and stay put. It works well with my moisturizer and the Clinique pore minimizer I use on my nose. It&#x27;s a subtle thing, but it makes fine lines less apparent too. I love it.</li>
            <li> So, I was really excited when I ordered this. I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. The first day I got it, I applied it to my skin to see how it made it feel and it felt so silky. I applied with my right hand and used my clean left hand to make sure it really felt like that. It did! Even though I love the product, I don&#x27;t like the fact that I can&#x27;t see the product in the bottle so I don&#x27;t know how much product is in there. The first couple of times I used 1 pump but now I&#x27;m using a pump and a half to get the same amount of product. The product is fabulous and you don&#x27;t need a lot, I just wish I could monitor how much is left.</li>
            <li> After the seeing all the great reviews and price I decided to purchase this primer, and I&#x27;m so glad that I did. Everything about this product, the customer service, price, and delivery is 5 stars. This primer is very light, and it&#x27;s so soft and silky. I just adore the way my makeup stays on the entire day. I&#x27;m a security guard and I work 12 hour shifts occasionally and my make up lasts the entire shift. When I get up in the morning to wash my face, my makeup is still on! It&#x27;s so hard to find good quality in cost effective products. They say you get what you pay for, well that saying was wrong in this case. I got exactly what I paid for and so much more. All the people complaining about how much you get like really??? You will pay double or triple this for primer that&#x27;s store brought and it will be the same size. You don&#x27;t need a lot anyway. A little will take you a long way.</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s good, but I feel it doesn&#x27;t provide that much of a smooth foundation finish. Next time I rather spend a bit more and get something better.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Light and silky, you can barely feel it putting it on but leaves your skin so soft. I love e.l.f. products and this one definitley hasnt let me down.</li>
            <li> Primer is a bit greasy feeling.  Will not buy again.  Not sure it&#x27;s really doing anything when I put it on.</li>
            <li> Even better than the Sephora primer I&#x27;ve been using and at a fraction of the cost! Will definitely be buying this again.</li>
            <li> This primer gives a super flawless look to make up. Makeup sits and blends much better with this product. Will definitely be buying again!</li>
            <li> Got this based on a recommendation in a magazine. It is very light and does to feel heavy on my face at all. I have already recommended it to several people who are also pleased with the product. Inexpensive compared to other products out there.  Goes on clear.</li>
            <li> Tried two times and it kept my makeup looking great all night. Not a everyday wear because I don&#x27;t wear makeup everyday but good buy.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin but this goes on quite nicely and feels extra silky! It does not leave my skin feeling oily afterward however, for me, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Other reviews had mentioned how little was in the container. Yes, it is a small bottle, but I used 5 days a week for 2 months. I would say that was more than others stated. I&#x27;m not sure how much they were using, I was using about 1½ pumps per use. I was very impressed with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am no longer shiny a few hours into my day. At the end of a long day where I&#x27;m running around and sweating, my makeup stays in place and my face is fairly matte. I do not use any special matte products, I only use this primer, liquid foundation and a sheer loose powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This in my opinion is a great product. Since my first order, I have ordered more bottles, so I&#x27;m always stocked up.</li>
            <li> My favorite primer, and I have tried many (all price ranges)!  It is silky smooth without being oily.  It doesn&#x27;t cause me to breakout either.  I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> works great depending on your skin. i was using it at one time then stopped because it would make my face oily and my makeup wouldnt last. but my friend uses it so im guessing it works better for her. if your skin is oily i dont recommend it. but it is a good product.</li>
            <li> I WANT ONE MORE...I USED IT EVERYDAY...MAKES THE FOUNDATION STAY ON AND GO ON PERFECTLY</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kicking myself for never having used primer before this. I have nothing to compare it to, but I noticed a marked difference between how my makeup went on, blended &amp; wore throughout the day when using the elf primer underneath. It&#x27;s a small bottle but you don&#x27;t need to use much at all, and it&#x27;s very inexpensive compared to other brands. Overall I&#x27;m quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> Not exactly the best. Feels really oily. It reminds me of dried up fat but, slapped onto my face.</li>
            <li> Makes face a nice smooth canvas just be careful not to use too much</li>
            <li> Love this Primer.  Smooth and weightless</li>
            <li> I agree wth most of the other reviewers, this product is amazing. It&#x27;s buttery smooth and quite matte. However, this is also the first primer I&#x27;ve ever used, so I don&#x27;t have a lot to compare it to, but at the price, it seems to be the most affordable one on the market.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Works terrifically, minimizes shine and feels fantastic&lt;br /&gt;- Price is decently affordable, at least compared to all other brands&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- very little of the actual product. As others have stated, it&#x27;s honestly quite misleading. E.L.F, please change the packaging! (But keep the pump--it&#x27;s quite sanitary)&lt;br /&gt;- The smell-- the reviews I&#x27;ve read do not mention this, but this primer has an awful smell. It&#x27;s very similar to rubber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s quite a great product I have integrated into my makeup routine. I purchase it at Target.</li>
            <li> This primer seemed heavy to me.  At the end of the day I couldn&#x27;t wait until I could take it off. It seemed like I had a mask on my face. I quit using it after a couple of times and ended up buying Estée Lauder primer which I love !</li>
            <li> Retextures my skin!  I love the smooth way my foundation hoes on and looks so flawless!  Priced just right, love it!</li>
            <li> Great product but so little in bottle</li>
            <li> I love the product, but the bottle was too small, and I don&#x27;t see a more cost effective way of purchasing the product</li>
            <li> I really like this face primer. It&#x27;s a little thicker, almost gel like, and goes on so smooth. I like how it gives a nice finish after makeup is on.</li>
            <li> feels good going on - does what it is supposed to do - makes my face look smoother under makeup</li>
            <li> great stuff --so smooth under foundation!!</li>
            <li> Before I begin the review, I want to say that I&#x27;ve never used high end make up, so take that into consideration!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used primer before, and honestly I didnt even know what it&#x27;s for. I bought it on a whim since its such an affordable price. It was delivered ahead of schedule, and the next morning I used it before applying my makeup. It was a HUGE difference from using no primer. Unfortunately I ran out really quickly and I had no idea when I was going to be out of it due to the way its packaged (hence the 4 stars). I went out one day and couldnt find it at target, so I bought a substitute primer from another product, and it did not work as well.&lt;br /&gt;This one leaves a flawless finish. I have bought three more of these since and recommend it to anyone that likes drug store make up!</li>
            <li> Horrible product.&lt;br /&gt;It does absolutely nothing for my face.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, might as well just not buy it, because you&#x27;re not missing anything.</li>
            <li> Got this for my mom back in 2014. Buy her only this type now. She loves it. Says her eye brows finally stay on her forehead.</li>
            <li> I&#x60;m Pro make up artist and I have never seen silicone based primer witch doesn&#x60;t crease. I&#x60;ve just receved it I&#x60;m exited.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> There are a few different Elf mineral infused primers on here. I bought the .49 $6 add on primer. I love it!! It&#x27;s small and I use it every day, so I ran out fast (about 2-3 weeks). I&#x27;ve never used primer before. I decided to buy a primer because I&#x27;m getting into my 30s now and after kids, my skin is not even toned anymore and it&#x27;s dull and dry. I also bought the elf foundation that was recommend and a foundation brush. Let me tell you firsthand, I have seriously upgraded in the world of cosmetics and it was cheap!!! I think $6 for primer, $6 for foundation, and $8 for the brush. The primer is clear and smells like nothing. It feels like jelly going on my face. But it fills in my wrinkles, my pores, makes my super dry skin very moist, and makes my makeup glide on evenly!! I used to use a sponge applicator. But when I watched YouTube makeup tutorials, they all used a foundation brush. Now I see why. The brush really does distribute the foundation evenly. I like the elf studio foundation. It is pretty lightweight but still enough coverage. The only issue I have now is powder. You can&#x27;t put powder on immediately after foundation because your face is still really moist from the primer. So I have to let my face dry forever and then lightly put on powder. If I don&#x27;t wait, then it looks awful. But it&#x27;s too shiny looking without powder. I came back to amazon to order more primer and saw the elf setting spray! I&#x27;m going to try that and hope it will set my makeup properly so I don&#x27;t have to worry.</li>
            <li> Love this primer.... especially for the price!!  I am going to order 3 more :))</li>
            <li> It feels so silky.  It gives my face a good base to apply makeup without makeup going in every pore and looking bad.</li>
            <li> Works well for being so cheap!</li>
            <li> I have found it to be just as effective as the expensive brands!</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, so this primer didn&#x27;t work the best for me. It definitely did make my makeup last longer though. This product would probably be better suited for someone with normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li> kinda sticky and cakey</li>
            <li> I love it this works like a charm and gives you a baby doll smooth finish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit of a makeup snob, so take that for what it&#x27;s worth. I thought this felt smooth when applying but it didn&#x27;t soak in at all, and made me have the most hellacious breakouts I&#x27;ve ever had. That&#x27;s hard to do considering I use Differin daily. But my pores were huge after a couple days of use and full of gunk. I had redness and zits all over. After a week or two of no makeup, I&#x27;m finally back to normal and will go back to Hourglass.</li>
            <li> Did not like! Dried out my skin and was overly greasy! Will not buy again in the future.</li>
            <li> I love to use this when I&#x27;m just running out of the door quick! I normaly use my lorac primer but seeing as how that&#x27;s quite expensive I dont like to waste it on a quick outing. This works and looks just as well! It just doesn&#x27;t last as long, I recommend using a setting spray if you plan on using this all day. So go ahead and buy it!</li>
            <li> Works good to fill in pores and lasted me a long time!</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and makeup goes smoothly over it.</li>
            <li> It had a really greasy feeling on my skin and gave the feeling of caking it on. It was clear like I thought but that was really the only good thing about it. It actually made my makeup harder to apply and it rubbed off a lot easier afterwards. It feels disgusting. I definitely do not recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a handful of primers, and this one is definitely the best product for the price. There are a handful of (much) higher end products that I like better, but this achieves the same result while remaining wallet-friendly. Would definitely recommend to friends and family!</li>
            <li> I have bought one and loved it. Bought a second and as other reviews, it came without the inside pump straw. So frustrated! Why can&#x27;t the company fix this issue!</li>
            <li> I have been using a primer for over a year that I liked, but that wasn&#x27;t holding back the oil from my oily skin very well. I use a primer because make up (all kinds, no matter mineral or not) make my skin break out, and my oily skin and large pores makes it impossible to &amp;#34;smooth on&amp;#34; for a natural look when wearing make up. I decided to give this one a try and I LOVE IT! It holds back my oily skin all day, goes on smooth and my skin doesn&#x27;t break out any more! LOVE it!</li>
            <li> makes my skin silky smooth before makeup application although the amount in the bottle is deceptively small, very good product thank you very much</li>
            <li> This primer goes on really smooth but doesn&#x27;t make my makeup stay on much longer than without. Skip it and use the money to go towards a better one.</li>
            <li> This gets 5 stars because this primer was awesome, my makeup stayed on all day, but the pump has stopped dispensing product.</li>
            <li> very smooth in my face, perfect before putting bb cream. when I started using it, I recognized that my make up stay longer...love it!:)</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels on my face. It feels like silk. It makes putting on makeup a total breeze.  Very light weight, and no strong smell. I love this product.</li>
            <li> I got this to help keep my gel eyeliner in place for the day because mine tends to smudge thru the day - I didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money before I knew how well a primer worked - so I thought this would be perfect to try.  It does have a light shimmer to it, which I like.  I don&#x27;t however, like how it smells.</li>
            <li> Applys perfectly well definetly buy again</li>
            <li> I was an avid e.l.f. cosmetics customer, until I realized that I grew up and needed makeup to last longer than two hours. Buyers, you get what you pay for. This is a cheap product for a reason. Sure, it works, but how long did you expect it to work for? Surely not as long as the primer you purchased at MAC for 3x the price. I gave it four stars because throughout my youth and into my college years, this was a dependable, decently priced item. I used it everyday, reapplied several times throughout the day, and it worked. Seller delivered with haste and in great condition.</li>
            <li> Product primes the face well.  Smooths skin and helps soothe as well.  I love this product and would recommend.  Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I was very amazed how smooth this was to apply on my face I am so glad I ordered it</li>
            <li> excellent product quality, competitive price and highly consistent product</li>
            <li> if you have some very hard to cover blemishes that you want to cover this is really does the trick</li>
            <li> It was an add on and I like it as well as the Maybelline age rewind.  I would order it again.</li>
            <li> This is the first mineral infused primer I&#x27;ve tried, so I can&#x27;t compare it to others.  I usually use creamy primers.  This primer feels almost like powder when you put it on.  It somewhat smooths me skin, but its not that great.  I don&#x27;t mind using it, but I probably won&#x27;t be buying any more.</li>
            <li> Exactly what i expected! Its the same as on the website except i got it here cheaper its a great product!</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd time using this stuff and I love it. It helps even out my foundation and allows it to go on so smoothly...so even. love it</li>
            <li> Works pretty well. For the price I really can&#x27;t complain. I just bought this item to bring my total to free shipping and it has proved to be a nice item to have. I am sure that different brands offer better primer though.</li>
            <li> I love the e.l f.Studio Mineral Infused Face Primer! It makes your face feel so smooth and your foundation glides on easily! It&#x27;s a must have!</li>
            <li> very smooth very i really can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s working&lt;br /&gt;i guess i should buy the one with colors maybe that&#x27;ll see a difference</li>
            <li> This face primer is absolutely amazing! it keeps my face looking smooth and the makeup never comes off, until I wipe it off that is!</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive skin, when I put it on, it feels smooth on face but it would not really cover up the pore. When I remove it after a day out, my skin feels sensitive and tinging. I have thrown away the entire bottle.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product. However, on my face it feels oily and it doesn&#x27;t keep my make up in place at all</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it should. I loved the feel of it and it wears very well for all day activity. I did wish there was a little more in the bottle, but for the value and amount of product, it&#x27;s just right. I wear it over my facial moisturizer and under my concealer and foundation. It looks flawless in all kinds of light and has worn well through extremely long days. I&#x27;m definitely buying it again when I run out. I tend to have normal/combination skin, so it was a relief to see how light and smooth this formula went on. Worth a try if you haven&#x27;t used primer before.</li>
            <li> Ordered this product about a month ago...and wow. I was hesitant about buying a cheaper primer, and I had never actually used a primer before, so this was all a big adventure for me. I use a tiny dot of product (really that&#x27;s all you need or else it forces your pores and little hairs on your face right out into the open) after I moisturize and before I put on my makeup.&lt;br /&gt; I use this primer with Revlon ColorStay (liquid), and it does wonders. Not only does it hold my make up on my face for the ENTIRE DAY (and I have an &#x27;on your feet&#x27; kind of job), it also mattifies the sheen on your make up/skin - you look powder fresh nearly all day. My make up only comes off in the shower at night when I use soap - so maybe it creates a water-resistant barrier because it&#x27;s silicone - who knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely re-buy this product because of the:&lt;br /&gt;- cheap price&lt;br /&gt;- little product needed to get the job done&lt;br /&gt;- actual staying power of the product</li>
            <li> This prime is amazing, feels really good on skin and is mineral :) It makes the foundation look and settle better. I love it! When I forget to put it on, the make up looks less natural and glows less.</li>
            <li> Changes the texture of my skin to velvet.I love it. I have spent tones of money of products and this will be my go to. The green took the redness out of my skin permanently which is crazy. The clear feels and seems oily but it&#x27;s not at the same time...dose not cause breakouts out my horrid acne skin but actually smooths out the appearance. At one point with this and acne treatment I felt confident I didn&#x27;t need makeup. It is small and runs out quickly so I buy in bulk. High quality for such a cheap price? A lot people I seen said it was oily but if you get it green it&#x27;s almost like a cream like silicone feeling?</li>
            <li> This moisturizes my face and keeps it from melting or cracking in very hot weather, I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love all elf makeup. And for the price they are wonderful. You get what you pay for, and then some!</li>
            <li> Okay so... I am a makeup lover. E.L.F. was having a sale, like they always are so I purchased a few things including  their Flawless Finish Foundation and the studio mineral infused face primer. The website claims to do the things that makeup primers are supposed to do i.e. provide a smooth canvas for easy makeup application, diminish the appearance of pores etc. I bought it to make my pores look smaller ( I&#x27;ve been having a problem with that lately). It doesn&#x27;t make the pores look smaller, but it does provide a smooth canvas for you to work with. The product is basically made out of a silicone blend. It hasn&#x27;t caused me to break out, and it is moisturizing. The only problem is the fact that it doesn&#x27;t minimize pores, like it claims to. So if you are virtually poreless, this is for you.   P.S. if you choose to purchase this product buy it from the e.l.f. website, they basically rape your wallet here on amazon. e.l.f. is affordable but here you have to pay crazy shipping and they overprice the products and e.l.f. is always having promos so most likely, you won&#x27;t be paying full price.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, make-up applies easily over it, and feels amazing! Keeps everything feeling lightweight and makes your face so touchable and nice.</li>
            <li> Really light primer. It doesn&#x27;t make you feel like you have make-up caked on. Really keeps foundation in place and sets a nice, smooth canvas for the rest of your make-up. I also have sensitivities to a lot of make-up and this doesn&#x27;t cause any redness or burning for me. It&#x27;s great, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Goes on like butter, making my face a canvass for my foundation. It is amazing stuff!</li>
            <li> This is the first primer I&#x27;ve ever used, and it feels quite nice. It honestly feels like silicone, but much lighter weight. Less than one full pump is all that&#x27;s needed to do a whole face - just massage it around like a lotion. Very simple and fast to use. There is no pigment in the primer, so don&#x27;t bother with a brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put a BB cream on top - the primer probably defeats the moisturizing purpose of the BB cream, but it matches my complexion better than any foundation. You DO want to let this dry completely before applying anything else, otherwise you could end up with smears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does, honestly, smooth out your complexion. It won&#x27;t get real wrinkles or crow&#x27;s feet, but it will smooth the natural texture and crinkles in your skin. After a bit of powder, your skin feels so soft and velvet-y.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a tiny bottle, but it&#x27;s been two weeks and I haven&#x27;t run out yet. The price on the E.L.F. website is $6 before shipping, so it&#x27;s a good deal here if you don&#x27;t want to buy $35 worth of makeup from the E.L.F. site to get their free shipping. HOWEVER the website also offers other versions of their primers (SPF 20, Mineral, Hydrating, and Poreless) and the Mineral comes in other colors - Clear, Tone-Correcting Green, Brightening Lavender, and Radiant Glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Cyclopentasiloxane, Cyclohexasiloxane, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Dimethicone，Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Silica, Silica Dimethyl Silylate, Phenoxyethanol. May Contain: Mica, Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Iron Oxides (CI 77491, CI 77492, CI 77499), Manganese Violet (CI 77742), Red 40 Lake (CI 16035), Blue 1 Lake (CI 42090), Ultramarines (CI 77007), Chromium Oxide Greens (CI 77288), Tin Oxide (CI 77861)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;^ Hint: &amp;#34;may contain&amp;#34; is for the different color options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional notes: I have pretty sensitive skin and this has not caused any reactions.</li>
            <li> This is really good face primer for the price. I was skeptical at first when buying this, I have a lot of skin allergies that easily get bothered with facial products. I was surprised however this did not break me out or cause a hellish rash. The primer does smooth your face, it covers your pores for a flawless application of your foundation. I am really happy that this product keeps my foundation looking fresh all day and it does not fade at the end of my 18 hour day. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product my foundation glides after applying this.</li>
            <li> Works very well... Not quite as smooth as BareMinerals Prime Time, but for half the price I&#x27;m not complaining!</li>
            <li> I like the way it feels on my face and doesn&#x27;t feel as \\&quot;filmmy\\&quot; as other primers. Is that a word? If not, just insert one of your own. I&#x27;m not a primer expert but this is doing its job and I&#x27;m not going to complain.</li>
            <li> Primer for your face. It really works! I just love this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought expensive primers and this is just as good, if not better.</li>
            <li> I was actually really impressed with this.  I purchased mine from Target, and I thought for the price, it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try it.  It leaves my face feeling and looking smooth and soft, and helps my makeup to last all day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not big on reviews but I thought I just HAD to comment on this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a person who lives in a tropical region and sweats a lot on my face and, my makeup barely lasts till midday in extreme heat. However, today I wore the primer for the first time in the sun under some light mineral makeup and bronzer. Around 2 pm and after scorching heat, I was shocked to hear my companions say how fresh and finished my face had looked, despite me sweating profusely and having done no touch-ups since 9 am. When I went to the bathroom I was indeed shocked to see that though my lipstick had worn off, my makeup looked almost 100% intact. The primer had done a great job of helping my makeup to stay despite the heat. I am pleased with this product and will be purchasing again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviews say that It&#x27;s too small, as a light makeup user I will test this myself and post an update.</li>
            <li> Five Stars In Every Way*****</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! I had red spots on my face for months and used this for two days the red spots are completely gone good product for $6.00.</li>
            <li> Your skin won&#x27;t believe you when you tell it how cheap this primer was! Great product. The lid never stays on...loose.</li>
            <li> Makes my make up glide on smooth also make my face appear smoother fills in pores as well. .. great product for the price</li>
            <li> I felt like this was so cheap it made me break out.and it was not soft enough. Only used it once and never again.</li>
            <li> First used e.l.f. from target , mascara only . I have used many products that claim to help with oil control and this actually worked . I live in New York where they just opened an e.l.f. store , goodbye Sephora!</li>
            <li> This is my fav primer helps to makes wrinkles less visible and makes my skin feel baby bottom smooth no build up</li>
            <li> this is so light, feels like nothing on your face, smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li> My make up stays longer with this primer and I also use the ELF stay on spray.</li>
            <li> Great value and for the price, too! For myself I don&#x27;t think it works as well as Smashbox Photofinish like others raved about but for $6, no complaints. Great for everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry, sensitive skin and everything seems to either oxidize quickly or makes me dry. I use this after my moisturizer dries a bit, put this stuff on which glides smoothly. It doesn&#x27;t make my makeup stay long as the smashbox primer does which is what I mentioned. Still, it&#x27;s a great product. I will buy again and refer to friends. :)</li>
            <li> I love putting on make-up, Im not great at it but I love it.  I dont even remember how I came across it but I read all the reviews and thought that I would give it a shot.  I could NOT be happier.  This stuff is amazing.  My make-up stays on so much longer.  I am hooked and have already purchased a few more!</li>
            <li> Love this primer! I&#x27;ve never used makeup primer before. I have only used eyeshadow primer but only a few times. This primer have me a nice smooth finish and my makeup lasted the whole night through all the dancing and sweating and walking. The bottle isn&#x27;t as small as I expected it to be, but no complaints there :)</li>
            <li> it does the trick, keeps makeup on a little longer</li>
            <li> I have been using this primer for a year after more expensive brands failed me.  For the price, this works great.  It keeps me shine free and helps my concelear stay put under the eyes.</li>
            <li> Nice product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> In fairness I&#x27;ve only been using this product for two days, but as someone who suffers from very oily skin this stuff is brilliant. I can go the whole day without my eyebrows sliding off of my face. Pretty much close to no &#x27;excess&#x27; sebum, yes there is still obviously some production naturally but nothing near how my skin is without the primer. It&#x27;s wonderful and gives you a great, smooth canvas to work on &amp; a teensy bit goes such a long way.  Would definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful, it makes your skin silky smooth and flawless. A makeup must have. Would recommend to anyone...!!!!</li>
            <li> Helps foundation go on smooth, look smooth and stay smooth.  I barely have to apply powder after working in full makeup all day. Really helps to make the makeup last on the skin. I love this primer! Delivery was quick and item was packaged well. I will be buying this again!</li>
            <li> My face feels like silk when I put it on - I read a review that said that prior to me buying it, its true. Absolutely love using this product.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling oily.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to just give this a one star.  I normally use a moisturizer and liquid foundation, but many YouTube makeup tutorials recommended a primer, so I just had to try it.  I moisturized and let that dry, then used this product before my foundation.  It felt nice on my skin, sort of like Vaseline, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in how my makeup goes on or how long it looks fresh.  It didn&#x27;t hurt anything, but it didn&#x27;t improve the process either.  Also there&#x27;s barely any product in the container.  I&#x27;m giving it three stars because it was cheap and it might make for a smoother application of thicker foundations.</li>
            <li> Pump has broken when received.  Overall had greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Works, but it clogged my pores and I threw it out.</li>
            <li> Amazing face primer. Elf is a brand that allways bring quality in the product, you can trust with a close eyes buying elf products, they always has long lasting and a big quality in compare to the prince.</li>
            <li> Great product, doesn&#x27;t go very far-- just not enough to the bottle. It felt like I only got 10 pumps.</li>
            <li> Decent primer, nothing special. Can&#x27;t really complain about the quantity since they specifically told you how much product was in there on the product&#x27;s page. A little goes a long way anyways. I would recommend this for beginners or people who can&#x27;t afford an overpriced primer. (Like me!)</li>
            <li> This primer does work pretty good.</li>
            <li> I love the product itself, but the container is such a hassle that I&#x27;d rather use something else. As others have said, it&#x27;s a small amount in misleading packaging. The pump is terrible and often struggles and sputters. Out of the two I&#x27;ve purchased, for both I&#x27;ve had to manually push up the pump from the inside because it didn&#x27;t work properly.</li>
            <li> Again I say, why spend crazy money when you dont have to! This primer is wonderful for wearing under makeup or alone. I definitely would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a bunch of primers and this one is by far my favorite:)</li>
            <li> love all e.l.f products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been getting more into makeup these days, trying out what used to seem like unnecessary extra steps in my daily makeup regime. My latest exploration was with a makeup setting mist, and since that seemed to work, I wondered how much I needed a face primer. But having finally tried it out, I can say that I really like it. It keeps the minimal foundation I use on my nose and chin looking smoother, and lasting longer. I used to have to touch up every day at lunchtime, but not anymore. The redness around my nose stays hidden until after work, sometimes beyond. Some reviewers said they&#x27;re unhappy with how little comes in this bottle, but I can&#x27;t complain. I only use a tiny bit that I spread over trouble spots - my nose and chin - not my whole face. Maybe they are using more than they really need. I have a feeling this bottle will last me a while.</li>
            <li> Liked the product. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Product works well enough but the bottle makes it impossible to use all the primer in the bottle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I was expecting to like this product that much, but I found the product to be very lightweight and easy to apply. I absolutely LOVED the silky, smooth texture - it feels great between my fingers without leaving an oily or greasy residue and it actually made it easier to apply my makeup. Thanks to the other reviews, I was prepared for how small the package was, less than half an ounce. However a little bit goes a very long way  it is not like applying lotion, or even foundation where you need a larger amount. Aside from the size, I honestly have no complaints, and I would definitely buy again and would recommend to my friends.</li>
            <li> Ok so it turned out I&#x27;ve been wearing make up the wrong way my whole life, no wonder I kept buying foundations thinking there&#x27;s a problem with each one, but now after I started using this primer, my face looks sooooo smooth!! It&#x27;s like I&#x27;m photoshopped!!! Please buy this you will not regret it</li>
            <li> I like this primer because it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t add any more oil to my combination skin. It keeps my face from getting oil throughout the day and it&#x27;s light under my foundation. I just wished it lasted a little longer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use a highlighter with this. The only issue is that it feels weird, almost greasy. Well priced, the quality is as good as my Victoria&#x27;s Secret primer.</li>
            <li> The product is a light silicone based primer. It keeps the makeup on your face well by providing a nice base. Even helped ward off some sweating. Wonderful.</li>
            <li> This face primer is ok, it doesn&#x27;t do much for me...but I don&#x27;t have a problem with it, maybe it&#x27;s just not for me because I have oily skin.</li>
            <li> This primer is said to be a dupe for Smashbox&#x27;s primer (which retails at about $26). It is a silicone-based primer that fills in all the fine lines on your face leaving your skin feeling ultra-silky smooth and ready for a flawless application of foundation. I do notice that when I wear this under my foundation, my skin really looks flawless. I also use just 1 pump/drop for my whole face. While the product may feel a bit greasy during the first few seconds but it quickly absorbs into the skin. The only down side is that the pump did break on me after several uses, but mine was part of the first batch that ELF put on the market and they have improved the pump since (according to their website). This did not break me out in any way. I think this is totally worth it for $6 on the ELF website!</li>
            <li> Just as good as smash box only a fraction of the cost</li>
            <li> This is a great face primer. Works very well with my makeup. The only downside is that it pumps way too much primer. You only need a little bit. Works well though!</li>
            <li> I was surprised when I used this the first time because of the color and texture. It&#x27;s clear and gel-like in texture. When you put it on, It has a somewhat oily texture but it helps spread it evenly. It does not dry oily though. I let it set for about 5 minutes before I apply my makeup. I have combination skin and this does not make my skin oily or breakout. I like it a lot compared to other &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; texture primers. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> When I first opened and used this product, I loved it. It took a little getting used to because it was the first primer I&#x27;d ever used. It did what the description said: minimizes your pores and provides a smooth canvas. My biggest problem was how short this lasted. I only used it four times, in small amount, and it was empty the next time I planned to use it. Unfortunately, for this reason, I&#x27;ve chosen a low rating. It was not worth the price. However, I would still give it a great review otherwise.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin so this worked for me. It&#x27;s not rhe best primer but the price is good.  Somerthing is better than nothing.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> This primer is great silky smooth</li>
            <li> I love the how smooth it is and it keeps your face with no shine and the make up goes on smoother!</li>
            <li> i have been using face primer under my foundation for many years now. it does add another expense to your make up products. when i saw this on amazon i thought it was worth the try for the reasonable price.  it is not the worst primer i have ever used but it is far from the best, being a little too sticky.  also, after only a few uses i am unable to pump the product out of the bottle. i would probably not purchase it again, and would never suggest it to a friend.</li>
            <li> Woow love it ❤️❤️❤️😍😍</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING! and I don&#x27;t say that very often. Before using any face primer, I would just put on my foundation and that would be it. But 2hrs later the oil on my face could fry a fish! It was that bad. But with elf I barely do touch ups and I work from 7 to 6 so it helps keep my day going without having me worry about how much oil had accumulated on my face!</li>
            <li> i love this primer it makes my face really smooth so my foundation can go on easier and it works great with a brush</li>
            <li> I love this ELF primer! It is very affordable and it lasted me a long time before having to buy a new one. When applying this for the first time I was pretty skeptical because it feels like you are rubbing grease on your face, but it doesn&#x27;t stay that way. When I finish rubbing it in it leaves my face silky smooth and in perfect condition to apply my makeup to. Even though it feels greasy when being applied it does NOT leave my face oily at all. I would say that this is a very good product for the price!</li>
            <li> wow, wish I had purchased this before buying other expensive products. This was transparent and went on smooth with no build up. It allowed my makeup to lay naturally. Well done e.l.f.</li>
            <li> I have been looking of a primer that was like the old smash box primer.  Well I found it and it&#x27;s cheap.  Not cheaply made but th silky silicone that fills in fine lines and smooths out the larger ones. Foundation slides on smoothly and  all the more expensive  primers in my makeup box that didn&#x27;t live up to there claims are being given away to daughters with younger skin !</li>
            <li> SO PERFECT! THANKS I WILL BUYING MORE PRODUCTS IN YOUR STORE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m going to buy this product again. I don&#x27;t like the clear primer, it just feels like lotion and I don&#x27;t see any cover up. Next time I&#x27;ll get a tinted one instead.</li>
            <li> Looooove! I put this stuff on after I apply my witch hazel toner and it keeps my makeup put for the whole day. I once ran out of this primer and had to go out without it and my foundation basically melted off. :( It does the job perfectly, and for inexpensive!</li>
            <li> This is a very smoothe and light primer...makes your face feel so Good!</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel like silk and holds the make up all day!</li>
            <li> primer works ok but it PISSES me off that they use such misleading packaging. You can open the bottom of the bottle and see that the &amp;#34;actual&amp;#34; amount is maybe 1/5th the size of the outside container. So where is the other 4/5ths that I paid for? You are getting like .47 of an ounce in a 2.5oz sized bottle. totally messed up, won&#x27;t buy this or any other elf products again. This is NOT a good deal for $6.</li>
            <li> Very nice, my makeup goes on well and my face looks smoother than ever before. It&#x27;s not heavy nor does it have any strong scent. I love it! I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Seems to cover pores well for a smoother looking finished face.  Do not put too much on or you will get greasy skin.  Just dab a little at first to see how much you will need.</li>
            <li> This is my second time buying this product and I loveeeeeeeee it. Am a cosmetology student and this is a product I will be recommending to all of my future clients. My skin is oily and this keeps it smooth and minimizes the shine.</li>
            <li> This made my face so dry and it started making me peal</li>
            <li> I love this primer.  I not only Spackle my old-lady face with it, I mix some in with my foundation to make the foundation flow, blend, and cover much, much better -- makes my skin look smooth and dewy.  I always thought a primer was just a marketing shtick until I tried it...I don&#x27;t think I could live without it now and I particularly love this one.</li>
            <li> So so so so happy w this product.  I&#x27;ve been using smashbox for 6 Years and finally decided I needed a cheaper alternative. At $6 a bottle, I can&#x27;t believe how wonderful it works. Will but again and again and again</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this face primer, it makes my face feel as smooth as silk. Wouldn&#x27;t definitely recommend  you try it before applying makeup for a flawless look. Awesome product. I love all elf products.</li>
            <li> I really like this primer. Helps my make up stay on longer throughout the day. Not heavy. Helps minimize my pores before applying foundation.</li>
            <li> nothing special.  won&#x27;t purchase again,.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  It makes your skin so smooth.  I do have large pores and it doesn&#x27;t really minimize pore size, but it smoothes my skin out so much.  My only suggestion is to let it set or dry before applying make-up.  Otherwise it sort of smears the make-up.  I apply it before getting ready for work, have my coffee and read some and then go do my hair and make-up.</li>
            <li> Tried this as an alternative to another much more expensive primer.  I LOVE it.  I have extremely sensitive skin and have had no breakouts.  I actually believe that this primer is better than the more expensive one.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed. My skin type is dry/normal. Sure, it went on smooth but that&#x27;s about it. It didn&#x27;t help my makeup go on any easier or help it last any longer. To be honest, I saw no difference in using this or going completely without primer. I prefer the monistat gel. My sister who has oily skin had a worse experience with it. It left her face extremely greasy and caused her to break out. She prefers to stick to oil blotting sheets and powder.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd time I&#x27;ve order this....and especially when you look at the price it&#x27;s actually really great stuff !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just one pump does my whole face including my eyelids, and if I&#x27;m going out I do another pump for my neck and chest area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foundation stays put and looks smooth and fresh!  Will continue to order!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing the quality you receive for $6. I have never used foundation primers before and decided to try this after hearing some pretty great reviews. I&#x27;m in no way disappointed. Makeup goes on effortlessly, there is no smell to the product, and it makes skin baby soft without effecting dry/oily skin. I will definitely be buying this product again. Love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I have to update my review and give this product 4 stars due to the amount of product in the bottle. Regardless of the great quality, for $6 I was expecting to have received at least twice the amount of product.</li>
            <li> Great for a $6.00 primer! Keeps my face smooth before my makeup and my makeup stays on perfectly. I use some expensive makeup and there is no way I&#x27;d pay more for a primer than this, because it works great! don&#x27;t be afraid to try it just for the price, i&#x27;ve used expensive primers (smashbox, bareminerals) and this works just as well!</li>
            <li> I bought this on the ELF website in order raise the price of my order total in order to comply with a promo deal, and I have to say that I was pretty much satisfied. I believe that this did aid me in applying my foundation in a smooth manner, and it was so light. I also like the fact that it was clear, so I didn&#x27;t have to worry about matching my skin or anything like that. I also didn&#x27;t break out like some people have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t exactly like was the layout of the bottle. I didn&#x27;t realize that I had basically run out. I guess I wasn&#x27;t paying attention the entire time or something, but that was a downer.</li>
            <li> From the moment I put it on I felt the difference. I have really bad combination skin and with this product my whole face felt the same and foundation application has never been easier. It feels like you&#x27;re putting nothing on your face but you feel the difference after. It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I have never used E.L.F products before, but I had heard amazing things about them. I had wanted to find a face primer and this seemed to be an excellent price. I am not disappointed. A little goes a LONG way, so though this is a small bottle it lasts. It smoothed out my skin, made my face feel softer, and made my makeup go on and cover SO much better. Definitely recommend it to others, especially if you have large pores like I do</li>
            <li> I love this product and it is perfect for my oily skin, the purpose of a primer is to protect your face from the makeup and to reduce the shine and this product does just that</li>
            <li> I Love how this works and feels on my face. Its very light and smooth. I have used it everyday since ive got it and im already needing more.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love how it feels like nothing is even on your face. Its light, and it works just as a primer should.</li>
            <li> So the pump stopped working after the first use. Not that big of a deal since I can still get to the make up, but an inconvience since i have to unscrew the top and use a q-tip or something to scoop some out. Also, i was hoping it would help keep my foundation in place when i sweat... which it does a better job than if i didn&#x27;t have a primer on, but its not the best. Other than that, the product does what it says it would, and for a pretty good price i might add!</li>
            <li> i had a sample of some primer through the mail (the high price ones). this beats the price and is a good product. a little goes a long way.  my foundation stays put and goes on so smooth. for the price you can not beat it.</li>
            <li> I love this product , I use it all the time now :) it&#x27;s so light weight , no oil residue, and make up stays on !</li>
            <li> love it! My skin feels very smooth and my makeup looks as natural as ever. The product arrived on time and the pump makes it easy to put on your fingertips.I will pirchase this product from Amazon in the near future.</li>
            <li> Made my makeup look flawless all day long, no need to keep blotting or reapplying powder, no smell, feels great, pump is working fine - I normally don&#x27;t manhandle makeup lol. All in all I love this primer, and I will keep buying it...but maybe from the ELF website since it would be cheaper than Amazon</li>
            <li> I liked it so much, I reordered it. Makeup glides on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Elf primer is the best low cost primer out there.  At about $6 a bottle, it works better than Smash Box which costs almost five times as much.  There&#x27;s a reason its almost always sold out in Target, that&#x27;s why I was happy to buy it here on Amazon.  It glides on like silk and fills in your fine lines and minimizes your pores like spackle.  You are now ready to paint your face.</li>
            <li> Absolutley love the feel of this primer</li>
            <li> this is the first time I decide to use primer and it turn out really great, it&#x27;s make my skin really really soft so I would recommend it for sure also the price not too pricey.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!! I have sensitive skin and didn&#x27;t have any problems with this product. will be buying again.</li>
            <li> Somehow, it was out of the box, and completely out of the packaging when it arrived.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not enough.</li>
            <li> I tried the much more expensive Primers at a Women&#x27;s Extravaganza in Jax, FL.  I wanted to purchase some then because it makes application of your make up so much easier.  However, the cost of over $60 was way out of my range.  I waited and found this months later but love the product and it works just the same as the expensive name brand primer.  I will use this from now on.</li>
            <li> I loved this primer! Raved about it and told everyone to get it. But, I noticed over a few weeks its texture gets weird. It goes from a gel to a weird stiffer gel and will come right off your face. Just weird.....</li>
            <li> Great inexpensive primer lasts through the day, goes on smoothly. ELF products are consistently a good value for the price</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say this, I have the Smashbox equivalent of this product which cost me over $30. This ELF product is easily just as good as the Smashbox version and it costs waaay less. I&#x27;m glad I purchased it. My makeup goes on smooth and makes my 43 yr old skin look younger and brighter, it also cuts down on my T-Zone oily skin from showing through.</li>
            <li> I like this face primer. This is the first one I&#x27;ve ever bought so I don&#x27;t really have much knowledge on them, but I do like this primer alot though. It glides onto my skin smoothly and I don&#x27;t need a whole lot to evenly cover my entire face. It doesn&#x27;t have much of an odor and it&#x27;s not sticky or greasy. It holds my makeup in place and holds up well throughout the day (I have REALLY oily skin so that&#x27;s really saying something)! This primer is definetly worth the investment!</li>
            <li> This is my second time to order.  Really smoothes out the skin and makeup nicely.  Will continue to order this product!</li>
            <li> Really nice texture. Makes a silky base for make-up. Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> light texture that leaves skin super smooth for makeup application.</li>
            <li> This primer is WONDERFUL. It comes out like a liquid, mattes up, and is basically just a wonderful product for a wonderful price. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have bougfht e.l.f. products and have been very pleased with the results.........this face primer is another GOOD product frome.e.l.f.  and I would buy from this seller again.  The service was good the delievery fast and wrapped well too.  So, yes I would recommend this face primer.</li>
            <li> I have Merle Norman primer and elf primer works just as well! I was skeptical at first because I thought surely a product you pay $25 for would work better than a primer I paid less than $5 for. But I plan to continue use of elf mineral primer, it smooths my skin and helps my makeup stay on longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many primers high end and drugstore.  I love this product.  its light on the face, cheap, and has great staying power with liquid foundation or minerals.</li>
            <li> I have never used a primer before so  dont really have anything to compare it to but I it feels amazing. My pores did get really little and my make up looked flawless. I havent tried it with my heavy duty foundation yet but I think it&#x27;ll do well so I am excited for my next girls night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other reviews were correct when they say something is wrong with that pump. I had to open it and get it that way.</li>
            <li> This helps to make a small amount of foundation to go a long way.  Without this primer, I need more makeup to cover my face but this helps me spread it around evenly and naturally.  But the reason I will buy this product again, is that it did not aggrevate my  acne prone skin.  I&#x27;ve struggled with aggresive acne since puberty and I choose my facial products with care for this reason.  Anything can set off a flurry of breakouts for me, even forgetting to wash my makeup off before bed.  But I&#x27;ve been using this product happily for a month.  It seems to be unscented too, which I appreciate.</li>
            <li> I have used quite a few other facial primers and I have to say this is one of my favorites.  I really like how soft it makes my face feel and I am not really a big e.l.f. user but I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Goes on oil free! Glides right on, if u have great skin like I do already you don&#x27;t even need foundation on just put your eyeliner shadow a little blush and maybe a bronzer and go!</li>
            <li> I really like ELF but when compared with Benefits $30 primer and it can&#x27;t stand up. Very affordable and works as a primer for about 4 hours instead of 10 like higher priced brands.</li>
            <li> This can definitely go as a dupe for multiple other high cost primers. I would recommend this to anyone trying to maintain a high end beauty routine for a much lower cost. Works like a charm. Keep in mind that a little (one pump!) goes a LONG way!</li>
            <li> My new go to product.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel soft will defiantly be buying in the future.</li>
            <li> I was kinda scared to buy this, but ia m so happy with this primer! you just need a very very small amount and it goes along ways, and it feels like your putting on silk on your face, its very smooth and very nice feeling, its great and my make up stayes all day, it is a great primer and will deff buy many many more from them and the price, is amazing!!! highly recomend, thsi item!!! very very happy!</li>
            <li> Lived up to my expectations.  Just as good, if not better, than the pricey primers I&#x27;ve purchased through Sephora or Department Stores.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product directly from e.l.f. and I really liked it.  When I ran out, I found the product on amazon and I ordered it there, happy that with my Prime membership I could save on shipping.  The product arrived and appeared to be the same.  The first few pumps from the bottle were just like the product when purchased directly from e.l.f. , which is thick and makes your face feel silky and helps your make-up glide on.  But about 3 days into the bottle provided by this seller, something thin and oily starts coming out.  Suddenly it is not the same product as when you buy it directly from e.l.f.  It is no longer thick and it appears to be some kind of oderless oil.  I purchased 2 bottles from this seller and this happened with both bottles.  I am very dissatisfied.  I would not recommend buying this \\&quot;face primer\\&quot; from this seller.</li>
            <li> Perfect and sooo soft</li>
            <li> I have been using for two weeks. My makeup stays on for 12-14 hours. Skin feels great. No breakouts. A few clogged pores on super hot days.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m trying to cut back on what I spend on makeup at Sephora. I didn&#x27;t have high expectations of this primer but I will likely buy again. The ounce size is low, so it is only about a 30% savings over the more expensive brands which come in larger amounts.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!! It makes my skin so soft and my makeup stays on perfect.</li>
            <li> OMG!! This is my first time I have ever used a primer in my life. I was skeptical about it. And here I have it...its amazing. This product brings brilliance and smooth touches to my face. My face feels like a newborn baby skin. I love it.I will definitely order more.I will highly recommend to friends and others.</li>
            <li> This makes my makeup stay on flawlessly all day!  Love it, can&#x27;t believe I haven&#x27;t used this ever before.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Great product</li>
            <li> Unbelievable price.  Had low expectations for the price but bought it because of the reviews.  It&#x27;s great.  Goes on easily and smoothly with a silky finish that minimizes imperfections despite the fact that it&#x27;s clear.  Will definitely buy again.  The pump looks good, but isn&#x27;t great - still works, just not as good as the actual product.</li>
            <li> It helps my makeup go on velvety smooth. While it isn&#x27;t the best primer, my pores aren&#x27;t as visible with it under my foundation.</li>
            <li> The pump is broken and I cannot use it, I have to use a qtip to get the product out which also wastes a ton.  Glad it was cheap, I would not order again.  The actual primer is adequate, nothing special.  I will stick with my bare minerals primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used other elf products - love and use their mascaras daily, but this is a fail.  They tried to make the packaging look fancy, but the quality suffered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not report to customer service, the price was cheap enough so I didnt bother I know Amazon would have done a replacement but didnt seem necessary since the product inside was still fine.</li>
            <li> First of all I purchased this product from ELF and not Amazon.  I like many Elf products.  I think they are cheap but work very well.  This one, however, I did not like at all.  The primer has tiny sparkles, which I did not like at all, and I noticed that every time I used it, my foundation did not go on smoothly, would look streaky and looked awful.  I tried other primers and my foundation looked normal again... So I attribute my foundation looking bad to this primer I was using at the moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this Elf product.</li>
            <li> Never tried a face primer before but I wondered how it would work under my BB cream. The texture is really neat. Once you start to apply it to your face its almost like it disappears  under your fingers.... as if you put nothing on at all. It makes your skin feel even and make-up ready. its a little much for the June thru October months in Florida but in.the winter its perfect.</li>
            <li> This product is just ok, i have really had much better!! it does not hold up to the heat makes your make up shine thru really fast. One other point the bottle was short on product!!!! my bottle was like half full, that sucks.......... wont buy again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used expensive primer before. This one does a pretty good job at smoothing out your face and holding on your make up. Bottle looks nice too. I feel as though I&#x27;ve had to use MORE of this product though to do the same thing as other primers- I&#x27;d use double the amount of this primer for the same results. Since it&#x27;s so cheap though, it&#x27;s still pretty good value.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several ELF products direct from their website. This product is very inexpensive but very good!I alternate with my Cover Girl &amp; Olay primer!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this for a while and none of the stores in my town carry it. I&#x27;m so glad I found it. It works great!</li>
            <li> This is the one of the most effective and amazing products I found on Amazon, you have to use it, the tone and texture of your skin will be better after applying the product</li>
            <li> Got this product, was so excited bcuz it was an awesome price!&lt;br /&gt;It has an off smell, I was maybe about to apply it to my entire face 3 4 times before it was empty!</li>
            <li> I am a cosplayer who was looking for a decent primer that did not induce oil overload on my face. This is a wonderful primer. It&#x27;s light and using it has extended the durability of my make-up by hours!</li>
            <li> This makes my face so smooth!</li>
            <li> The best thing ever, keeps your skin fresh and natural looking</li>
            <li> seems to work good.....</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for me.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply and is a good base for my BB Cream &amp; foundation. The consistency is nice and not overly silicony. Does not leave me with a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Been buying this primer for awhile. Got it in two days. Love it.</li>
            <li> First time using primer ever and i have to say i made a great choice using the E.L.F mineral infused primer. Goes on as soft as pearls without feeling sticky or thick and holds my makeup on all day not to mention awesome price. I was skeptical at first for the low price low quality assumption but i must say that&#x27;s not the case at all. i love this product. i would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My favorite primer hands down.  I always want to try something new but come back to this one every time.  So smooth!</li>
            <li> This primer blends onto your skin smoothly and helps minimize / smooth out any problem areas making a nice clean and workable palette to do what you will makeup-wise. I hate products that smell weird or too purfume-y, this is nice and clean. My skin tends to be more on the dryer side, so after a basic exfoliation I apply this on and it&#x27;s wonderful and helps the makeup adhere for longer wear.</li>
            <li> Really like this. It has no weird smell, and washes off really easy. I&#x27;ve had no problems with breakouts, and it lasts a full day for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I rarely wear makeup, maybe 3-4 days a month. I&#x27;ve had no problems with this at all, but I don&#x27;t wear it daily either!</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best primer I&#x27;ve ever used! Dirt cheap, too. Makes skin silky smooth and blots excess oil (I have enough for 8 people) for hours and hours. HIghly rec.</li>
            <li> I ordered this looking for a cheaper alternative to the high end primers that you can get at MAC or Sephora and I was pleasantly surprised at how well this worked! Great texture- made my face super soft and velvety. It also held up pretty well allowing my face between 6 and 8 hours of great wear. I loved how my foundation and powder glided right over this product. Only downside is there isn&#x27;t much product in the bottle. But for $6 I will be buying more!</li>
            <li> This has definatley made my foundations go on more smoothly and crease less. This is my first time using primer and I have to say this product did not dissapoint me. I would at least try it out if I were you.</li>
            <li> I typically would use Avon Magix but I decided to switch it up and try this product. This product works really well and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot. I have some slight scarring on my face and when I use this product with and then my mineral powder, you can&#x27;t see any of the scarring. It doesn&#x27;t make your skin oily and it doesn&#x27;t clog your pores. I&#x27;ve had it for about two weeks now and I&#x27;m going to continue buying this product.</li>
            <li> Hey,&lt;br /&gt;  The delivery was a little slower than i was hoping for, it was 3 days later than i was told it would be here. I have only used it a couple of time so far and it has worked good for me. It smothes out my face nicely. I have very sensitive and acne prone skin and i have seen no bad reactions. i have read some reviews that it came broken or the packageing was bad but it was all in one peice....just a little slow.</li>
            <li> this product is great at first it feels greasy on your fingers but when you rub it into your face it goes on smoothly and then makes your skin feel super soft, my make up now lasts all day, would defo buy again</li>
            <li> i dont really use primers.I should,but i usually forget and realise if after i apply foundation. but whenever i do, I love it.This a great product, the texture is nice and soft. One pump usually spreads well all over the face and leaves the face super smooth.I feel like I&#x27;m touching talcum powder on my face. Helps foundation set in better ans stay longer. Just give it a minute or 2 before applying the next product, i think it helps :)</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed much of a difference in my skin after using it. I like some other primers a little more.</li>
            <li> first of all its super tiny barely the size of my pinky even smaller and second o f all when i went to use it there was nothing in it it pumped but absolutely nothing came out. horrible</li>
            <li> this is not working it  doesn&#x27;t let my make up stay nd it doesn&#x27;t work its definitely clear but let me tell you just go but the one from the store this didn&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li> I love this primer! It feels good on the skin, it&#x27;s not oily and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy. The only thing that I can say that I didn&#x27;t like was how small it is, but it&#x27;s ab awesome primer.</li>
            <li> Love this, only thing is you cannot keep it that long, as it ashes it begins to get &amp;#34;goopy&amp;#34; and does not distribute evenly over your face and leaves little gross balls on your face</li>
            <li> Just fyi, this is NOT the primer with salicylic acid. I thought it was, but then I realized I can&#x27;t read.</li>
            <li> This product did help reduce the look of pores and fine lines but it was a little greasy feeling so more. It felt s pretty shiney with it on. It is a great price and maybe my skin is just too oily for it.  But I don&#x27;t think I have found my final product and I will keep searching</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars because of the size. Very deceiving. The product itself is like smearing rainbows and kittens your face; it&#x27;s magical and works great. BUT, I only used it for 2 weeks and it&#x27;s empty.</li>
            <li> Love this primer (I am on my fourth bottle!) and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Works awesome for me, put it on the test as soon as it arrived and my makeup did not move on a hot sunny day.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I thought it would be.  It feel GREAT on your face but it does nothing else really.  I thought it would be similar to the eye primer but I saw no noticeable difference from when I wasn&#x27;t using it.  But it feels great and silky.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best Face Primers that I&#x27;ve ran across, it&#x27;ll last for most of my work day (about 6-7 hours) without having to touch up my makeup. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> This seems like a good primer. I had an event that I wanted to wear make up for. This came in handy to use before my foundation and it felt good on my skin. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it and my Foundation.</li>
            <li> I loved the way this product felt and the way it made my makeup look, but there is not enough product in this bottle.  It only lasted about 5 days snd that is not long at all.  I probably won&#x27;t re-purchase.</li>
            <li> It is good and it does work !!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the face primer and I like the feel it imparts.  My skin looks more even and polished and my makeup stays on all day.  I have used it before applying liquid foundation and also when I just want to wear a loose mineral makeup and it works well.  I have rosacea and need something to make my foundation cover longer and better and this seems to work.  I would recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> I love Elf. Its a perfect primer and I traveld with it this summer. I can&#x27;t say how it compares to other primers as I&#x27;ve really only tried this one. However, I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Yes, this was great when you put it on - but that $6.00 was gone in a flash!  I could not believe it was already out within a few weeks of using it.  I was trying to save money because I used the Arbonne before but that lasted me over a year!  No more skimping on this one.</li>
            <li> Although I haven&#x27;t tried any other primers.&lt;br /&gt;I truly like, scratch that, loooove this one!&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smooth and feels like satin being rubbed onto your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Your make up lasts and doesn&#x27;t run down your face or anything.&lt;br /&gt;The only faulty thing about it is its cheap bottle, the pump sticks and you end up having to manually get the primer by unscrewing the pump.&lt;br /&gt;But, besides that, love it!</li>
            <li> It feels like silk going on your face but it makes me brake out so I have stopped use. I dont have very sensitive skin either, but it works.</li>
            <li> As someone with skin that breaks out from time to time, this really helps cover patchy spots. Doesn&#x27;t last all day but for the price, it makes my skin look and feel absolutely soft. You don&#x27;t need to wear much since one full pump seems enough but this has become the only primer I use now. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have used Sephora and Tart primer in the past. This product has the same effect for 1/3 of the price.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. I have very oily skin and this keeps me looking cool all day.</li>
            <li> What did I do before this stuff? That&#x27;s right, I used to use lotion, which combined with my makeup left my face feeling oily and gross. This stuff is SO smooth and light. It makes my makeup last longer too. SO happy with this purchase. Only wish it came in a bigger size.</li>
            <li> Makes makeup go on super smooth.</li>
            <li> i loved this and my mom stole it from me bc she loves it too</li>
            <li> Granddaughter loved it! Just what she asked for and amazon, as usual, a breeze to order from.</li>
            <li> I have bought this primer before, but now the amazon prices are comparable to the store prices! The bottle looks pretty enough that I can leave it out on the counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This primer works just as well as other more expensive products I have used from Sephora and others. It does not irritate or break out my sensitive skin and goes on smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful to let it soak in before putting on powder make up. Also, I sometimes break out if I do not use makeup remover before bed with this (I use mineral make up so do not need to remove all the time) so be careful!</li>
            <li> Not sure what it was suppose too look like when i wear it under foundation. However it is so silky smooth and it makes my skin feel nice. It also has a pleasant smell. Helps my concealer go on smoother.</li>
            <li> Made my face feel smooth, but I didnt see a difference between wearing it or not wearing it. Plus there isn&#x27;t much in the container so it doesn&#x27;t last that long. I used it 4-5 times a week and it lasted about a month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used [[ASIN:B002DP75R6 Too Faced Cosmetics Primed and Poreless, 1 Ounce]], [[ASIN:B001A0E0GO Philosophy Never Let Them See You Shine Primer, 1 Ounce]] and a few other more expensive primers and I&#x27;ve found that this works just as well, if not better. I use mineral powder makeup and I find that using a mineral infused primer helps my mineral makeup wear better. I&#x27;m a black woman with an oily T-zone, but dry skin, overall. I know this sounds crazy, but it&#x27;s true. Oily skin doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not dry and in need of good moisturizers. Anyway, my T-zone stays fresher and doesn&#x27;t shine too quickly. Nothing will make it not shine at all...let&#x27;s be honest. But any help i can get is appreciated. Also, the areas of my skin that are really dry (around my mouth, eyes and cheeks) don&#x27;t feel tight or itchy like some primers cause. I spray mine afterwards with [[ASIN:B00BKLH0QA e.l.f. Studio Makeup Mist &amp; Set 2.02 fl oz (60 ml)]] (which is cheaper on the e.l.f. website...shhhh) and blot with a makeup sponge and it lasts even longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: No primer is perfect...at least I haven&#x27;t found a perfect primer yet...but this one is amazing for the price! Go ahead and buy the expensive primers if you want to, but you&#x27;ll find that this one stacks up pretty well against them for 1/4 the price.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my sister and she was having such a hard time using the pump, the packaging is terrible. She had to open it up nd scoop out the product but when she uses it it&#x27;s really good.</li>
            <li> I have normal skin, not terribly sensitive, occasional breakouts, occassional oiliness. I dont need to buy expensive makeup or skin care products. I have been a HUGE fan of E.L.F for years. While some of their products are not my fav, they get you by without having to spend alot of money. This primer works great, fills in pores, is so smooth going on and keeps my makeup (usually a BB cream and a mineral powder finish) all day long! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Comparable to smashbox&#x27;a all day primer! Love this product.</li>
            <li> Very soft and skin after is realy smooth.</li>
            <li> I love the elf. This is my favorite product to buy them. Exact same price on Amazon as it is on Elf&#x27;s website. Can&#x27;t imagine putting my makeup on without it</li>
            <li> Very comparable to Smashbox Primer.. I love it!</li>
            <li> Feels amazing going on. Have noticed a difference in my foundation lasting longer than without using it</li>
            <li> This is the best purchase I&#x27;ve made!!!  The price is unbelievably reasonable and the results are superior in comparison with other similar products I&#x27;ve purchased at department stores!!</li>
            <li> I have found my forever primer! I was at Target and on impulse decided to buy this to see if it&#x27;d make a difference on my makeup. I have used Revlon primer prior but felt like it wasn&#x27;t helping my makeup. Tried this one and loved it on sight! It&#x27;s so different from Revlon. Revlon is very creamy whereas this one is like a jelly but not greasy and feels silky smooth. My makeup goes on so smoothy vs when I had on Revlon primer. I&#x27;m sold on this one, so worth the buy!</li>
            <li> I am 30 yrs old and I have started to notice a few (small) fine lines..mostly laugh lines, around my mouth. I bought this, hoping it would help hide my lines but it didn&#x27;t hide anything. I used it for a week straight and it made no difference what so ever. I applied it before my foundation/powder and it made no difference. In addition to not hiding any of my lines, it broke me out in every place I had applied it to. I also used it under my eyes and it settled into my lines pretty badly there. I am not sure what type of skin this is good for, but it definitely is not for sensitive/acne prone skin and most definitely does not hide any fine lines of any sort.</li>
            <li> I used this product 4 times and then it was done. Either the pump is broken or I got bamboozled. I missed the date to return the product, so I&#x27;m SOL.</li>
            <li> It works great! But it&#x27;s only 5 or 6 dollars at elf. com lol so go get it from there</li>
            <li> Love it! It feels like a sily moisturizer on my skin! Creates a good base for foundation. I will make a review video for my website [...] so stay tuned.</li>
            <li> Extremely lightweight and soft...</li>
            <li> I like the product but did not see how it really improved the longevity of make-up on my face.  I bought one from mac instead and will use this as a back up</li>
            <li> No complaints. Was concerned with sensitive skin that &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; product would irritate or not work for me, but I&#x27;ve gone through the whole bottle no issues and very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Product itself was faultless, the main problem with it is the amount in one container. The tube has a false bottom to make it look larger. The contents only last maybe 2-3 weeks using 1-2 pumps per application.</li>
            <li> this product does a better job than the expensive kind I&amp;#34;ve tried. I would recommend this item, it helps prevent pimple breakouts I had</li>
            <li> Love, love this product</li>
            <li> I liked the product itself. Nothing special but did the job. Like many others, mine arrived broken as well. The pump didn&#x27;t work at all so I ended up having to screw off the top and try to fish some out with the end of a thin makeup brush. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I love love love this!! After my shower, I put this on and my skin is ready and radiant for my make-up!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really work how I thought it would.  It just kind of left an oily film on my face.  Also the remnants stick to the side of the container and you can&#x27;t use every last bit.</li>
            <li> I wore it one night when I was going dancing and did not think it made any significant difference with keeping my face from looking too oily. Maybe its better for normal day wear than for out wear when they may be dancing or other vigorous activity. However it is light weight and you don&#x27;t feel it at all when applied. I will continue to use it to see if I see a difference in daytime wear.</li>
            <li> This face primer give my face a flawless looks. And the price was great wonderful product and it blend in very good.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product. I saw no difference on my skin when using this product.I like elf, and many of there products are great but not this one.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  It makes your face silky smooth so your foundation goes on easier and you use less.  Love it.  I had read the reviews and they were right.  Excellent product with an excellent price.  I recommend it to anyone and all ages.</li>
            <li> I LOOOOOOOVE using Arbonne&#x27;s primer, but at $40, I don&#x27;t love paying for it.  Elf has provided an awesome alternative, and Elf&#x27;s primer is now my go-to.  I have combination, acne prone skin and am currently using topical clindamycin (from my dermatologist) to keep my skin clear.  Elf&#x27;s primer gives me a flawless look and stays put all day.  Great base for my foundation and eye shadow (I only apply it where I need it, on my t-zone, eyelids and cheekbones).  Keeps my skin relatively matte all day. Not as matte as Arbonne&#x27;s, but darn good for $6. Love that I can also find it at Target too. :-)  Only gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s not the best product I&#x27;ve used, but great product especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I may have gotten 2 uses out of it and I was so disappointed.I couldn&#x27;t believe it. Empty bottle. smdh</li>
            <li> Facial primer, like all e.l.f products is wonderful, however: the application top is defective and I was only able to use it twice.  Product otherwise is absolutely wonderful.  In fact, I ended up re-ordering Face Primer I loved it so much.</li>
            <li> I really thought that I was probably going to breakout by using this since I have sensitive skin. I tried using a M.A.C primer and I break out constantly when using it. But with is primer, it glided on smoothly. It literally felt like NOTHING was there and my face got 10x&#x27;s more coverage than ever before. It lasts longer than you would expect. LOVELY! Will be re-ordering when I run out.</li>
            <li> I just love love love this product ! I have porous skin yet this just makes a perfect canvas and makes pores seem evened out !</li>
            <li> Love this primer! It&#x27;s very light and not greasy at all! I love elf products. sometimes i only wear this primer! I will moisterize my face after getting out of the shower and use only a little bit of primer and cover up and im good to go!</li>
            <li> Not sure if does what it says.!!  Won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> pretty good, i am going to buy another one!</li>
            <li> Amazing! I love what it does for my skin, and does not clog pores or cause breakouts like others I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with this product!  E.L.F products are great! Using this on&lt;br /&gt;Clean skin before applying my foundation creates a flawless line free face! My favorite part.....my mkeup looks exactly same 10 hours later! Fantastic product, arrived on time, affordable and packaged well...yes I&#x27;m ordering again!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it! Feels like satin when you put it on, and it is weightless! Great primer to add to your make up routine</li>
            <li> Love it.  Makes my face feels so smooth and it gives me that nice matte finish.  This has been my second order.  You don&#x27;t need alot either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a primer before, but have been watching a lot of makeup tutorials on Youtube, and everyone seems to use them now. I bought this because it was on the cheaper end, and I was pleasantly surprised. It went on very smooth, was very light, and my CC cream went on much better than without it. If I touch my skin now, it&#x27;s super soft. I love it.</li>
            <li> the e.l.f. Studio Mineral Infused Face Primer  is an excellent primer.. I start to switch to this brand after watching a make-up artist using it on youtube.. no more high prices primers. go for this.. good results in good price</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this. It is very silky in finish and made my foundation look beautiful. Sadly, it also broke my skin out terribly which surprised me. The moment I stopped using this my skin cleared back up. I&#x27;m returning to Palladio primer. Its very similar and its more at $11 but you get more product and most importantly, no breakouts. The reviewers aren&#x27;t kidding when they say that e.l.f.&#x27;s primer is a tiny amount. Its about the size of a glob on your pinkey finger.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly, no irritation. But did not see any difference when I didn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I love this product but the pump didn&#x27;t work. It seemed to be broken when I opened up the top. Other than that this product is good. It leaves your skin smooth.</li>
            <li> Wonderful! Why pay more at the mall for the same results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used one other face primer, but so far I love the e.l.f. face primer. My skin feels smoother and makeup goes on a lot better.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money for the quantity received. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> e.l.f. offers quite a few good products and this is one of them. Countless makeup reviewers, makeup artists, and regular people who make makeup tutorials on YouTube swear by this primer even when most of their other cosmetics are high end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoyed this primer. I&#x27;m still learning how to correctly apply it so I don&#x27;t use more than necessary. But it goes on very smooth. It slides across your fingers and face like the most slippery lubricant you can imagine. At the same time, the texture of it is SOOO soft and silky. It actually feels great just rubbing it between thumb and forefinger. It&#x27;s a pleasant experience!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have with this product, and why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is that there is so little -actual- product in this pump. It looks, by its size, like there is a lot more product inside it. When I started running out, exceptionally soon, I unscrewed the housing and took the pump out and looked inside. The actual well that holds the product is TINY! I mean very tiny. And there&#x27;s still a bit of product on the sides of the well which can&#x27;t be drawn up into the pump for some reason. I&#x27;m having to take it apart and scoop out what I need with a toothpick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of toothpicks, I just had an idea. I took the bottle apart so that I could get an -approximate- measurement for the inside of that little well. When I put the toothpick in, and it hit the bottom, MOST of the toothpick was still above the rim. Probably 2/3rds of it. I marked the toothpick and measured it. The well, from the bottom to the top of the mouth of it where the other bits screw onto it, it&#x27;s exactly 1 inch.  1 inch deep.  The diameter is less than 2 cm wide which is a little less than 3/4 of an inch. So, yeah, teensy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this was one of e.l.f.&#x27;s $1 - $3 products, I&#x27;d have absolutely no problem with that. But for $6, you should get a little more product. At least that&#x27;s MY opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in summary, it&#x27;s a great product and will probably work for most skin types and blend well with most foundations (though I&#x27;m not sure if it would work well under powder foundation). However, the small amount of product you get might not be work the $6 price tag depending on how you use it and what you&#x27;re looking for. Hope this helps.  &#x3D;)nd will probably work for most skin types and blend well with most foundations (though I&#x27;m not sure if it would work well under powder foundation).

            <li> Love the smooth finish this product gives my skin under make-up, It&#x27;s very smooth and velvety feeling. Very Happy with this product</li>
            <li> Amazing, very good!!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this primer.  When I ran out I tried Bare Minerals primer for oil control.  I think that it works better, but it is much more expensive.  If oil is not an issue for you use the E.L.F.</li>
            <li> I was a little unsure when I bought this but I love it. It comes in a nice pump bottle which makes it easy to dispense. One pump will be more than enough for your face. I have enlarged pores and nothing worked until I tried this. It covers it so well you can&#x27;t tell they are there unless your in my face. Even the you will only see a faint trace. If you want flawless make up this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold very much and was missing the inside piece to the pump....couldn&#x27;t pump from it at all. I ended up throwing it away.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love the primer. I did not even know primers for things other than walls, especially not faces, existed. The most I knew was foundation. Hmmm...funny how construction terms made their way into the beauty department!&lt;br /&gt;After watching a makeup tutorial in which the girl started off with a primer and ended up with flawless skin, I decided to order one from Amazon for my flawed skin. The product applies wonderfully, and almost feels like a plastic gel on your fingers. I guess the whole point of the primer is to even out any dings and dents on the skin though I am not sure if its meant for bumps or for people with pimples/acne.&lt;br /&gt;The skin starts feeling very slippery after you put it cause I think the primer erases all friction and the skin becomes pretty even. It lays the foundation for the foundation, which glides over easily, and the rest of the make up.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, my pictures come out great and I attribute it to the way the light bounces off my face, and I am sure it is because of the primer.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this primer! It feels so soft, like silk! The finish is like a gel-to-powder, it&#x27;s very nice, it makes my skin feel very fresh. It creates a really smooth base for my foundation, and makes it last a long time. I also tend to have very dry skin, and this (unlike some other primers I have used) doesn&#x27;t cling to my dry spots, and make my makeup look cakey. This was an impulse buy for me, and I do NOT regret it! I will definitely be repurchasing!</li>
            <li> Works as well as the expensive brands. Very happy with this purchase and will buy again. It&#x27;s nice to buy something that isn&#x27;t tinted which has been a problem for me.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  I definitely recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> I decided to try E.L.Fs primer because I was satisfied with their other products, but I have to say that I won&#x27;t be purchasing this anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way (so you have to be careful with how much you put on)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It takes more time to dry than other primers do.&lt;br /&gt;The only foundations it works well with are Elf foundations - everything else came out cakey or just didn&#x27;t last throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, it doesn&#x27;t last as long or work as well as other primers. So if you&#x27;re looking for a primer that is adaptable and can work with a variety of foundations, I&#x27;d recommend that you look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, someone else mentioned that beauty gurus use/recommend this product, but out of all the gurus that I&#x27;ve checked out&lt;br /&gt;(which is quite a lot) only one or two ever mentioned it.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  Its silky smooth.  I like it.  I would definitely buy this product again.  I have never used primer.</li>
            <li> great primer, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> When I first put this on my face, I really loved it.  I have uneven, acne-prone skin but this primer made my skin super soft and silky to the touch.  However it did not give my foundation and powder the lasting power that I hoped for.  After a few hours my face felt sticky and like it was starting to get oily.  After a nine hour workday with no touch-ups, I looked in the mirror and, although it wasn&#x27;t as bad as I was expecting, my face did look more oily and the foundation seemed to have worn off.  I may try this primer again, but I prefer Revlon Photoready Primer[[ASIN:B006OZF4KG REVLON Photoready Perfecting Primer, 0.91 Fluid Ounce]].  Although it didn&#x27;t make my skin as soft as this primer did, Revlon&#x27;s primer kept my makeup looking fresh all day with no touchups, and for only a few dollars more (depending on where you buy it) you get almost twice the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would reccommend this E.L.F. primer for people with normal skin (and maybe dry skin), but those with more oily or combination complexions might want to try something else.</li>
            <li> This is fine for smoothing out small wrinkles but just not great.  I would not buy this product again because I was expecting more of a dramatic result/</li>
            <li> This product works wonders...I work long hours at work and after a long day at work, my face still looks fresh. I love, love, love this stuff</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fairly inexpensive product, but it makes my face oily within a couple of hours. The quality of it is 3 out of 5 stars. I&#x27;ve tried several primers, high end, low end. This is okay for the price but I have oily skin already so this makes it even worse. Someone with dry skin may have better results with it. I, myself, am not a big fan of face primer until I come across one that is absolutely flawless, which I have yet to find.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other primers in the past (Too Faced and L&#x27;oreal Studio Magic) and this is not my favorite. I was hoping for a less expensive alternative to the other good brands. While it does make my skin feel silky smooth and my makeup looks good over it, it doesn&#x27;t seem to work quite as well as the other two I mentioned. It did not feel greasy or have a bad smell and best of all, I did not have any breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would still recommend it too the budget conscience, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest downside is the pump. It only works half the time and is very irritating. Do not purchase here, it is far less expensive elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: After this ran out, I purchased Cover Girl BB and no longer have the need for any sort of primer, as this BB is AMAZING as a lightweight moisturizer, primer and light foundation all in one.</li>
            <li> This may sound a little funny, but I think I like this product. I don&#x27;t notice that much of a difference in putting on my make up to be honest. I think it stays a bit better when using primer versus without, but the jury is still out on that one.</li>
            <li> Literally felt like I put velvet clouds on my face! Glorious! I wish they made a full body lotion that made me skin feel this way!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! it spreads very well its very silky and it does make the makeup last a very long time, a little goes a long way so 2 pumps are good enough.</li>
            <li> I used it a few times just didn&#x27;t go well on my skin might work for someone else but not me</li>
            <li> In love with ELF products! This primer does the job of a department store brand however I&#x27;m saving lots of money. It helps my makeup stay fresh and stay on longer! Great buy! Arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with my purchase. Fast shipping, good packaging and great price. I love it I also recommend that if your looking for this type of item, buy it with confidence. Thank you</li>
            <li> I bought this primer just out of curiosity to see if it would make a difference with my makeup. I really wasn&#x27;t expecting any miracles considering the price (under $4) suffice to say i was pleasantly surprised. I have combination dry oily skin with my T-zone being extremely oily  i also live in a very hot/ humid country as well, I almost always have to prime my skin before i wear makeup to keep it from melting off my face I&#x27;ve tried a couple primer&#x27;s before like smashbox and mac which  work  great but are wayy more pricey  since I&#x27;ve been using this elf primer it seems to do the same job for far less  also  it feels like i&#x27;m rubbing pearls onto my face I&#x27;m glad i decided to order this product.</li>
            <li> This primer is amazing! It makes my skin SOOOOO soft and smooth. It goes on very easy and makes the foundation I put on afterwards look flawless. The only down side is that it doesn&#x27;t come with much, but, you don&#x27;t need a whole lot to cover the entire face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I have used this everytime I have put makeup on since it came and I really like it.  Thanks again</li>
            <li> I was shopping around for face primers and this one works great!  I love how it&#x27;s very similar to one of my other more expensive face primer. This is a good steal for its price.</li>
            <li> This is a great primer! I use it for special occasions as I usually don&#x27;t wear foundation or anything, but this makes my skin so smooth and nice, I love it. It makes the foundation or powder stay for much longer, and I use it definitely with mineral makeup. It goes great with my Bare Escentuals Mineral Foundation. Very little quantity is needed, and it stays for long. It makes my face really matte (my skin is oily on the T zone) and my face doesn&#x27;t become shiny.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a product like this and I really like it. It makes my face look awesome !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased primers from several brands at Sephora and find the ELF version to be just as good as products that cost $20 or more.</li>
            <li> Thus product worked really well. Makeup slid on really well and set perfectly. No harsh or floral smells, easy to apply</li>
            <li> i am shocked with the tippy top quality of this primer.  it does perfectly, EXACTLY what a primer is created to do.  applying the primer, it magically vanishes beneath my fingertips into skin with a satin finish.  everything after that goes on more evenly and easily.  astonished at the value!</li>
            <li> I had previously used a much more expensive brand of face primer. The e.l.f. face primer works just as well and is a great price.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I heard it is a dupe of a higher end primer. It looks and works just the same for a fraction of the price. It doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts and allows my foundation to glide on and last all day. It gives me a flawless finish.</li>
            <li> i have very oily skin and i use to use the bare minerals primer and then a powder afterwards so that my makeup would hold all day but every dau by lunch my makeup was gone. this hold my makeup in place all day and creates a smooth and silky base before i put my foundation on. will never use anything else</li>
            <li> Bought this for use as a primer.  Overall, not bad.  However, it was quite apparent some of the primer leaked out during transport.  Not enough to contact Amazon about it though.  The texture feels greasy/oily in my hands, but somehow not on my face.  The primer itself does a decent job.  I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in the size of my pores and my make-up seems to stay on a little longer than without it.  The reason I do like it is mainly because I have issues with other primers making my face break-out very badly (and I&#x27;m not prone to break-outs normally).  So, this is a good one in my book.</li>
            <li> I really like this primer. It feels a little greasy at first, but it dries quickly and it leaves a super-smooth and silky face that you can use as a canvass for your makeup. It does make your makeup last longer. It didn&#x27;t break me out, I really have had any problem with the content itself. Also, one pump is enough for your whole face. The issue is with the pump, mine broke after several months. I heard the new batch of primers has an improved pump, so I&#x27;d repurchase it.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and dries. Not slippery feeling like some primers.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and seamless and dries fast.</li>
            <li> I like how it keeps makeup in tact, but I started to get holes and acne on my face after wearing this a few days in a row (and yes I do wash my makeup off at night). I think it may be  concealer side effect in general, but this was one was pretty oily.</li>
            <li> My Primer Came In 6 Days Early and Undamaged!!! I Have Read Previous Reviews Stating That The Bottles Are Only Half Full Which Is Mostly True But You Get What You Pay For. I Love How Soft It Makes My Face Feel &amp;&amp; How My Makeup Stay Where Its Supposed To All Day!! I Love It &amp;&amp; Would Def Recommend It To Others!!</li>
            <li> Compares to BM primer just a better value</li>
            <li> For a cheap product it works well. However, it does not last all day. Good to use right before you are going out for the evening.</li>
            <li> Great primer, it leaves your face so soft and silky</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. Typical primer, nothing fantastic but is primer really fantastic? If you aren&#x27;t a make-up artist or brand snob, click the &amp;#34;buy&amp;#34; button.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and for being my first primer, this works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Favorite affordable and good quality!</li>
            <li> Love it. Goes on silky smooth amd serves it purpose as a primer.</li>
            <li> Great product that doesn&#x27;t make your face feel oily or greasy. I&#x27;ve used Lancome for yrs and this works better and A LOT cheaper.</li>
            <li> Loved this product got it because it was highly recommended product primer for a cheap price cause I&#x27;m a college student. This works really well. Best part is its light weight and it feels oily when you first put it on your face but then you feel nothing after you spread it on and put the rest of your makeup on, it&#x27;s really not oily though and I have sensitive skin so its very important I get good product makeup. It works like it should so I definitely recommend this to others to try as see for themselves!:)</li>
            <li> This product helps me a lot! with acne prone skin, I need something to help concealer stay on my face without looking too cakey. This helps with that pretty well. it feels a bit greasy at first but does not break me out.&lt;br /&gt;There isn&#x27;t a lot of product in the bottle, but a little drop goes a long way on the whole face and neck</li>
            <li> Elf is one of my favorite make up brands and i usually love their products, this one however was not my favorite, i didnt notice a big difference when i used it and when i didnt, also its a very weird texture. I have very sensitive skin and am alergic to several things including latex and adhesives and this product did not cause a reaction however i wouldnt recommend this product, the elf mist and set spray because it is amazing, not only does it feel really good when you spray it on, but one spray will keep your makeup set all day</li>
            <li> it simply feels wow on skin. It is so so smooth and silky.  i will ordered for every girlfriend i know LOL ;)</li>
            <li> I bought my e.l.f. primer from Target for $3.00.  It is a basic primer and doens&#x27;t claim to do anything fancy, like cover wrinkles or blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After apply this foundation, my skin feels softer and smoother making the application of foundation easier.  It does not hide any wrinkles or cover blemishes or dark spots.  It goes on transparent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $3.00 it&#x27;s worth it as a basic primer.</li>
            <li> Looks fine with me but it is very little product inside</li>
            <li> 5 stars it is so worth it! Smooth, hypo-allergenic (even for SUPER sensitive skin) and works as a base for makeup! I use moisturizer (LUSH - celestial) and let that dry, then apply this. This stuff feels so AWESOME on your face and fingers I just love it!!</li>
            <li> An absolutely beautiful primer. A little goes a long way. It gives a flawless,non-greasy, non-sticky finish under makeup. It compares favorably to bare minerals primer which I swear by.</li>
            <li> Very nice thank you to upscale deal</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It helps my make-up go on smoother, and my face appear brighter.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS!!!!! it gives my face a matte look after applying and smooth it out. again i love it. I hate that the amount of product is so small. Its like half the container.</li>
            <li> This does nothing on my skin.</li>
            <li> Feels good on the skin, Great value!</li>
            <li> Love the texture of the product. Had my face feeling smooth. No need for lotion after washing ur face, just apply this and ur make up and ur good to go.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my face feel and helps my makeup glide on. I have very oily skin so this does not help with that but it does help makeup go on and not soak in my skin</li>
            <li> This provided a nice base before applying bronzer or makeup. It smoothed out my skin so&lt;br /&gt;my makeup when on nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: not a very large amt in this big bottle but will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This primer feels very smooth and soft when I apply it to my skin. I will buy again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any difference and the smell is a little different. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again or recommend, waste of six dollars.</li>
            <li> Ehh it&#x27;s okay, not all that but I mean you get what you pay for right? It does leave your skin very soft. I would use this primer just for when I go to work but not a night out on the town</li>
            <li> this product rates &#x27;okay&#x27; for me - I was hoping it would create a better look then it does, however, it&#x27;s certainly acceptable.</li>
            <li> I love this product. When I put on my makeup it went on so smoothly.  This is a must buy.</li>
            <li> When I receieved this primer it looked used and the top where the product is dispensed out, doesn&#x27;t even work!!!!!!! Highly upset with this purchase :(</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this primer. I have tried numerous primers from cheap drugstore to spendy department store brands and nothing has worked like this. I really mean it. It goes on so smooth and helps my foundation stay on. I actually use Bare Minerals Powder/Foundation. This E.LF. Studio Mineral Infused Face Primer is the best I am so happy.</li>
            <li> I received it quickly but when I went to pump some out hardly anything came out so the only way I can use it is by digging my pinky finger in the bottle and only way it works well is if you put alot on. Overall you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Probably could be a great item but the pump is horrible. When I can actually get the product out i love it and its silky smooth. But the fact that it doesn&#x27;t work 80% of the time makes it not worth it. Like they should have at least put it in a tub I don&#x27;t understand. Get another drug store brand for $5 it&#x27;ll be better.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this primer, I really was surprised, but I really like it! I have tried some other&#x27;s with tint, ad I like the fact that this is clear, it goes on so smooth. I will order it again!</li>
            <li> I was looking for an inexpensive primer to hold my makeup in place(I bought the NYC primer &amp; it didn&#x27;t work at all!) i was skeptical about this primer &amp; I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work or not- thank god it did! I put it on before applying my makeup &amp; lasted 8 hours without my makeup sliding off! I love elf! At $6 you can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my oily skin</li>
            <li> Really good primer worked great on my severely sunburned face for my makeup to go in smooth</li>
            <li> I have never used a primer before and was happy to try this since the cost was so low. I am amazed with this product. It feels fantastic on your face. It goes on like silk, but is not in any way oily. I use mineral powder foundation on top of this primer and am very happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so nice to be able to buy excellent quality cosmetics at a reasonable price -- and rare! I will be reordering this when I run out!</li>
            <li> Very silky smooth makes my makeup go one beautifully I love how long it holds my makeup for ecspecially in the heat Down south. Love love love it.</li>
            <li> The primer is extremely smooth on my skin and it works better than I expected!</li>
            <li> This serves its purpose. I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Love this! My 17 yr old daughter actually got me started with this. I use to borrow hers all the time, so i decided to buy my own &amp; replace hers! Works great with MAC concealer &amp; powder! Finish product is flawless!! Price is great!</li>
            <li> Best primer I&#x27;ve ever used and it doesn&#x27;t cost an arm. Will always buy this primer.</li>
            <li> product is awesome the pump I&#x27;m not to impressed with. I might have gotten a defective pump.</li>
            <li> Wish ELF could sell a bigger one! I love this product!</li>
            <li> It took like a month and a half to arrive, but it wasn&#x27;t the seller&#x27;s fault. I have no complain with them, they acted absolutely great with me, sent an apology and even refund the product value due the late arrive.&lt;br /&gt;The primer is awesome, I really love how it feels in my skin and how soft and silky my skin gets after applying it.&lt;br /&gt;I would totally recomend you!</li>
            <li> one of the best primers I have used, I know it is cheaper at a target or a kmart for around 3.00 but I don&#x27;t have one close so I was okay with paying the extra 3.00 and it really is awesome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased with this product. I haven&#x27;t been using it with mineral powders or anything, but a mousse like foundation and it works just fine. I&#x27;ve never felt anything like this before. It looks like a gel once you pump a small amount out onto your hand but it smooths onto your skin and feels like nothing! It leaves my skin feelings airy, light and silky smooth and soft. It has also helped me quite a bit with my breakouts. I haven&#x27;t had hardly any serious outbreaks lately and for that I&#x27;m beyond thankful. :)&lt;br /&gt;I love it and can&#x27;t wait to get back to the States. Living overseas I have to wait so long to get packages so I have to kind of ration it out for a while.&lt;br /&gt;Amazed by this stuff.</li>
            <li> When I first purchased this primer, I loved it. It was silky, smooth, and helped my makeup stay on all day. However, I used it up very quickly. I&#x27;m talking 2 weeks, people. I took the pump off in an attempt to get the last bit of product out, only to find that the actual well was TINY. Around 3/4 of the bottle is empty space. After searching on amazon for the exact ounce measurement, I discovered it was only 0.47 ounces. The bottle looks like it must hold at LEAST 2.5. I really don&#x27;t think that that tiny, sample-sized bit of product is worth 6 bucks, even though I enjoyed it while it lasted. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. e.l.f. is plating some tricky little games in an effort to get more money, something that I strongly disapprove of. I wont be trusting e.l.f. for my purchases in the future.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t make a difference in my makeup application or wear. It didn&#x27;t give me the smooth base or staying power I was wanting. Would not buy again</li>
            <li> I have only used the product once so far. I really like how the product feels on my face. It is silky smooth and very light weight. I also like how my make up applies over it. My make up did seem to last longer even getting a little sweaty in the sun. The bottle is deceiving however it does say how much product you are getting and I had heard other reviews saying that you don&#x27;t get as much product as the bottle makes it seem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I am really disappointed about is that the straw for the product to get sucked into the pump is not there. I don&#x27;t know if it just fell off and is in the bottle somewhere or if it just was missed completely. I was sort of able to get it to work by turning bottle upside down and shaking the product toward the top of bottle and using the pump holding bottle upside down. However because of this flaw I feel like much of the product will be wasted seeing as it will be very hard to get out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin - but this primer did not work at all for me!</li>
            <li> This stuff feels great on my skin! The tiny amount of product you get is ridiculous. I probably won&#x27;t buy this again, but as an introduction to what primer can do this was enough.</li>
            <li> This product has made severe changes in my skin. I have way less acne and my skin doesn&#x27;t get nearly as oily throughout the day. Keeps my makeup fairly noncomedogenic (doesn&#x27;t go into my pores). I love it! Get it!</li>
            <li> I wish I could buy a lifetime supply of this product.  It makes my pores literally disappear and really does feel like I&#x27;m applying something silky smooth to my skin.  I wear this directly on top of my moisturizing face lotion and then put on my face powder and in this winter weather it helps keep my face looking and feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love the fact, that this is so creamy that it makes you feel like you&#x27;re not wearing nothing.. It makes you feel like it&#x27;s a second skin and it last for a long time. Actually, although, no make up last for that long.. But, this is definitely helping your make up to last for a much longer time. I like it due to the fact, that this makes you feel like youre not really wearing anything.. It feels like your just wearing a lotion and it glides on your skin.. LOVES!</li>
            <li> A little bit really goes a loooong way with this primer.  I have used expensive primers and I don&#x27;t think they are any better than this one. My makeup goes on so smooth and stays put all day when I use this primer.</li>
            <li> This primer right here is the bomb. I&#x27;ve been looking for a primer that could combust my oily skin and this is the only that holds of my oiliness for about a good 5 hrs and more if I do minor blotting.</li>
            <li> This primer is very good considering the price. It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t make your skin oily after wearing this product under your foundation all day. I would recommend it to everybody. Elf is on point</li>
            <li> this is a good product but not much different then my drug store on. i will use it but when it is gone I will goback to my drug store brand it does the same thing and same coverage for less money</li>
            <li> I ordered this b/c I need $6 to get free shipping. Before this, I&#x27;d only used Hourglass Mineral Veil Primer (which costs $20 for the smallest size). I was leery b/c I have very sensitive, acne-prone skin (I&#x27;m 48!) - so I was hoping for the best but not expecting too much since it only costs $6. I am now a TOTAL CONVERT!!!  It controls the oil in my T-zone, doesn&#x27;t itch my face, and the best part is it doesn&#x27;t break me out AT ALL - no irritation whatsover. It just glides over my face - and I NEVER have to reapply my makeup during the day after I do it in the morning. (This last part blows my mind b/c my skin is still oily at my age &amp; seems to drink in my Bareminerals foundation - so much that I&#x27;d have to reapply again around lunchtime. Never again! :)  Try this - you will not be sorry and WILL be quite as amazed as I was/still am!!!</li>
            <li> Feels and looks just like smash box but for WAY WAY LESS!!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product for the price.  It compares to more expensive brands.  I will purchase again.  Packaged very well.  It is a very good value</li>
            <li> Great with making creases invisible, but when i put it all over the face it made my face greasy and I have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff, I use it every single morning! I can definitly tell a difference if I don&#x27;t use it. My only issue was the pump part stopped working, I&#x27;m not sure if there was a little hose that reached down in the bottom or what, so I usually have to scrap it out. I&#x27;ll be sure to check my next bottle to see for the hose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only other \\&quot;issue\\&quot; would be the price, I found this at target for only $3 vs. almost $9 on amazon!</li>
            <li> I love it!! Make my face feels so soft and definitely gives my Makeup  a radiant look. Definitely a regular buyer.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve searched high and low for a primer that actually made a difference and didn&#x27;t clog my pores. this one does the trick and i use about half the amount of foundation.</li>
            <li> Omg! Let me just say that this primer works really well.  My makeup stayed on better and longer, and my face did not get oily. This is great!</li>
            <li> I rated the way i did is because i do like it,&lt;br /&gt;It goes on just as good as too face primer and cost alot less.</li>
            <li> Allows foundation to stay on for many hours and is humidity-proof. Great product.</li>
            <li> This primer makes my skin looks and feels super smooth after applying! And it is also inexpensive. Definitely worth trying girls!!</li>
            <li> I hate to give such a negative review, but I just don&#x27;t get this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers were correct that the container is deceiving as the actual amount of product is really small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product itself, I like how light it is and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel oily. That&#x27;s about all I like about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t do what primer is supposed to. All it does for me is cause my pressed powder foundation to clump up and get all icky.</li>
            <li> The primer feels nice,but it&#x27;s nothing like the more expensive primers. It doesn&#x27;t give my face that photoshopped look that I get with other primers. Good primer for every day use if you&#x27;re looking for something cheap, but you could just as easily do without.</li>
            <li> not sure if this is useful at all  -  makes skin smooth but makeup dont hold longer at all -</li>
            <li> Feels great on your skin. I have had more expensive primers and this is now my go to primer.</li>
            <li> The product itself is easy to apply, however, I notice no difference between when I use the primer, and when I don&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s not &amp;#34;priming&amp;#34; anything... it&#x27;s just adding another step to the makeup process for no reason.  My makeup wears off just as it did without the primer.</li>
            <li> Feels nice going on and I do see a difference in the oil on my face when wearing this product but the amount you get is SO small. The picture (and bottle) are very deceiving.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I was trying to save money on primer. This is okay but it did cause me to break out and made my skin red. So I&#x27;ll be sticking with my smashbox primer from now on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good primer but it runs out quite fast</li>
            <li> Runs out too quickly. Looks like there&#x27;s more than there actually is...</li>
            <li> It does a great job as what primers are supposed to do. It makes my face so smooth so when I apply my concealer, foundation, and powder it looks so even and gorgeous. It keeps the facial makeup on my face all day without any bit of fading. I also have the elf eye concealer which is not as awesome as this facial primer but it is decent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the price here on Amazon really is unfair. This was only $6 in Target.</li>
            <li> Love the primer but the pumps NEVER work.  E.L.F&#x27;s fault not the seller.</li>
            <li> loved it thank you&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again</li>
            <li> My order arrived early, and after using it the last two days, I am thrilled. My foundation goes on easier, looks smoother and I don&#x27;t get anywhere near as shiny in my t-zone as I used to. I wear my makeup for nearly 12 hours a day and it stays flawless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only issue I had with it was that the pump doesn&#x27;t really work - I just use a Q-tip to scoop out how much I want and it actually makes it easier, weirdly enough. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> No little straw on inside to make pump work. I had to take the bottle apart &amp; get it out from the bottom. I wonder if that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so cheap!</li>
            <li> Found this primer to be effective and inexpensive.  The primer is easy to blend onto your face and can be used all over the face.  It is a great alternative to more expensive products.  It really helps the foundation and makeup last for a long time.  I found it at a Target store and was surprised at how well it worked.&lt;br /&gt;  The bottle is kind of large, which helps in dispensing the product, but as others have said, there is not a lot of product in the bottle.  There is a pump to dispense the primer.  Overall, it is a good primer that spreads on clear.  You only need a little to cover the face, and it can be used for the lids of eyes if you don&#x27;t have an eyeshadow primer.  But, you really only need a very little of the product, as is the case with most face primers.</li>
            <li> Works surprisingly well for the price. Tiny dot goes a long way, and it didn&#x27;t make me break out at all. If fact my skin might be clearer..?</li>
            <li> So glad I discovered this face primer! I was using the smashbox one that was 4 times the price of this little keeper. This is my second time ordering elf studio mineral primer and it still feels like the same exact smashbox formula to me. Awesome dupe! Its all about saving those hard earned bucks!! (Or spending them on something way more fun!!!)</li>
            <li> Elf have great products for a good price. This works just as well for me as a top brand sold for a lot more.</li>
            <li> Loving it so far... Goes only smoothly &amp; helps my foundation glide on just right.</li>
            <li> i love this product.  love the way it feels.  the pump will not work and it isn&#x27;t worth the money for shipping it back.  disappointed.to g&lt;br /&gt;I have to stick a q -tip in to the bottle  to get some out..</li>
            <li> makes my skin really oily and shiny.  I don&#x27;t like it at all :/</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth as butter!  Great product!</li>
            <li> Works great under powder or liquid makeup. Giving a smooth young skin look!</li>
            <li> Second bottle. Better than some expensive brands.</li>
            <li> works okay.  feels like really light mineral oil.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work well with some foundations makes your skin look dry and flake.Now it may not do that with all skin types.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes such a major difference!  It was a really nice surprise.&lt;br /&gt;I had ordered a more expensive primer that was recommended to me and noticed that this was on sale - I decided to get both to compare.  They both were near perfect and did not cause any breakouts.  However, ELF Primer is around $20 cheaper!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t purchased this off of amazon (because I only just saw it online) but I purchase this product regularly in store. It&#x27;s the best primer I have found for price and works amazing!!! I am a 24 y/o african american with very oily skin (as in I can&#x27;t go more than 2 hours without using blotting papers or blotting powder to get rid of my shine). This primer works like a dream at taming the oil in my skin. I&#x27;m sure that there are more expensive primers that would work better but I have yet to find a comparable one in this price range. It works so well for me though that I&#x27;m not even sure I&#x27;d want to try a different brand. Also, for those of you with sensitive skin like me, this doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or make me break out at all! I am very prone to acne and peeling skin if I don&#x27;t use the right products. And one more point of reference it works great with my pricier makeup brand! I use MAC foundation, blush, blotting powder (everything else practically) and this primer works great with it, no conflicts! I&#x27;d imagine it&#x27;d work well with most makeup brands. This is worth a try especially for the price. Even on my no makeup days I have to use this primer. I highly recommend it especially if you&#x27;re in my situation.    Also, to address the comments on the deceiving packaging... they&#x27;re accurate, but you&#x27;ll get the same thing if you buy it in store. If you remove the lid the chamber is very small so the bottle doesn&#x27;t last long. If you&#x27;re so inclined, once the pump stops working you can usually get a little more out of the bottle if you take off the lid. I wear makeup almost every day (with primer) and one bottle lasts me close to a month.</li>
            <li> horrible..my face face after 1-2 h looks even worse then without this primer...very disappointed</li>
            <li> Not sure if its my combo skin but it just doesn&#x27;t do much for me and it makes my skin extra greasy. Used it a couple of times before throwing it away. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
            <li> I received it on time! I&#x27;m in love with how soft it is. I just wish there was more of it. There&#x27;s a lot less in there than appears. Also my pachage arrived with the box all broken open and damaged. Overall  do adore this product!</li>
            <li> Very lightweight feeling and makes it easier to appy and remove makeup. Definitely going to order more.</li>
            <li> Held my make up in place excellent. No problems mixing blush, bronzer, concealer. Great product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. Not only does it make my face smooth, but it help my make up stay longer than normal. It makes any eye design pop with brilliant color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You simply apply and then put your makeup on. Such an amazing product! Can&#x27;t beat it for this price.</li>
            <li> I usually use Rimmel, but Elf is actually great.  Goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, a little goes a long way, and the price is amazing. Even better buying direct from the companies site. I use this, along with setting spray, and it causes cheaper, as well as more expensive makeups to last all day - no smudging. Specifically I use it with essence soft-touch mousse (relatively inexpensive), and faceatelier ultra foundation pro (more spendy). Works equally well with both. Sister is also very impressed with product, and it&#x27;s ability to rpovide a base fr a smudge free- smooth look, despite activity and the elements.</li>
            <li> Felt like I smeared grease on my face. Did feel soft and smooth but COATED.</li>
            <li> I used to buy primer that cost  4 times as much for  half the size here.  This stuff works even better! This goes on very smooth and primes your face for makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased.  Great  deal..</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me but I couldn&#x27;t see the difference. The finish didnt look no different. My makeup last as long as it always do.</li>
            <li> Meets expectations. It IS in a small bottle but very little is needed per application! A little goes a long way! Feels like silk going on and helps makeup wear longer. Seller was excellent! Received faster than expected and packaging was just as if I purchased it in a store! Very happy!!</li>
            <li> My foundation application has never looked more smooth and even!  This is exactly what I needed to give my makeup a flawless look! Also, I have very sensitive skin and I have not had any problems with break-outs or irritation.  Very little product needed for application.  Love this!!</li>
            <li> You need a very small amount of this product to do it&#x27;s job. It&#x27;s great! It arrived on time and in good packaging.</li>
            <li> ive always used face primer before i was using sheercover the $50 tube and yes it would last longer but this product for the price is awesome and i even like it better than sheercovers primer. I would recomment the clear primer because my face got pretty oily with the purple one.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Makes skin feel soft and foundation glides right on. As terrific as this product is, there is VERY little of it. The bottle is misleading; you think there is a reasonable amount in the bottle, but no. Still, it&#x27;s a nice product just be prepared to replace often.</li>
            <li> Love how silky and smooth this feels on my face. But my foundation still creases. The purpose of using this is to allow for a smoother finish. Not too convinced.</li>
            <li> By far the best primer I&#x27;ve ever used. Have recommended to pretty much everyone I know!</li>
            <li> It makes you look finished, goes on easily because it is a gel and you don&#x27;t need too much to cover your entire face.</li>
            <li> How am I suppose to use this if the pump doesnt work at all? I want my money back or a new one that actually work, and I just dont know how to proceed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really loving this primer. It has really helped my foundation go on for a flawless finish. This is a fantastic, cost effective primer.</li>
            <li> It helps in some areas of my face, but not all.  Was hoping it would help more when I applied my foundation.  Feels great on my face</li>
            <li> Previously I have purchased some of their mineral makeup and was satisfied other than finding it was not made in the USA.  However when the skincare product came, not only was it made elsewhere it had multiple parabens in the ingredients.  Sorry, it went in the trash.</li>
            <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful, glowing, pore-free looking skin. While it doesn&#x27;t hide the larger pores, the smaller ones disappear. I haven&#x27;t found a better primer for the price. It works great, and many people noticed a difference after I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Feels greasy- It only feels greasy when you put the primer on by itself. Once foundation or powder is applied, the greasy feeling goes away.&lt;br /&gt;Dry skin- Use a light moisturizer, the primer dries you out really fast.&lt;br /&gt;Breakouts- A lot of people say that this product makes them break out after some use, this can be prevented by scrubbing your face regularly. Dimethicone creates a barrier on the skin that gives you that flawless, pore free look. However it also creates a barrier that traps all the dirt and oil underneath it.&lt;br /&gt;Simply scrubbing your skin and using a light moisturizer prevent anything bad I&#x27;ve found to happen when using this product.</li>
            <li> i love it makes my eye shadow last longer.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 30&#x27;s and needed a primer due to skin changes. This had good reviews and a great price so I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;I have no problems with acne since a teen. After the first use the next day I had severe break out all over my face. It was more then just a few pimples. The areas of the skin that were even slightly inflamed or pimples that were popped (yeah, I know gross but true life isn&#x27;t always pretty) became swaths of red raised inflamed areas. My face looks horrible and the outbreaks kept coming even on the 3rd day. No amount of face washing, scrubbing, or acne lotion has helped But I think it is finally starting to calm down today after putting ACV on my face. This product was Awful for me.&lt;br /&gt;It also did not give me the coverage I needed for larger pores. It does go on incredibly smooth and silky. Feels sheer and light, pretty nice feeling on the skin. But Perhaps too light for those needing a heavier primer for aging and fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;I have never broken out from Makeup before in all the years I have been applying it.&lt;br /&gt;I do NOT recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product.  My foundation goes on so easily.  My skin feels very smooth.  Just LOVE this product!!!</li>
            <li> I use it everyday under my make up.  Makeup blends and is so much prettier with this on under it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this product. I like to have two full sets of my must-have makeup products--one set of more expensive items (usually NARS, Chanel, Benefit, Smashbox) and one set of items that I can buy at the drug store. Smashbox&#x27;s Photo Finish Foundation Primer has always been a staple in my more expensive set, and I&#x27;ve been searching for years for a cheaper primer to be Smashbox&#x27;s counterpart. Hadn&#x27;t found it until I tried e.l.f.&#x27;s primer and now I&#x27;m hooked! I see NO difference in the quality of this primer compared to Smashbox&#x27;s. My makeup stays on just as long, and the consistency of the product is exactly the same. I do agree with the other reviews in that the e.l.f. primer runs out pretty quickly, but for $5-6 a bottle I&#x27;m not complaining.</li>
            <li> I like this primer. Its inexpensive and it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling oily. My only complaint is that the bottle seems so much bigger than it needs to be for the amount of makeup you get. It just doesn&#x27;t seem very eco-friendly.</li>
            <li> This is ridiculously cheap primer, and as we all know, you get what you paid for. It&#x27;s not a terrible product, but it&#x27;s not REALLY going to help your makeup stay on all day. It DOES help fill in some pores and gives a bit more of a velvety look, but it&#x27;s no miracle.</li>
            <li> Apparently, the primer bottle worked just fine. I have actually bought several bottles of this since I made my original review and realize that the problem was me and not the bottle. I love the feel of the primer. So slick and silky on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaving the old review even though it mainly shows that I am a doofus.&lt;br /&gt;-----------&lt;br /&gt;I like the feel of the primer but I have to remove the top and use a qtip to get the product in the bottle. There is no &amp;#34;straw&amp;#34; in my pump. Just a pump top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The primer itself works fine, and I use it regularly. I didn&#x27;t contact the seller and let them know because the product was so cheap that I was like &amp;#34;Whatever. I will just make it work.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would get it again, and if that pump was broken as well then I would not ever get it again. I use lots of other e.l.f cosmetics though and think they are a great deal for the price so perhaps that is why I am being lenient on the broken bottle pump.</li>
            <li> Nothing comes out of the bottle. The pump is broken.  Do not order from this seller.  I like this product but need to get one that isn&#x27;t broken.</li>
            <li> I havent try it yet bit i think this product is worth it hope i enjoy using this and well see</li>
            <li> Too oily and its difficult to get solid pumps out of the container. I will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> Makes your face smooth and silky but there isnt much at all in the bottle</li>
            <li> Thanks to the Drugstore Princess on Tumbler for recommending as well as several other dupe sites. The texture is so Unique</li>
            <li> This product is a pretty great primer. However, the pump does.not.work. I opened it and immediately had to open the top and shake out the product. I would definitely buy again if the pump issue was fixed.</li>
            <li> I like this because it makes my skin feel smooth, but I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s actually doing anything to enhance the way my makeup looks at all. I never really noticed a difference. It also dried up inside of the container super quick and started to sort of ball up when I tried to apply it to my face. Don&#x27;t see myself buying this again.</li>
            <li> I will not ever go without this product. It is by far the best primer I have ever used.  It  minimizes my pours and makes my foundation look flawless</li>
            <li> This was ok. It has this mineral and I can barely feel it going on my face. It&#x27;s so light, but can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s really works. It does not come with much, so u have to ask yourself if it&#x27;s worth it. I did see die thing else for a substitute as this at Walmart, for $5 I just can&#x27;t think of the name brand by maybe I&#x27;ll be back on here to add a photo of it!</li>
            <li> For an affordable, easy to use Primer. I suggest this e.l.f. SUPER cheap, but works great!</li>
            <li> I love this primer, makes my makeup long lasting, is smooth and light, my skin really love it!!!</li>
            <li> I have an active job and noticed that by early afternoon, my mineral make-up was waning.  This product gets me through the day.  I have only had it for a week but I am sold.  It does what it say&#x27;s it will do, does not feel heavy or greasy.  It works; I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a novice when it comes to primers but I had heard that they make a huge difference when it comes to makeup. I decided to go for this primer just in case if it didn&#x27;t work I wouldn&#x27;t be out a lot of money. Let me tell you it DOES make a BIG difference! I see no laugh lines, my pores look smaller, the wrinkles under my eyes are less visible and it dries pretty fast. This is now a must have in my makeup bag, a little goes a long way &amp; I love it! I didn&#x27;t buy my primer from amazon, I actually bought it at Target for the same price. So if you want to get this A.S.A.P. I would check at your local Target, I&#x27;m a very happy customer! You can&#x27;t beat the price &amp; it works very well!</li>
            <li> Very nice.  My makeup goes on so much better with this product.</li>
            <li> I had no idea how much face primer could change my makeup game. e.l.f Studio Mineral Infused Face Primer is first of all a great bargain and is a staple in any frugal beauty queen&#x27;s battlestation. A little goes a long way with this product, and I&#x27;ve found that a bottle lasts me a few months. This makes the price literally cents a day for a product that smooths out the fine lines in my face, makes other products more effective and vibrant, and generally makes applying other makeup easier. It really changed how I do my makeup, and I would highly recommend it for any skin type on any budget.</li>
            <li> Nothing fancy but better than not using a primer. I compared it to Avon MagiX face perfector and prefer the Avon. Prices are similar</li>
            <li> I heard about this face primer from someone on YouTube who had tried it and loved it. I figured for $6 it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to give it a try. The formula is clear and goes on really smooth, it wasn&#x27;t too runny, thick, sticky or smelly like others I have tried. It made my liquid foundation glide right over my pores. It also seemed to keep me relatively shine free as my day went on and my makeup stayed put. No melty makeup shift midway through your work day. I plan to repurchase this product once I run out, which might take awhile because you also don&#x27;t need to use very much.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying this is the first primer I have used and it worked really good I tend to have dry skin and I peel a lot with this primer it helped cover it up. I thought it wouldn&#x27;t work but it does I recommend it and remember that any type of make up you use takes about 3 days or more to adjust to your skin so if you buy this don&#x27;t expect it to instantly work, but it does work it took me only like two days of using it to adjust .Also it gives you a natural shine all day and it helps keep your make up looking nice I really recommend it if you are looking for something cheap and that works good. It last a while also it&#x27;s in a small container but with a bit it covers your whole face. I have been using it for 3 months and I use it about 4-5 days a week and it still has some last a while</li>
            <li> Been using for about 2 weeks read other reviews gave it a try.  Never used a primer before I am 48 fine lines not a lot but do like the difference in how my face and make up look.  Would highly reccommend.  At first thought the pump was broken but it started to work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always up for trying E.L.F. products because it&#x27;s an affordable yet good brand. I love a lot of their products such as eyeliners and brushes, and I keep coming back to see what&#x27;s new. I got this at Target and thought I&#x27;d leave a review here. I needed a primer because my skin&#x27;s texture is never very smooth (and it&#x27;s SUPER sensitive) so I thought I would just give this a try. Many of ELF&#x27;s products I just love. This one, sadly, I did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it&#x27;s kinda pretty. The packaging makes it look like it&#x27;s a more fancy/expensive product (thought the plastic FEELS cheap). But trying to get the product out can be a pain. The pump seems very cheap. It never wanted to come out and when it finally did, it spurted out very little at a time (which was annoying). I have the bottle sitting in front of me as I&#x27;m typing this, trying to pump a drop onto my finger, and it doesn&#x27;t work at all. I took it apart and noticed that on the pump, there&#x27;s no tube going down the center of the bottle to actually GET the product up and out of the bottle. It&#x27;s just a little stub. So once you&#x27;ve used it enough for it to go down about 1/2 of an inch, the rest won&#x27;t come out anymore. That&#x27;s just lame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now let me try and explain the weird texture of this stuff... When I say weird, I definitely mean weird. Visually it looks like a gel, but it feels much lighter and softer, almost silky. It&#x27;s so light and &#x27;soft&#x27;, it almost has a greasy feel to it, which I really don&#x27;t like.. On my fingers and the back of my hand, once it&#x27;s had a minute to set and soak in, it feels very soft and smooth. But on my face, it just feels greasy and gross. Even leaving it for a while to soak into my skin it still felt horrible. Whether it was freshly put onto my face or left to sit, foundation over it just didn&#x27;t work. It made the texture weird and the foundation didn&#x27;t last long at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this in different ways for different amounts of product and different periods of time, and none of them seemed to work for me. I never wore it more than a couple times a week because it left my skin very red and irritated the next day. It totally broke me out. That was the cherry on top of a bad primer sundae. I stopped using it for a while and my skin cleared up. Then I tried it again (just to be sure) and again, red skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum it all up, I don&#x27;t like this at all. If for some weird reason I needed primer for my fingers or hands then it feels great! But definitely not my face. We all have different skin, what may work for me might not work for someone else. All I can recommend is that you give it a try. It&#x27;s not a whole lot of money out of the pocket, and it&#x27;s worth a shot before you commit to buying something much more expensive. You never know, this could be the best primer you&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> Very great price for a very great product!  I have visible pores, and this primer does a great job of making them a lot less visible.  I will continue to use it and would recommend it to others!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite primer.  I have never broken out because of this product (which happens with a lot of others), my skin looks so smooth, and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I was using a gift card or I wouldn&#x27;t have paid for it. I was so surprised. It helps your liquid makeup glide on without thinning it out. It feels like when you put silicone lubricant on a piece of machinery. It works great but I don&#x27;t use it every day. You can definitely tell you have it on as your makeup feels heavier. I don&#x27;t wear it on real hot days.</li>
            <li> I really like this primer! Keeps my foundation well set and it isn&#x27;t oily either. And you need a really small amount to last you the entire day! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different primers and so far I love the ELF</li>
            <li> Good primer- easy to apply, makes makeup look smoother and stay longer.</li>
            <li> Good, but it&#x27;s the only primer I&#x27;ve used so I have nothing to compare it to. I like it though, and it&#x27;s so cheap!</li>
            <li> Finishes too quickly!</li>
            <li> This primer works great. i can definetely tell the difference in my makeup when i use this primer. Everything just goes on smoother and looks better.</li>
            <li> e.l.f. claims that the primer works as a smooth canvas upon which to place your makeup which allows it to help your makeup stay on longer and is also supposed to help diminish the look of larger pores. Now I will admit that it does go on very smoothly and makes your face feel quite nice (probably has alot to do with the fact that it&#x27;s silicone based), however, I suffer from slightly enlarged pores on my cheeks and nose and I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in this department. I have used some higher end products that also failed in this department as well though, so I can&#x27;t bash on e.l.f. too hard. Bottom-line, for the price I doubt you will find anything better than this primer and it does do a pretty good job of making your makeup application go a bit smoother but if you have a little more money to spend and are looking for something that will help with more size I recommend either Benefits \\&quot;Porefessional\\&quot; or Too Faced \\&quot;Primed and Poreless\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Smooth great product and im picky</li>
            <li> I noticed the first day I used it that I never needed to touch up my foundation or cover up at all! My blush stayed where I put it and my trouble spots remained out of sight and out of mind. The next day I used it I went along my business as usual, but rubbed my face against my arm at some point because I noticed I had makeup on my sleeve! I looked in the mirror and sure enough, my forehead wasn&#x27;t as full coverage looking as I put it on, it did hold onto some of the makeup though. Also, right after you wash and moisturize your face (and wait about 5 minutes for the moisturizer to absorb into your skin) you are suppose to just apply a little pump to the back of your hand. I use my fingers to apply it to my face, starting from the center of my face (my nose) and working out to even the edges and neck, moving in small circular motions. You shouldn&#x27;t need more than one or two pumps. It does feel greasy when you apply it, but all three bottles that I went through felt like that, so its okay. Just make sure to wash your face very well at the end of the day to make sure it doesn&#x27;t clog up your pores!</li>
            <li> Ok. Not as good as the one currently using. Like the price!</li>
            <li> It is a clear facial primer. I love how soft it feels when it goes on your skin. It makes my face feel amazing. I use a liquid tinted moisturizer with it and it works amazing. I have blemishes now that I use this with my make-up regime. I just wish you could order it on it&#x27;s own instead of as an add on item!</li>
            <li> This is the first primer I&#x27;ve ever used so I don&#x27;t have anything to base experience on but I will say my makeup looks just as good after 8 hours of work. It keeps it on and looking fresh all day so im.happy with it. I&#x27;m going to try to primed and poles next from elf</li>
            <li> This product was no good at all, I used it to prevent my face from getting greasy from my cover up and at the end of the day I noticed that my face was very greasy. Would not recommend this product!</li>
            <li> A good primer for the price.</li>
            <li> Love it. It makes foundation just glide on. It is so light.</li>
            <li> The Elf mineral primer works much like the Smashbox primer, only for a quarter of the price.</li>
            <li> Leave my skin soft and even with a velvet sensation that prepare for a foundation. Worth it !!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve absolutely always loved this primer and on here it&#x27;s cheaper than target!</li>
            <li> The product itself was good, but the pumped stopped working and I wasn&#x27;t able to get the rest of the product out.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite e.l.f product. It is easy to apply and really does prime your face for denser makeups like concealer. The price is fair for the amount you receive. The only problem I had when I first received this product was that I kept using too much. You really only need one, maybe two, pumps and you will have plenty to cover your face without saturating it or missing spots. I will definitely purchase this product when I run out. I also bought the tinted version of this product and found the color to blend to my skin evenly. It also helped even out my complexion because I suffer from rosacea so finding a product that won&#x27;t irritate my face and will even it out can be a challenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: My thoughts and opinions are my own. I was not compensated in any way for my review.</li>
            <li> I guess i should have know that it wouldnt work.  The brand and price tells it all.  I dont like the texture of it too thin and the makeup doesnt stay on all day.</li>
            <li> This primer is AWESOME! It gives the most crazy-thin, sheer mask of coverage over your face and smooths everything out to give you a flawless canvas to put your makeup on. I don&#x27;t use this every time I do my makeup, but when I want that extra oomph of perfection I put this on after I&#x27;ve let my moisturizer absorb into my skin. This is a fantastic product at a crazy value - I will be using/buying this for a loooong time!</li>
            <li> I got this primer to give it a shot.  It is nice you put it on and it makes you face feel like it has a super soft slick surface for you makeup to be applied onto. It seems to make my foundation last a bit longer than without but not long enough that I fell obligated to use it every day.  One thing this was a bit pricey and if you have ever tried Monistat chaffing gel I swear it feels exactly the same and you get so much more product for much less.</li>
            <li> It does what it is suppose to do! I had no problem with the packaging. Overall very satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li> i bought this bc i didnt want to splurge on expensive ones without first knowing how different it would make my makeup look..glad I did bc although makeup glides on smoothly after i applied it, I really dont see a significant difference after applying it vs not applying it. i would have completely wasted my money had i bought the expensive one.</li>
            <li> perfect for eyes, lips, face!!! like the brand</li>
            <li> I never used a &amp;#34;face primer&amp;#34; before, so I was kind of skeptical, but this product goes on smoothly and very nicely and sure helps my makeup application go wonderfully and helps it last longer!  I will definitely be using it on a regular basis!</li>
            <li> I love ELF&#x27;s products because they are always so affordable but they also get the job done, and their face primer seems like no exception. I have very sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t bother it, either.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product!! I&#x27;ve been useing expensive primers for along time like the smash box  and Mac primer and I can say this primer is better because its cheap and does the job. It goes on my skin so smooth felt like I was gliding on my foundation on my face. Bottom line I would recommend.</li>
            <li> i use lees makeup than before and i looks more natural, am going to get another one pretty soon. thanks</li>
            <li> I thought this primer was alright. Nice packaging, nice price. It wasn&#x27;t a miracle product or anything but it helped my foundation stay on longer throughout the day. However, I was sorely disappointed when I went to pump some out and it was done already! I used it maybe every other day for about a month. I&#x27;d rather just pay the price for a GOOD primer that will last longer, you&#x27;ll end up spending the same price anyways.</li>
            <li> I really do like elf products.  And this primer feels very nice on the skin..but makes me a bit too oily.</li>
            <li> The pump didn&#x27;t work so you had to slam the bottle on your hand in order to get the product out.  Could have been a defective bottle or pump.  It worked well though once you got it out.</li>
            <li> All the other reviews on this product are accurate.  This stuff makes a HUGE difference in how well my foundation goes on.  It makes it just glide on, and it really does smooth over pores and fine lines.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing my mother in law said I looked well rested! It fills in lines beautifully! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Nice bottle I knw it will work.</li>
            <li> This works so great!! It gives the silkiest finish and foundation blends so well!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright. Although it reminds me of Vaseline, it looks clear but feels like Vaseline. I was expecting a different texture I guess. But works fine, better than nothing.</li>
            <li> I love putting this on before putting any makeup on my face. It allows my makeup to go on smoothly. Its light weight and doesnt feel greasy/oily when applying. Only con is there is not much in it :( most of the bottle is just show, (took it apart) the actually container that holds the primer is not much.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect because the product was so inexpensive, but putting it on fine lines under my eyes, I did see improvement. It does seem to smooth them out. I&#x27;ve used some of Elf&#x27;s other products and liked them. I would buy this one again. So many products like this are outrageously priced. This isn&#x27;t and I plan on making it part of my beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> It definitely helps your makeup go on smoother and look softer.  It also lasts a long time, so its a good value for the money spent.</li>
            <li> smoothens my make up for a more natural look!</li>
            <li> I like the product its self, works pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess my only complaint is that i didn&#x27;t really notice the oz listed on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this came in a bigger option I would definitely buy it again but not worth paying the amount for a few uses.</li>
            <li> I got this after reading its as good as Smashbox, I&#x27;ve never used Smashbox but this primer feels higher quality than you would expect for the price if you didn&#x27;t already know about E.L.F.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a bit odd but fades quickly.</li>
            <li> i couldn&#x27;t even use it, it came open with hardly anything in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a primer before. Heard good things about this one, especially since it&#x27;s cheap. I don&#x27;t know....maybe it&#x27;s me? I used this product twice over the last two days and every time I looked in the mirror a few hours after I put it on it was like my makeup had already worn off. So I conducted a little experiment. I used it yesterday and today I did not. I&#x27;m sorry to say that my makeup lasts 10 times longer without this crappy product. No more drugstore products for me....except for their baked eye shadows.</li>
            <li> This primer really made the difference with how my liquid foundation goes on and how it looks when done. It made my foundation look perfect! I love it and will be ordering more when I start to get low.</li>
            <li> Ive had alot of face primers and was excited to try this one i admit the bottle made me buy it. After i tryed it on it was just a very think oily product it litterly felt like i was rubbing just plan oil on my skin i waited to see if the shine and oil looking would go away never did even with makeup on! Would not recommend</li>
            <li> Makes foundation go on patchy</li>
            <li> This was aight. I&#x27;m not sure what the consistency was SUPPOSED to be like, but when I got it, the primer was like a congealed gel and I have to remove the top whenever I want to use it. I can&#x27;t just pump it out easily.  It&#x27;s fine for a primer. I wouldnt go raving about it, but it&#x27;s better than no primer at all</li>
            <li> The Elf Studio Mineral Infused face primer is an amazing product.  This is the first time I used a primer and I am very pleased with the results.  The product went on like silk, made my skin feel so soft and smooth and kept my makeup looking fresh.  Also,  I go for the more natural look and don’t like to feel like I have anything on my face, this product feels weightless . Another plus, a little bit goes along way.  I love it, great price, great product !</li>
            <li> This stuff ROCKS! I like it much better than my MAC primer. I will order this again for sure. It goes on like silk and makes your skin feel awesome. Foundation goes on flawlessly!</li>
            <li> I cant say that I am super experienced with face primers but I got this one to see if it makes any difference with eyeshadows and bronzers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came in great condition and it is very silky when you put it on. its also very conveniently in a push-pump container (like lotion bottles are) so its easy to use. (a little does go a long way though!)</li>
            <li> It makes the makeup go on smooth....</li>
            <li> Awesome same quality as sephora.. save your money!</li>
            <li> Transparent (which is what I wanted). Works great with foundation and with finishing powder over the top. I love it.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s suppose to and feels like silk when applied I could rub this on all day lol. High quality primer .It gets my thumbs up.</li>
            <li> Your skin is so soft when you use this. makeup stays for a long time and it seems so much more healthy than using the oil based lotions</li>
            <li> I is very light and silky and it goes on smoothly and last all day.  Love it.</li>
            <li> it did what it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> I like it but is hard to pump it out it applys well real soft evens up skin and does lock your makeup no smell and great price</li>
            <li> I love this product, but the packaging is silly.  I accept the amount it includes, so why not put it in a smaller container.  Like an eye cream jar.  Putting it in this larger container, making it a struggle to get the last 50% of it is just annoying.</li>
            <li> i love this product! &amp; after using it i don&#x27;t think i could ever wear my makeup the same again! it is a must have!</li>
            <li> Surprisingly for how cheap this product is, it works amazing! A little goes a long way, and it spreads so nicely. My face is so smooth and soft after using it. I will definitely be buying this again when it runs out.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Goes on clear and feels so soft and silky on my skin. Lasts a long time on the skin. Arrived in about 6 days.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, feels so wonderful. My skin looks more even and fair even before I put anything else on. I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This feels so great on my skin. It fills in fine lines and extends my make up to all day!</li>
            <li> It was dry when I opened the bottle</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this primer.  Unfortunatly, it didn&#x27;t work for me.  I gave it a few days, but each day it left my face a greasy mess and certainly didn&#x27;t help my make-up last.</li>
            <li> This gave me an even and silky glow once I applied my foundation. I would especially recommend this to anyone who suffers from oily skin, it kept me shine-free the whole day!</li>
