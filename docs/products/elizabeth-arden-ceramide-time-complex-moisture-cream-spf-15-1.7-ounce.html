            <li>I have used Elizabeth Arden products for years and like this product very much.</li>
            <li>I wish this one had a higher SPF.</li>
            <li>I was able to purchase this product at a very low amount... much lower than what is now on the internet.  </li>
            <li>Elizaberth Arden&#x27;s Ceramide complex products are simply the best for me.</li>
            <li>I love this item and will continue to use as long as I can find it!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m told they only carry a moisture cream with an SPF of 30 which is too strong for my skin,it breaks me out.</li>
            <li>I would only endorse a product I really felt strong about whether I worked for the company or not.</li>
            <li>This product really works and delivers the results it claims.</li>
            <li>Am been using Elizabeth Arden ceramide for face for years and it really works-</li>
            <li>Thanks Bella Alexa for your help expediting my orders sooner.</li>
            <li>This had way too much fragrance, which I think caused the dryness.  </li>
            <li>My mom told me how much she was paying for this at Belks and my jaw dropped.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it as long as it&#x27;s available at what I consider to be a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product which is sold at a reasonable price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I use this on dampened  skin right before applying makeup (only blush and foundation powder for me) and it really makes my skin glow.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I have used Elizabeth Arden Ceramide products for years and feel that they are worth the extra cost.  </li>
            <li>This was my favorite lotion, only thing that helped my dry skin!  </li>
            <li>This moisture cream makes my facial skin feel hydrated throughout the day which is important to me since I live in a dry climate.</li>
            <li>my face is glowing and skin does not look like a 66 years old women.</li>
            <li>I asked what she was using and she said, \\&quot;How old</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my almost 40 year old daughter as she has gotten hooked on this as well.</li>
            <li>I was in line at a major department store feeling frustrated because none of my cosmetics were making me happy.</li>
            <li>The effects don&#x27;t last all day but they last part of the day, and it will last through a whole evening.  </li>
            <li>I personally represented this line in a major Dept. store as a counter manager and had the honor to visit the Red Door Salon in New York.</li>

            <li> I personally represented this line in a major Dept. store as a counter manager and had the honor to visit the Red Door Salon in New York.</li>
            <li> This is the exact same product she has been using for years--at less than half the cost of what she was paying at Belk.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a long time, since my early fifties at least when my skin really started to dry out.</li>
            <li> A little sensitive at times.</li>
            <li> Some of the similar pink ones gave me a rash.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a very long time; I like the way it feels on my skin</li>
            <li> Recommend for dry skin.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it all five stars was because it&#x27;s only when you use the other products (the ceramide capsules, the toner, the serum) that your skin seriously glows.</li>
            <li> Tried to get it at Dillards the other day</li>
            <li> They were pretty expensive</li>
            <li> This is one of the few face creams that you can apply and not have to use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Dried my skin out, had to quit using it after just two days.  </li>
            <li> But it is still to soon to see if it helps my complexion with wrinkles and small lines.</li>
            <li> Its not greasy, has hardly any scent and my skin</li>
            <li> Although I can never squeeze it all out, at least I don&#x27;t have to dip my fingers into a jar and contaminate the rest of the cream.  </li>
            <li> I have used Elizabeth Arden exclusively for at least 30yrs.</li>
            <li> When I put this on my arm, (testing a small patch), the area turned red and hard like a mosquito bump, and it&#x27;s painful.  </li>
            <li> Have  not experienced a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> This is an expensive item that is somewhat difficult to find.  </li>
            <li> Sorry for the bad review, but this was my experience.</li>
            <li> Quite disappointed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent moisture cream for your face.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful product.  Release moisture on the face for hours, keeping my skin from damage.  Wind is not a problem anymore.</li>
            <li> Thanks!!!Super fast shipping and included a nice note and extra gift.Packaged nicely.A+++++</li>
            <li> This product really works and delivers the results it claims. I personally represented this line in a major Dept. store as a counter manager and had the honor to visit the Red Door Salon in New York. The Ceramide line is wonderful ladies do yourself a favor and give it a try. I would only endorse a product I really felt strong about whether I worked for the company or not.</li>
            <li> But it is still to soon to see if it helps my complexion with wrinkles and small lines. It does hydrate the skin.</li>
            <li> I love this item and will continue to use as long as I can find it!  Recommend for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Am been using Elizabeth Arden ceramide for face for years and it really works- my face is glowing and skin does not look like a 66 years old women. I will continue buying this product even if am in another country. Thanks Bella Alexa for your help expediting my orders sooner. Ratings I gave you is 5 star.  Clarita juson</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for over twenty years.  I&#x27;ve tried just about every new thing to come along, but this still works best.  Now that it&#x27;s discontinued, I&#x27;m glad to be able to find it here.  And I like the tube.  Although I can never squeeze it all out, at least I don&#x27;t have to dip my fingers into a jar and contaminate the rest of the cream.  I&#x27;ll use this until I can&#x27;t find it anywhere anymore.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I have used this for a long time, since my early fifties at least when my skin really started to dry out. It is an amazing moisturizer, very light and non-greasy. Softens lines around the eyes and mouth.</li>
            <li> i love all items of elizabeth arden</li>
            <li> I have used Elizabeth Arden exclusively for at least 30yrs. I was in line at a major department store feeling frustrated because none of my cosmetics were making me happy. As I waited in line, I started a conversation with a lovely older woman. I asked what she was using and she said, \\&quot;How old do you think I am?\\&quot; I guessed \\&quot; Maybe 60 or so?\\&quot;. She laughed &amp; said she was 82! Her skin was so flawless, I stocked up on EA &amp; continue to do  so!</li>
            <li> I use this facial moisturizer with SPF 15 on a daily basis throughout the year.  When Elizabeth Arden had company stores in Manhattan, my company was a participant.  I was able to purchase this product at a very low amount... much lower than what is now on the internet.  The SPF works and I like the fact that this product is light and not greasy.  I will continue to use it as long as it&#x27;s available at what I consider to be a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much but would very much like to see a SPF of 30.  I probably won&#x27;t buy it again for this reason.</li>
            <li> Wonderful day cream with SFP 15.It&#x27;s very smooth</li>
            <li> I have used Elizabeth Arden Ceramide products for years and feel that they are worth the extra cost.  I ordered this for my almost 40 year old daughter as she has gotten hooked on this as well.</li>
            <li> This was my favorite lotion, only thing that helped my dry skin!  But, then could not find it anymore. This is the same product, the tube, consistency of the lotion. And lack of color dyes.  Some of the similar pink ones gave me a rash.  Only... No&lt;br /&gt;Package / box like. It used to come in. I will be getting more.</li>
            <li> Still using it.  Have  not experienced a difference in my skin.  I&#x27;ll use it up and see how I feel after then.</li>
            <li> This moisture cream makes my facial skin feel hydrated throughout the day which is important to me since I live in a dry climate. This product was packaged well for shipment.</li>
            <li> Elizaberth Arden&#x27;s Ceramide complex products are simply the best for me. I have tried them all and always come back to the Eight  Hour Cream and Ceramide products. This is one of the few face creams that you can apply and not have to use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this excellent product.</li>
            <li> I have used Elizabeth Arden products for years and like this product very much. The price was also very good.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. No greasy. My skin loves it. I will recommend this product for any skin type. Love it love it!</li>
            <li> I never post on products, but I wanted to write about this one. I have been looking for something for &amp;#34;dehydration lines/fine lines&amp;#34; for 3 years now. I got this product and within a week I noticed a difference in my skin. It hydrates it better and softens it. I will be buying this from now on</li>
            <li> I am a senior citizen who has always taken care of her skin.  This product makes my face and neck feel wonderfully hydrated and smooth.  I highly recommend it.  The packaging is exceptional.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and am over 60.  It definitely plumps your skin and reduces the appearance of wrinkles.  The effects don&#x27;t last all day but they last part of the day, and it will last through a whole evening.  I use this on dampened  skin right before applying makeup (only blush and foundation powder for me) and it really makes my skin glow.  Highly recommend this product which is sold at a reasonable price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is an expensive item that is somewhat difficult to find.  It arrived in good time so it was not only a bargain but timely as well.</li>
            <li> I have used Ceramide Moisture Cream for years.  I can&#x27;t do without it.  Its not greasy, has hardly any scent and my skin&lt;br /&gt;loves it.  Love that it has SPF!  Tried to get it at Dillards the other day and they said it was discontinued.  I was so upset and so happy to be able to find it at Amazon!!  Wonderful product!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product. I continually get compliments that I look 12 year younger than I am.  I will continue to use this product until they stop making it!</li>
            <li> Quite disappointed.  Dried my skin out, had to quit using it after just two days.  From now on, I will use a fragrance free moisture cream.  This had way too much fragrance, which I think caused the dryness.  Sorry for the bad review, but this was my experience.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be able to find it anywhere. Great price. Great product.</li>
            <li> Lovely face cream, goes on smooth and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> I love Elizabeth Arden moisturizers and have used them for years. They give my face a healthy glow.  I wish this one had a higher SPF.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I always buy this product, it makes my face feel wonderful. I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a very long time; I like the way it feels on my skin and it works great.  It was an excellent price on Amazon and was shipped immediately.</li>
            <li> Have been using this face cream forever and it is great and the pricing is even greater. I love it</li>
            <li> My mom told me how much she was paying for this at Belks and my jaw dropped. I logged on here and ordered it for her. This is the exact same product she has been using for years--at less than half the cost of what she was paying at Belk.</li>
            <li> very nice.. leaves skin dewy and looks great</li>
            <li> This Moisture Cream is FABULOUS! Elizabeth Arden has discontinued this product with a SPF15. I&#x27;m told they only carry a moisture cream with an SPF of 30 which is too strong for my skin,it breaks me out. Maybe if enough people write in to  Elizabeth Arden requesting SPF15 they may consider bringing it back on the market. I HOPE SO.</li>
            <li> NOT for Celiacs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has hydrolyzed oat flour.  Oats, even though it does not have gluten, the body sees it as the same structure as gluten grasses (like wheat, rye, barley).  When I put this on my arm, (testing a small patch), the area turned red and hard like a mosquito bump, and it&#x27;s painful.  Definitely not for celiacs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the ingredients were perfect;  if EA got rid of the oat flour, it will be the perfect moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I used to work for Elizebeth Arden and was able to try all of the products. They were pretty expensive but so so worth it. If I had that kind of money I would have the whole skin care line. I was able to get this moisturizer on Amazon for a decent price so I bought it. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it all five stars was because it&#x27;s only when you use the other products (the ceramide capsules, the toner, the serum) that your skin seriously glows. That said, this is still one of the best moisturizers out there. I am over 40, was a sun worshipper and my skin leans towards combination. A little sensitive at times.</li>
