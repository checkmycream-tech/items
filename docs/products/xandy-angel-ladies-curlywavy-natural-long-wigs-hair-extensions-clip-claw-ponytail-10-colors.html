            <li> This ponytail is much shorter and much less full than it appears to be in the photo. I was disappointed b/c my friends have ponytail extensions of this kind and theirs do not look like this one. I would need two of these to replicate the image.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I have never written a review so I will rate this on the 3 days I wore it...&lt;br /&gt;Day 1: I received the package and was very surprised at how quickly they arrived. I got them out of their package which was a yellow package bag... They were super soft but REALLY shiny. I tried brushing them but could never get them fully brushed out. I put it in and thought it was absolutely beautiful though and I was super impressed with the color matching so well..&lt;br /&gt;Day 2: woke up and tried to brush them out still wouldn&#x27;t brush out they were a little frizzy at the ends and no longer soft.&lt;br /&gt;Day 3: woke up brushed them completely and they were SUPER frizzy felt like a Barbie doll that had a flat iron run through its hair... It looked awful.&lt;br /&gt; I am very upset with this product and was super excited to try it.. And also I didn&#x27;t include this I didn&#x27;t sleep in them.</li>
            <li> good quality I just didn&#x27;t realize it would be so heavy! my fair hair is fine so it didn&#x27;t want to hold in my hair! but I felt it was very nice for the price : )</li>
            <li> You pay for what you get</li>
            <li> Love this piece! Looks exactly like the photo &amp; came in the exact color I ordered. The bad reviews made me second guess but glad I ordered anyway. Only thing I don&#x27;t like is the  fact that mine somewhat &amp;#34;sheds&amp;#34; little hairs that irritate my back like crazy</li>
            <li> Not as long as it looks in the picture not really happy with it..</li>
            <li> Im very dissapointed with these the clip was broken.</li>
            <li> I really like this product!  I have short hair and it&#x27;s the most easiest thing to clip on!! ⊙ω⊙ I highly recommend it! I bought a black one! Its perfect!&lt;br /&gt;And for the price of 7 bucks! Normal extensions at stores are expensive but this is awesome!</li>
            <li> After wearing it once it was all tangled and you couldn&#x27;t just run your fingers through it to un tangle it. :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly the way it look in the picture ,I like it but the clip I thought its bigger</li>
            <li> The hair itself I like but I dislike the bulky way it looks attached . Too obvious that it&#x27;s not the real deal, thinking of taking the jaw claw out and improvising it somehow</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for it lasted for a bit but if if gets tangled is a nightmare so be warned.if u take extra extra extra careful care it is good For You.</li>
            <li> Never used the hair fall off all the time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long &amp; perfect for work.</li>
            <li> Havent used it but e mane looks beautiful and thick.</li>
