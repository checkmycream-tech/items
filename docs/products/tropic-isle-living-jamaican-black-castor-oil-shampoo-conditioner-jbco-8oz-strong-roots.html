            <li> The black castor oil has transformed my natural hair to a much healthier state.  </li>
            <li> I have very coarse hair and The first shampoo, protein treatment and conditioning left my hair unbelievably manageable!  </li>
            <li> I didnt have to use a flat iron</li>
            <li> I feel that is products was setting on the shelve for an long time.</li>
            <li> so i can&#x27;t give it 5 stars but doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very dry.</li>
            <li> One other thing, don&#x27;t keep shampoo on to long and the conditioner has a tingling to it care of scalp.</li>
            <li> My hair is harder to comb now though</li>
            <li> I miss the oil with pimento and other oil.</li>
            <li> Now the black castor oil, although it smells like stale cigarettes is promising.</li>
            <li> I noticed less hair falling out when brushing .  </li>
            <li> The black castor oil and the pimento oil keeps my jaor greasy.  </li>
            <li> but they smell a little</li>
            <li> but I hope I haven&#x27;t waste my money</li>
            <li> I use it as an everyday regimen for my hair.</li>
            <li> Very heavy on the hair.</li>
            <li> I got the information from a friend who said that it will thick your hair</li>
            <li> I have bad dry and itchy scalp</li>
            <li> The castor is very thick .  </li>
            <li> The itchiness as well as the flaking my scalp would experience has definitely decreased since I began using this oil.</li>
            <li> just hate the initial smell</li>
            <li> I accidently leave the wrong review.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any changes whatsoever by using this product. If you ask me I think it was regular castor oil in one bottle. It may work for someone else but not me.</li>
            <li> My fiance said that this product work great for her hair!</li>
            <li> brought my bleached hair from dull to delicious</li>
            <li> Works great, keeps hair shiny and healthy.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is just what I need it&#x27;s during a good job on my hair  and sent I being use it my hair has gotten thicker</li>
            <li> Shampoo and conditioner aren&#x27;t what I expected,but the oil is fabulous.</li>
            <li> Great products.....but they smell a little</li>
            <li> Excellent products my hair agrees with this line I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and I have experienced hair growth in problem areas. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The conditioner spilled in my box but products are good</li>
            <li> Love all these products.</li>
            <li> Best combination you can get.</li>
            <li> Has not done anything for my hair after a month. I guess everyone is different. Very heavy on the hair.</li>
            <li> Great!!!...I&#x27;ll say one thing my edges are growning wonderfully...#willrecommendtoanyonehavingproblemswiththiningorhairloss</li>
            <li> My hair is more healthier than it was before I started using this product. I can&#x27;t wait to seek the results after a couple of months.</li>
            <li> I was amazed with just one use. I have damaged  bleached hair. I noticed less hair falling out when brushing .  This product left my hair Healthy  silky-smooth  and i had volume.  I didnt have to use a flat iron .. love these products.</li>
            <li> Where do I start.....lol. First, I&#x27;ve never had a shampoo that actually moisturized my hair as well as detangle while washing. My hair felt clean without feeling stripped and there was no residue left on my scalp. The conditioner smells like a field of oranges, lol. I have to use it again to really see how I feel about its moisturizing capabilities but I&#x27;m hoping its as good as the shampoo. Now the black castor oil, although it smells like stale cigarettes is promising. I&#x27;m not quite sure on how I want to incorporate this into my hair regime. I did mix it with coconut oil to use as a pre-poo, I may revisit this again because my hair and scalp definitely agreed with it. Last but certainly not least is the Red Pimento Hair Growth Oil!! MY SCALP LOVES THIS STUFF!!!! I have bad dry and itchy scalp and I apply this to my scalp as needed, which is about 2-3 times a week. The itchiness as well as the flaking my scalp would experience has definitely decreased since I began using this oil. Overall I can definitely see me using these products for a while</li>
            <li> 3 of the products was solid, only the shampoo was fine.  I feel that is products was setting on the shelve for an long time.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair nice and thick!</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon. Excellent delivery service. This oil is awesome. I just goy it today and mixes the pimento and cadtor oil with emu oil. I massages ps my scalp and put some on my hair with creamy shea butter. Wow. My hair came alive so silky, smooth and soft. Will buy very soon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it about three weeks and I&#x27;ve haven seen progress yet but I hope I haven&#x27;t waste my money</li>
            <li> I accidently leave the wrong review. but this product is good I miss the oil with pimento and other oil. my hair grow two inch.</li>
            <li> This product works miracles</li>
            <li> Great product. Came on time and I been using since and hair has been feeling health and scalp has healed and became health as well.</li>
            <li> Well I love this I got the information from a friend who said that it will thick your hair so I&#x27;m trying I out.</li>
            <li> however its growing slooooooooowly!!!!! Packaging was awesome!!! Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with my order. Good sized bottles. Cost to ship to the UK is quite costly from the States, would be great if this was available in the UK.</li>
            <li> I love it I have brought and sent to someone else to try.</li>
            <li> great. thanks. just hate the initial smell but you get use to it. it works as indicated</li>
            <li> Already seeing the results after a month. Great quality products, although the castor oil doesn&#x27;t smell great, but castor oil never does.</li>
            <li> Well to be honest, this product didn&#x27;t fair to well with my scalp. My scalp broke out with red bumps that irritated my scalp to where I had to see a doctor, but this product worked well for my daughter with no problems.</li>
            <li> I love these hair products.</li>
            <li> I just started using the products within the last month. The black castor oil and the pimento oil keeps my jaor greasy.  I haven&#x27;y seem a difference yet, But I&#x27;m hopeful.  So I&#x27;m still waiting to see results.</li>
            <li> I love this product I will continue to use it it leaves my hair shiny soft and in good condition my hair has grown out without split ends</li>
            <li> Very pleased with time of delivery.</li>
            <li> Love it. Not too oily leaves hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I use the shampoo and conditioner on my 4 month old daughter&#x27;s hair. It makes her very curly hair easier to comb. I also use the castor oil on her forehead cause it&#x27;s very dry. The A&amp;D ointment doesn&#x27;t do anything for her. Her forehead has been cleared of the flakes. I highly recommend this to anyone. I also love that all the ingredients are all natural. I might make an update of this product cause I got it about 2 weeks ago, but I love the results so far.</li>
            <li> Great  job  I can&#x27;t  complain  about  nothing  my hair  stop breaking off. It stopped  coming  out  in a bundle. I love it.</li>
            <li> I liked the product and feel that consistent use of the castor oil for a month helped my edges to grow slightly.</li>
            <li> Had to get use to the smell, but I love it and the price</li>
            <li> The items were received in a timely manner, bottles were shipped in protective packaging, and the price was affordable. I most of all loved the extra pimento oil that was included in this set. It smells wonderful and feels great on the scalp.</li>
            <li> I just love this.  The black castor oil has transformed my natural hair to a much healthier state.  I use it as an everyday regimen for my hair. Highly recommended for people who are natural or trying to transition.  Not a heavy feel like some castor oils maybe and the smell is not what you would think that castor oil would be.</li>
            <li> Okay I just received this product on Saturday.  I washed my hair on Sunday.  I must say my hair felt soft.  The castor is very thick .  I mixed it with  shea butter.  Hair feels great. Will write a follow up in one month to let you guys know how the hair is doing.. One other thing, don&#x27;t keep shampoo on to long and the conditioner has a tingling to it care of scalp. I am a natural lady.</li>
            <li> Love this combo it works on my hair the scent of these is interesting but i love the product five stars</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo and conditioner, have not tried the other  two.</li>
            <li> Ive only used it 30 days now and see a minor difference; bur good one.  But the lsr twocweeks i kept my hair braided up and stopped using relaxers. I think ill see more differences in the next 30 days</li>
            <li> Has increased my hair&#x27;s health and manageability. The shampoo and conditioner have a great fragrance that oils don&#x27;t smell as nice, but they work. I plan to check out the rest of their product line.</li>
            <li> Awesome product I love them. I am from Jamaica. 😄</li>
            <li> Well, I bought this for my mom and she is in love with it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the product! I&#x27;m transitioning from relaxed hair of over 35 yrs to natural. My hair was so damaged from all the yrs of chemical use that I had to try something. Several coworker&#x27;s of mine told me about the Jamican Castor oil line that they had been using. They too are making the transition and I had been noticing how healthy their hair was looking so I decided to try it for myself! I have very coarse hair and The first shampoo, protein treatment and conditioning left my hair unbelievably manageable!  I love how much stronger and healthy hair is becoming and It is really helping with this  transition! I love it!</li>
            <li> Dont really like how my hair feels after the shampoo but love the results</li>
            <li> This product suit me I like it</li>
            <li> Where has this product been all my life. My hair is growing back after 10 years of wearing wigs and hats. All you people out there have to try it.  My hair is harder to comb now though but it&#x27;s stronger and I&#x27;m not complaining.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time, the shampoo and conditioner smells good. Like these products</li>
            <li> Shampoo has alchohol so i can&#x27;t give it 5 stars but doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out.</li>
