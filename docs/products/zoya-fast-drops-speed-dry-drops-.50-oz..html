            <li>This works amazingly well.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s kind of what I&#x27;m saying.</li>
            <li>So have something handy to wipe off your fingers after use.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and nails are immediately not tacky.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Zoya nail polishes.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I ran out of my favorite quick-dry topcoat.</li>
            <li>, definitely glad I found these.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s easy to get it everywhere</li>
            <li>these drops work and quickly!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the price of using 5 free nail polish.</li>
            <li>Really helps speed up drying time, especially useful during the winter months.  </li>
            <li>It works great and makes my nails shine and dry very quickly.</li>
            <li>The Zoya product works and dries quickly and cleanly.</li>
            <li>With toddlers I was looking for something faster than OPI fast drying top coat so decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li>these Zoya products are very first</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t even have to aim the drop; it just soaks right away into the polish and</li>
            <li>Still, overall I&#x27;m happy with these and would definitely buy them again.</li>
            <li>These drops work really well!  </li>
            <li>Really speeds up nail drying process!</li>
            <li>Will stick to OPI for drying but love regular Zoya nail polish.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I love having dry nails in 10min as opposed to, what, never?</li>
            <li>did 2 coats of color, Zoya top coat, and then the Speed Dry Drops.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the feel of it afterwards</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>She loves her fast drops.  </li>
            <li>These speed drops work very well.</li>
            <li>But, I&#x27;ll fight through that as long as it dries my nails quickly!</li>
            <li>They do what they say they will and they&#x27;re allowing me to get more use out of some products that had previously gotten pushed aside.&lt;br</li>
            <li>To remedy this, I invested in the Zoya Fast Drops, which seem to set up the surface of the polish, but after allowing the Armor + Anchor with Fast Drops a reasonable amount of drying time (over an hour, which is much longer than stated in the Fast Drops instructions), I found that my shoes seemed to push the polish back on my toenails.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>IMHO, well worth the extra expense, since because of my allergies</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the week-long lifespan of Zoya&#x27;s polishes, and I find that using them by themselves is more convenient than dealing with the drying time that the extra base and top coat take.</li>
            <li>So I wasn&#x27;t even consistently using the same brand for every product.</li>
            <li>Looks amazing, dries fast and leaves an amazing glossy look, without all of those nasty chemicals.</li>
            <li>You should still wait at least 20 min before touching anything against polished nails.</li>
            <li>My 8 year old daughter loves to paint her nails.  </li>
            <li>and I am pleasantly surprised by how well it worked.  </li>
            <li>Nails came out smooth and the polish dried.  </li>
            <li>I was worried that the Julep top coat was too runny (seemed really thin), but I put 1-2 of these fast drops on each nail</li>
            <li>I had a lot of other topcoats, but they weren&#x27;t quick-dry, and I&#x27;ve really become accustomed to a fast drying time.</li>
            <li>They last a very long time and well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry on contact and is very greasy.</li>
            <li>My cosmetic routine is fairly basic, so using four different products just to paint my nails is a bit much for me.  </li>
            <li>Armor + Anchor does make the polishes last much longer, but they require a very long drying period (several hours overall), making them impractical for me.  </li>

            <li> It is only dry to the touch though, it will smudge if you try to do anything major too soon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands and they have not worked nearly as well.</li>
            <li> only thing to watch out for is, this is a pretty thin formula.</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t dry polish on contact.</li>
            <li> does work very quickly to dry nails</li>
            <li> They actually dry my nail polish so that it does not smudge in about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> yeah, after 5-10 minutes, my polish was dry all the way through, including the topcoat.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And the little dropper isn&#x27;t really a proper lid, so you&#x27;ll have to keep track of it as well.</li>
            <li> Despite what other reviewers said about it being &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; (?), the drop disappears into the polish on contact and literally dries the polish in a flash.</li>
            <li> I used an OPI peelable base coat, two coats of Zoya pixie dust polish (Thea), and the Julep Oxygen Performance top coat.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still dry faster then usual.  </li>
            <li> I have been using only cruelty-free cosmetics for about ten years, and I can attest to how difficult it is to find products that are not tested on animals that also work as well as their animal tested counterparts.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s a little oily (from the silicones).</li>
            <li> and I wish it dried out my polish quicker</li>
            <li> used these drops for years.&lt;br /&gt;Terrific product, especially to eliminate bubbling, which used to happen to me often at nail salons, they often put the polish on too thick, instead of in thin layers as they should, which causes bubbling, but if you use this product, no bubbles!</li>
            <li> I started with Zoya base,</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> My manicurist uses this on me and I&#x27;m out the door in five minutes - no worries about smears. Can apply nail polish at night and not get &amp;#34;sheet impressions.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> These drops are awesome! I used the Essie ones and still had issues with indentations and whatnot. Not to mention the greasiness. The Zoya product works and dries quickly and cleanly.</li>
            <li> These do speed up drying time but they don&#x27;t dry polish on contact. You should still wait at least 20 min before touching anything against polished nails. They last a very long time and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Zoya nail polishes.  I have been using only cruelty-free cosmetics for about ten years, and I can attest to how difficult it is to find products that are not tested on animals that also work as well as their animal tested counterparts.  I bought the Armor + Anchor as a way to extend the life of the already durable Zoya colors.  Armor + Anchor does make the polishes last much longer, but they require a very long drying period (several hours overall), making them impractical for me.  To remedy this, I invested in the Zoya Fast Drops, which seem to set up the surface of the polish, but after allowing the Armor + Anchor with Fast Drops a reasonable amount of drying time (over an hour, which is much longer than stated in the Fast Drops instructions), I found that my shoes seemed to push the polish back on my toenails.  My cosmetic routine is fairly basic, so using four different products just to paint my nails is a bit much for me.  I am satisfied with the week-long lifespan of Zoya&#x27;s polishes, and I find that using them by themselves is more convenient than dealing with the drying time that the extra base and top coat take.</li>
            <li> Works well enough.  I don&#x27;t really like the feel of it afterwards and I wish it dried out my polish quicker then it does, but it&#x27;s still dry faster then usual.  It is only dry to the touch though, it will smudge if you try to do anything major too soon.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Just place a couple drops on nail after you have finished the very last coat of polish, and it speeds up drying time. it&#x27;s a must-have in our salon.</li>
            <li> These drops work really well!  Very easy to use and nails are immediately not tacky.</li>
            <li> Looks amazing, dries fast and leaves an amazing glossy look, without all of those nasty chemicals. MUST HAVE!</li>
            <li> It works, but it is greasy.</li>
            <li> My 8 year old daughter loves to paint her nails.  She loves her fast drops.  They work and that helps with the smudging issues she had.</li>
            <li> This works amazingly well.  No odor or petrochemicals.  Manicure good to go in a heartbeat.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> does work very quickly to dry nails</li>
            <li> These speed drops work very well. They actually dry my nail polish so that it does not smudge in about 5 minutes. I&#x27;ve tried other brands and they have not worked nearly as well. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> these Zoya products are very first rate-&lt;br /&gt;-and these drops work and quickly!</li>
            <li> Works great!! Really speeds up nail drying process!</li>
            <li> It works great and it met every expectation that I had.</li>
            <li> These do what they say. I love having dry nails in 10min as opposed to, what, never? That&#x27;s the price of using 5 free nail polish. I don&#x27;t want to say nail polish dryer &amp;#34;changed my life,&amp;#34; but that&#x27;s kind of what I&#x27;m saying. I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Works GREAT!!  I&#x27;ve never used a product like this before and I am pleasantly surprised by how well it worked.  Nails came out smooth and the polish dried.  I started with Zoya base, did 2 coats of color, Zoya top coat, and then the Speed Dry Drops.  Awesome!!</li>
            <li> Always great!&lt;br /&gt;Have used these drops for years.&lt;br /&gt;Terrific product, especially to eliminate bubbling, which used to happen to me often at nail salons, they often put the polish on too thick, instead of in thin layers as they should, which causes bubbling, but if you use this product, no bubbles!</li>
            <li> I ran out of my favorite quick-dry topcoat. I had a lot of other topcoats, but they weren&#x27;t quick-dry, and I&#x27;ve really become accustomed to a fast drying time. So I bought these drops to try out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t understand why they work, but they do. I used an OPI peelable base coat, two coats of Zoya pixie dust polish (Thea), and the Julep Oxygen Performance top coat. So I wasn&#x27;t even consistently using the same brand for every product. I was worried that the Julep top coat was too runny (seemed really thin), but I put 1-2 of these fast drops on each nail and I&#x27;d say yeah, after 5-10 minutes, my polish was dry all the way through, including the topcoat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, definitely glad I found these. They do what they say they will and they&#x27;re allowing me to get more use out of some products that had previously gotten pushed aside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing to watch out for is, this is a pretty thin formula. And it&#x27;s a little oily (from the silicones). So it&#x27;s easy to get it everywhere (like my laptop keys, oops). So have something handy to wipe off your fingers after use. And the little dropper isn&#x27;t really a proper lid, so you&#x27;ll have to keep track of it as well. Still, overall I&#x27;m happy with these and would definitely buy them again. (Prices on Amazon are currently very good.)</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  Dries polish to touch almost immediately and eliminates bubbles every time.</li>
            <li> It works great and makes my nails shine and dry very quickly. The only issue I have is when I put it on, the residue gets on my fingertips and creates a  greasy residue. But, I&#x27;ll fight through that as long as it dries my nails quickly! Once you wipe your fingers clean then you are good to go!</li>
            <li> With toddlers I was looking for something faster than OPI fast drying top coat so decided to give this a try. Doesn&#x27;t dry on contact and is very greasy. Will stick to OPI for drying but love regular Zoya nail polish.</li>
            <li> Perfect ... this product does what it says and dries nail polish in a flash. Despite what other reviewers said about it being &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; (?), the drop disappears into the polish on contact and literally dries the polish in a flash. You don&#x27;t even have to aim the drop; it just soaks right away into the polish and then *poof*, it&#x27;s gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Really helps speed up drying time, especially useful during the winter months.  IMHO, well worth the extra expense, since because of my allergies I always bring my Zoya products to the salon when I am getting a pedicure.</li>
