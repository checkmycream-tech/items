            <li>it is affordable plus it works great.</li>
            <li>and this had great reviews</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy for all those who&#x27;ve found the answer inside this product - but it didn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
            <li>Great eye cream and makes wonders</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>If you should try the serum, I hope you&#x27;ll be happy with the results as I am.</li>
            <li>I would be happy with these results alone, so I cannot wait to see what happens over time.</li>
            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels great.</li>
            <li>not all that happy with the results</li>
            <li>LOL.</li>
            <li>Great price though</li>
            <li>And Neutrogena is a great name for beauty that you can get in the store.</li>
            <li>Adds great moisture.  </li>
            <li>Definitely a great buy.</li>
            <li>Good value for good results!)</li>
            <li>I love Neutrogena!!</li>
            <li>Considering how many creams I have tried, I found this to work the best.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed a remarkable difference after using the cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice to not look like a hungover raccoon every morning!</li>
            <li>and it is quite effective !</li>
            <li>This product has been a pleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff that I will continue to use</li>
            <li>The cream feels good on my skin, too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That was good</li>
            <li>Combined with a good moisturizer, it also works well for my eye area, crow lines are still there</li>
            <li>For the price, I think this is a good product.  </li>
            <li>I am now using a squalene oil from olives and find that works as good as anything.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for an inexpensive really good eye cream you have found it.</li>
            <li>And I must say it works fairly well for me.</li>
            <li>Use a good moisturizer and face wash.</li>
            <li>Love most of Neutrogena stuff, but this eye treatment is perfect in moisturizing level for my combination skin.</li>
            <li>Takes the fine lines and erases them!!</li>
            <li>This has helped tremendously!!!  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I have been using it about two weeks, and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how much I love this stuff!! :)</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use and if I notice a change for the better I will update!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, even though I can&#x27;t use it as intended, I do see results that for the price of the product, I think are pretty impressive.  </li>
            <li>they are amazing, but never this one, or anything that reeks with fragrance.</li>
            <li>, I really liked it.</li>
            <li>Besides the price is good and I like neutrogena:)</li>
            <li>I probably should have gone to CVS to get a product just as good or better.</li>
            <li>nice product and came as desribed in ad - would buy again.</li>
            <li>It has a nice consistency somewhere between a serum and a cream.</li>
            <li>It absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li>But it feels nice going on and doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes</li>
            <li>Nice texture, not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>because the product ingredients may not have been as effective if the tube had been opened.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try this before spending that much money and have been very happy.  </li>
            <li>but it does feel nice.  </li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel nice</li>
            <li>but honestly I don&#x27;t see any improvements</li>
            <li>0% effective.</li>
            <li>It seems to be working nicely.</li>
            <li>This formula works nicely as a complement to the Neutrogena Rapid Tone Repair Moisturizer Night.</li>
            <li>tried many products that claim how effective their eye treatment is until i tried neutrogena rapid wrinkle repair eyes</li>
            <li>so far Neutrogena is the best I use Neutrogena</li>
            <li>but as you know most products today are sold with some kind of safety seal that ensures purity.  </li>
            <li>Fills in lines and moistens skin around eyes nicely making for a more youthful look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 36 and have pretty good skin, so I wasn&#x27;t looking for a miracle, just a good night time moisturizer, and this works well.</li>
            <li>I have used this for more than two months and quite honestly I noticed that it makes my wrinkles MORE pronounced.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I purchased this, it really works and you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li>This has nice light scent, and is easy and nice to apply.</li>
            <li>After talking to them and doing my own research, I bought this product for the fine lines around my 48-year-old eyes.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles around my  eyes and have been using for a year</li>
            <li>My eyes look significantly better after two weeks.</li>
            <li>I love ALL Neutrogena products, and am extremely pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Love this eye treatment.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>/&gt;VERY pleased with this product and will buy it again and again.</li>
            <li>This product has helped the skin around my eyes look better than ever.  </li>
            <li>I love finding a gem like this stuff for such a great price!!</li>

            <li>are cream I have been trying and do work better.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be better than it is.</li>
            <li>I am glad I tried this before going to a prescription strength.</li>
            <li>OK but would not buy again</li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT FAST SHIPPING</li>
            <li>I love this cream</li>
            <li>totally satisfied thank you</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will keep using this, and I am tempted to try the one formulated specifically for face, for even better results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel much better knowing Im not putting chemicals on my skin anymore.</li>
            <li>Love all Neutrogena.</li>
            <li>There are better products out there that I&#x27;m discovering.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think i love it</li>
            <li>Make sure you use it with tapping motions.</li>
            <li>Works like a charm and cheap!</li>
            <li>but much better than how they used to be.</li>
            <li>I look way more rested</li>
            <li>and my eyes look better than I thought they could.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>It was okay.</li>
            <li>My aesthetician recommended a retinol product but the one at the spa was more than $75.00.  </li>
            <li>and then use my Bioelements Sleepwear overnight moisturizer over top of it.  </li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>or I would be even more dissapointed</li>
            <li>I have tried many products to keep wrinkles at bay</li>
            <li>Just ok will buy peter Thomas Roth firming cream before I wood buy this again  </li>
            <li>This is one of the better eye creams for the price.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I quit using the eye cream and after more than a week of using all kinds of things to heal this up</li>
            <li>My eye area does appear more youthful after using it for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have many wrinkles to begin with.</li>
            <li>normally i love all neutogena products if they do what they say they are supposed to do.</li>
            <li>read the reviews and really thought this would be a great product.  </li>
            <li>I would probably pay a lot more for this</li>
            <li>I found this to be a pretty good alternative to pricier eye creams.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this eye cream for two weeks and it seemed to be doing a good job at first</li>
            <li>I will be 47 this year and am very happy that this stuff a long with</li>
            <li>just apply it before sleeping on a clean face..voila!</li>
            <li>I have used this product for 1 year and works perfectly, I can notice less fine wrinkles!</li>
            <li>Doing great so far on and around my eye area.</li>
            <li>good price and fast delivey</li>
            <li>The product works somewhat for me, but I had hoped for more significant results.</li>
            <li>So I decided to try another product, Clinique All About Eyes Rich, to see if I could find something better.</li>
            <li>I break out easily, and this product didn&#x27;t cause any breakout problems for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far so good will post more info when it has been one month.</li>
            <li>I do highly recommend this product and if you try it, I hope you have as good an experience as I did.</li>
            <li>And it did not disappoint me and I am very happy about its effectivenss on reducing dark circles.</li>
            <li>The area is brighter, smoother and clearer, and the fine lines have softened.</li>
            <li>After 2 weeks I noticed reduction of fine lines, but it did irritated my skin around my eyes a lil.</li>
            <li>some of the fine lines under my eyes</li>
            <li>I have been using the Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Eye all over my face, and it is working - improving the look of fine lines and making my face smoother.</li>
            <li>It appears to work fine</li>
            <li>It doesnt irritate my skin and it smells fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using this for 2-3 months, I could see a noticeable difference in the fine lines;</li>
            <li>I am 28 and have some fine lines under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I am 25, and I use it twice a day and it didn&#x27;t make any difference in my fine lines.</li>
            <li>Is Super!</li>
            <li>It helps to temporarily smooth fine lines underneath the eye and works well under my makeup.</li>
            <li>The fine lines disappeared and the eyes looks crease free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and silky and goes on smooth, but I have not noticed any real improvements in fine lines.</li>
            <li>just purchased the intensive serum after reading such great reviews, so I’m super excited to see the results of this one!</li>
            <li>She reported that this product makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and keeps the eye area hydrated.  </li>
            <li>This incredibly light, unscented eye cream is a powerhouse performer.</li>
            <li>Feel free to call me</li>
            <li>This eye cream applies smoothly, without a greasy feel.  </li>
            <li>Though, what is of primary importance is that it does not appear that it contains harmful chemicals that have been linked to cancer etc.</li>
            <li>and it want cheap for me</li>
            <li>and I enjoy the product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s helping with wrinkles, but it is a fantastic moisturizer for the eyes.</li>
            <li>It is light weight</li>
            <li>I think this is a fantastic eye creme.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t happy with this product,  saw no results, back to the grave yard!!</li>
            <li>So far it does a good job of moisturizing without and side effects of skin breakouts.</li>
            <li>Not disappointed with this eye cream, works well under makeup and has helped with fine lines under eyes.</li>
            <li>--if you are willing to wait a while to see results and don&#x27;t expect your lines to completely disappear, I think you will be happy with this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product very much and recommended it to my friends as well.  </li>
            <li>I found a new way to use concealer that seems to work best, which I did not know until very recently that applying dots under the eye (like I&#x27;ve done for 30 yrs.)</li>
            <li>does not work exactly as advertised, but it is okay</li>
            <li>Did not see significant results.</li>
            <li>I did significant research before purchasing an eye cream and was torn between this one and the &amp;#34;RoC&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I was so excited that I started taking pictures of the progress from week to week.</li>
            <li>The best, better than the more expensive brands and it works.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t trust it&#x27;s original product.</li>
            <li>I did however contact the seller because the product was not sealed or in any kind of packaging (although it was listed as brand new)</li>
            <li>it really helps I made a excellent choice buying this product I have tried so many creams products for the eye-face in the past</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and absorbs well -- the skin around my eyes always looks healthy and vibrant.</li>
            <li>I’m so happy with this product that I already purchase a second bottle, so I don’t have to worry about ordering another one, when I get finished with my first bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that most just hydrate the eye area but don&#x27;t really do much of anything for the wrinkles.......</li>
            <li>I feel like I gave it a fair try, and I&#x27;m switching back to the product I used before after 3 weeks of hating how the skin under my eyes looks.</li>
            <li>Not only was I wanting to remove the milia, I wanted a good eye cream as well.</li>
            <li>Look at that full set of traveling luggage under your eyes and do nothing?  </li>
            <li>My issue was more dark circles - but wrinkle repair is always good.</li>
            <li>When I used it at night, my eyes would feel kind of foggy the next morning but after washing my face it was fine.</li>
            <li>This product is great as part of face routine with the other products in this line....</li>
            <li>After my skin was better I went back to using it, because I liked it so much at  first.</li>
            <li>Everything was fine with the order and exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>After just the first night of use I could see improvement in the look of my undereye along with fine lines.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s older than I am, has better skin than I do, and swears by this product.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a good eye cream for a relatively low price, this one is definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li>Over time I&#x27;ve tried another products but have yet to find another cream that worked as quickly and brightens the eye area.  </li>
            <li>Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I use a lot of Neutrogena products and was eager to try this new product for fine lines under the eyes, especially because it had some good testimonials.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see what continual and consistent use will do.</li>
            <li>This product is my favorite goes on smooth and is very hydrating for my 63 year old eyes.</li>
            <li>It seems to smooth the skin in the eye area and is gentle.  </li>
            <li>it was worth it for that.  </li>
            <li>Crows feet gone, now if this company could get a product to get rid of smile lines.</li>
            <li>I always ask myself if a product is “worth what I paid” for it.</li>
            <li>The fine line beginnings of crows feet at the corners of my eyes are completely gone, and the lines under my eyes reduced tremendously.</li>
            <li>Many people are fine with the Retinol in this moisturizer but the problem I ran into was that my skin was far too sensitive.</li>
            <li>Will never switch again, this is fantastic for my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Recommend usage for prevention and to treat new surfacing fine lines.</li>
            <li>Product came quick and in very protective packaging.</li>
            <li>my eye skin is much more supple more and the dark sircles is much lighter</li>
            <li>I am in my early 20&#x27;s and started to notice some fine lines around my eyes</li>
            <li>Not that I have has success with anything else, but this one certainly does not work.  </li>
            <li>Most of the time, I apply it at night so it will stay on for several hours without being disturbed.  </li>
            <li>I actually had much better results by just applying Oil of Olay Night Time Firming Cream around my eyes.</li>
            <li>This really works!  </li>
            <li>Maybe there are more expensive safe creams out there that work better, but, again, for the price, my wife has no complaints.</li>
            <li>Received the product almost three months ago and I&#x27;ve been using it consistently and as directed.</li>
            <li>I thought I had a viral infection the first time.</li>
            <li>Stopped using it and went with a higher end retinol with no stink that I was using before and ahve no reactions to it .</li>
            <li>working at first, decided to stick with it.</li>
            <li>Not only did it reduce the milia under my eyes, it gave my eyes more of a well-rested appearance.</li>
            <li>I purchased this as more of a preventative measure in terms of taking care of possible crow&#x27;s feet at the edge of my eyes.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen much results, but it&#x27;s fun to pretend.  </li>
            <li>This might be because I have pretty oily skin, even on my eyelids.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I recommend starting with the smallest dab you can put on your fingertip, patting it in, and then adding more if you need to.  </li>
            <li>It does have a burning/warmth sensation when first applied so expect that.</li>
            <li>use this daily , I love it</li>
            <li>I could not believe how one use could do so much damage!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely use up the tube and give it more time.</li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>But when I tried to do it every day, for the first time it set my skin on fire.</li>
            <li>tried this product for around a month yet didn&#x27;t notice any real difference regarding the wrinkles under the eyes yet is good for the dark spots under the eyes.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing just like Neutrogenas other skin care products.</li>
            <li>but I actually find it more effective on dark circles:)&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>Is nice for moisture, but I do not see any difference in regard to any of the other claims.</li>
            <li>, It does take a few days to see results but it feels amazing and refreshed when applied, not stuck and almost give you a shimmer looked, I see better results when I use this right after my shower when my pores are open as to at night before I go to bed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve definitely spent much more on beauty products from boutiques, so the price was worth giving this product a shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it but expected a tiny bit more from the product.  </li>
            <li>The wrinkles around my eyes are not near as noticeable, and the puffiness under my eyes is much better.</li>
            <li>Very punctual delivery, it exactly what it describe</li>
            <li>Those of you with dryer or more normal skin might have no problems at all with wearing this under makeup, so definitely try it for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good shipping.product works and last a long time.worth it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see any dramatic change, but it is nice and moisturizing, and my fine lines do seem a little more plump and filled in.</li>
            <li>It definitely moisturizes and gets rid of the bags, but it didn&#x27;t do anything to get rid of fine lines.</li>
            <li>Gentle on your skin</li>
            <li>Both softens and firms the eye area, very noticible under the eyes.</li>
            <li>I really like this eye cream.  </li>
            <li>The price is really reasonable, too.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see much of a difference while using this.</li>
            <li>but this didn&#x27;t really help.</li>
            <li>THIS.....is ironic, because.....</li>
            <li>Thanks you,  Silvia Brooks    </li>
            <li>Fast delivery and works</li>
            <li>And as always, I&#x27;m amazed at Amazon&#x27;s prices - much lower than retail.</li>
            <li>Took about a month for the difference to be really noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so didn&#x27;t lose much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve have used this product and really dont know if its working or not.  </li>
            <li>and you really don&#x27;t need that much for the eye area.</li>
            <li>, there is no product that can do the whole trick not for that price,</li>
            <li>Thanks Neutrogena and thank you to the responsible vendor.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference yet.  </li>
            <li>After going to a Dermatologist and hearing how much it would be to remove them, plus the recovery time - I was on a mission to find a cream that would help diminish my milia over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>did not do much for me</li>
            <li>it absorbs fast and not greasy.  </li>
            <li>No odor, just smooths on and I&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
            <li>I know this got great reviews, but i find my skin in worse</li>
            <li>I really didnt see a difference in using this product undernearth my eyes..</li>
            <li>and it is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff for my eyes</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t help with the bags as much as i thought it would.</li>
            <li>but given more time and daily use, it has far exceeded even my fondest expectations.</li>
            <li>noticed that I developed a patch of skin beneath the outer portion of one eye that turned red and kept gettomg redder, and it burned, sometimes without even touching it.</li>
            <li>I bought it for the newly developed crows feet I have from more sun exposure last year.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive and steady but not dramatic overnight results...</li>
            <li>Works better than any other product I have used.</li>
            <li>and what&#x27;s more, because I&#x27;d ordered other things and didn&#x27;t pay close attention to the slip</li>
            <li>My eyes are pretty sensitive, but this product does not irritate at all.  </li>
            <li>Many eye creams that I have tried in the past fall into one of two categories: great moisture but somehow irritates my eyes OR completely dries out my delicate skin in my eye area with the wrinkle-reducing ingredients.  </li>
            <li>, I smooth this on, let it dry</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think any cream can get rid of wrinkles that  only a facelift can accomplish, but this product does make my skin look smoother, more refreshed and younger.  </li>
            <li>But it is a lot more expensive than this stuff, so I guess that&#x27;s why it worked better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since moved on to another product because I find that my skin&#x27;s needs change as I get older, but for the 2-3 years I used this</li>
            <li>Of course I didn&#x27;t see it as a permanent miracle, but I wont keep purchasing as part of daily routine when I have found lotion for the entire face that does the same thing, its more an extra step for around the eyes that I forget, and have had better products for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be tempted to remove a star for the results not being particularly rapid--this didn&#x27;t happen in the time frame suggested by the packaging--</li>
            <li>use this product mainly at night instead of during the day because if I wear it under makeup my experience has been that my eyeshadow wears off a lot faster than if I just use an eyelid primer.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely say that it made my eyes look more youthful overall.</li>
            <li>I am able to use this formula on my entire eye area including above my eyes at the brow.</li>
            <li>Works better than more expensive department store brands.</li>
            <li>highly recommended</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>I will NEVER use this product again and would highly advise others against it.</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate lines, but they have improved more than with any other product I have tried so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks, so I may need to give it a little more time.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t swear definitely that it was this eye cream, but I feel pretty certain it was</li>
            <li>It absorbs easily and does not interfere with my other skincare</li>
            <li>I have very dry, very sensitive skin and have started to notice fine lines around my eyes and mouth.  </li>
            <li>has not worked near as well or fast as Neutrogenas.</li>
            <li>Overall, it was worth the money</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my late 20s and started using this as soon as I saw small under eye lines and very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>lotion is not too thick, no discernable fragrance, it doen&#x27;t burn but produces a warm sensation sometimes, say after microdermabration.</li>
            <li>I bought this mainly to address fine lines and wrinkles and to lighten dark areas.</li>
            <li>Well, the rash came right back.</li>
            <li>I have not seen much difference in my dark spots and will most likely not buy it again.</li>
            <li>makes me feel like a new born baby</li>
            <li>My daughter is pregnant and dealing with acne and fluctuating oily to dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eyes and</li>
            <li>First I have very sensitive skin around my eyes, and not every facial product is for me.  </li>
            <li>Under eye concealer/makeup blends well with it after use instead of sitting on small wrinkles and making them more noticeable like some products do after makeup is applied.</li>
            <li>For the past week I&#x27;ve been moisturizing a lot more and using night creams to see if it helped improve things.</li>
            <li>It does the exact opposite of what it claims.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena eye cream for 10 years and my eyes look exactly the same as the day I started.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to report that after using this cream for only 2 weeks, I saw a dramatic difference.</li>
            <li>There should be more apparent warnings that some people, apparently (see other reviews) cannot tolerate some ingredients in this product.</li>
            <li>My under eye area is soooo smooth, the bags are gone, my skin is brighter and the wrinkle depth is half its size.</li>
            <li>well enough that if I switched to a different full face brand I would still use this eye product.</li>
            <li>My dark circles are significantly diminished and the crepe-i-ness is unnoticeable.</li>
            <li>but I have also used it during the day to apply to other areas of my face (scowl lines) that I use the full face cream on.</li>
            <li>I made the mistake early on of putting too much product on so that my skin wasn&#x27;t able to absorb it all, and about an hour later when I rubbed my eye, I got a most unpleasant burning sensation.</li>
            <li>My research told me that there is not a tremendous difference in results from the ultra-expensive products and the cheaper ones that have effective actives like this one, and there is no product that is going to magically erase your lines and wrinkles overnight no matter how expensive it is.</li>
            <li>The wrinkles around my eyes are significantly lighter and less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>As a 68 year old sun lover living in Florida I did indeed see results.</li>
            <li>I am 38 years old, so it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m 80 and expecting miracles.  </li>
            <li>So far, I am not seeing an results.</li>
            <li>Though my skin tends to be sensitive, I use this product without experiencing either burning eyes or itchy skin.</li>
            <li>My eyes are brighter and it&#x27;s actually helped my undereye circles so much that I don&#x27;t need concealer anymore</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t completely achieved the outcome I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite 30 but want to start tackling the signs of aging as early as I can.  </li>
            <li>but I believe that finding a gentle moisturizer to keep my eye area hydrated will help to stave off the development of crows feet and help keep my upper lid lifted.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not going to completely remove your lines, but it does soften them, and it doesn&#x27;t cause concealer to &#x27;cake&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>This product sucks like most eye creams.  </li>
            <li>The skin is so soft.</li>
            <li>This product does moisturize well but as far as repair eye wrinkles, it didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  </li>
            <li>Just another 47 year old hamburger patty on the grill of life(lol).</li>
            <li>have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this has not caused any irritation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 60 year old guy.  </li>
            <li>Oh yeah, and don&#x27;t get old.</li>
            <li>I am 39 years old</li>
            <li>Thus the four out of five stars to early to give five stars.</li>
            <li>If you have not tired this I will recommend it especially if you have tan skin</li>
            <li>But so far I have not seen an difference in my wrinkles</li>
            <li>I used this religiously for a month straight.</li>
            <li>I am 32 yrs old</li>
            <li>Makes skin around eyes feel soft</li>
            <li>I used the product for 1 month completely and still no difference.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m surprised how inexpensive it is.</li>
            <li>Have only been using it for a few weeks so time will tell if the results get better.</li>
            <li>This product works great on sensitive under eye skin &amp; only a small application is need so it last long.</li>
            <li>At 39 I am seeing more and more and was hoping to try and at least slow the process, but no luck.</li>
            <li>I mean dryer and the wrinkles more pronounced.</li>
            <li>so I have dark circles and a few fine lines around my eyes when I smile</li>
            <li>Tried numerous drugstore, high end and natural based creams with no effect on the lines around my eyes at all (Lumene, Burt Bees, Origins to name a few).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I stopped using eye cream for a while and recently found this eye cream and was motivated to give it a try because of its decent reviews.</li>
            <li>Hoping my skin will go back to normal b/c</li>
            <li>all three facial products live up to</li>
            <li>This product is gentle, moisturizes my eye area without irritation, and does not leave me with dry, scaly skin.  </li>
            <li>This product really helped with the dry skin around my eyes -</li>
            <li>The burning sensation at the first few applications is quite normal and it will go away soon.</li>
            <li>Several tubes later and all is exactly the same.</li>
            <li>and I have actually noticed a difference in my lines not being nearly as noticeable!</li>
            <li>I have faithfully applied it since August, two times a day to clean, dried skin and still see my wrinkles in the same state since before I began applying the cream.</li>
            <li>But, the main reason I am only giving it 3 stars is because I wake up every morning with a red horizontal line coming out of the edges of both my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend this product to women my age who are trying to slow down the natural aging process with this very affordable product.</li>
            <li>started searching high and low, all over amazon and the internet for different creams.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t see any less wrinkles but actually see more when I compare it to my other eye where I&#x27;m using an Obagi eye cream.</li>
            <li>I used this product ONCE at night (along with my usual moisturizer), and literally woke up with huge visible (and multiple!)</li>
            <li>abandoned ship and used my old cream.&lt;br /&gt;Going totry hydroxatone next..</li>
            <li>It is ok but not great.</li>
            <li>I literally see results as soon as I put in on my face and distinct results within a few days.  </li>
            <li>On the OTHER hand, the results were very noticeable on my skin.</li>
            <li>My under eyes did start to brighten up but other than that I haven&#x27;t seem much of a difference.</li>
            <li>I usually have pretty sensitive skin around my eyes and this has never given me a problem.</li>
            <li>It burns a little at first</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed dramatic improvement, but my skin feels soft and moisturized, I&#x27;ve had no irritation and the fragrance is fine.</li>
            <li>I purchased this cream because of all the great reviews and am totally disappointed.  </li>
            <li>It seems to instantly brighten my dark circles and my fine lines look less.</li>
            <li>Absolutely didn&#x27;t reduce dark circles below my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and didn&#x27;t want it to dry out, so put petroleum jelly around my eyes at night before I put it on..</li>
            <li>After applying the stuff for a few weeks, I noticed significant results on my previous wrinkles.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This stuff is great for pre-menopausal women!</li>
            <li> In my opinion Neutrogena has the very best eye creams.</li>
            <li> and I am very happy with how non-irritating this Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Eye has performed.  </li>
            <li> My experience with this product is excellent – it does what it is supposed to do</li>
            <li> More wrinkles now then I did before!!!...</li>
            <li> Very nice!</li>
            <li> I do not see any effects on the wrinkles yet but as an eye cream it is very good.</li>
            <li> A good pair of glasses help too!</li>
            <li> great product to vanish eye wrinkles and laughlines around your brows.</li>
            <li> It does a great job of diminishing the darkness under the eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I went with neutrogena.</li>
            <li> it is affordable plus it works great.</li>
            <li> and this had great reviews</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy for all those who&#x27;ve found the answer inside this product - but it didn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
            <li> Great eye cream and makes wonders</li>
            <li> lol</li>
            <li> If you should try the serum, I hope you&#x27;ll be happy with the results as I am.</li>
            <li> I would be happy with these results alone, so I cannot wait to see what happens over time.</li>
            <li> Great product</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> not all that happy with the results</li>
            <li> LOL.</li>
            <li> Great price though</li>
            <li> And Neutrogena is a great name for beauty that you can get in the store.</li>
            <li> Adds great moisture.  </li>
            <li> Definitely a great buy.</li>
            <li> Good value for good results!)</li>
            <li> I love Neutrogena!!</li>
            <li> Considering how many creams I have tried, I found this to work the best.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed a remarkable difference after using the cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nice to not look like a hungover raccoon every morning!</li>
            <li> and it is quite effective !</li>
            <li> This product has been a pleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li> Good stuff that I will continue to use</li>
            <li> The cream feels good on my skin, too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That was good</li>
            <li> Combined with a good moisturizer, it also works well for my eye area, crow lines are still there</li>
            <li> For the price, I think this is a good product.  </li>
            <li> I am now using a squalene oil from olives and find that works as good as anything.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for an inexpensive really good eye cream you have found it.</li>
            <li> And I must say it works fairly well for me.</li>
            <li> Use a good moisturizer and face wash.</li>
            <li> Love most of Neutrogena stuff, but this eye treatment is perfect in moisturizing level for my combination skin.</li>
            <li> Takes the fine lines and erases them!!</li>
            <li> This has helped tremendously!!!  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I have been using it about two weeks, and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how much I love this stuff!! :)</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use and if I notice a change for the better I will update!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, even though I can&#x27;t use it as intended, I do see results that for the price of the product, I think are pretty impressive.  </li>
            <li> they are amazing, but never this one, or anything that reeks with fragrance.</li>
            <li> , I really liked it.</li>
            <li> Besides the price is good and I like neutrogena:)</li>
            <li> I probably should have gone to CVS to get a product just as good or better.</li>
            <li> nice product and came as desribed in ad - would buy again.</li>
            <li> It has a nice consistency somewhere between a serum and a cream.</li>
            <li> It absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li> But it feels nice going on and doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes</li>
            <li> Nice texture, not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> because the product ingredients may not have been as effective if the tube had been opened.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try this before spending that much money and have been very happy.  </li>
            <li> but it does feel nice.  </li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel nice</li>
            <li> but honestly I don&#x27;t see any improvements</li>
            <li> 0% effective.</li>
            <li> It seems to be working nicely.</li>
            <li> This formula works nicely as a complement to the Neutrogena Rapid Tone Repair Moisturizer Night.</li>
            <li> tried many products that claim how effective their eye treatment is until i tried neutrogena rapid wrinkle repair eyes</li>
            <li> so far Neutrogena is the best I use Neutrogena</li>
            <li> but as you know most products today are sold with some kind of safety seal that ensures purity.  </li>
            <li> Fills in lines and moistens skin around eyes nicely making for a more youthful look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 36 and have pretty good skin, so I wasn&#x27;t looking for a miracle, just a good night time moisturizer, and this works well.</li>
            <li> I have used this for more than two months and quite honestly I noticed that it makes my wrinkles MORE pronounced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I purchased this, it really works and you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> This has nice light scent, and is easy and nice to apply.</li>
            <li> After talking to them and doing my own research, I bought this product for the fine lines around my 48-year-old eyes.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles around my  eyes and have been using for a year</li>
            <li> My eyes look significantly better after two weeks.</li>

            <li> I feel much better knowing Im not putting chemicals on my skin anymore.</li>
            <li> Love all Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> There are better products out there that I&#x27;m discovering.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think i love it</li>
            <li> Make sure you use it with tapping motions.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm and cheap!</li>
            <li> but much better than how they used to be.</li>
            <li> I look way more rested</li>
            <li> and my eyes look better than I thought they could.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> It was okay.</li>
            <li> My aesthetician recommended a retinol product but the one at the spa was more than $75.00.  </li>
            <li> and then use my Bioelements Sleepwear overnight moisturizer over top of it.  </li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> or I would be even more dissapointed</li>
            <li> I have tried many products to keep wrinkles at bay</li>
            <li> Just ok will buy peter Thomas Roth firming cream before I wood buy this again  </li>
            <li> This is one of the better eye creams for the price.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I quit using the eye cream and after more than a week of using all kinds of things to heal this up</li>
            <li> My eye area does appear more youthful after using it for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have many wrinkles to begin with.</li>
            <li> normally i love all neutogena products if they do what they say they are supposed to do.</li>
            <li> read the reviews and really thought this would be a great product.  </li>
            <li> I would probably pay a lot more for this</li>
            <li> I found this to be a pretty good alternative to pricier eye creams.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this eye cream for two weeks and it seemed to be doing a good job at first</li>
            <li> I will be 47 this year and am very happy that this stuff a long with</li>
            <li> just apply it before sleeping on a clean face..voila!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 1 year and works perfectly, I can notice less fine wrinkles!</li>
            <li> Doing great so far on and around my eye area.</li>
            <li> good price and fast delivey</li>
            <li> The product works somewhat for me, but I had hoped for more significant results.</li>
            <li> So I decided to try another product, Clinique All About Eyes Rich, to see if I could find something better.</li>
            <li> I break out easily, and this product didn&#x27;t cause any breakout problems for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far so good will post more info when it has been one month.</li>
            <li> I do highly recommend this product and if you try it, I hope you have as good an experience as I did.</li>
            <li> And it did not disappoint me and I am very happy about its effectivenss on reducing dark circles.</li>
            <li> The area is brighter, smoother and clearer, and the fine lines have softened.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks I noticed reduction of fine lines, but it did irritated my skin around my eyes a lil.</li>
            <li> some of the fine lines under my eyes</li>
            <li> I have been using the Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Eye all over my face, and it is working - improving the look of fine lines and making my face smoother.</li>
            <li> It appears to work fine</li>
            <li> It doesnt irritate my skin and it smells fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this for 2-3 months, I could see a noticeable difference in the fine lines;</li>
            <li> I am 28 and have some fine lines under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I am 25, and I use it twice a day and it didn&#x27;t make any difference in my fine lines.</li>
            <li> Is Super!</li>
            <li> It helps to temporarily smooth fine lines underneath the eye and works well under my makeup.</li>
            <li> The fine lines disappeared and the eyes looks crease free.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and silky and goes on smooth, but I have not noticed any real improvements in fine lines.</li>
            <li> just purchased the intensive serum after reading such great reviews, so I’m super excited to see the results of this one!</li>
            <li> She reported that this product makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and keeps the eye area hydrated.  </li>
            <li> This incredibly light, unscented eye cream is a powerhouse performer.</li>
            <li> Feel free to call me</li>
            <li> This eye cream applies smoothly, without a greasy feel.  </li>
            <li> Though, what is of primary importance is that it does not appear that it contains harmful chemicals that have been linked to cancer etc.</li>
            <li> and it want cheap for me</li>
            <li> and I enjoy the product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s helping with wrinkles, but it is a fantastic moisturizer for the eyes.</li>
            <li> It is light weight</li>
            <li> I think this is a fantastic eye creme.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy with this product,  saw no results, back to the grave yard!!</li>
            <li> So far it does a good job of moisturizing without and side effects of skin breakouts.</li>
            <li> Not disappointed with this eye cream, works well under makeup and has helped with fine lines under eyes.</li>
            <li> --if you are willing to wait a while to see results and don&#x27;t expect your lines to completely disappear, I think you will be happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product very much and recommended it to my friends as well.  </li>
            <li> I found a new way to use concealer that seems to work best, which I did not know until very recently that applying dots under the eye (like I&#x27;ve done for 30 yrs.)</li>
            <li> does not work exactly as advertised, but it is okay</li>
            <li> Did not see significant results.</li>
            <li> I did significant research before purchasing an eye cream and was torn between this one and the &amp;#34;RoC&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I was so excited that I started taking pictures of the progress from week to week.</li>
            <li> The best, better than the more expensive brands and it works.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t trust it&#x27;s original product.</li>
            <li> I did however contact the seller because the product was not sealed or in any kind of packaging (although it was listed as brand new)</li>
            <li> it really helps I made a excellent choice buying this product I have tried so many creams products for the eye-face in the past</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and absorbs well -- the skin around my eyes always looks healthy and vibrant.</li>
            <li> I’m so happy with this product that I already purchase a second bottle, so I don’t have to worry about ordering another one, when I get finished with my first bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that most just hydrate the eye area but don&#x27;t really do much of anything for the wrinkles.......</li>
            <li> I feel like I gave it a fair try, and I&#x27;m switching back to the product I used before after 3 weeks of hating how the skin under my eyes looks.</li>
            <li> Not only was I wanting to remove the milia, I wanted a good eye cream as well.</li>
            <li> Look at that full set of traveling luggage under your eyes and do nothing?  </li>
            <li> My issue was more dark circles - but wrinkle repair is always good.</li>
            <li> When I used it at night, my eyes would feel kind of foggy the next morning but after washing my face it was fine.</li>
            <li> This product is great as part of face routine with the other products in this line....</li>
            <li> After my skin was better I went back to using it, because I liked it so much at  first.</li>
            <li> Everything was fine with the order and exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> After just the first night of use I could see improvement in the look of my undereye along with fine lines.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s older than I am, has better skin than I do, and swears by this product.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a good eye cream for a relatively low price, this one is definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> Over time I&#x27;ve tried another products but have yet to find another cream that worked as quickly and brightens the eye area.  </li>
            <li> Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I use a lot of Neutrogena products and was eager to try this new product for fine lines under the eyes, especially because it had some good testimonials.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see what continual and consistent use will do.</li>
            <li> This product is my favorite goes on smooth and is very hydrating for my 63 year old eyes.</li>
            <li> It seems to smooth the skin in the eye area and is gentle.  </li>
            <li> it was worth it for that.  </li>
            <li> Crows feet gone, now if this company could get a product to get rid of smile lines.</li>
            <li> I always ask myself if a product is “worth what I paid” for it.</li>
            <li> The fine line beginnings of crows feet at the corners of my eyes are completely gone, and the lines under my eyes reduced tremendously.</li>
            <li> Many people are fine with the Retinol in this moisturizer but the problem I ran into was that my skin was far too sensitive.</li>
            <li> Will never switch again, this is fantastic for my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Recommend usage for prevention and to treat new surfacing fine lines.</li>
            <li> Product came quick and in very protective packaging.</li>
            <li> my eye skin is much more supple more and the dark sircles is much lighter</li>
            <li> I am in my early 20&#x27;s and started to notice some fine lines around my eyes</li>
            <li> Not that I have has success with anything else, but this one certainly does not work.  </li>
            <li> Most of the time, I apply it at night so it will stay on for several hours without being disturbed.  </li>
            <li> I actually had much better results by just applying Oil of Olay Night Time Firming Cream around my eyes.</li>
            <li> This really works!  </li>
            <li> Maybe there are more expensive safe creams out there that work better, but, again, for the price, my wife has no complaints.</li>
            <li> Received the product almost three months ago and I&#x27;ve been using it consistently and as directed.</li>
            <li> I thought I had a viral infection the first time.</li>
            <li> Stopped using it and went with a higher end retinol with no stink that I was using before and ahve no reactions to it .</li>
            <li> working at first, decided to stick with it.</li>
            <li> Not only did it reduce the milia under my eyes, it gave my eyes more of a well-rested appearance.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as more of a preventative measure in terms of taking care of possible crow&#x27;s feet at the edge of my eyes.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen much results, but it&#x27;s fun to pretend.  </li>
            <li> This might be because I have pretty oily skin, even on my eyelids.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I recommend starting with the smallest dab you can put on your fingertip, patting it in, and then adding more if you need to.  </li>
            <li> It does have a burning/warmth sensation when first applied so expect that.</li>
            <li> use this daily , I love it</li>
            <li> I could not believe how one use could do so much damage!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely use up the tube and give it more time.</li>
            <li> This product really works!</li>
            <li> But when I tried to do it every day, for the first time it set my skin on fire.</li>
            <li> tried this product for around a month yet didn&#x27;t notice any real difference regarding the wrinkles under the eyes yet is good for the dark spots under the eyes.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing just like Neutrogenas other skin care products.</li>
            <li> but I actually find it more effective on dark circles:)&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> Is nice for moisture, but I do not see any difference in regard to any of the other claims.</li>
            <li> , It does take a few days to see results but it feels amazing and refreshed when applied, not stuck and almost give you a shimmer looked, I see better results when I use this right after my shower when my pores are open as to at night before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve definitely spent much more on beauty products from boutiques, so the price was worth giving this product a shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it but expected a tiny bit more from the product.  </li>
            <li> The wrinkles around my eyes are not near as noticeable, and the puffiness under my eyes is much better.</li>
            <li> Very punctual delivery, it exactly what it describe</li>
            <li> Those of you with dryer or more normal skin might have no problems at all with wearing this under makeup, so definitely try it for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good shipping.product works and last a long time.worth it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any dramatic change, but it is nice and moisturizing, and my fine lines do seem a little more plump and filled in.</li>
            <li> It definitely moisturizes and gets rid of the bags, but it didn&#x27;t do anything to get rid of fine lines.</li>
            <li> Gentle on your skin</li>
            <li> Both softens and firms the eye area, very noticible under the eyes.</li>
            <li> I really like this eye cream.  </li>
            <li> The price is really reasonable, too.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much of a difference while using this.</li>
            <li> but this didn&#x27;t really help.</li>
            <li> THIS.....is ironic, because.....</li>
            <li> Thanks you,  Silvia Brooks    </li>
            <li> Fast delivery and works</li>
            <li> And as always, I&#x27;m amazed at Amazon&#x27;s prices - much lower than retail.</li>
            <li> Took about a month for the difference to be really noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so didn&#x27;t lose much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve have used this product and really dont know if its working or not.  </li>
            <li> and you really don&#x27;t need that much for the eye area.</li>
            <li> , there is no product that can do the whole trick not for that price,</li>
            <li> Thanks Neutrogena and thank you to the responsible vendor.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference yet.  </li>
            <li> After going to a Dermatologist and hearing how much it would be to remove them, plus the recovery time - I was on a mission to find a cream that would help diminish my milia over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> did not do much for me</li>
            <li> it absorbs fast and not greasy.  </li>
            <li> No odor, just smooths on and I&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
            <li> I know this got great reviews, but i find my skin in worse</li>
            <li> I really didnt see a difference in using this product undernearth my eyes..</li>
            <li> and it is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff for my eyes</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t help with the bags as much as i thought it would.</li>
            <li> but given more time and daily use, it has far exceeded even my fondest expectations.</li>
            <li> noticed that I developed a patch of skin beneath the outer portion of one eye that turned red and kept gettomg redder, and it burned, sometimes without even touching it.</li>
            <li> I bought it for the newly developed crows feet I have from more sun exposure last year.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and steady but not dramatic overnight results...</li>
            <li> Works better than any other product I have used.</li>
            <li> and what&#x27;s more, because I&#x27;d ordered other things and didn&#x27;t pay close attention to the slip</li>
            <li> My eyes are pretty sensitive, but this product does not irritate at all.  </li>
            <li> Many eye creams that I have tried in the past fall into one of two categories: great moisture but somehow irritates my eyes OR completely dries out my delicate skin in my eye area with the wrinkle-reducing ingredients.  </li>
            <li> , I smooth this on, let it dry</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think any cream can get rid of wrinkles that  only a facelift can accomplish, but this product does make my skin look smoother, more refreshed and younger.  </li>
            <li> But it is a lot more expensive than this stuff, so I guess that&#x27;s why it worked better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since moved on to another product because I find that my skin&#x27;s needs change as I get older, but for the 2-3 years I used this</li>
            <li> Of course I didn&#x27;t see it as a permanent miracle, but I wont keep purchasing as part of daily routine when I have found lotion for the entire face that does the same thing, its more an extra step for around the eyes that I forget, and have had better products for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be tempted to remove a star for the results not being particularly rapid--this didn&#x27;t happen in the time frame suggested by the packaging--</li>
            <li> use this product mainly at night instead of during the day because if I wear it under makeup my experience has been that my eyeshadow wears off a lot faster than if I just use an eyelid primer.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely say that it made my eyes look more youthful overall.</li>
            <li> I am able to use this formula on my entire eye area including above my eyes at the brow.</li>
            <li> Works better than more expensive department store brands.</li>
            <li> highly recommended</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li> I will NEVER use this product again and would highly advise others against it.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate lines, but they have improved more than with any other product I have tried so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks, so I may need to give it a little more time.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t swear definitely that it was this eye cream, but I feel pretty certain it was</li>
            <li> It absorbs easily and does not interfere with my other skincare</li>
            <li> I have very dry, very sensitive skin and have started to notice fine lines around my eyes and mouth.  </li>
            <li> has not worked near as well or fast as Neutrogenas.</li>
            <li> Overall, it was worth the money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 20s and started using this as soon as I saw small under eye lines and very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> lotion is not too thick, no discernable fragrance, it doen&#x27;t burn but produces a warm sensation sometimes, say after microdermabration.</li>
            <li> I bought this mainly to address fine lines and wrinkles and to lighten dark areas.</li>
            <li> Well, the rash came right back.</li>
            <li> I have not seen much difference in my dark spots and will most likely not buy it again.</li>
            <li> makes me feel like a new born baby</li>
            <li> My daughter is pregnant and dealing with acne and fluctuating oily to dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes and</li>
            <li> First I have very sensitive skin around my eyes, and not every facial product is for me.  </li>
            <li> Under eye concealer/makeup blends well with it after use instead of sitting on small wrinkles and making them more noticeable like some products do after makeup is applied.</li>
            <li> For the past week I&#x27;ve been moisturizing a lot more and using night creams to see if it helped improve things.</li>
            <li> It does the exact opposite of what it claims.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena eye cream for 10 years and my eyes look exactly the same as the day I started.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to report that after using this cream for only 2 weeks, I saw a dramatic difference.</li>
            <li> There should be more apparent warnings that some people, apparently (see other reviews) cannot tolerate some ingredients in this product.</li>
            <li> My under eye area is soooo smooth, the bags are gone, my skin is brighter and the wrinkle depth is half its size.</li>
            <li> well enough that if I switched to a different full face brand I would still use this eye product.</li>
            <li> My dark circles are significantly diminished and the crepe-i-ness is unnoticeable.</li>
            <li> but I have also used it during the day to apply to other areas of my face (scowl lines) that I use the full face cream on.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake early on of putting too much product on so that my skin wasn&#x27;t able to absorb it all, and about an hour later when I rubbed my eye, I got a most unpleasant burning sensation.</li>
            <li> My research told me that there is not a tremendous difference in results from the ultra-expensive products and the cheaper ones that have effective actives like this one, and there is no product that is going to magically erase your lines and wrinkles overnight no matter how expensive it is.</li>
            <li> The wrinkles around my eyes are significantly lighter and less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> As a 68 year old sun lover living in Florida I did indeed see results.</li>
            <li> I am 38 years old, so it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m 80 and expecting miracles.  </li>
            <li> So far, I am not seeing an results.</li>
            <li> Though my skin tends to be sensitive, I use this product without experiencing either burning eyes or itchy skin.</li>
            <li> My eyes are brighter and it&#x27;s actually helped my undereye circles so much that I don&#x27;t need concealer anymore</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t completely achieved the outcome I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite 30 but want to start tackling the signs of aging as early as I can.  </li>
            <li> but I believe that finding a gentle moisturizer to keep my eye area hydrated will help to stave off the development of crows feet and help keep my upper lid lifted.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not going to completely remove your lines, but it does soften them, and it doesn&#x27;t cause concealer to &#x27;cake&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> This product sucks like most eye creams.  </li>
            <li> The skin is so soft.</li>
            <li> This product does moisturize well but as far as repair eye wrinkles, it didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  </li>
            <li> Just another 47 year old hamburger patty on the grill of life(lol).</li>
            <li> have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this has not caused any irritation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 60 year old guy.  </li>
            <li> Oh yeah, and don&#x27;t get old.</li>
            <li> I am 39 years old</li>
            <li> Thus the four out of five stars to early to give five stars.</li>
            <li> If you have not tired this I will recommend it especially if you have tan skin</li>
            <li> But so far I have not seen an difference in my wrinkles</li>
            <li> I used this religiously for a month straight.</li>
            <li> I am 32 yrs old</li>
            <li> Makes skin around eyes feel soft</li>
            <li> I used the product for 1 month completely and still no difference.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m surprised how inexpensive it is.</li>
            <li> Have only been using it for a few weeks so time will tell if the results get better.</li>
            <li> This product works great on sensitive under eye skin &amp; only a small application is need so it last long.</li>
            <li> At 39 I am seeing more and more and was hoping to try and at least slow the process, but no luck.</li>
            <li> I mean dryer and the wrinkles more pronounced.</li>
            <li> so I have dark circles and a few fine lines around my eyes when I smile</li>
            <li> Tried numerous drugstore, high end and natural based creams with no effect on the lines around my eyes at all (Lumene, Burt Bees, Origins to name a few).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I stopped using eye cream for a while and recently found this eye cream and was motivated to give it a try because of its decent reviews.</li>
            <li> Hoping my skin will go back to normal b/c</li>
            <li> all three facial products live up to</li>
            <li> This product is gentle, moisturizes my eye area without irritation, and does not leave me with dry, scaly skin.  </li>
            <li> This product really helped with the dry skin around my eyes -</li>
            <li> The burning sensation at the first few applications is quite normal and it will go away soon.</li>
            <li> Several tubes later and all is exactly the same.</li>
            <li> and I have actually noticed a difference in my lines not being nearly as noticeable!</li>
            <li> I have faithfully applied it since August, two times a day to clean, dried skin and still see my wrinkles in the same state since before I began applying the cream.</li>
            <li> But, the main reason I am only giving it 3 stars is because I wake up every morning with a red horizontal line coming out of the edges of both my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend this product to women my age who are trying to slow down the natural aging process with this very affordable product.</li>
            <li> started searching high and low, all over amazon and the internet for different creams.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see any less wrinkles but actually see more when I compare it to my other eye where I&#x27;m using an Obagi eye cream.</li>
            <li> I used this product ONCE at night (along with my usual moisturizer), and literally woke up with huge visible (and multiple!)</li>
            <li> abandoned ship and used my old cream.&lt;br /&gt;Going totry hydroxatone next..</li>
            <li> It is ok but not great.</li>
            <li> I literally see results as soon as I put in on my face and distinct results within a few days.  </li>
            <li> On the OTHER hand, the results were very noticeable on my skin.</li>
            <li> My under eyes did start to brighten up but other than that I haven&#x27;t seem much of a difference.</li>
            <li> I usually have pretty sensitive skin around my eyes and this has never given me a problem.</li>
            <li> It burns a little at first</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed dramatic improvement, but my skin feels soft and moisturized, I&#x27;ve had no irritation and the fragrance is fine.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cream because of all the great reviews and am totally disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It seems to instantly brighten my dark circles and my fine lines look less.</li>
            <li> Absolutely didn&#x27;t reduce dark circles below my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and didn&#x27;t want it to dry out, so put petroleum jelly around my eyes at night before I put it on..</li>
            <li> After applying the stuff for a few weeks, I noticed significant results on my previous wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I was trying to save a little from my normal Dermalogica total eye care, and this wasn&#x27;t the same thing at all.  </li>
            <li> I have deep wrinkles and although they do not completely disappear, they definitely ease up.</li>
            <li> My eye area looked brighter, smoother, and nearly erased my dark circles...</li>
            <li> Add your blush, then add your translucent powder, and blend with a flat kubuki brush.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed because usually Neutrogena products are very good.</li>
            <li> Really works on the hard wrinkles, especially on your forehead!</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t see a difference except that it leaves a dry white residue around my eyes</li>
            <li> It does burn a little, but if the above is the other option, I will take the mild burning sensation which does diminish after a few days of use.</li>
            <li> THis product irritated my skins so bad that it caused redness and swelling and because of that I have more skin damage! .</li>
            <li> You should make a triangle from the corner of your eye down to nearly the bottom of your nose (not quite, you&#x27;ll know how far down) then make a row of lines close together, all the way to the other corner of your eye to create a triangular shape.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product I&#x27;m in my late 20s and do not get the sleep in need</li>
            <li> After a minor freak out about aging prematurely, I purchased this and have been using it morning/night for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Neutrogena rapid wrinkle repair eye cream goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It goes a long ways.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this for people that have very sensitive skin or have had adverse reactions to Retinol in the past.</li>
            <li> check back to my order on that date, because I got OTHER items, but I did NOT get that.....</li>
            <li> On the mornings I use it the skin around my eyes looks dry and wrinkled.</li>
            <li> Made my skin incredibly dry and irritated.</li>
            <li> and if you have dry skin, may need to put additional cream over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my skin is so dry</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t feel any burning, but I have pretty tough skin</li>
            <li> Not appropriate for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> it say my dark circles has left 90% under my eyes.ive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never dealt with dark circles under my eyes, but it definitely gave a brighter appearance under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Dark circles under my eyes seem to be brightened and not as deep as they were before.</li>
            <li> The only curious thing is that this did not happen beneath the other eye.</li>
            <li> However, if you have sensitive skin you may want to use Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Eye less and/or less often.</li>
            <li> Actually the lines under my eyes seemed to get worse, maybe because this product isn&#x27;t particularly moisturizing.    </li>
            <li> I only use this at night before bed and a single tube lasts me around 4-5 months as you only need a very little amount.</li>
            <li> It provides a little moisture but there were no long term effects as stated by manufacturer.</li>
            <li> First I tried an outrageously expensive department store serum and got moderate results.</li>
            <li> Granted, it doesn&#x27;t last all that long, but why waste product and get a burning eye?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think for the price it does not live up to any expectations!</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t noticed a single change with this product!</li>
            <li> Tight to the point of soreness, red, flaky, baggy.  </li>
            <li> It only takes a little dab for results.</li>
            <li> , I think this little tube can last for quite a while before it runs out</li>
            <li> My eyelids are usually a little puffy, and it took that away instantly.</li>
            <li> but it would last you few months.</li>
            <li> I am just 40 and have minimal wrinkles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Just be careful to use sunscreen while using this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 46 and have no real visable wrinkles but was looking for something to help with the beginning of some eye area</li>
            <li> Not really.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take away what&#x27;s already there, but it seems to slow down the new wrinkle growth rate.</li>
            <li> Teaching an old dawg new tricks is easier said than done, for this hard headed gal!!!</li>
            <li> --they have not disappeared, but they are less deep and much less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> My rings are half of what they were in less than a week, only used at bedtime(when</li>
            <li> For the past few years, I have developed a lot of milia under my eye area</li>
            <li> I notice that my dark circles are reduced only after a few days.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> (Also, the product lasts--a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I started to peel, and started just applying every other night and the peeling stopped..</li>
            <li> While I like this product, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s actually working.  </li>
            <li> It may work on other people.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be trying other products in this line.</li>
            <li> Over these past months, I&#x27;ve only gone through two tubes.</li>
            <li> I plan on trying the other products in this line also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve reviewed other items I use that are a part of the Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair line of products.  </li>
            <li> It takes a small dab to cover the entire eye area.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this based on other reviews and after using for over a month have not noticed any difference.  </li>
            <li> Maybe the retinol and other ingredients were compromised since the product was not sealed, but the product didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> I tried the every other day.</li>
            <li> Not really much improvement over other brand eye creams I can buy for half the price.</li>
            <li> I was shocked that in a few weeks, the skin under my eyes was dryer and showed more signs of age.</li>
            <li> I have tried several eye creams (some more expensive and some less expensive ones)</li>
            <li> I noticed a slight difference, but not much.</li>
            <li> As expected, I can tell there is less retinol in the eye formula.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a definative dark circle yet, just a thinning of the skin.  </li>
            <li> Friends asked what was wrong, I had deteriorated so much, so fast.  </li>
            <li> I had seriously dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have used it for two weeks now, and I notice that my circles do not appear as dark as they had been, and my eye area does not look as &#x27;stressed&#x27; as it had.  </li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t give any effect and results, i still have dark circle eys, wrinkles, don&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li> Most of the products are worthless.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had fine lines around my eyes ever since my early twenties and got worst over time due to stress etc.</li>
            <li> I see less visible dark circles.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and has made my crow&#x27;s feet less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> and I see no improvement just a slight stinging sensation while applying.</li>
            <li> but much less</li>
            <li> and I have to wipe it away half way through the day.  </li>
            <li> I gave this one star because less than 5 seconds of this product under my eyes it started to burn.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for less than a week</li>
            <li> did not seem to do anything, tried for 2 weeks and did not notice any less lines, would not order again</li>
            <li> , I have a lot less creasing than I did before.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping this stuff would help with the little dark spot coming in, in the corner below both eyes, close to my nose.  </li>
            <li> I have a huge fan of Neutrogena products but this one disappointed me.</li>
            <li> I used it for a few days and my eyelashes started thinning out which made it not worth using.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going to be a gradual process, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to take 10 years off of my eyelids, but I think I&#x27;m seeing a little less sag, and every little bit helps.</li>
            <li> oz seem little</li>
            <li> Little bumps I was getting under my eyes are gone.</li>
            <li> After just a little over a week of using this product, the appearance of my under-eye area is noticeably improved.</li>
            <li> It may be wishful thinking, but I think I see a little improvement.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product 5-6 days a week fora little over a month now</li>
            <li> I havent noticed any immediate or general improvement, as I have with other eye creams - seems kinda lame</li>
            <li> Have used for two months and there is no difference in the wrinkles round my eyes.</li>
            <li> Actually made my under eye are look worse than before I used it.</li>
            <li> This was not a cheap product</li>
            <li> I did not really start seeing a difference for quite a while, though--probably at least 8 weeks.</li>
            <li> not cheap</li>
            <li> I will have to update in a few years?</li>
            <li> The missing star is because it claims to repair wrinkle</li>
            <li> so I started using this and have stop been using now for a few months.</li>
            <li> This has made a visible difference in the few weeks that I&#x27;ve been using it</li>
            <li> It was far too expensive.</li>
            <li> , it is the wasted</li>
            <li> I have dark circles for a long time and was never happy about the eye creams I used in the past.</li>
            <li> , nothing would work under my eyes because they were so raw, not Benadryl or hydrocortisone.</li>
            <li> but I already can small lines around my eyes</li>
            <li> and I think my wrinkles have actually gotten worse!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it has helped (or will drastically improve)</li>
            <li> I am not sure I see ANY difference.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!  </li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but all those in need of improving the appearance of wrinkles should buy this product.</li>
            <li> No more.</li>
            <li> No more.</li>
            <li> I am quite a way past 65 and drooping eyelids needed something and not surgery.</li>
            <li> Just a small amount keeps your skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about &amp;#34;visible&amp;#34; results -</li>
            <li> Neutrogena usually has products that work well.</li>
            <li> No longer does my foundation or concealer get stuck as badly in those icky lines as much as it used to.</li>
            <li> The crows feet and under eye area are significantly worse looking like I had aged 20 years!!</li>
            <li> I apply it at least once a day, sometimes morning and night.  </li>
            <li> I have used the product morning and evening for at least a month.</li>
            <li> it does work at least for me.</li>
            <li> We all age but women are suckers when it comes to buying anti-aging products.  </li>
            <li> This probably sounds crazy but I saw overall improvement in ONE use.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for any woman who is facing her 40&#x27;s and not loving it.</li>
            <li> I am not overly sensitive skin type, but I hate heavy fragrance in skin care products;it</li>
            <li> like slow and never works</li>
            <li> for a mans face this product absorbs slowly but it firms up the bags and erases 5 years--will take that any day</li>
            <li> My dermatologist reccommended this product over other expensive brands.</li>
            <li> A must for anyone serious about their skin.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t do worse damage.</li>
            <li> and I do not see a reason why its not welcome for all age groups.</li>
            <li> Back when I wasn&#x27;t sleeping well and looking like crap</li>
            <li> It has a thin consistency that seeps into your eyes.</li>
            <li> and Neutrogena considers it a trade secret.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me, sad about wasting money and disappointed not to get what expected.</li>
            <li> My face developed horrible rashes about the areas that I&#x27;ve applied the product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product under one eye only and am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> you can never go wrong with them.</li>
            <li> I have never had a reaction to a product before, not happy about this!!</li>
            <li> But you can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> Sorry about this.  </li>
            <li> RAPID is the wrong word for this&lt;br /&gt;more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 8 or 9 months now and, while I was skeptical about it</li>
            <li> The girls in my office have converted from expensive brands after hearing about it.</li>
            <li> But I got a horrible rash on my face; flushed and rough skin on face, neck and chest.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointing.</li>
            <li> That is so 50 years ago and artificial fragrances on your face is just bad for you.</li>
            <li> My wrinkle is not as bad looking as it was before.</li>
            <li> My under eye concealer was creasing so bad because my under eye wrinkles had become so pronounced.</li>
            <li> Really bad.  </li>
            <li> Very unhappy</li>
            <li> Then, using a sponge, pounce it to blend, then use your base around don&#x27;t go over this.  </li>
            <li> worthless, worst neutrogena product i have ever used</li>
            <li> it looks terrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used this for more than two months and quite honestly I noticed that it makes my wrinkles MORE pronounced. On the mornings I use it the skin around my eyes looks dry and wrinkled. Extremely disappointing.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena products...you can never go wrong with them. Gentle on your skin and it does what it says it&#x27;ll do!</li>
            <li> As a 68 year old sun lover living in Florida I did indeed see results. Have only been using it for a few weeks so time will tell if the results get better.</li>
            <li> I definitely noticed a difference after a week of applying this under my eyes. I have deep wrinkles and although they do not completely disappear, they definitely ease up. I experimented with not applying it for a week and my deep wrinkles were back! Although it may be a temporary fix, it still helps and I would use it probably forever. .05 oz seem little but it would last you few months. I apply day and night, just under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I also use it around my lips for wrinkles. I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles around my  eyes and have been using for a year</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work... Don&#x27;t buy into the gimmick</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I have very sensitive eyes and this cream does not irratate at all. Both softens and firms the eye area, very noticible under the eyes. Little bumps I was getting under my eyes are gone. My eyes look significantly better after two weeks. Works better than any other product I have used.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cream because of all the great reviews and am totally disappointed.  I have been  using it now for over 6 weeks, faithfully.  I apply it at least once a day, sometimes morning and night.  Most of the time, I apply it at night so it will stay on for several hours without being disturbed.  However, I have seen not the slightest bit of improvement in even my finest wrinkles. I am 38 years old, so it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m 80 and expecting miracles.  This product didn&#x27;t plump or moisturize my skin, and sometimes it actually looked worse~by that I mean dryer and the wrinkles more pronounced. I actually had much better results by just applying Oil of Olay Night Time Firming Cream around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Good stuff that I will continue to use</li>
            <li> Seems to do the job as advertised</li>
            <li> Works great! Would buy again.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is wonderful.  Goes on smoothly and keeps the eye area hydrated.  I have been using it for about a week now and have noticed some softening of the lines and wrinkles around my eyes.  There is no scent so it doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes.  Great product!</li>
            <li> A++++ item as pictured. Does what it is supposed to do. Recommended!</li>
            <li> I love ALL Neutrogena products, and am extremely pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> great product to vanish eye wrinkles and laughlines around your brows. just apply it before sleeping on a clean face..voila! no lines and smoothes every creases. highly recommended</li>
            <li> Not really much improvement over other brand eye creams I can buy for half the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a &amp;#34;nighttime&amp;#34; treatment in my book.... (Daytime is for SPF and hydration).... Inexpensive and steady but not dramatic overnight results...</li>
            <li> This incredibly light, unscented eye cream is a powerhouse performer. After just a little over a week of using this product, the appearance of my under-eye area is noticeably improved. The area is brighter, smoother and clearer, and the fine lines have softened. Another great anti-aging product from Neutrogena!</li>
            <li> Love this eye treatment. Love most of Neutrogena stuff, but this eye treatment is perfect in moisturizing level for my combination skin. It&#x27;s not greasy at all, so it may not be enough moisturizing for some people with drier skin.</li>
            <li> This really works!  I don&#x27;t think any cream can get rid of wrinkles that  only a facelift can accomplish, but this product does make my skin look smoother, more refreshed and younger.  Considering how many creams I have tried, I found this to work the best.  I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I really like this eye cream.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and has made my crow&#x27;s feet less noticeable.  The price is really reasonable, too.  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Good shipping.product works and last a long time.worth it.</li>
            <li> Have used for two months and there is no difference in the wrinkles round my eyes.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much of a difference while using this. It lasted me about 2-3 months and I wore it every day. I am 24 but I already can small lines around my eyes but this didn&#x27;t really help. After I finished the tube, I began using Rhonda Alison&#x27;s eye cream and I can see a bit of a difference. But it is a lot more expensive than this stuff, so I guess that&#x27;s why it worked better.</li>
            <li> THIS.....is ironic, because.....I NEVER RECEIVED this item.....check back to my order on that date, because I got OTHER items, but I did NOT get that.....and what&#x27;s more, because I&#x27;d ordered other things and didn&#x27;t pay close attention to the slip, I didn&#x27;t even realize I DIDN&#x27;T get it, so could you please look into this matter for me...NOW....I DID give it a rating, but again I....NEVER received it.    Thanks you,  Silvia Brooks    slv_brooks@yahoo.com    PS. Feel free to call me and/or email me about this matter, because, now I&#x27;m concerned that I did NOT get it.</li>
            <li> AS promised, this eye cream works.  I&#x27;ve never actually used something like \\&quot;as directed\\&quot; but now that I am I can see results.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and works okay</li>
            <li> I found this to be a pretty good alternative to pricier eye creams.  It worked well for me for quite awhile.  I&#x27;ve since moved on to another product because I find that my skin&#x27;s needs change as I get older, but for the 2-3 years I used this, I really liked it.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product. So far, I am not seeing an results. It did irritate my skin a bit and I ended up breaking out from it. I have acne prone skin and this product irritated it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this eye cream for two weeks and it seemed to be doing a good job at first but then the outside corners of my eyes got burned from this cream and it hurts to put anything on it but maybe neosporin. The crows feet and under eye area are significantly worse looking like I had aged 20 years!! I am just 40 and have minimal wrinkles. I will not use this anymore so I don&#x27;t do worse damage. Hoping my skin will go back to normal b/c it looks terrible! I have never had a reaction to a product before, not happy about this!!</li>
            <li> I have not seen any results as advertised.  I have used the product morning and evening for at least a month.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks I noticed reduction of fine lines, but it did irritated my skin around my eyes a lil. I had to suspend for a while</li>
            <li> I like this cream and maybe I will repurchase. I do not have any lines or wrinkles around my eye area so I can not leave testimony on how/if it works. But it has not done any damage and has retinol. Besides the price is good and I like neutrogena:)</li>
            <li> does not work exactly as advertised, but it is okay</li>
            <li> I had tried prescription retin-A cream for my eyelid wrinkles several years ago, but the resulting irritation kept me from continuing. I finally decided to try one of the newer retinol creams to see if I could do anything to help my increasingly crepe-y middle-aged eyelids. It may be wishful thinking, but I think I see a little improvement. It&#x27;s going to be a gradual process, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to take 10 years off of my eyelids, but I think I&#x27;m seeing a little less sag, and every little bit helps. The cream feels good on my skin, too. I&#x27;ll definitely keep using it! And as always, I&#x27;m amazed at Amazon&#x27;s prices - much lower than retail.</li>
            <li> This has nice light scent, and is easy and nice to apply. But, I am still waiting to see results. Hopefully, the results will speak for themselves in another month or two!</li>
            <li> This eye cream applies smoothly, without a greasy feel.  Though my skin tends to be sensitive, I use this product without experiencing either burning eyes or itchy skin.</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with Neutrogena Ageless Restoratives Instant Eye Reviver. My dark circles are significantly diminished and the crepe-i-ness is unnoticeable. Took about a month for the difference to be really noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t feel any burning, but I have pretty tough skin so didn&#x27;t expect any problems. I break out easily, and this product didn&#x27;t cause any breakout problems for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY pleased with this product and will buy it again and again.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me, sad about wasting money and disappointed not to get what expected.</li>
            <li> I really like this product I&#x27;m in my late 20s and do not get the sleep in need so I have dark circles and a few fine lines around my eyes when I smile, It does take a few days to see results but it feels amazing and refreshed when applied, not stuck and almost give you a shimmer looked, I see better results when I use this right after my shower when my pores are open as to at night before I go to bed. Both men and women could use this and I do not see a reason why its not welcome for all age groups.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for three weeks now and I see no improvement just a slight stinging sensation while applying. I wish it would have done something. Learning through trial and error that there are no wrinkle fixes in a bottle.</li>
            <li> Within this price range, I don&#x27;t think that you can beat this cream. Though, what is of primary importance is that it does not appear that it contains harmful chemicals that have been linked to cancer etc. Maybe there are more expensive safe creams out there that work better, but, again, for the price, my wife has no complaints.</li>
            <li> This product has helped the skin around my eyes look better than ever.  My eyes are pretty sensitive, but this product does not irritate at all.  Very nice!</li>
            <li> The product did nothing but moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;That was good but I bought for treatment benefits of which there were none.&lt;br /&gt;Product inexpensive so didn&#x27;t lose much. Even so would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love this! I noticed a change after just a week. My eyes are brighter and it&#x27;s actually helped my undereye circles so much that I don&#x27;t need concealer anymore</li>
            <li> good price and fast delivey</li>
            <li> Received the product almost three months ago and I&#x27;ve been using it consistently and as directed. I am 30 years old and developed a few lines around my under eye area. This product has definitely softened those lines after 3 months of use but it has not eliminated them. Perhaps I just need to use it for a longer period of time. Also, I did not experience any redness or swelling as a result of this product. Overall, it was worth the money but I haven&#x27;t completely achieved the outcome I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this stuff would help with the little dark spot coming in, in the corner below both eyes, close to my nose.  It&#x27;s not a definative dark circle yet, just a thinning of the skin.  I found a new way to use concealer that seems to work best, which I did not know until very recently that applying dots under the eye (like I&#x27;ve done for 30 yrs.) is not the proper way to use concealer.  You should make a triangle from the corner of your eye down to nearly the bottom of your nose (not quite, you&#x27;ll know how far down) then make a row of lines close together, all the way to the other corner of your eye to create a triangular shape.  Then, using a sponge, pounce it to blend, then use your base around don&#x27;t go over this.  Add your blush, then add your translucent powder, and blend with a flat kubuki brush.  This has helped tremendously!!!  Teaching an old dawg new tricks is easier said than done, for this hard headed gal!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great! Takes the fine lines and erases them!! I will be 47 this year and am very happy that this stuff a long with i also use the rapid eye repair at night does wonders!!! It burns a little at first but it did go away. I started to peel, and started just applying every other night and the peeling stopped.. I love finding a gem like this stuff for such a great price!! I would recommend this to everyone, give it a try, it&#x27;s not like your spending a lot of money! Personally, I would buy this if it was exspensive! That&#x27;s how much I love this stuff!! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve have used this product and really dont know if its working or not.  I probably should have gone to CVS to get a product just as good or better.</li>
            <li> Doing great so far on and around my eye area. I can already see the difference. My wrinkle is not as bad looking as it was before. I will continue using it to maximize the result of the cream. No Botox yet, hopefully.</li>
            <li> Did not see significant results.</li>
            <li> Used per directions and had a lot of irritated and peeling skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple years now and still love it. I usually have pretty sensitive skin around my eyes and this has never given me a problem. It goes on smooth and absorbs well -- the skin around my eyes always looks healthy and vibrant.</li>
            <li> Love it but expected a tiny bit more from the product.  But you can&#x27;t go wrong it does work at least for me.</li>
            <li> nice product and came as desribed in ad - would buy again.</li>
            <li> This product works great on sensitive under eye skin &amp; only a small application is need so it last long.</li>
            <li> While I like this product, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s actually working.  But, the main reason I am only giving it 3 stars is because I wake up every morning with a red horizontal line coming out of the edges of both my eyes.  This seems to defeat the purpose.</li>
            <li> This product never disappoints.  I use it day and night.</li>
            <li> I like this product. It has a nice consistency somewhere between a serum and a cream. A little goes a long way. It absorbs nicely. Under eye concealer/makeup blends well with it after use instead of sitting on small wrinkles and making them more noticeable like some products do after makeup is applied. Says for eyes but I have also used it during the day to apply to other areas of my face (scowl lines) that I use the full face cream on. This product is great as part of face routine with the other products in this line....however, I like it well enough that if I switched to a different full face brand I would still use this eye product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a regular eye mosturizing cream, After 2 months using it I don&#x27;t see any difference. It just gives a softer appearance to the under-eye area, but it doesn&#x27;t evens the skin, nor combats wrinkles.</li>
            <li> To me the product has not worked .I was trying this for over1 month and no results.Very unhappy and it want cheap for me I do not recommend this .There are cream I have been trying and do work better.</li>
            <li> I have used the rapid wrinkle repair line for 6 months now and I think my wrinkles have actually gotten worse!  Not that I have has success with anything else, but this one certainly does not work.  At 39 I am seeing more and more and was hoping to try and at least slow the process, but no luck.</li>
            <li> I have just purchased my second tube of Rapid Wrinkle Eye Repair from Neutrogena. It goes without saying that, since I&#x27;ve re-ordered, I obviously like the product! I&#x27;m not quite 30 but want to start tackling the signs of aging as early as I can.  Many eye creams that I have tried in the past fall into one of two categories: great moisture but somehow irritates my eyes OR completely dries out my delicate skin in my eye area with the wrinkle-reducing ingredients.  This product is gentle, moisturizes my eye area without irritation, and does not leave me with dry, scaly skin.  I&#x27;m not sure it has helped (or will drastically improve) some of the fine lines under my eyes but I believe that finding a gentle moisturizer to keep my eye area hydrated will help to stave off the development of crows feet and help keep my upper lid lifted.  I would definitely recommend this cream to a friend and will continue to use myself!</li>
            <li> I thought this would be better than it is. It is ok but not great. I have not seen much difference in my dark spots and will most likely not buy it again.</li>
            <li> It does a great job of diminishing the darkness under the eyes. Back when I wasn&#x27;t sleeping well and looking like crap I put this stuff on and it worked. A good pair of glasses help too!</li>
            <li> Eh.  I&#x27;ve been using for several weeks.  I am not sure I see ANY difference.  But it feels nice going on and doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes so I gave it 3 stars.  I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Be care how you squeeze the bottle because it will ooze out and you really don&#x27;t need that much for the eye area.</li>
            <li> Starting the third tube of Rapid Wrinkle Repair Eye. The wrinkles around my eyes are significantly lighter and less noticeable.  I will continue to use this as part of my basic daily routine.</li>
            <li> Ouch!  Not appropriate for sensitive skin.  I am glad I tried this before going to a prescription strength.</li>
            <li> Using this for years, excellent product &amp; price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not going to completely remove your lines, but it does soften them, and it doesn&#x27;t cause concealer to &#x27;cake&#x27;.  Best product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Product came quick and in very protective packaging. I was impressed with delivery speed and I enjoy the product. It seems to instantly brighten my dark circles and my fine lines look less. I&#x27;m excited to see what continual and consistent use will do.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s to say? I like it and it seems to be working somewhat, there is no product that can do the whole trick not for that price,</li>
            <li> This product sucks like most eye creams.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!  Actually made my under eye are look worse than before I used it.</li>
            <li> Nice texture, not greasy at all. I do not see any effects on the wrinkles yet but as an eye cream it is very good.</li>
            <li> OK but would not buy again</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s older than I am, has better skin than I do, and swears by this product. I order it online, it arrives in 2 days and everyone is VERY happy. Thanks Neutrogena and thank you to the responsible vendor.</li>
            <li> I did significant research before purchasing an eye cream and was torn between this one and the &amp;#34;RoC&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m so happy I went with neutrogena. I&#x27;m 26 in med school and am starting to get crows feet and bags from the lack of sleep and stress. My under eye concealer was creasing so bad because my under eye wrinkles had become so pronounced. After a minor freak out about aging prematurely, I purchased this and have been using it morning/night for 2 weeks. My under eye area is soooo smooth, the bags are gone, my skin is brighter and the wrinkle depth is half its size. I&#x27;m so happy I purchased this, it really works and you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference yet.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks, so I may need to give it a little more time.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT FAST SHIPPING</li>
            <li> Great eye cream!  I love this cream it is affordable plus it works great. I have noticed a remarkable difference after using the cream. In fact I have recommended it to my sister.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than the expensive product that I was using - and a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> all three facial products live up to it say my dark circles has left 90% under my eyes.ive tried many products that claim how effective their eye treatment is until i tried neutrogena rapid wrinkle repair eyes im totally satisfied thank you</li>
            <li> I have been using the Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Eye all over my face, and it is working - improving the look of fine lines and making my face smoother. Combined with a good moisturizer, it also works well for my eye area, crow lines are still there but much less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using this, and I am tempted to try the one formulated specifically for face, for even better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is not too thick, no discernable fragrance, it doen&#x27;t burn but produces a warm sensation sometimes, say after microdermabration. It absorbs easily and does not interfere with my other skincare products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 weeks now and I don&#x27;t see a difference except that it leaves a dry white residue around my eyes and I have to wipe it away half way through the day.  This was not a cheap product so I&#x27;m going to keep using it until it&#x27;s gone and hope that at the end of the tube I see some type of improvement.  Rapid my eye!</li>
            <li> I gave this one star because less than 5 seconds of this product under my eyes it started to burn. I rinsed it off the next morning under my eyes felt like I had eczema, nothing would work under my eyes because they were so raw, not Benadryl or hydrocortisone. They both burned my under eye area.</li>
            <li> I started out liking this; I have been using retinols for a while and this had great reviews, so I thought I&#x27;d try it. I am not overly sensitive skin type, but I hate heavy fragrance in skin care products;it just isn&#x27;t \\&quot;clean\\&quot; to me. Well, I think I had a reaction, eventually, to the fragrance, not the retinol. But I got a horrible rash on my face; flushed and rough skin on face, neck and chest. Itchy. then it peeled, and my skin even had red blotches where it peeled very deeply. My skin is well exfoliated and maintained, so this was not necessary. I thought I had a viral infection the first time. After my skin was better I went back to using it, because I liked it so much at  first. Well, the rash came right back. Stopped using it and went with a higher end retinol with no stink that I was using before and ahve no reactions to it . I do recommend retinols- they are amazing, but never this one, or anything that reeks with fragrance. That is so 50 years ago and artificial fragrances on your face is just bad for you.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this anymore because I could not see a difference in my wrinkles around my eyes. It might have not worked on my skin.  Sorry about this.  It may work on other people.</li>
            <li> A must for anyone serious about their skin.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work as well reviews say.  I&#x27;m 5 weeks into it, and I don&#x27;t notice a difference at all.  I put this on twice a day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a chemist and have friends who work in the Beauty Care sector.  After talking to them and doing my own research, I bought this product for the fine lines around my 48-year-old eyes.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 months now and definitely see a difference in the lines--they have not disappeared, but they are less deep and much less noticeable.  I did not really start seeing a difference for quite a while, though--probably at least 8 weeks. For the price, I think this is a good product.  My research told me that there is not a tremendous difference in results from the ultra-expensive products and the cheaper ones that have effective actives like this one, and there is no product that is going to magically erase your lines and wrinkles overnight no matter how expensive it is. I was a bit shocked at how small the tube was when I first opened it up, but I use it twice a day and it has lasted me all summer with a fair amount still left. Bottom line--if you are willing to wait a while to see results and don&#x27;t expect your lines to completely disappear, I think you will be happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried several eye creams (some more expensive and some less expensive ones).....I&#x27;ve found that most just hydrate the eye area but don&#x27;t really do much of anything for the wrinkles.......this one however DOES seem to lessen the wrinkles under my eyes.....will continue to buy this one in the future i think!</li>
            <li> does everything it promises!</li>
            <li> eh. I cant say I noticed any difference in wrinkles. I think this one has convinced me to quit hunting for the fountain of youth..especially in the chemical isle. I am now using a squalene oil from olives and find that works as good as anything. I feel much better knowing Im not putting chemicals on my skin anymore.</li>
            <li> Love all Neutrogena. This is the only brand I&#x27;ve been using since in my 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> this does not work at all. RAPID is the wrong word for this&lt;br /&gt;more like slow and never works</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy for all those who&#x27;ve found the answer inside this product - but it didn&#x27;t work for me at all. Several tubes later and all is exactly the same. Still looking....</li>
            <li> I have been using  Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Eye cream for 2 months now.  i did not see any noticeable change. I am not going to buy another bottle. looking for another product.</li>
            <li> This has the crinkle removing benefit I was looking for, but its a daily thing. Of course I didn&#x27;t see it as a permanent miracle, but I wont keep purchasing as part of daily routine when I have found lotion for the entire face that does the same thing, its more an extra step for around the eyes that I forget, and have had better products for.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the raving reviews.  I applied the product as directed and saw zero results.  I&#x27;ve given it plenty of time and this product is big on hype but it just doesn&#x27;t deliver the results it claims to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 8 or 9 months now and, while I was skeptical about it working at first, decided to stick with it. The fine line beginnings of crows feet at the corners of my eyes are completely gone, and the lines under my eyes reduced tremendously. I&#x27;m 41 and don&#x27;t spend a lot of time in the sun. I&#x27;d be tempted to remove a star for the results not being particularly rapid--this didn&#x27;t happen in the time frame suggested by the packaging-- but given more time and daily use, it has far exceeded even my fondest expectations. I&#x27;ll be trying other products in this line. (Also, the product lasts--a little goes a long way. Over these past months, I&#x27;ve only gone through two tubes. Good value for good results!)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s helping with wrinkles, but it is a fantastic moisturizer for the eyes. The skin is so soft. It helps with puffiness.</li>
            <li> worthless, worst neutrogena product i have ever used</li>
            <li> There are better products out there that I&#x27;m discovering.</li>
            <li> This product did not do what is stated it would. It provides a little moisture but there were no long term effects as stated by manufacturer. Just another basic moisturizer. No repair results noted after three weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Is Super! it really helps I made a excellent choice buying this product I have tried so many creams products for the eye-face in the past so far Neutrogena is the best I use Neutrogena and I love it.</li>
            <li> Great eye cream and makes wonders</li>
            <li> I used it once a week ago and face has still not recovered.  Tight to the point of soreness, red, flaky, baggy.  Friends asked what was wrong, I had deteriorated so much, so fast.  Now have a dermatologist appointment to see what, if anything, can be done. There should be more apparent warnings that some people, apparently (see other reviews) cannot tolerate some ingredients in this product.</li>
            <li> for a mans face this product absorbs slowly but it firms up the bags and erases 5 years--will take that any day</li>
            <li> makes me feel like a new born baby</li>
            <li> Made my skin incredibly dry and irritated.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of Neutrogena products and was eager to try this new product for fine lines under the eyes, especially because it had some good testimonials.    I used it twice a day for 3 weeks and didn&#x27;t see any improvement. Actually the lines under my eyes seemed to get worse, maybe because this product isn&#x27;t particularly moisturizing.    I feel like I gave it a fair try, and I&#x27;m switching back to the product I used before after 3 weeks of hating how the skin under my eyes looks.</li>
            <li> I used this religiously for a while with no results.  I won&#x27;t be purchasing this item again.  Oh well; on to the next product...</li>
            <li> The product matches the description.</li>
            <li> Is oaky stuff .I  don&#x27;t think i love it .i don&#x27;t know it works or not .but i won&#x27;t buy it again .is not cheap and i don&#x27;t see it&#x27;s work</li>
            <li> Does not work as advertised. Disappointed because usually Neutrogena products are very good.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but all those in need of improving the appearance of wrinkles should buy this product.</li>
            <li> Not disappointed with this eye cream, works well under makeup and has helped with fine lines under eyes. Recommend usage for prevention and to treat new surfacing fine lines. I&#x27;m in my late 20s and started using this as soon as I saw small under eye lines and very happy with the results. Make sure you use it with tapping motions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream day and night for two months now and I have not noticed any difference. Since I still have it I might as well keep on using it.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm and cheap! After applying the stuff for a few weeks, I noticed significant results on my previous wrinkles.</li>
            <li> For the past few years, I have developed a lot of milia under my eye area and I was so self-conscious about it. After going to a Dermatologist and hearing how much it would be to remove them, plus the recovery time - I was on a mission to find a cream that would help diminish my milia over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started searching high and low, all over amazon and the internet for different creams. Of course I read that retinol, over time would help in decreasing milia. Not only was I wanting to remove the milia, I wanted a good eye cream as well. I don&#x27;t like using a million products to get the job done, so I didn’t want to purchase a cream specifically for the treatment of milia. After extensively reading the reviews for this products, I decided to give it a shot. I&#x27;ve definitely spent much more on beauty products from boutiques, so the price was worth giving this product a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy to report that after using this cream for only 2 weeks, I saw a dramatic difference. I was so excited that I started taking pictures of the progress from week to week. Not only did it reduce the milia under my eyes, it gave my eyes more of a well-rested appearance. I&#x27;ve never dealt with dark circles under my eyes, but it definitely gave a brighter appearance under my eyes. I’m so happy with this product that I already purchase a second bottle, so I don’t have to worry about ordering another one, when I get finished with my first bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just purchased the intensive serum after reading such great reviews, so I’m super excited to see the results of this one! Stay tuned for my review!</li>
            <li> First I have very sensitive skin around my eyes, and not every facial product is for me.  However, this one is.  I have been using it about two weeks, and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results. I use it in the mornings and again at night just before I go to bed. The wrinkles around my eyes are not near as noticeable, and the puffiness under my eyes is much better. If you are looking for an inexpensive really good eye cream you have found it. I plan on trying the other products in this line also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about a month.  It appears to work fine - I&#x27;m not noticing any changes in my wrinkles however so although it is a bit thicker and seems to saturate the area under the eyes well I don&#x27;t see that it is repairing anything.  I&#x27;ll continue to use and if I notice a change for the better I will update!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as more of a preventative measure in terms of taking care of possible crow&#x27;s feet at the edge of my eyes. It doesnt irritate my skin and it smells fine. I will have to update in a few years? lol</li>
            <li> We all age but women are suckers when it comes to buying anti-aging products.  Most of the products are worthless.  This product didn&#x27;t work for my wife.  No more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve reviewed other items I use that are a part of the Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair line of products.  The eye serum is an excellent product as well.  The eye serum works for me to use day and night.  I apply it all around my eyes not just on the lower lids.  It takes a small dab to cover the entire eye area.  If you should try the serum, I hope you&#x27;ll be happy with the results as I am.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had fine lines around my eyes ever since my early twenties and got worst over time due to stress etc. Tried numerous drugstore, high end and natural based creams with no effect on the lines around my eyes at all (Lumene, Burt Bees, Origins to name a few).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena rapid wrinkle repair eye cream goes a long way. I only use this at night before bed and a single tube lasts me around 4-5 months as you only need a very little amount. Don&#x27;t expect a ton of moisturization with this though and if you have dry skin, may need to put additional cream over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this for 2-3 months, I could see a noticeable difference in the fine lines; no they&#x27;re not all gone but much better than how they used to be. No longer does my foundation or concealer get stuck as badly in those icky lines as much as it used to.</li>
            <li> This probably sounds crazy but I saw overall improvement in ONE use. My eye area looked brighter, smoother, and nearly erased my dark circles... I look way more rested and my eyes look better than I thought they could. I would be happy with these results alone, so I cannot wait to see what happens over time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product faithfully for the last 3 months. I don&#x27;t see any dramatic change, but it is nice and moisturizing, and my fine lines do seem a little more plump and filled in. This might be wishful thinking on my part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful to use sunscreen while using this product.</li>
            <li> Does not work but it does burn your eyes.</li>
            <li> This eye repair cream is a wonder.  It only takes a little dab for results.</li>
            <li> Everything was fine with the order and exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for pre-menopausal women! It got rid of raccoon eyes that come from getting up at 3:30 am for work. It also puffs up the wrinkles and makes them disappear! It&#x27;s so nice to not look like a hungover raccoon every morning! No burning itching heat or any side effects! It is light weight it is not greasy and absorbs instantly. I would recommend this for any woman who is facing her 40&#x27;s and not loving it.</li>
            <li> Purchased this based on other reviews and after using for over a month have not noticed any difference.  I&#x27;m 46 and have no real visable wrinkles but was looking for something to help with the beginning of some eye area crows feet.  This product does moisturize well but as far as repair eye wrinkles, it didn&#x27;t do anything for me.  I did however contact the seller because the product was not sealed or in any kind of packaging (although it was listed as brand new) because the product ingredients may not have been as effective if the tube had been opened.  She claimed that it is the way it is sold but as you know most products today are sold with some kind of safety seal that ensures purity.  Maybe the retinol and other ingredients were compromised since the product was not sealed, but the product didn&#x27;t work for me and I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> I have used this product under one eye only and am very disappointed. Don&#x27;t see any less wrinkles but actually see more when I compare it to my other eye where I&#x27;m using an Obagi eye cream. i won&#x27;t  buy this product again and will start using the Obagi instead.</li>
            <li> Dark circles under my eyes seem to be brightened and not as deep as they were before. the wrinkles and puffiness seem to have leveled out and my skin texture is noticeably smoother.</li>
            <li> Love this. Been using it for years and it is quite effective !</li>
            <li> it is the way I expect it</li>
            <li> Bought this on August 15 and have not seen any improvement on my eye wrinkles. I have faithfully applied it since August, two times a day to clean, dried skin and still see my wrinkles in the same state since before I began applying the cream. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> I love this product very much and recommended it to my friends as well.  I notice that my dark circles are reduced only after a few days. I have dark circles for a long time and was never happy about the eye creams I used in the past. So I stopped using eye cream for a while and recently found this eye cream and was motivated to give it a try because of its decent reviews. And it did not disappoint me and I am very happy about its effectivenss on reducing dark circles. As for the wrinkle part, I don&#x27;t have deep wrinkles or crow&#x27;s feet so I can not tell if it works on wrinkle reduction. The burning sensation at the first few applications is quite normal and it will go away soon. The missing star is because it claims to repair wrinkle but I actually find it more effective on dark circles:)&lt;br /&gt;In addition, I think this little tube can last for quite a while before it runs out but I think I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Going through a divorce has/is ruining my sleep. I am starting to look like a zombie raccoon. This cream has helped. My rings are half of what they were in less than a week, only used at bedtime(when I do sleep). It does burn a little, but if the above is the other option, I will take the mild burning sensation which does diminish after a few days of use. Just another 47 year old hamburger patty on the grill of life(lol).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple months now. It&#x27;s nice and silky and goes on smooth, but I have not noticed any real improvements in fine lines. Since I need something that reduces under eye puffiness (I know this doesn&#x27;t claim to) I wont be repurchasing.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and this didnt hurt or burn my skin in any way, so that&#x27;s a plus. It may work for some, but doesnt suit my needs.</li>
            <li> In my opinion Neutrogena has the very best eye creams. This product is my favorite goes on smooth and is very hydrating for my 63 year old eyes. I love Neutrogena!!</li>
            <li> The product was open.</li>
            <li> I had seriously dark circles under my eyes. No more. First I tried an outrageously expensive department store serum and got moderate results. Then I tried Reviva Firming Eye Serum. It was okay. I still use it sometimes. Then I tried this and got rapid wrinkle reduction just like it says.</li>
            <li> I am quite a way past 65 and drooping eyelids needed something and not surgery. I tried this - it actually works! A friend asked me if I had my eyes done!  It&#x27;s my third order...</li>
            <li> I am in my early 20&#x27;s and started to notice some fine lines around my eyes so I started using this and have stop been using now for a few months. It is not greasy feeling when applied and I have actually noticed a difference in my lines not being nearly as noticeable! Great product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using at night for 3 weeks or so. I haven&#x27;t noticed dramatic improvement, but my skin feels soft and moisturized, I&#x27;ve had no irritation and the fragrance is fine. I&#x27;m 36 and have pretty good skin, so I wasn&#x27;t looking for a miracle, just a good night time moisturizer, and this works well.</li>
            <li> did not do much for me</li>
            <li> Used it twice daily for a month after washing my face or showering.  Absolutely didn&#x27;t reduce dark circles below my eyes.</li>
            <li> Just a small amount keeps your skin hydrated. Love it!</li>
            <li> My aesthetician recommended a retinol product but the one at the spa was more than $75.00.  I decided to try this before spending that much money and have been very happy.  I have very dry, very sensitive skin and have started to notice fine lines around my eyes and mouth.  This has made a visible difference in the few weeks that I&#x27;ve been using it and I&#x27;ll probably keep using this instead of buying the more expensive product at the spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because my skin is so dry, I smooth this on, let it dry and then use my Bioelements Sleepwear overnight moisturizer over top of it.  My skin looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> My face developed horrible rashes about the areas that I&#x27;ve applied the product. This product is definitely not for me.</li>
            <li> love it. would recommend.</li>
            <li> I havent noticed any immediate or general improvement, as I have with other eye creams - seems kinda lame just glad it wasnt expensive or I would be even more dissapointed</li>
            <li> Many people are fine with the Retinol in this moisturizer but the problem I ran into was that my skin was far too sensitive. It not only burned the skin under my eyes but because it was so harsh, it caused additional lines and wrinkles which really defeats the purpose. The skin under my eyes was so red and sore that it took a solid 6 days for it to heal. I don&#x27;t recommend this for people that have very sensitive skin or have had adverse reactions to Retinol in the past.</li>
            <li> The product works somewhat for me, but I had hoped for more significant results. I probably need a stronger Retinol product, but I won&#x27;t get it for this price! It helps to temporarily smooth fine lines underneath the eye and works well under my makeup.</li>
            <li> This product has been a pleasant surprise.  I have used it for two weeks now, and I notice that my circles do not appear as dark as they had been, and my eye area does not look as &#x27;stressed&#x27; as it had.  I have tried many products to keep wrinkles at bay and I am very happy with how non-irritating this Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Eye has performed.  I use it twice a day; under my makeup during the day, and I apply it at night after cleaning.  I would strongly recommend this product to women my age who are trying to slow down the natural aging process with this very affordable product.</li>
            <li> I was using this product for quite some time, and I was unsure it was working. So I decided to try another product, Clinique All About Eyes Rich, to see if I could find something better. I was shocked that in a few weeks, the skin under my eyes was dryer and showed more signs of age. And my eyes seemed to have a reaction to the Clinique. So after several weeks of going without eye cream, I finally ordered my Neutrogena again. Within one week, my eyes are brighter and the skin is softer. Will never switch again, this is fantastic for my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for less than a week but I can already see results. I have sensitive skin and this has not caused any irritation.</li>
            <li> I have used for almost a month and I don&#x27;t see any difference.  I have a huge fan of Neutrogena products but this one disappointed me.</li>
            <li> tried this product for around a month yet didn&#x27;t notice any real difference regarding the wrinkles under the eyes yet is good for the dark spots under the eyes.</li>
            <li> It felt soothing around my eyes.  It goes a long ways.  I&#x27;m not sure about &amp;#34;visible&amp;#34; results - but it does feel nice.  My issue was more dark circles - but wrinkle repair is always good.</li>
            <li> I see less visible dark circles. Thank you</li>
            <li> Just ok will buy peter Thomas Roth firming cream before I wood buy this again  not all that happy with the results</li>
            <li> Been taking this like forever.. it absorbs fast and not greasy.  I use it out of habit dunno if it even works anymore.  LOL.</li>
            <li> did not seem to do anything, tried for 2 weeks and did not notice any less lines, would not order again</li>
            <li> Not really.  I&#x27;m a 60 year old guy.  This product really helped with the dry skin around my eyes - it was worth it for that.  Rapid wrinkle repair?  Haven&#x27;t seen much results, but it&#x27;s fun to pretend.  What are you gonna do?  Look at that full set of traveling luggage under your eyes and do nothing?  Rub the cream on.  Oh yeah, and don&#x27;t get old.</li>
            <li> I have used the product for a month. I didn&#x27;t see any visible sign of change. The product does moisturize the eye and not too oily. That&#x27;s something I like.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product 5-6 days a week fora little over a month now and I have noticed a softening in the lines around my eyes, especially when I wear foundation and/or powder, I have a lot less creasing than I did before.  This product doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate lines, but they have improved more than with any other product I have tried so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product mainly at night instead of during the day because if I wear it under makeup my experience has been that my eyeshadow wears off a lot faster than if I just use an eyelid primer.  I have tried it under the makeup primer and had creasing and makeup fade.  This might be because I have pretty oily skin, even on my eyelids.  Those of you with dryer or more normal skin might have no problems at all with wearing this under makeup, so definitely try it for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, even though I can&#x27;t use it as intended, I do see results that for the price of the product, I think are pretty impressive.  Plus, even after a month I still have about 2/3 of the tube left, you don&#x27;t need a lot of product at all.  In fact, I recommend starting with the smallest dab you can put on your fingertip, patting it in, and then adding more if you need to.  I made the mistake early on of putting too much product on so that my skin wasn&#x27;t able to absorb it all, and about an hour later when I rubbed my eye, I got a most unpleasant burning sensation. Granted, it doesn&#x27;t last all that long, but why waste product and get a burning eye?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a good eye cream for a relatively low price, this one is definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> We have been using this for a while and my bf can attest to the result of it.... my eye skin is much more supple more and the dark sircles is much lighter</li>
            <li> Fills in lines and moistens skin around eyes nicely making for a more youthful look. This is one of the better eye creams for the price.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 1 year and works perfectly, I can notice less fine wrinkles! I am 39 years old</li>
            <li> I was trying to save a little from my normal Dermalogica total eye care, and this wasn&#x27;t the same thing at all.  I was hoping for a cream, which this is not.  Great price though, so I will use it.  And Neutrogena is a great name for beauty that you can get in the store.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any change on the wrinkles under my eyes or on  my forehead. I will not be buying this again for it did nothing for me!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Just received my products last Saturday and did two home peels this week and started using this product. So far so good will post more info when it has been one month. Thus the four out of five stars to early to give five stars. Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I did not like the product , got rashes and a lot of itching, I would like to return it but do not know  if I an return since it is used?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year. I like the retinol ingredient, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or my eyes. It doesn&#x27;t take away what&#x27;s already there, but it seems to slow down the new wrinkle growth rate. Gotta take care of what you&#x27;ve got!</li>
            <li> I think this is a fantastic eye creme.  I use it every night and I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I read on Oprah website about the wonders of this eye serum. And I must say it works fairly well for me. The fine lines disappeared and the eyes looks crease free. If you have not tired this I will recommend it especially if you have tan skin</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t notice any change</li>
            <li> So far it does a good job of moisturizing without and side effects of skin breakouts. It does have a burning/warmth sensation when first applied so expect that. But so far I have not seen an difference in my wrinkles</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying this would happen to everyone, but it did happen to me. I used it for a few days and my eyelashes started thinning out which made it not worth using. On the OTHER hand, the results were very noticeable on my skin. My eyelids are usually a little puffy, and it took that away instantly. I would definitely say that it made my eyes look more youthful overall. When I used it at night, my eyes would feel kind of foggy the next morning but after washing my face it was fine. I&#x27;ll probably use it 1x a week until its gone.</li>
            <li> I am not one to have problems with products. I like or don&#x27;t like them, but the rule is that they don&#x27;t cause any side effects or specific problems for me. I think this eye cream did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that I developed a patch of skin beneath the outer portion of one eye that turned red and kept gettomg redder, and it burned, sometimes without even touching it. The only curious thing is that this did not happen beneath the other eye. But I don&#x27;t know of anything else it could have been except this eye cream. I quit using the eye cream and after more than a week of using all kinds of things to heal this up, I think it is finally healing and I noticed today that the skin is peeling, like it was burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t swear definitely that it was this eye cream, but I feel pretty certain it was so I am this is something to watch out for. If you start to develop any redness, quit using it immediatley. I didn&#x27;t do that and I do actually think this stuff burned my skin.</li>
            <li> Adds great moisture.  No odor, just smooths on and I&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
            <li> use this daily , I love it ~ it erases wrinkles around my eyes !!!</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel nice but honestly I don&#x27;t see any improvements</li>
            <li> Very punctual delivery, it exactly what it describe</li>
            <li> I am 28 and have some fine lines under my eyes. For the past week I&#x27;ve been moisturizing a lot more and using night creams to see if it helped improve things. I noticed a slight difference, but not much. So I figured I&#x27;d give official eye cream a shot. I used this product ONCE at night (along with my usual moisturizer), and literally woke up with huge visible (and multiple!) lines under my eyes!! I could not believe how one use could do so much damage! I will NEVER use this product again and would highly advise others against it. It does the exact opposite of what it claims. Yikes.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy with this product,  saw no results, back to the grave yard!!</li>
            <li> I used this religiously for a month straight. My under eyes did start to brighten up but other than that I haven&#x27;t seem much of a difference. I&#x27;ll definitely use up the tube and give it more time. A little goes a long way so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> Is nice for moisture, but I do not see any difference in regard to any of the other claims.</li>
            <li> I bought this under my bfs account. I am 32 yrs old and I have wrinkles under my eyes. I applied this how it said in the box, twice daily. Use a good moisturizer and face wash. I also do face masks once a week or every 2 weeks. Tried this product for 2 months?? And no luck.. It did not do anything for my wrinkles. 0% effective.</li>
            <li> Makes skin around eyes feel soft</li>
            <li> I know this got great reviews, but i find my skin in worse condition!!&lt;br /&gt;My skin is ironically dryer after using it.&lt;br /&gt;I abandoned ship and used my old cream.&lt;br /&gt;Going totry hydroxatone next..guess u get what u pay for?</li>
            <li> My daughter is pregnant and dealing with acne and fluctuating oily to dry skin. I bought her this to go along with the skin care set and she loves it! She reported that this product makes a huge difference. I also use this on a daily basis, I am 46 and got carded for Wine 2 days ago! This product really works!</li>
            <li> My eye area does appear more youthful after using it for a couple of weeks.I didn&#x27;t have many wrinkles to begin with. Drinking water and wine helps enliven my complexion also.  I have sensitive skin and didn&#x27;t want it to dry out, so put petroleum jelly around my eyes at night before I put it on.. It seems to be working nicely.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t noticed a single change with this product! I think for the price it does not live up to any expectations! save your money and use olay!</li>
            <li> The best, better than the more expensive brands and it works.  Crows feet gone, now if this company could get a product to get rid of smile lines.</li>
            <li> I have used many inexpensive and expensive (Sonia Dakar) products - this one beats them all. Definitely a great buy.</li>
            <li> All it did for me was irritate my eyes. Not what I was hoping for. It has a thin consistency that seeps into your eyes.</li>
            <li> Really works on the hard wrinkles, especially on your forehead!</li>
            <li> I bought it for the newly developed crows feet I have from more sun exposure last year. THis product irritated my skins so bad that it caused redness and swelling and because of that I have more skin damage! . More wrinkles now then I did before!!!... And it made my eyes burn and water all day. I tried the every other day. But when I tried to do it every day, for the first time it set my skin on fire. It was far too expensive. And it damaged my skin further. They should take it off the shelves and discontinue.</li>
            <li> I really didnt see a difference in using this product undernearth my eyes..I used the product for 1 month completely and still no difference.</li>
            <li> After just the first night of use I could see improvement in the look of my undereye along with fine lines.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist reccommended this product over other expensive brands. I have used it for over a year and I like the results. I would reccommend it to anyone needing a moisturizing, yet exfoliating eye cream. I also use the daytime and night time rapid wrinkle repair creams.</li>
            <li> It definitely moisturizes and gets rid of the bags, but it didn&#x27;t do anything to get rid of fine lines. I am 25, and I use it twice a day and it didn&#x27;t make any difference in my fine lines.</li>
            <li> Really bad.  Burned my eyes when I applied.</li>
            <li> does not diminish wrinkles yet alone take them away. normally i love all neutogena products if they do what they say they are supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I have been using Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Eye for about a week. As indicated in the advertising, I do notice a difference. I don’t have any deep wrinkles around my eyes. I bought this mainly to address fine lines and wrinkles and to lighten dark areas. I am able to use this formula on my entire eye area including above my eyes at the brow. I don’t know the percentage of retinol in Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Eye and Neutrogena considers it a trade secret. I also started using Neutrogena Rapid Tone Repair Moisturizer Night around the same time. As expected, I can tell there is less retinol in the eye formula. However, if you have sensitive skin you may want to use Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Eye less and/or less often. This formula works nicely as a complement to the Neutrogena Rapid Tone Repair Moisturizer Night. I use them both twice a day, morning and night. My experience with this product is excellent – it does what it is supposed to do and it is reasonably priced. I always ask myself if a product is “worth what I paid” for it. Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Eye meets my criteria. Please remember, this is just one person’s opinion. Your mileage may vary. I do highly recommend this product and if you try it, I hope you have as good an experience as I did.</li>
            <li> read the reviews and really thought this would be a great product.  if you have wrinkle skin on your eye lids forget about buying.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing just like Neutrogenas other skin care products. I literally see results as soon as I put in on my face and distinct results within a few days.  May just be the way my skin responds to it but everything else I&#x27;ve tried (to include the more expensive Olay) has not worked near as well or fast as Neutrogenas.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
            <li> I like this Neutrogena eye cream.  It seems to smooth the skin in the eye area and is gentle.  Works better than more expensive department store brands.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff for my eyes but it didn&#x27;t help with the bags as much as i thought it would. From the reviews I read it seemed like it would. As for the wrinkles I does work well, I may try something else after this, but for the price I paid online it is a quality product. Neutrogena usually has products that work well.</li>
            <li> I finally found an eye product that works and doesn&#x27;t break the bank. I used to use department store brands only, but tried this and have been using it for over a year now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena eye cream for 10 years and my eyes look exactly the same as the day I started. Over time I&#x27;ve tried another products but have yet to find another cream that worked as quickly and brightens the eye area.  The girls in my office have converted from expensive brands after hearing about it. I would probably pay a lot more for this so I&#x27;m surprised how inexpensive it is.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t give any effect and results, i still have dark circle eys, wrinkles, don&#x27;t buy it, it is the wasted</li>
            <li> Product arrived opened with package also squashed.  There is no instruction paper in the package. Don&#x27;t trust it&#x27;s original product.</li>
