            <li>No b.s.&lt;br /&gt;Happy!&lt;br /&gt;:-)</li>
            <li>I heard about this product through a friend and decided to give it a try and surprisingly my friend was right.</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m fine with how my jaw is now and don&#x27;t wanna go anymore slimmer.</li>
            <li>but it is a little uncomfortable,but if you got a date or an outing and you want to look your best and something temporary</li>
            <li>The seller is really friendly and patient, too.</li>
            <li>but Mask house&#x27;s head band is much stronger and mask are better quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The packets feel really gross, but they do heat up surprisingly.</li>
            <li>The seller was very fast and easy to work with.</li>
            <li>I got the shipment super quick.</li>
            <li>It worked great and did slim my face down</li>
            <li>i actually started getting compliments from my family and friends saying my jaw is slimmer and more V shape!</li>
            <li>Really!!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li>Worked after first use!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try my first one</li>
            <li>when i first used it i had it on for 45</li>
            <li>I purchased one box on my first order.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, there was a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it, I could feel the push on my jaws, and the heat radiated by the gel during use.</li>
            <li>I am ordering refill masks pretty soon.</li>
            <li>I would recommend trying this since I had positive results.</li>
            <li>At my last try i was really happy with the results it does slim down your jaw.</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>but IT REALLY</li>
            <li>When using the product, I can really imagine how it flushes toxins into my lymphatic nodes in the neck.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this to anyone who would like to define their face shape.</li>
            <li>you do get a burning sensation and that&#x27;s normal</li>
            <li>I actually saw results after using this mask every other day, after using the 1st box, I noticed that my face look more defined and chiseled.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this product did not irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve used 2 masks already.</li>
            <li>thing works as far as the slimming goes.</li>
            <li>and if you want to lose fat around your face you have to do it through old school - diet &amp; execise.</li>
            <li>It shipped fast but my only concern is the mask it won&#x27;t stay</li>
            <li>(I have sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>I had sensitive skin</li>
            <li>But, I would still recommend this to my friends without sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll say this: I&#x27;m pretty sure this doesn&#x27;t work, but when I sleep on my neck wrong for some reason the band helps support my neck during sleep and when I&#x27;m awake and relaxing at home.</li>
            <li>The  measurement was back to normal after a night&#x27;s sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Did not work on double chin, dispite great reviews, I was really hoping it would work:(</li>
            <li>but my face won&#x27;t loose much.</li>
            <li>cause it can be uncomfortable, but other than that this is a great product.</li>
            <li>If only I was for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions for the subsequent masks and no results (in fact, my face immediately went back to normal the next day).</li>
            <li>The only down side is it&#x27;s a tiny bit pricey, but since this works for me, I think it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>have to say that in only 3 uses, I see a MAJOR difference.</li>
            <li>First time use it reduced my profile from 25.5 cm to 25 cm (ear-to-ear), but my profile come back to 25.5 cm after few day.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like this product when i first used it i had it on for 45 you do get a burning sensation and that&#x27;s normal its like burning away the fat and stuff lol! soon as it was getting to 45 min it kinda started to hurt i can actually feel my jaw getting skinnier if that makes sense. Anyways once i took it off in front of the mirror i actually saw my jaw was being compressed in and when i took it off it was slowly going back to normal or not normal but expanding back slightly. I did this once a week and after my 2nd try with it i actually started getting compliments from my family and friends saying my jaw is slimmer and more V shape! I was so happy! At my last try i was really happy with the results it does slim down your jaw. Now i don&#x27;t have anymore of the packets left but i&#x27;m fine with how my jaw is now and don&#x27;t wanna go anymore slimmer. I do use the strap by itself every now and then and it does give the burning sensation as well. I would recommend trying this since I had positive results.</li>
            <li> It works but you need to keep buying it</li>
            <li> Did not work on double chin, dispite great reviews, I was really hoping it would work:(</li>
            <li> I was a skeptical but IT REALLY WORKS!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been looking for this kind of products couple years ago..I have been on diet, facial massage, exercise, starving myself to death but my face won&#x27;t loose much. I heard about this product through a friend and decided to give it a try and surprisingly my friend was right. I actually saw results after using this mask every other day, after using the 1st box, I noticed that my face look more defined and chiseled. With the consistent usage, I saw a subtle improvement in my jawline. Once you apply the mask, you feel a warm sensation. I have sensitive skin and this product did not irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad that I found this product here. I got the shipment super quick. I purchased one box on my first order. It worked great and did slim my face down so I ordered 5 more of just the Refill Mask from this seller. I&#x27;m going to continue using it. Great Product and Great Service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this to anyone who would like to define their face shape. The only down side is it&#x27;s a tiny bit pricey, but since this works for me, I think it&#x27;s worth the money. This is similar to the LUS product... but Mask house&#x27;s head band is much stronger and mask are better quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth buying !!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this one it is bad.  I&#x27;ve been purchased the slim face band from Japan which is similar to this one : http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00RKX7XE6/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, there was a noticeable difference. I followed the directions for the subsequent masks and no results (in fact, my face immediately went back to normal the next day). :/</li>
            <li> This is not for small face, so I can&#x27;t tell it is work or not!</li>
            <li> This works...but it is a little uncomfortable,but if you got a date or an outing and you want to look your best and something temporary this is for you,I will order again,fast shipping,great seller</li>
            <li> It slowly works. You need to buy a lot of masks in order for it to work though. Probably would recommend for people with double chins, but I don&#x27;t have it so I only wanted to slim my face into a v-shape. There&#x27;s a little bit of difference. So far I&#x27;ve used 2 masks already. Will update if there is any other changes.</li>
            <li> This item does work but it caused me to break out over the sides of my chin. If only I was for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Had better results with the lus brand.</li>
            <li> This product is great. After two uses my face was a centimeter slimmer. It&#x27;s very warm so don&#x27;t be alarmed. Just make sure you don&#x27;t plan on eating or drinking when you&#x27;re wearing it cause it can be uncomfortable, but other than that this is a great product.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I would buy more of this moving forward. The seller was very fast and easy to work with.</li>
            <li> works! but if you stop using it , the double chin comes back... :S</li>
            <li> I love this maskmask and band combo! You can feel it working abd see the results after continuous use. Well be buying more masks.</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 sets of this and I was told it was in my mailbox yesterday morning and I came home to an Al Capone book &amp; a CD about love stories!! Need my money back or my actual products!!!!</li>
            <li> I love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been soooooo unhappy with the asymmetrical quality of my face and after getting Invisalign it only got worse. My left side cheek just somehow always looked like my jaw was swollen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that in only 3 uses, I see a MAJOR difference. Like, I&#x27;m extremely happy, I want to thank you all so much!!! Really!! Cause I was looking at surgery!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing works as far as the slimming goes. I love it!! And I am about to order again! I&#x27;ve seen people use the botox solution to contour the jaw and oay thousands with no real visual difference in my opinion. I can see in my photos already just an entirely more beautiful look. So happy! And i NEVER leave reviews. Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> I WILL BUY AGAIN. I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Worked after first use!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll say this: I&#x27;m pretty sure this doesn&#x27;t work, but when I sleep on my neck wrong for some reason the band helps support my neck during sleep and when I&#x27;m awake and relaxing at home. So at least I found a purpose for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packets feel really gross, but they do heat up surprisingly. I recommend if you seriousy want to purchase this, buy it in the winter rather than the summer because I feel like the heat does something to the face packets that come with the face sling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, this thing is absolutley silly and if you want to lose fat around your face you have to do it through old school - diet &amp; execise.</li>
            <li> It shipped fast but my only concern is the mask it won&#x27;t stay I struggle with it I was so excited to try my first one and I only had it for 5 minutes because that mask just wouldn&#x27;t stay! Not so happy about this product</li>
            <li> It works people.  No b.s.&lt;br /&gt;Happy!&lt;br /&gt;:-)</li>
            <li> First time use it reduced my profile from 25.5 cm to 25 cm (ear-to-ear), but my profile come back to 25.5 cm after few day. Will keep using it and see what happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: It does have a burning sensation but doesn&#x27;t hurt my skin (I have sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> This is indeed the best jawline enhancement product I have tried so far. I felt the product was a bit pricy at the beginning. However decided to try it out. The first time I tried it, I could feel the push on my jaws, and the heat radiated by the gel during use. By the feel of it I could say that there is bound to be a result. And yes, my jawline did decrease by a centimetre like you see on the YouTube videos for this product. Don&#x27;t be too happy &#x27;cos this drastic decrease is just temporary. The  measurement was back to normal after a night&#x27;s sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my double chin has significantly decreased with 3 uses. I do some basic neck stretching exercises too. This may be a combined effect. Not to mention, I received compliments about my decreased double chin after I started using this product. I am ordering refill masks pretty soon.</li>
            <li> I had sensitive skin so this didn&#x27;t work for me. But, I would still recommend this to my friends without sensitive skin. When using the product, I can really imagine how it flushes toxins into my lymphatic nodes in the neck. The seller is really friendly and patient, too.</li>
