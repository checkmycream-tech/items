            <li> I love this body lotion. It is very difficult to find. Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> great lotion great fragrance</li>
            <li> LOVE this scent and this incredibly moisturizing lotion....it&#x27;s the ONLY thing I use now. Other Crabtree products smell \\&quot;OK\\&quot; - this is fantastic....floral but not that disgusting \\&quot;rosy floral\\&quot; a nice, sofiticated, light scent.  I even get the body spray and use it as linen spray when company is coming over.  Really nice.</li>
            <li> this is a great body lotion I love it use it every day thank you very much will buy again</li>
            <li> I bought the Summer Hill cologne a while back and decided to try the body lotion as well. I was not disappointed. This has a heavenly floral scent at first, followed by the scent of grass or new-mown hay. A wonderful summer fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is my new &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; scent - I love it, it makes me feel beautiful!!!  I apply it on my arms and legs and hit the road - quick &amp; easy.  It&#x27;s a light fragrance that I enjoy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I like the scent, and thought it would be perfect for summer. It works fine as a body lotion, but the scent quickly fades and smells more like soap.It wasn&#x27;t worth the additional cost.</li>
            <li> My favorite body lotion.  I have tried many others, but this is by far the product I like the best.</li>
            <li> Trying to find someone to take this off my hands.  This will teach me not to buy lotions off of descriptions. Said it was fruity with floral undernotes.  Yech.  Smells awful to me.</li>
            <li> I ordered this from Amazon and I love it. Have used this product for a long time. It has a light scent and makes your skin feel so soft. No perfume needed when I use this. Thanks again Amazon. Will order again when I need more...</li>
            <li> The lotion is nice but I ordered this because of the pretty box, then it came without any box. What&#x27;s the deal?&lt;br /&gt;The scent is nice but I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> It reminds me a little of gardenia, and is spring-y and light, yet feminine.  Fell in love with it in college 20 years ago, so it&#x27;s nice to finally be able to afford a bottle for myself once a year as a treat.  I get the bath gel too and it&#x27;s very nice.</li>
            <li> When I first began using the lotion, people were constantly asking what scent I was wearing.  No more----something has changed about it, and I don&#x27;t like it as well.  I&#x27;ve seen other people with similar comments.</li>
            <li> I love Crabtree &amp; Evelyn products, in particular, Summer Hill and Spring Rain.  I did notice that the familiar odor of Summer Hill was not quite as strong as it used to be, still very good though.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this scent.  floral, fresh and feminine.  I could hardly wait to get this and have gotten so many compliments.</li>
            <li> Excellent product  In a matter of fact, I purchased Summer Hill lotion, powder and perfume.  Beautiful light and airy summer smell.  I highly recommend this product.  The lotion also a great moisturizer</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s absolute favorite for more than 15 years running. She expects it for Christmas (2 bottles) every year and it has been easy for me to remember to gift. It is so clean and light in fragrance,</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with this scented lotion.  I like the fragrance&amp;#34; Summer Hill&amp;#34;, but wasn&#x27;t sure about getting it in lotion form.  It is not greasy at all and smells so wonderful!  I&#x27;m so glad that I ordered this and have found that I do like the &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift, and I&#x27;m pleased to see that amazon carries it.  The scent is just beautiful - I use this lotion in place of perfume.  It is lightly fragranced with an exquisite floral scent that smells like a bouquet of beautiful smelling flowers.  I will definitely order from amazon once my stash is used up.  Highly recommended if you like light but beautiful floral fragrances.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because of all the positive reviews on it. I was looking for a clean fresh scent but I was a bit disappointed because from most of the reviews this should have been &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34;, finally. But there is something else that cuts into the scent that smells &amp;#34;green&amp;#34;. It just doesn&#x27;t smell good on me. I thought maybe it was my skin not reacting well to the product but when I put my nose inside the bottle it has that same odd &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; scent. I&#x27;d rather smell like softly scented flowers and not the grass.</li>
            <li> I love this product and been using for many years also the soap and cologne.. This is a subtle smell that lingers.Love it</li>
            <li> The name says it all....it&#x27;s a fresh summer scent.  The large bottle was a great buy.  I think any age will enjoy this scent.  I was thrilled to find it available on Amazon!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have yet to receive this order. It has been over a month since I got confirmation it was mailed and to allow 7 to 10 days. I look forword tothese products. It has been a ritual for me everyday and night after my showers and baths. I am down tothe last few drops and practically scrapping the sides of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love these products and have been a customer for over 15 years.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my Granddaughter who is in the Army.  She was elated to get it and loved the smell and the way it felt when she used it.  As she said to me in her thank-you note  &amp;#34;please consider giving this to me for Christmas this year&amp;#34;  I&#x27;d say this is a &amp;#34;winner&amp;#34;  Also, it was delivered on time.  I am very pleased with Amazon&#x27;s shipping service.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this purchase, its not a 1\4 of the quality I get from the store that I usually purchase it from. Its color is not the same even, I wish I had purchased only one, but, live and learn :(</li>
