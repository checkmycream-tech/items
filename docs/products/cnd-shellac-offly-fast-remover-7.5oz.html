            <li>Works great and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>This nail polish remover works great but feels oily on my skin</li>

            <li>Takes off the shellac nicely.</li>
            <li>I own all the CND shellac equipment as I believe you get best results when you don&#x27;t mix brands, however, when I tried this remover it wasn&#x27;t any better than the normal nail polish remover&#x27;s</li>
            <li>and it was so easy to remove the shellac on my nails!</li>
            <li>I thought it will be really easy!</li>
            <li>Love the smell.  </li>
            <li>so it is not my favorite remover</li>
            <li>Pleased with the scent</li>
            <li>The seal was still in tact, I&#x27;m glad it didn&#x27;t puncture.</li>
            <li>Love this polish remover for the vinylux polish.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying more.</li>
            <li>Much better to use than acetone.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It makes removing polish so easy.</li>
            <li>Even after letting them soak the shellac was still standing strong.</li>
            <li>This really is the best of the two different kinds of remover that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>100% Better than pure acetone.</li>
            <li>that work just as well nothing special with name brand.</li>
            <li>Came right on time and just as described !</li>
            <li>cool cucumber.  </li>
            <li>Does a nice job of removing old polish.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll need to scrape at the shellac still, but works pretty well and easy to scrape off.</li>
            <li>Quickly shipped.</li>
            <li>A lot to pay for a remover but worth it for me.</li>
            <li>works better than anything else i have tried so far for removing shellac polish.</li>
            <li>I use the wraps with this and after 20-30 mins the polish will peel right off.  </li>
            <li>CDN polisher remover takes the polish off gently and quickly.</li>
            <li>The thing will come off like dust very gently.</li>
            <li>Life is too short to spend more than a minute fighting off nail polish.</li>
            <li>It also smells waaaay better than the regular stuff.</li>
            <li>This is wayyyyy better than the acetone they use in the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I foiled my nails for only about 5 minutes and the Shellac came off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There should be instructions that require you to purchase the wraps or makes you aware that you must buy the wraps in order for the product to work.</li>
            <li>To get the best results so far, I have broken the shine on the shellac with a nail buffer then used the CND Remover with the nail wraps.</li>
            <li>It is way better than the acetone which is very drying to the nail and skin for so long.</li>
            <li>Thanks CND</li>
            <li>I also purchased a no name brand and got 3 times a much for a couple dollar,</li>
            <li>Just bare with the 10-12 minutes wrap, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it</li>
            <li>Better than Acetone (not as harsh).  </li>
            <li>Better than paying $10 to have them remove it or getting impatient and peeling the polish off and then having damaged nails.</li>
            <li>it works awesome on glitters and thick lacquer &amp; takes off plain old polish in a breeze.</li>
            <li>Product was as expected - I was not disappointed with the product and recommend product highly.</li>
            <li>Works quickly and nails look nourished rather than dry when done.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supposed to be a more pure acetone, but you can just go to the store and find a nail polish remover that isn&#x27;t too diluted with other chemicals and is half the price...</li>
            <li>my nails aren&#x27;t nearly as dry after using this, as they were after using the straight up remover without the &#x27;nourishing&#x27; addative!  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for the past 5 weeks and it has left my nails feeling healthy and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>Also I use about 3 coats of top coat (after various coats of color) to really thinken my nails as I am not used to my natural (thin) nails.  </li>
            <li>Really takes off the polish and doesn&#x27;t dry out your nails</li>
            <li>Works fine, still have to soak with cottonballs for at least 10 minutes...</li>
            <li>Not sure that this took off my shellac any faster like someone said, or maybe it was in the description, which is what I was really looking forward to, but it certainly didn&#x27;t dry my nails out like acetone did either.</li>
            <li>only reason why I&#x27;m not giving a one star only is because I have noticed that CND shellac colors act differently when you remove them, for instance the red (wildfire) is so easy to remove, but the black (black pool) is whole different story, so maybe I tried this remover on a hard to take off color.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This for some reason does remove my gel nails faster. Just bare with the 10-12 minutes wrap, it&#x27;s worth it. The thing will come off like dust very gently. A plus side is that it smells delish, and also has a bit of an oily property so your cuticles say THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> Love the smell.  Seems to be easier on the nails.</li>
            <li> I was simply not impressed with this product. I used it to wet a cotton ball and rubbed it on my shellac and it had almost not effect. Then I soaked pieces of cotton ball in it, put them on my nails, and wrapped it in tin foil to let my nails soak. Even after letting them soak the shellac was still standing strong. Eventually I just used acetone on them.</li>
            <li> 100% Better than pure acetone. It removes your soak off gel polish as it conditions your nail with the oils it contains. It doesn&#x27;t leave the white residue that acetone leaves behind and your nails and cuticles are not dry.</li>
            <li> This nail polish remover works great but feels oily on my skin so it is not my favorite remover and I will probably not buy it again. If that doesn&#x27;t not bother you, then it does work great and you would probably like it.</li>
            <li> Life is too short to spend more than a minute fighting off nail polish. I know this is for gel - but I use this to take off regular polish - it works awesome on glitters and thick lacquer &amp; takes off plain old polish in a breeze. It also smells waaaay better than the regular stuff.</li>
            <li> Product was as expected - I was not disappointed with the product and recommend product highly.</li>
            <li> This is wayyyyy better than the acetone they use in the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I foiled my nails for only about 5 minutes and the Shellac came off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is how I did it:&lt;br /&gt;1. I took a long bubble bath to soak my hands so they don&#x27;t end up soaking up the acetone too much.&lt;br /&gt;2. Used a standard cotton ball and poured the CND Remover on the cotton ball and wrapped my finger with foil.&lt;br /&gt;3. Waited a few minutes - then got tired of waiting...&lt;br /&gt;4. Took off the foil and the Shellac flaked off.</li>
            <li> The nourishing remover is Great!  my nails aren&#x27;t nearly as dry after using this, as they were after using the straight up remover without the &#x27;nourishing&#x27; addative!  I&#x27;ll always use this from now on!</li>
            <li> Takes off the shellac nicely. Does a  good job.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll need to scrape at the shellac still, but works pretty well and easy to scrape off. Doesn&#x27;t dry your nails out.</li>
            <li> nothing different than regular polish remover</li>
            <li> This remover was awesome! It did what it was supposed and it was so easy to remove the shellac on my nails!</li>
            <li> Works but Shellac is such a pain to remove to begin with. Pleased with the scent and it isn&#x27;t harsh on your skin.</li>
            <li> this product work awesome. Would and will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> It works.  Delivery came on time.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> It came without a cover.  The seal was still in tact, I&#x27;m glad it didn&#x27;t puncture.</li>
            <li> Very effective! Takes the cnd vinylux weekly polish off with ease. A lot to pay for a remover but worth it for me.</li>
            <li> I had to buy CDN Shellac Power Polish remover because the &#x27;regular&#x27; remover would not take off my shellac polish between beauty  shop appointments. CDN polisher remover takes the polish off gently and quickly.</li>
            <li> Not really, unless you buy the &#x27;wraps&#x27; to go over your nails this product does not work.  There should be instructions that require you to purchase the wraps or makes you aware that you must buy the wraps in order for the product to work.</li>
            <li> Love it! It is way better than the acetone which is very drying to the nail and skin for so long.</li>
            <li> Works fine, still have to soak with cottonballs for at least 10 minutes... but works... doesn&#x27;t dry nails excessively. Good</li>
            <li> I own all the CND shellac equipment as I believe you get best results when you don&#x27;t mix brands, however, when I tried this remover it wasn&#x27;t any better than the normal nail polish remover&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used in the past. It&#x27;s supposed to be a more pure acetone, but you can just go to the store and find a nail polish remover that isn&#x27;t too diluted with other chemicals and is half the price...

            <li> This product worked much faster than what I usually use. I would purchase this again and have recommended it to friends.</li>
            <li> works better than anything else i have tried so far for removing shellac polish. does seem to have a slight moisturizing effect on my nails as well.</li>
            <li> Use now instead of OPI remover.  Seems less harsh for my nails.</li>
            <li> Came right on time and just as described !</li>
            <li> not a stand alone product,  needs to be purchased with wraps.  directions for use come on tye wraps.</li>
            <li> Great purchase. Quickly shipped.</li>
            <li> Really takes off the polish and doesn&#x27;t dry out your nails</li>
            <li> Love this polish remover for the vinylux polish.  I tried using regular polish remover and it took me forever to remove the polish but this product takes it off in a couple of minutes.  I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> I used other products to remove the nail color and my nails were really dried out. My manicurist was not happy with them at all. When I switched to this remover, my nails immediately became smoother and healthier looking. I would not go back to any of my previous solutions after seeing the dramatic difference this made for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past 5 weeks and it has left my nails feeling healthy and moisturized.  It is not like the removers I have used in the past that don&#x27;t work well and leave my nails very dry.</li>
            <li> I like the smell..cool cucumber.  I am not convinced that there is any remover out there that can efficiently remove shellac.  I use this with the Hands Down Nail wraps. To get the best results so far, I have broken the shine on the shellac with a nail buffer then used the CND Remover with the nail wraps. I still can&#x27;t get the shellac off in ten minutes.  I don&#x27;t find that the CND product does not leave my nails feeling dried out.</li>
            <li> Works great and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Works great. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your $10... this thing is not going to do the promissed job, after soaking my nails in this staff, my manicurist had to use other product to remove the Shellac from my nails.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Better than Acetone (not as harsh).  Works quickly and nails look nourished rather than dry when done.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product with no acetone.  Removes gel nail polish perfectly.  Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> This remover is the only remover you should use with vinylux polish. It makes removing polish so easy. Thanks CND I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else</li>
            <li> Was delivered in my mailbox and leaked all over EVERYTHING! Not only did ruined the mail in the box with it but leaked all over my clothes.  There&#x27;s no seal on the bottle and the cap was loose.</li>
            <li> Does a nice job of removing old polish. Would recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I like all CND products</li>
            <li> Worked well on gel nails I got done at the salon.  Better than paying $10 to have them remove it or getting impatient and peeling the polish off and then having damaged nails.</li>
            <li> Not sure that this took off my shellac any faster like someone said, or maybe it was in the description, which is what I was really looking forward to, but it certainly didn&#x27;t dry my nails out like acetone did either. So that was definitely a benefit.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Removes nail polish with just a few swipes.</li>
            <li> I purchase this to see if shellac would come off easier. I also purchased a no name brand and got 3 times a much for a couple dollar, that work just as well nothing special with name brand.</li>
            <li> This really is the best of the two different kinds of remover that I have tried.  I use the wraps with this and after 20-30 mins the polish will peel right off.  I wait because I do not want to damage my nails any further.  I am a recovering acrylic nail wearer (after almost 30 years).  Also I use about 3 coats of top coat (after various coats of color) to really thinken my nails as I am not used to my natural (thin) nails.  The other stuff (acetone) I could leave on an hour and still be working hard to get the gel off.</li>
            <li> its hard to get rid of the shellac nail polish with this. I thought it will be really easy! but its not!</li>
            <li> Much better to use than acetone.</li>
