            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more of this when I run out!</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t anything spectacular.</li>
            <li>Nice staff.</li>
            <li>This works great - the lady that did my nails for many years says this is an important part of keeping the polish adhered to the nail.</li>
            <li>I feel safe that i have this to go on and do my nails with this Gelish ph bond lady&#x27;s most have it feel great easy to apply on</li>
            <li>(so I could apply it more conveniently), but it isn&#x27;t as effective.  </li>
            <li>There are many tutorials online.....</li>
            <li>Gelish products have so many tutorials.</li>
            <li>Used it before Gelish foundation, color and top it off.</li>
            <li>I just love the gelish brand.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the whole Gelish line of products, at these prices can&#x27;t beat them.</li>
            <li>Best to get a thin brush and dip in acetone to remove excess polish along sides of nail and cuticle before curing, Used LED lamp to cure.</li>
            <li>I bought a huge bottle of rubbing alcohol to take the stickiness off after the manicure, and I will use it to refill this handy little bottle, but I do not intend on purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li>I was doing my nails without this initially, I was using alcohol instead, but I decided I better do everything right in the hope that I would get a longer manicure out of it.</li>
            <li>The smell reminds me of lemon candy and it makes my cuticles and nails feel so much nicer!</li>
            <li>Nt to mention doing my nails myself for the first time.</li>
            <li>I use alcohol first and this bonder after.</li>
            <li>Use it as the first step when I am applying gel nails.</li>
            <li>thanks to this my nails/ clients nails stay on forever!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and works as it should.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This product does exactly whats supposed to do, I really like it and use it every time I do my nails</li>
            <li>I just did my nails at home for the first time and this product worked very well.  </li>
            <li>It works as it is suppose to continue much to say about it except it does what it&#x27;s suppose to do</li>
            <li>Keeps gelish polish from peeling off of my otherwise very oily nails.  </li>
            <li>You really need to use the bond if you are doing your get nails at home.</li>
            <li>Also, Its for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I spend so much time prepping my nails</li>
            <li>I want the gel/shellac polish to last more than a day, that&#x27;s why I switched from regular polish in the first place.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product dehydrates my nail instantly and my Gelish polish and other soak-off gel products bond great after using this product and it a nice big bottle that should last you a very long time</li>
            <li>Definitely helps my gel polish to last longer and stick to my nail better.</li>
            <li>This is basically rubbing alcohol in a cute little bottle, with a brush to apply it.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and cost so much less on your site</li>
            <li>Products come on time or early.</li>
            <li>It is convenient being able to brush it over your nails before putting on the foundation gel, to avoid fuzz from cotton or a paper towel, but it is essentially the same product you can buy for a few bucks at a drug store.</li>

            <li> Not sure if I do, but get about a week before they start to lift a little and bug me.</li>

            <li> Made all the difference in my nail polish staying on.</li>
            <li> I was doing my nails without this initially, I was using alcohol instead, but I decided I better do everything right in the hope that I would get a longer manicure out of it. Not sure if I do, but get about a week before they start to lift a little and bug me. I&#x27;m pretty hard on my nails.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It smells really good. The smell reminds me of lemon candy and it makes my cuticles and nails feel so much nicer! I am going to buy more for xmas presents!</li>
            <li> To the last reviewer.... This is not a color! It preps the nail for your color. There are many tutorials online..... I suggest taking a look at one, then maybe you will like the ph bond</li>
            <li> This product does exactly whats supposed to do, I really like it and use it every time I do my nails</li>
            <li> I feel safe that i have this to go on and do my nails with this Gelish ph bond lady&#x27;s most have it feel great easy to apply on you&#x27;re nails..Do it pay it i did....</li>
            <li> Works great! great seller.</li>
            <li> This made absolutely no difference in helping my gel manicure last longer. Save your money and use rubbing alcohol. I only gave it 3 stars because it was delivered on time.</li>
            <li> I love the whole Gelish line of products, at these prices can&#x27;t beat them. Nt to mention doing my nails myself for the first time. Gelish products have so many tutorials.</li>
            <li> This works great - the lady that did my nails for many years says this is an important part of keeping the polish adhered to the nail.</li>

            <li> Used it before Gelish foundation, color and top it off. Best to get a thin brush and dip in acetone to remove excess polish along sides of nail and cuticle before curing, Used LED lamp to cure. Looks great!</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. It works as it is suppose to continue much to say about it except it does what it&#x27;s suppose to do</li>
            <li> I purchased as a back up for when my supply was getting low. Works great! Would recommend this product to use with OPI gel polish.</li>
            <li> Definitely helps my gel polish to last longer and stick to my nail better.</li>
            <li> Helps with retention of the polish and prevents peel. I use alcohol first and this bonder after. I just love the gelish brand.</li>
            <li> I just did my nails at home for the first time and this product worked very well.  Nail gel bonds well.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t anything spectacular.</li>
            <li> Keeps gelish polish from peeling off of my otherwise very oily nails.  I have issues with peeling and the polish pulls away from the edges of my nail while it&#x27;s drying.  This has solved that problem.  Great stuff.</li>
            <li> Use it as the first step when I am applying gel nails.</li>
            <li> Products come on time or early. I like that. very good bonder. I love it !</li>
            <li> Nice staff. I love it.</li>
            <li> This works well with my primer (my primer is of another brand) thanks to this my nails/ clients nails stay on forever! This is such a big bottle and a little goes a long ways! The packaging on this is also very attractive! I&#x27;ll be buying more of this when I run out!</li>
            <li> Full size bottle for great price - can&#x27;t do gel nails correctly without it!</li>
            <li> Works great, seller is good- will need to buy more form them..</li>
            <li> You really need to use the bond if you are doing your get nails at home. Don&#x27;t skip this step if you want them to stay on.</li>
            <li> This product is great. Easy to use and cost so much less on your site then anywhere I have found.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and works as it should. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This product I&#x27;s a must! With this, your gel manicures lasts longer! You won&#x27;t be disappointed! Also, Its for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This is basically rubbing alcohol in a cute little bottle, with a brush to apply it. It is convenient being able to brush it over your nails before putting on the foundation gel, to avoid fuzz from cotton or a paper towel, but it is essentially the same product you can buy for a few bucks at a drug store. Not to mention, you get 100x the amount you get here. They don&#x27;t even use this product in the nail salons that I&#x27;ve been to. They use gauze and rubbing alcohol. I bought a huge bottle of rubbing alcohol to take the stickiness off after the manicure, and I will use it to refill this handy little bottle, but I do not intend on purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> ...the Gelish PH Bond arrived promptly and works perfectly!  I use it with the entire Gelish line and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the outcome.</li>
            <li> I broke my last bottle of ph bond but went ahead and used gel polish without it. Big mistake.....they lifted and peeled off in just a couple of days. I won&#x27;t go without this again! I also use it with other brands of gel polish and I&#x27;ve had no problems.</li>
            <li> I thought this was basically just rubbing alcohol so I refilled an empty bottle of PH bond with rubbing alcohol (so I could apply it more conveniently), but it isn&#x27;t as effective.  My nail polish peals off by the next day.  I spend so much time prepping my nails I want the gel/shellac polish to last more than a day, that&#x27;s why I switched from regular polish in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s what brings me to this page, I&#x27;ve given up on my experiment and am going back to using PH Bond.</li>
            <li> I could notice a difference when I started using the PH bond prior to using the gel polish. The polish was peeling off without this, but the bond seems to be helping prevent that.</li>
            <li> I tried this and it was awful. It did not work. Don&#x27;t waste your money. My gel nail polish did not work after this.</li>
