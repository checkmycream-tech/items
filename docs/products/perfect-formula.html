            <li>I first saw this product on QVC, and I was thinking that this product just might work, and let me tell you my nails have never looked, so good.</li>

            <li>Will that is the color right but didn&#x27;t do what I wanted it to do or do what it says for me</li>
            <li>The color was fine and would have looked better if it didn&#x27;t dry with streaks from the brush.</li>
            <li>Great little size!</li>
            <li>Was very watery- not like what you get from sephora!</li>
            <li>Sorry, Perfect Formula doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>I would endorse this product whole heartedly!</li>
            <li>tried so many nail hardeners and some yellow nail, nails continue splitting.  </li>
            <li>My nails are pretty healthy but sometimes crack at the sides when they&#x27;re long.</li>
            <li>My nails &amp;#34;struggled&amp;#34; for a long time to get healthy.</li>
            <li>It dries fast, gives a smooth look, gives added strength, stays on a long time, and leaves  a beautiful sheer pink color</li>
            <li>it has very light pink color and shiny.</li>
            <li>Lasts forever and has a very light pink tint.</li>
            <li>this polish is very high tech.</li>
            <li>This is a great polish for a person who has little time for personal grooming.</li>
            <li>I use this with the ruby stone and buffer nail kit and my nails look very health and natural.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Very overpriced.</li>
            <li>The formula glides on very well with no streaks.</li>
            <li>did not help my peeling nails that much.  </li>
            <li>really need to give it 2 Â½ stars.</li>
            <li>My nails are stronger and don&#x27;t split as much .  </li>
            <li>So dont think this really is helping but will keep using it to see if it does improve them.</li>
            <li>This winter dryness has really taken a toll on my nails so hope this helps.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really see improvement in my nails after using this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>You need this if you have trouble keeping nice looking nails.</li>
            <li>Have tried many other products but this one works.</li>
            <li>I only wish the claim about brightening were true for me.</li>
            <li>I think there are better products that cost much less.</li>
            <li>- there is no way you can apply it smoothly, I have to open another clear polish and use that brush to apply, then replace the correct brushes with the correct bottles...</li>
            <li>I love the soft pink color.  </li>
            <li>Since I started using pink gel formula, I actually have been able to grow my nails for the first time.</li>
            <li>I thought it would add a little more color than it does.  </li>
            <li>One coat of this makes them look almost normal.</li>
            <li>One coat is light and two coats are very pink.</li>
            <li>just got this stuff - used it twice so far - really too early to say if it&#x27;s going to help my nails...</li>
            <li>I never have been able to grow my weak and peeling nails out; but with this they are long and strong.  </li>
            <li>Glad i got the small bottle.  </li>
            <li>If I run out of product before my nails clear up (assuming they do) I would buy it again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clear polish that strenghens the nails, but also gives the nail a whiter, brighter look.</li>
            <li>Have been using this since it arrived, and all I can say is WOW</li>
            <li>I was inaccurately told that it was no worse for my nails than regular polish.</li>
            <li>I prefer a natural look...no polish...</li>
            <li>and it is really easy to apply and uses very little</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and its enough to last for a few months.</li>
            <li>I get a little &#x27;hint&#x27; of pink that translates to just looking really healthy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and it really treated my nails very well.  </li>
            <li>I never use a regular clear coat anymore, this looks way nicer.</li>
            <li>It is just a great product wish it was less expensive.</li>
            <li>pink tint is girly and looks better than plain unpainted nails!</li>
            <li>I reapplied it every 3 or 4 days but only 4 stars because it&#x27;s kind of expensive.</li>
            <li>It really hasnt helped with the peeling as of yet and a nail grew out a little but just snagged and broke.</li>
            <li>The color is only pink outside, inside it looks clear.</li>

            <li> The color is only pink outside, inside it looks clear.</li>
            <li> This has helped my nails grow like they have not grown in a long time.</li>
            <li> other brands will work the same.</li>
            <li> It was way thicker and didn&#x27;t dry.  </li>
            <li> I use this every single day.  </li>
            <li> so the little bottle will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product, particularly since it appeared an easier alternative for professional manicures when life gets too busy.  </li>
            <li> Yes, things will peel and you need to reapply but that is as expected in my book.  </li>
            <li> ( i am rough on them)&lt;br</li>
            <li> you are looking for the pink color</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too long for the little bottle, so the bottom of the brush is smushed on the bottom of the bottle, and the bristles curve out in every direction</li>
            <li> Previously purchased from another place.  </li>
            <li> does make your nails stronger but expensive not to last too long.</li>
            <li> a few days after you put it on. would not recommend unless you polish once every few days.</li>
            <li> NOT TRUE!</li>
            <li> The product got hard and clumpy after a few months.  </li>
            <li> Since I just wanted to try a small bottle I found it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Now I have to keep cutting my nails back as they have taken off.</li>
            <li> Althought the brush was broken</li>
            <li> Knowing this, I applied 2 thin coats.  </li>
            <li> anyway my nail still broke evert time I turned around not happy with it at all</li>
            <li> my nails were as thin as tissue paper....for quite some time.</li>
            <li> My nails have been peeling and generally looking terrible.</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with gel nail polish.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product and would not buy it again.  </li>
            <li> but the brush is horrible!  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> this polish is very high tech. it keeps my nails nice and strong and growing i would purchase it again</li>
            <li> works for my nails!!!</li>
            <li> Like this  Purchased on a home shopping channel first, but always better price on Amazon.  Makes your color stay on longer.</li>
            <li> I use this with the ruby stone and buffer nail kit and my nails look very health and natural.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t need to put any nail color on.</li>
            <li> This worked great!  Yes, things will peel and you need to reapply but that is as expected in my book.  Love it and have recommended it.</li>
            <li> Great Product and fast shipping</li>
            <li> it yellows  a few days after you put it on. would not recommend unless you polish once every few days.</li>
            <li> I have been using the perfect formula on my nails for 3 years. My nails are strong,and they have quit breaking at every use( i am rough on them)&lt;br /&gt;The pink tint is girly and looks better than plain unpainted nails! I&#x27;ve thrown my nail polish out...even i can apply this and it looks good!</li>
            <li> just got this stuff - used it twice so far - really too early to say if it&#x27;s going to help my nails...but the brush is horrible!  it&#x27;s too long for the little bottle, so the bottom of the brush is smushed on the bottom of the bottle, and the bristles curve out in every direction - there is no way you can apply it smoothly, I have to open another clear polish and use that brush to apply, then replace the correct brushes with the correct bottles...jeese!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple of years.  I never have been able to grow my weak and peeling nails out; but with this they are long and strong.  You must use it faithfully and continue to use it to get the promised results.  It works like nothing I have ever tried before and I have tried a lot of nail products.</li>
            <li> The product got hard and clumpy after a few months.  does make your nails stronger but expensive not to last too long. I think there are better products that cost much less.</li>
            <li> Makes your nails look so fresh and healthy!</li>
            <li> My nails are pretty healthy but sometimes crack at the sides when they&#x27;re long. This polish amazing. It dries fast, gives a smooth look, gives added strength, stays on a long time, and leaves  a beautiful sheer pink color</li>
            <li> I thought it would add a little more color than it does.  It didn&#x27;t wear well at all, kept peeling off.  Very disappointed in this product and would not buy it again.  Glad i got the small bottle.  Very overpriced.</li>
            <li> Product is great - what I expected and the service was wonderful.  Thank you</li>
            <li> My nails have been peeling and generally looking terrible. One coat of this makes them look almost normal. I only wish the claim about brightening were true for me. The formula glides on very well with no streaks. If I run out of product before my nails clear up (assuming they do) I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is a great polish for a person who has little time for personal grooming. It goes on easily, dries in a flash and lasts more than a day or two. I&#x27;ll purchase this again.</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with gel nail polish.  I use this every single day.  One coat is light and two coats are very pink.</li>
            <li> Althought the brush was broken I was able to use this for a while and so far enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for quite awhile. It&#x27;s a clear polish that strenghens the nails, but also gives the nail a whiter, brighter look. I love it!</li>
            <li> I first saw this product on QVC, and I was thinking that this product just might work, and let me tell you my nails have never looked, so good.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and would NEVER BE WITHOUT IT.&lt;br /&gt;If you want beautiful names....this is IT!&lt;br /&gt;I bought the travel size because I would never leave home without it.</li>
            <li> did not help my peeling nails that much.  have not found the right  polish yet.  this is not it.  really need to give it 2 Â½ stars.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in this product, particularly since it appeared an easier alternative for professional manicures when life gets too busy.  The color was fine and would have looked better if it didn&#x27;t dry with streaks from the brush.</li>
            <li> works not as promise. other brands will work the same. i have use this over 3 months and see no difference. for the amount of money, i will buy next time something else.</li>
            <li> I like the growth results of this gel on my splitting nails. I reapplied it every 3 or 4 days but only 4 stars because it&#x27;s kind of expensive.</li>
            <li> I had seen this on one of the shopping channels.  When they applied it, it looked close to a French manicure.  ( That is one of the things they used to sell it).  It is working well to strengthen my nails and it is really easy to apply and uses very little so the little bottle will last a long time.  I always compare the prices between the shopping channels and Amazon.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what changed, but my nails COULD not grow - kept splitting.  Started using this, as well as a deep moisturizer, and my nails are starting to grow longer.  This seems to protect, hold them solid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and it really treated my nails very well.  However, I&#x27;m assuming that the ingredients have changed because my nails are still chipping and breaking.  I love the soft pink color.  Thus, the 3 star review.</li>
            <li> I order it a lot cause it really does good.  My nails are stronger and don&#x27;t split as much .  So I like it.</li>
            <li> Since I started using pink gel formula, I actually have been able to grow my nails for the first time. Have tried many other products but this one works.</li>
            <li> Was very watery- not like what you get from sephora!</li>
            <li> It is just a great product wish it was less expensive.</li>
            <li> I normally have great nails but now they have been peeling and breaking so decided to try this. It really hasnt helped with the peeling as of yet and a nail grew out a little but just snagged and broke. So dont think this really is helping but will keep using it to see if it does improve them. This winter dryness has really taken a toll on my nails so hope this helps. But I do love how shiny the color makes them. It does NOT look like a french manicure like they say, it has very light pink color and shiny. I like it for quick and easy look. Makes nails look nice and finished. Love the shine. Even if it doesnt help improve nails I do like the finished look.</li>
            <li> Great little size! I love this gel polish. Lasts forever and has a very light pink tint. Strengthens nails and keeps them looking nice. Easy to remove too. I never use a regular clear coat anymore, this looks way nicer.</li>
            <li> Within 36 hours it chips.  I don&#x27;t have time to strip and polish nails every day. Also it would damage my nails  to do so.  I have brittle nails.  They both grow and brake off easily. Knowing this, I applied 2 thin coats.  Sorry, Perfect Formula doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> As long as you remember to remove this once a week and re-apply it, this is a great product. My nails are longer and stronger than they&#x27;ve ever been, plus they look manicured since the gel coat has a pinkish tint.</li>
            <li> The color is only pink outside, inside it looks clear. I you are looking for the pink color do not buy this.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really see improvement in my nails after using this product.  Was hoping for fuller coverage.  Would probably not reorder.  Arrived quickly/on time.</li>
            <li> Since I just wanted to try a small bottle I found it here on Amazon. I love this stuff and its enough to last for a few months. Very happy with this size bottle.</li>
            <li> Have been using this since it arrived, and all I can say is WOW my nails have always been a problem with breaking and splitting. Now I have to keep cutting my nails back as they have taken off. Never could see white now have to file or cut, would never have thought possible. You need this if you have trouble keeping nice looking nails.</li>
            <li> I use it every week,  keeps my nails looking great.</li>
            <li> Perfect price, size, and product.</li>
            <li> Will that is the color right but didn&#x27;t do what I wanted it to do or do what it says for me anyway my nail still broke evert time I turned around not happy with it at all</li>
            <li> Use this all the time. Works great for protecting nails.</li>
            <li> one of my faves for nails.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to grow my nails because they are so brittle. For the first time in a long time, I have healthy, beautiful nails.</li>
            <li> My nails because are more brittle and started to peel more after using this product.</li>
            <li> I finally gave up acrylic and  (later) silk wrapped nails about 7 years ago. My nails &amp;#34;struggled&amp;#34; for a long time to get healthy. They finally did...not great, but certainly passable. Then I decided to try the gel nails. I was inaccurately told that it was no worse for my nails than regular polish. NOT TRUE! When I finally stopped doing the gel my nails were as thin as tissue paper....for quite some time. Somebody told me about this Perfect Formula Gel Coat and I bought it immediately. I can&#x27;t tell you how great it is! My nails have never been in better shape. I prefer a natural look...no polish...so that with thePINK Gel&lt;br /&gt;Coat I get a little &#x27;hint&#x27; of pink that translates to just looking really healthy. I would endorse this product whole heartedly!</li>
            <li> Previously purchased from another place.  It was way thicker and didn&#x27;t dry.  This is great - much thinner and dries quicker.&lt;br /&gt;Have tried so many nail hardeners and some yellow nail, nails continue splitting.  This stuff is great.  For anyone with problem&lt;br /&gt;nails - GIVE THIS A TRY!</li>
            <li> This has helped my nails grow like they have not grown in a long time. I love the way it protects my nails, and I especially love the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; look it gives them. I highly recommend!</li>
