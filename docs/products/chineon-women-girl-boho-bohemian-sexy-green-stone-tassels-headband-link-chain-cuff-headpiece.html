            <li> Merchandise came in tact.  It is cute and I like it.</li>
            <li> The head chain was a great buy, the only downside was it took about a month to arrive. If it&#x27;s not something you need fast then I suggest buying it! It&#x27;s super cute!</li>

            <li> This is a beautiful and quality piece. My granddaughter loves it.</li>
            <li> It was very small,  did not fit proper and was made of very cheap material. I would never wear it. I will probably donate it to the Salvation Army for some child to have fun with. I thought I ordered a low cost accessory to wear with an uppercut summer dress.Disappointing. However, some child will have fun with it. Not a total loss.</li>
            <li> I think this is a very pretty item . Standard quality for costume  jewelry . Excellent price for what it is .</li>
            <li> looks just as pictured.</li>
            <li> Cute for summer outings and beach club nights out with friends. Fun and feminine.</li>
            <li> Pretty headband, got here ahead of schedule. Pulled it out of the package and it was in fine shape. When my mom asked me what it was I didn&#x27;t know what to tell her at first except, it&#x27;s a headband. It doesn&#x27;t matter there are no sizes charts it fits just fine the way it is. Very happy with it. I didn&#x27;t really expect to have any sizing issues so everything worked out perfectly. This is not a lightweight headband it looks and feels durable and high quality, more than I was expecting. Really pretty gemstones. Headband fits great. They are set high in the headband, looks awesome.</li>
            <li> The stones look very cheap .. which it was but its decent quality still.</li>
            <li> Shipped pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two small things I don&#x27;t like about this. I don&#x27;t like where the clasp lands. Its a bit too big for my head and if I put the clasp on another line, the center part doesn&#x27;t alight with my center mart in my hair. Also, it gets tangled really easily and is sometimes confusing to untangle.</li>
            <li> Unfunctional. Breaks easily. Doesnt sit n head well</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and very nice for the price..actual stone, not plastic..looks like true turquoise.</li>
            <li> Cute hair piece on my daughter!</li>
            <li> I ordered this on November 27th and I didn&#x27;t get it until January 3rd . shipping was ridiculous . And then when I opened it there was pieces broken . Luckily I make jewelry so It was an easy fix but with how long the shipping took its kinda of upsetting . It fits perfectly so that&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> Nice fit but gold looks super tacky and cheap</li>
            <li> Kinda off center but cute</li>
