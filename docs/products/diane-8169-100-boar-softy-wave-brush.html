            <li> it is I like it.&lt;br /&gt;it is an average like brush.</li>
            <li> I use this one to lay it down followed by a compression method</li>
            <li> No because it wasn&#x27;t Diane 8119 wave brash</li>
            <li> My hair is thick.</li>
            <li> so i guess ill it as a shower brush....</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with a Diane brush</li>
            <li> My waves already Sea Sick</li>

            <li> My husband loves this brush its soft, big, and does the job.</li>
            <li> When I was younger Diane brushes were sold at Wal mart and I had the 8119. This is a great soft brush for my hair when low because I have a very soft grade. Shipping was fast also</li>
            <li> Great quality, effective and soft.</li>
            <li> The 8169 is a perfect soft/medium brush for 360 waves.</li>
