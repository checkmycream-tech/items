            <li>Love the scent.</li>
            <li>I use it with it&#x27;s conditioner for a perfect look all day long!</li>
            <li>shampoo is pretty nice</li>
            <li>I suppose the heart and blood pressure medication I&#x27;m on has drastically changed the texture of my droopy, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the smell of this shampoo.</li>
            <li>but after use this, my hair is smooth.</li>
            <li>This moroccan shine makes your hair silky, frizz free.  </li>
            <li>Herbal Essences has really hit the mark when they created this shampoo!!!</li>
            <li>I am so hooked on Herbal Essences shampoos because of how clean my hair feels when I use it and the price is affordable.</li>
            <li>smells amazing makes my hair super soft</li>
            <li>This stuff is blue, and has a nice smell, very light and not heavy and sweet.</li>
            <li>It has a fresh scent that reminds me of apples.</li>
            <li>I end up with super soft and silky hair that is oil free and flowing.</li>
            <li>the next 2 days of using my hair got super oily no matter how many times I washed without conditioner.</li>
            <li>After the first wash using both Shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>shiny hair for everyone in the whole  family!</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;I use this shampoo at the first time today.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Makes my hair really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>got in the shower, wet my hair under warm water and then lathered up my hair with a pea sized amount.</li>
            <li>Leaves no residue hair is super soft too!!</li>
            <li>came very fast, and was packaged very securely.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t get any greasy or wet feelings that some nourishing shampoos give, but my hair wasn&#x27;t as soft as i would have liked, but for the price, this shampoo is really great!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely try this one out!</li>
            <li>really well.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t even have to wash my hair as much.  </li>
            <li>So i saw this at target and rememberd looking up reviews on different shampoos and rememberd seeing makes curly hair flat and soft and morrocon oil is good for you, so i bought it</li>
            <li>I like to do this with shampoo because the product can seep into my hair and just give it that extra &amp;#34;&#x27;oomph&#x27;&amp;#34; it needs to get super</li>
            <li>Even right after rinsing the shampoo out it had that very slimy oily feeling my hair felt gross after the shower as if I hadn&#x27;t washed it in a week.</li>
            <li>I love the blue color, and it really leaves your hair extra soft and the shine is from the oil in it, so</li>
            <li>it made my hair very moisturized and soft but</li>
            <li>and it straightend alot easier than normal</li>
            <li>It is a heavy conditioner which is wonderful for long hair that gets very dry at the ends!!!  </li>
            <li>Used with the accompanying conditioner it seems to decrease the brittleness of this old head!</li>
            <li>leaves hair soft and hydrated .</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair smooth and shiny without feeling heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>But it is not heavy at all or oily.  </li>
            <li>My hair stays soft all day long, and it makes it so much easier to style!</li>
            <li>and my hair is shiney and is flat and straight</li>
            <li>i normally dont like to buy regular drugstore products</li>
            <li>I have wave hair, I used blow dry with comb, my hair became straight.</li>
            <li>This conditioner makes my hair shinier and softer than no other.  </li>
            <li>and i felt like i could only use it on special occasions and not as an everyday shampoo.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not entirely too bad it has a pleasant soft Apple-like smell</li>
            <li>I have tried other kinds of shampoo and so far none of them give me the shine and soft feel</li>
            <li>I would only recommend this for someone who just needs a little moisture in their super dry.</li>

            <li> my hair is not frizzy or anything sometimes feel dry.</li>
            <li> Dry.  </li>
            <li> But now my hair is so dry</li>
            <li> and it made her hair just lay down flat.  </li>
            <li> It is very comparable to some of the expensive big name shampoo and conditioners I use at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> my hair is what most stylist call &amp;#34;soft loose curls&amp;#34; but it can get really dry and hard to straighten which is why i straighten it one day and literally wait a month till it gets really bad and gross before i have to wash it again</li>
            <li> but i was getting tired of spending money on high end products that did half the job</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried about almost all herbal essence products I had decided to try this one since my long thick wavy waist length hair was getting really dry.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, and colored hair, and it would always look dry and dull to me.  </li>
            <li> I like my hair to shine but not worth the heavy greasiness.</li>
            <li> have I used a shampoo that weighs this head of hair down and makes it look greasy and limp until this.</li>
            <li> I use both the Moroccan my shine shampoo and conditioner, and then use a clarifying shampoo every few days.  </li>
            <li> The scent is subtle when the hair dries but it is still somewhat there because I will move my head sometimes and get a slight smell of the lingering</li>
            <li> Expensive conditioners don&#x27;t even do the same for me.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo is so harsh on hair!</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> During the summer, my hair gets dry and frizzy and difficult to maintain, but this helps my hair stay moisturized and keep</li>
            <li> Poor choice.</li>
            <li> This is not great for all hair types.)  </li>
            <li> It works up into a very thick, soapy lather, and it didn&#x27;t get runny, which I like because I HATE it when I get shampoo in my eyes.</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate it and would NEVER purchase it again.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I enjoy the smell of this shampoo. I have used this Moroccan My Shine and the Long Term Relationship one and I love the way Herbal Essences makes my hair feel after my hair dries. I end up with super soft and silky hair that is oil free and flowing. The scent is subtle when the hair dries but it is still somewhat there because I will move my head sometimes and get a slight smell of the lingering scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband also loves the smell and compliments me when using both scents I listed above. I am so hooked on Herbal Essences shampoos because of how clean my hair feels when I use it and the price is affordable. I have tried other kinds of shampoo and so far none of them give me the shine and soft feel I get from this brand!</li>

            <li> I have the thickest hair and it is almost to my waist. NEVER have I used a shampoo that weighs this head of hair down and makes it look greasy and limp until this. Poor choice. I like my hair to shine but not worth the heavy greasiness.</li>
            <li> this did nothing great for my hair, smell is ok.  My daughter was allergic to something in it, so that&#x27;s mostly why we didn&#x27;t like it.  Now boys have lots of bubble bath!</li>
            <li> Love the smell!! Leaves no residue hair is super soft too!!</li>
            <li> shiny hair for everyone in the whole  family!</li>
            <li> smells amazing makes my hair super soft</li>
            <li> I usually buy large package of shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;This is an add  on item with 1.5 coupon when I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;I use this shampoo at the first time today.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is blue smells like apple scent.&lt;br /&gt;Lathered really well. Didn&#x27;t use any conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;So my hair is not frizzy or anything sometimes feel dry. but after use this, my hair is smooth. I have wave hair, I used blow dry with comb, my hair became straight. Don&#x27;t know if this will give a long term benefit. Overall, works well for me.</li>
            <li> I love the Herbal Essences Moroccan shampoo and conditioner.  It is a heavy conditioner which is wonderful for long hair that gets very dry at the ends!!!  It is very comparable to some of the expensive big name shampoo and conditioners I use at a fraction of the price. (Warning - I had a family member with short curly hair use it and it made her hair just lay down flat.  This is not great for all hair types.)  Long hair combs out so well and does not frizz with this duo.  It has a fresh scent that reminds me of apples.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is so harsh on hair! I absolutely hate it and would NEVER purchase it again. Waste of money!</li>
            <li> Love this so much better than Suave&#x27;s moroccan.  The smell is better and it even feels like it cleans my hair better.</li>
            <li> Works and smells great!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It makes my hair look and smell AMAZING! During the summer, my hair gets dry and frizzy and difficult to maintain, but this helps my hair stay moisturized and keep it&#x27;s shine. My hair stays soft all day long, and it makes it so much easier to style! I use it with it&#x27;s conditioner for a perfect look all day long! I recommend this product to family and friends all the time!</li>
            <li> Works really good!! Makes my hair really soft and smooth. It smells amazing also!! Will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> leaves hair soft and hydrated . I love</li>
            <li> i normally dont like to buy regular drugstore products but i was getting tired of spending money on high end products that did half the job and i felt like i could only use it on special occasions and not as an everyday shampoo. So im mixed african american and latina, so my hair is what most stylist call &amp;#34;soft loose curls&amp;#34; but it can get really dry and hard to straighten which is why i straighten it one day and literally wait a month till it gets really bad and gross before i have to wash it again cause straightening it is such a long hassle. So i saw this at target and rememberd looking up reviews on different shampoos and rememberd seeing makes curly hair flat and soft and morrocon oil is good for you, so i bought it and omg this made my hair feel so moisterized and it straightend alot easier than normal and my hair is shiney and is flat and straight like i like it, im really really happy with my results and whats awsome is it almost felt like i just got out of a salon, i really love this and will stick with it for a while</li>
            <li> It made my hair.  Dry.  It was lîke I washed with hair spray !</li>
            <li> I suppose the heart and blood pressure medication I&#x27;m on has drastically changed the texture of my droopy, fine hair.  In all my 75 years, I&#x27;ve never had waves.  But now my hair is so dry, I decided to try this product because of the argan oil in it.  Used with the accompanying conditioner it seems to decrease the brittleness of this old head!</li>
            <li> Great. Fast delivery. Smells good.</li>
            <li> Great lather and smell!!! Easy to extract from the bottle!!!! Herbal Essences has really hit the mark when they created this shampoo!!!</li>
            <li> excellent product and came in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo! I use it with the matching conditioner for great results. It leaves my hair smooth and shiny without feeling heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> I love the blue color, and it really leaves your hair extra soft and the shine is from the oil in it, so if u don&#x27;t like the sleek look I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it</li>
            <li> best daily shampoo with argan oil ....</li>
            <li> This is the BEST shampoo and conditioner I have ever used.  I have long hair and no matter what I tried I still had frizz.  This moroccan shine makes your hair silky, frizz free.  But it is not heavy at all or oily.  My hair is shiny, smooth, silkey and looks so healthy! And I don&#x27;t even have to wash my hair as much.  I get compliments on how healthy my hair looks a week after I wash it.&lt;br /&gt; Love...love...love it.</li>
            <li> Love the scent. Works great. Must try!</li>
            <li> Well this was certainly a nice find! It was very cheap and had Prime as well, so i thought; &amp;#34;&#x27;What the heck, I&#x27;ll try it.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;It came very fast, and was packaged very securely.&lt;br /&gt;I got in the shower, wet my hair under warm water and then lathered up my hair with a pea sized amount. This stuff is blue, and has a nice smell, very light and not heavy and sweet. It works up into a very thick, soapy lather, and it didn&#x27;t get runny, which I like because I HATE it when I get shampoo in my eyes. Then i left it in for about five minutes. I like to do this with shampoo because the product can seep into my hair and just give it that extra &amp;#34;&#x27;oomph&#x27;&amp;#34; it needs to get super soft.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is pretty nice, I didn&#x27;t get any greasy or wet feelings that some nourishing shampoos give, but my hair wasn&#x27;t as soft as i would have liked, but for the price, this shampoo is really great!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely try this one out!</li>
            <li> Smells great! I bought the shampoo and conditioner and have to say that I love them!  These leave my hair looking and feeling great.</li>
