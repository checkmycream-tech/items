            <li> I love the way it smells.  I really like how shiny my hair looks after I use it.</li>

            <li> Great product!  I read about it in People Magazine and it is everything that was said.</li>
            <li> it was sealed;; but looks like used one;;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure.. but its ok</li>
            <li> Another reviewer stated this is the same as After Party and I do not agree.  Although the consistency is similar it is a different color and has some sparkly gold specs in it.  I like, as I like After Party.  It&#x27;s a light conditioner/styling cream for your hair.  I&#x27;ve used these products for a long time now and really can&#x27;t go without them.</li>
            <li> Only thing i would change is to make the product with all organic ingredients</li>
            <li> I love this product and will continue to order it!</li>
            <li> This is exactly the same as Tigi After Party in the pink container. I have been using the After Party for over 13 years and thought that they had added another product that I.must.have! Nope, same smell, same formulation, just a brownish color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I use this (or these) product(s) every day to smooth fly aways and in general keep my (somewhat) unruly hair in line. I flat iron my hair daily and wash every couple of days. This product really finishes and seals my hair and makes my hair smell great, regardless of when I washed it. I never leave this product behind, this is a daily must use. I love it and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> gives you smooth soft hair.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Smells great!</li>
            <li> good product and a little goes a long way.  I combine this with a hair oil that makes it less sticky and goes into my hair smoother.</li>
            <li> this product was recommended by my hairdresser. Works very well.</li>
            <li> Fast good product no problems</li>
            <li> Awesome price. Thank you soooo much</li>
