            <li>and it&#x27;s working flawlessly</li>
            <li>This one should work perfectly with just about any style tooth brush.</li>
            <li>I was impressed with the warranty while shopping and that influenced my purchase decision.</li>

            <li>Great service.  </li>
            <li>Purebrush work great.</li>
            <li>Works great.  </li>
            <li>It is a good product.</li>
            <li>Somehow I tend to feel that the unit is a good one</li>
            <li>was looking for a good place to store my families tooth brushes.</li>
            <li>The product seems to work great, it looks good, and the people at the company are lovely.</li>
            <li>Very Pleased....</li>
            <li>I own 2 Purebrush units.</li>
            <li>Each time they were courteous, prompt and helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I guess it is wise to buy from a reputable company</li>
            <li>It fits nicely on my counter.</li>
            <li>I will have to make my own holder if I want to use this thing anymore.&lt;br</li>
            <li>often I have had truly great products that didn&#x27;t enjoy the success they deserved because totally satisfied consumers like me didn&#x27;t take the time to let others know about our positive experience with a wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>I was looking for something better.  </li>
            <li>This one LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>Something with pins for electronic brush heads, I think, makes more sense.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>love mine have had no issues</li>
            <li>What better than a sanitizer?</li>
            <li>I have had that telephone number for many years</li>
            <li>I have had that telephone number for many years</li>
            <li>I am sure this is out of an abundance of caution as it does plug in and if it accidentally falls into water could do allot of harm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Very easy to work, bulb changes easily.  </li>
            <li>Bulb is available online and at most drug stores.  </li>
            <li>So far, the replacement bulb is working great.</li>
            <li>Just take it easy when storing and removing toothbrushes (kids will break them).</li>
            <li>but I can see the unit working when I turn off the light</li>
            <li>so I can see the ultraviolet light on along the edge of the door, so</li>
            <li>After a period of time, I contacted him again, and he said that the shipment was somewhere over the ocean, and it should be at available in September.</li>
            <li>and that now it was available.  </li>
            <li>but the manufacturer has gone cheap on the part that holds the brushes.</li>
            <li>This one fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>It worked great for several months</li>
            <li>Luckily, the manufacturer thoughtfully included one replacement bulb.  </li>
            <li>This unit is large and takes up a lot of space on your counter top.</li>
            <li>This mailbox is full.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>own two and have given several as gifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>same kind of switch problem.</li>
            <li>It is easy to keep clean, and it comes with extra bulbs, toothbrush holders and toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>impression is that Pure Brush is a labor of love by a small but devoted crew of folks who are fanatical about offering a truly affordable and genuinely effective sanitizer.  </li>
            <li>I have taken one of them apart and have admired the simple and quality of the build and understand why this unit has lasted me more than 5 years.</li>
            <li>it works exactly as it&#x27;s supposed to</li>
            <li>the first one lasted 2 yrs.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It is funny.</li>
            <li>It is funny.</li>
            <li>I appreciate how the hangers on the inside are simple in design with a very large area that sanitizes whatever will fit inside the swinging door.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve purchased 2 pure brushes.</li>
            <li>It is a good looking appliance, but I hardly want it on my coffee</li>
            <li>the only thing that stopped working after two years was the sanitizing light on the front</li>
            <li>so can&#x27;t really comment on that.</li>
            <li>This unit is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>The company sent a replacement very promptly.to my email with the phone number on it.</li>
            <li>The company sent a replacement very promptly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this</li>
            <li>Company called me and asked what color I wanted because I failed to choose one when ordering, great customer service.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re serious about oral hygiene you should own one of these.</li>
            <li>COMBINATION HAS RESULTED IN CLEAN, HEALTHY TEETH, WHICH IN MY&lt;br /&gt;BREED, CAN BE DIFFICULT.  </li>
            <li>I searched high and low for a decent sanitizing unit that is large enough to accommodate electronic toothbrush heads.  </li>
            <li>Please read complete review.....</li>

            <li>I have never been in a bathroom that doesn&#x27;t have the electrical outlet near the sink .</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Too bulky - did not like the style..</li>
            <li> I own 2 Purebrush units. I have taken one of them apart and have admired the simple and quality of the build and understand why this unit has lasted me more than 5 years. I appreciate how the hangers on the inside are simple in design with a very large area that sanitizes whatever will fit inside the swinging door. Currently I use my Oral B removable toothbrush heads and my Waterpik nozzles in my unit. I have witnessed a decline in my allergies, and I am thankful for this simple fact as my day starts easier than it used to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this unit for over 5 years and I love it I replace the bulb twice and it&#x27;s working flawlessly the only thing that stopped working after two years was the sanitizing light on the front but I can see the unit working when I turn off the light In the bathroom so I can see the ultraviolet light on along the edge of the door, so I know it&#x27;s working. I highly recommend this unIt it works exactly as it&#x27;s supposed to</li>
            <li> I had ordered this product directly from the seller several months ago. When he sent me the wrong color, I notified him of the fact. He said there was a mixup, and that not only would he send me the correct color, but I could keep the one I had. After a period of time, I contacted him again, and he said that the shipment was somewhere over the ocean, and it should be at available in September. Then no more responses after my e-mailing him several times.  It is obvious to me that he never intended to send me the correct order.  One very disappointed customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost a year later (June 2012), I received the Purebrush product in white that I had ordered.  The owner said that the shipment had been detained from China all these months. and that now it was available.  I have changed the one star to four stars because he kept his word. It is a good product.</li>
            <li> After having 2 others brands that I was unhappy with due to the quality of both and one having the brush resting down in the floor of it where it gets icky I was looking for something better.  I&#x27;ve had mine for almost 2 years and would buy it again.  Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product over eight years ago and have only had to replace the bulb one time.  Bulb is available online and at most drug stores.  Very easy to work, bulb changes easily.  Quality of product is great...highly recommend.  Note:  have not had to deal with customer service so can&#x27;t really comment on that.</li>
            <li> I had two other toothbrush sanitizers before and I had to get rid of them because it did not do the job. This one LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Great service.  Purebrush work great.</li>
            <li> This unit is the real deal.  It really works, unlike the imitators that are unlikely to sanitize anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own two and have given several as gifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My impression is that Pure Brush is a labor of love by a small but devoted crew of folks who are fanatical about offering a truly affordable and genuinely effective sanitizer.  Over the years that I&#x27;ve used these units I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to deal with the company on a couple of occasions.  Each time they were courteous, prompt and helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too often I have had truly great products that didn&#x27;t enjoy the success they deserved because totally satisfied consumers like me didn&#x27;t take the time to let others know about our positive experience with a wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re serious about oral hygiene you should own one of these.</li>
            <li> This unit is large and takes up a lot of space on your counter top. I have used this for over a year. We have replaced the bulb with the extra that it came with. The part that I do not like is the holder. Although it came with an extra toothbrush rack, it is a steady chain of breakage. We use oral b and sonic care brushes. We do not feel that we are rough on this unit but we continually have the plastic holders for the brushes snap off. I think we have 2 of the four clips left..  This is using the replacement. Somehow I tend to feel that the unit is a good one but the manufacturer has gone cheap on the part that holds the brushes. I would not buy this unit again. Something with pins for electronic brush heads, I think, makes more sense.</li>
            <li> I was sent a defective product so I can&#x27;t rate it. What a shame though I tried this product before and I love it in fact I still have it. I guess it is wise to buy from a reputable company</li>
            <li> It is easy to keep clean, and it comes with extra bulbs, toothbrush holders and toothbrushes. If you can get past the sticker shock, it is worth the price in the long run.</li>
            <li> Works great.  The only negative is the toothbrush holders (which holds 4 toothbrushes or toothbrush heads) break easily but they provide you with an extra one.  Just take it easy when storing and removing toothbrushes (kids will break them). Company called me and asked what color I wanted because I failed to choose one when ordering, great customer service.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve purchased 2 pure brushes. the first one lasted 2 yrs. then failed,something to do with the door switch.  i did like the idea, so i purchased another unit.  this one lasted 10 months.  same kind of switch problem. i will not buy a third, but i am hoping the warranty works.  reading some of the feedback, i doubt it.</li>
            <li> love mine have had no issues</li>
            <li> Please read complete review.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a good place to store my families tooth brushes. What better than a sanitizer? This is a solid construction. It fits nicely on my counter. It is exactly what I was looking for. Some noted that other brands would not hold a standard tooth brush. This one should work perfectly with just about any style tooth brush. I like the tooth brush mounts as well. Mine came with a spare lamp and tooth brush mount. Very Pleased....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE....After 3 months the unit has quit working. Contacted the manufacturer and was given a telephone number to call to help with getting it repaired. It appears that it is a problem with the door switch and possibly the electronics of the item. I will advise. Very disappointing after only 3 months of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE....Called the number that was given. Answering machine picked up and said there was no one to take my call and requested that I leave a message at the beep. After the beep I got another message. This mailbox is full. GOODBYE and my call was disconnected.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE....Contacted the company by email and got a response from the CEO of the company and said that I would be contacted by a manager. It never happened. Repeated attempts to contact the company by phone resulted in the same scenario above. Contacted the CEO and was advised that a manager had attempted a call. I was home the entire day no calls. Also I have caller ID and that would have shown their attempt had it been made!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update....Asked the CEO why no one ever called and received response from the CEO on March 2 saying that if I would send him the number I was at that he would call then. I sent the number and 5 hours later received am email stating that he would have someone call on Monday. I responded to the email asking why he failed to call that day and he stated that he never received the number from me. The email stating he would have someone call Monday was a reply to my email with the phone number on it. I guess they would run you around with double talk until you get tired and give up or the warranty time has ended. The most frustrating company that I have EVER dealt with. It is funny. They answer emails promptly, and always advise that they have to speak to you by phone to work out any repair. Never answered my calls. Made promises to call me, but never did. The time frame of all the above is about 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final update....The CEO sent another email and said that he tried my home telephone number, but it was not an operating number....FYI I have had that telephone number for many years and it is still operational. I have caller ID and the only numbers were known numbers. The sad thing is that I really liked this product up until the time I had trouble with it. I then received no help from the company that made the item in regards to getting the warranty repair service. To me the one year warranty was not worth the paper it was written on. I was impressed with the warranty while shopping and that influenced my purchase decision. It is sad that the company would not honor it. They never even examined it. I did not waste my time responding to this last email as no one from this company will ever answer their phone as they disconnected every call attempt I made. Also, they do not return calls that were requested through email chatter....Said they tried, but NO evidence to that fact....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. The company sent a replacement very promptly.to my email with the phone number on it.

            <li> There us no way to contact thus company, the number they give is for something totally different and they want you to buy some crap that has nothing to do with the purchase! Garbage and a wast of money sorry I brought it!</li>
            <li> I USE IT TO SANITIZE MY SHOWDOGS TOOTHBRUSHES AND PLAQUE SCRAPER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IN CONJUNCTION WITH MAXI-GUARD ORAL CLENSING GEL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS COMBINATION HAS RESULTED IN CLEAN, HEALTHY TEETH, WHICH IN MY&lt;br /&gt;BREED, CAN BE DIFFICULT.  KUDOS!</li>
            <li> The product seems to work great, it looks good, and the people at the company are lovely. Here&#x27;s what I wished I knew before buying it...&lt;br /&gt;In the instruction manual it states you should not place this item on or near a sink or shower.  I am sure this is out of an abundance of caution as it does plug in and if it accidentally falls into water could do allot of harm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know about you, but I brush my teeth over the bathroom sink, and this is essentially a toothbrush holder that sanitizes the brushes.  I have never been in a bathroom that doesn&#x27;t have the electrical outlet near the sink . This begs the question, where are you supposed to put this thing? Am I supposed to brush my teeth then walk the wet toothbrush into the livingroom, or the bedroom, or the garage? It is a good looking appliance, but I hardly want it on my coffee table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish this caution was put into the product description.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for 4 - 5 weeks, and it has already stopped working.  I am not happy at all.  Don&#x27;t buy it.  UPDATE - I contacted Murdock Labratories, the maker of this product, about the \\&quot;warranty\\&quot;.  After 5 unanswered e-mails, and a threat to contact the BBB, they sent me a new toothbrush sanitizer.  This one lasted a month.  Don&#x27;t buy this product.  It&#x27;s horribly made.</li>
            <li> I searched high and low for a decent sanitizing unit that is large enough to accommodate electronic toothbrush heads.  This one fit the bill.  It worked great for several months then the bulb burned out.  Luckily, the manufacturer thoughtfully included one replacement bulb.  So far, the replacement bulb is working great.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for about 5 months now. My first bulb burnt out within 3 months and I was expecting it to last at least a year. I just had to replace my second bulb after 2 months. I ordered replacements for about 9 bucks each here on amazon. The bulbs I ordered are rated for 10000 hours so they should be lasting way longer than 2 or 3 months since this device only turns on a hour per cycle. One problem with this product is the toothbrush heads are not dry after finishing a cycle. If the toothbrush is still wet I doubt it is killing all the germs. The next problem is the plastic piece that holds the toothbrush in place. The clips keep breaking and now every single clip has broken in my short time owning the product. I will have to make my own holder if I want to use this thing anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thing about this product is you can order it directly from the purebrush website for less money. I contacted the seller about this and they offered me some extra bulbs to compensate for the price difference but I never received anything.</li>
