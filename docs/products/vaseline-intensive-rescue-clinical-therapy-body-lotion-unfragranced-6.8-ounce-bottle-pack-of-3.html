            <li>Found it on Amazon and was thrilled.  </li>
            <li>It feels great, no fragrance and seems to be more effective than many of the more frou-frou lotions I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>It feels smooth and pleasant when you rub your skin after you use</li>
            <li>I have suffered from excema on my hands for over a decade and have been through many many products.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased with this find that I did a search to locate this product on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Try it for sure.  </li>
            <li>sure you get &#x27;Intensive Rescue Clinical Therapy&#x27;.</li>
            <li>It costs more so</li>
            <li>so I am glad I can still get this...</li>
            <li>so I was pleased to be able to order it through Amazon.</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love, this product.  </li>
            <li>A friend told me about this, and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>IT SEEMED TO BE OK</li>
            <li>MUCH MORE THEN AT THE BEGINNING.</li>
            <li>This is the best lotion I have ever used for my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Still, I have to admit  it must be good for something because it costs so much.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply and spread easily.  </li>
            <li>Fantastis, light weight cream</li>
            <li>Fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>Vaseline clinical Therapy lotion  was referred to me as an over the counter lotion to use in place of a fabulous $100 prescription that I have been using for over a year for a dermatitis condition on my hands.</li>
            <li>it is worth more???    </li>
            <li>Just wish it was available in stores, also.</li>
            <li>Bottle size is easy to handle and lotion goes on and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>For the most dry, cracked and ailing parts of my skin, it felt good going on, healing even.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I always need to grab a towel and clean the excess goo from my palms after application.</li>
            <li>the \\&quot;lightly fragranced\\&quot; and \\&quot;unfragranced\\&quot; versions are scented, which in both cases is mild, pleasant and reminiscent of days on the beach.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Both the \\&quot;lightly fragranced\\&quot; and \\&quot;unfragranced\\&quot; versions are scented, which in both cases is mild, pleasant and reminiscent of days on the beach.     </li>
            <li>Great for dry cracked hands.  </li>
            <li>The best I have found but very hard to find.</li>
            <li>I paid a premium but it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>Good for very dry skin and absorbs pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>The Cetaphil did a pretty good job, but my hands would become dry again after 4-5 hand washings.</li>
            <li>That is sensible, right?  </li>
            <li>Does not wash off right away.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores and no other lotion does hydrates as well without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>The bottle advertises \\&quot;for extremely dry skin\\&quot;...and that is the demographic that will make the most of this unique product.</li>
            <li>is prescription strength and it really works!</li>
            <li>It definitely made my baby feel better; I&#x27;ll keep buying this lotion for him.</li>
            <li>WHEN I FIRST STARTED USING THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li>Love this product and was glad to find it at less than $10 a bottle -- but can&#x27;t find that price anymore!!</li>
            <li>After trying a sample in my dermatologist&#x27;s office, I couldn&#x27;t believe how effective this product was compared to the higher end brands I&#x27;d purchased previously.</li>
            <li>I prefer a more elegant formulation that sinks in and leaves only a moist, dewy sensation behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had my skin pretty much under control, but my skin would still crack and the problem would persist throughout the year.</li>

            <li>It does a good job in mending parts of your skin that are dry which it does almost instantly.  </li>
            <li>It really was a rescue for me.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I also really appreciate that it is has nofragrance.</li>
            <li>, IT REALLY IS AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to buy several packs for my mom because it runs out quick.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Vaseline makes good, solid lotions in general, and I would recommend this product to anyone with very dry, cracked and bothered skin.</li>
            <li>Vaseline makes good, solid lotions in general, and I would recommend this product to anyone with very dry, cracked and bothered skin.</li>
            <li>Too bad, it works real good.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are sound, including glycerin, mineral oil, herbal borage oil (thought to be helpful for ecxema and other skin problems), soybean oil, Vitamin E and lecithin.</li>
            <li>Good product but hard to find locally.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not hard to work with unlike some reviewers comments and it absorbs quickly and does last and last without having to reapply frequently.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also an excellent supplementary lotion to keep in the medicine cabinet for dry skin emergencies, or to add a protective skin barrier in cold, windy climates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also an excellent supplementary lotion to keep in the medicine cabinet for dry skin emergencies, or to add a protective skin barrier in cold, windy climates.     </li>
            <li>It is pure white.  </li>
            <li>My arms and legs stayed noticeably soft and supple and I did not need to reapply during the day.</li>
            <li>Would of rated this 5 stars, but really didn&#x27;t need 3 bottles that all expire on the same date.  </li>
            <li>The titanium dioxide adds the opacity seen in sunscreens (as it&#x27;s the last ingredient on the list, there would not be enough to add a useful SPF factor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received this \\&quot;skin protectant body lotion\\&quot; to test, I was both impressed and appalled with the viscosity of the product.</li>
            <li>The Vaseline Clinical Therapy Body Lotion is very thick, very rich and very creamy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But in North Carolina, it did not work any better in winter than the various other dozen or so moisturizers I have tried over the last five years.     </li>
            <li>There is a slight scent to the unfragranced, but it dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>There are many others - but this is a little more expensive &amp; you get what you pay</li>
            <li>I have tried many hand lotions with no good results.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is not greasy and really does heal dry cracked heals, you have to keep at it to see results.</li>
            <li>The ads claim this stuff cured a whole village in Alaska of dry hands in winter.  </li>
            <li>I put this product on once a day and my hands stay soft the entire day.</li>
            <li>Ordered this product by mistake but have no regrets.</li>
            <li>He termed the product too rich and \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; and found it hard to rub in.</li>
            <li>My skin, while dry and sometimes cracked in hot spots like cuticles, shins and elbows, is not really in need of a clinical strength lotion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, for daily wear on normal to slightly dry skin, my conclusion is that the Vaseline Clinical Therapy Body Lotion is a bit of overkill.</li>

            <li>I went back and got several more samples and after my morning shower I did half my body with the Intensive Rescue and half with two other brands that I&#x27;d been using.</li>

            <li> It is the ONLY thing that helps with my severely dry skin that cracks open.</li>
            <li> Only use this lotion on my face so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I buy this every few months as a subscription, because I live in the south</li>
            <li> I only need to use vaseline at night &amp; only very minimally.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Living in the southwest of the USA, I have dry hands as a rule.</li>
            <li> We decided to use the lotion on our somewhat scaly lower legs and be content to wash our hands after use, reapplying another lotion for our dry palms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;For persons with severely dry skin, I suspect the lotion is a godsend.</li>
            <li> I have dry hands in the winter.  </li>
            <li> For the normal majority of my body, the lotion is just too thick to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This lotion helps me keep from getting very dry hands during the day.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very dry here.  </li>

            <li> Great for all around the seasons !!</li>
            <li> The Vaseline Clinical Therapy Body Lotion is very thick, very rich and very creamy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received this \\&quot;skin protectant body lotion\\&quot; to test, I was both impressed and appalled with the viscosity of the product. For the most dry, cracked and ailing parts of my skin, it felt good going on, healing even. For the normal majority of my body, the lotion is just too thick to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Living in the southwest of the USA, I have dry hands as a rule. I use a lot of lotion several times a day on hands, arms and legs, but the Vaseline Clinical Therapy Body Lotion is still uncomfortably waxy for me. I always need to grab a towel and clean the excess goo from my palms after application. It&#x27;s too bad, in a sense, as I really did want to like this product. I used it for months, in both climates both hot/dry and cold/windy, hoping the lotion would grow on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to engage my husband as a tester, as he also is a daily lotion user. He termed the product too rich and \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; and found it hard to rub in. We decided to use the lotion on our somewhat scaly lower legs and be content to wash our hands after use, reapplying another lotion for our dry palms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sense is that I am not precisely the target market for a formulation subtitled, \\&quot;Intensive Rescue.\\&quot; My skin, while dry and sometimes cracked in hot spots like cuticles, shins and elbows, is not really in need of a clinical strength lotion. I prefer a more elegant formulation that sinks in and leaves only a moist, dewy sensation behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For persons with severely dry skin, I suspect the lotion is a godsend. The ingredients are sound, including glycerin, mineral oil, herbal borage oil (thought to be helpful for ecxema and other skin problems), soybean oil, Vitamin E and lecithin. Tapioca starch provides a slight \\&quot;powder\\&quot; sensation, while active ingredient dimethicone adds a protective \\&quot;glove-like\\&quot; residue. The titanium dioxide adds the opacity seen in sunscreens (as it&#x27;s the last ingredient on the list, there would not be enough to add a useful SPF factor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both the \\&quot;lightly fragranced\\&quot; and \\&quot;unfragranced\\&quot; versions are scented, which in both cases is mild, pleasant and reminiscent of days on the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vaseline makes good, solid lotions in general, and I would recommend this product to anyone with very dry, cracked and bothered skin. It&#x27;s also an excellent supplementary lotion to keep in the medicine cabinet for dry skin emergencies, or to add a protective skin barrier in cold, windy climates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, for daily wear on normal to slightly dry skin, my conclusion is that the Vaseline Clinical Therapy Body Lotion is a bit of overkill. The bottle advertises \\&quot;for extremely dry skin\\&quot;...and that is the demographic that will make the most of this unique product.ould not be enough to add a useful SPF factor).

            <li> I have suffered from excema on my hands for over a decade and have been through many many products. I had my skin pretty much under control, but my skin would still crack and the problem would persist throughout the year. It would get so bad sometimes that it would hurt to try to grip something and the cracks/cuts would bleed. I was using Cetaphil every day after a shower on my hands before I found this product. The Cetaphil did a pretty good job, but my hands would become dry again after 4-5 hand washings. I put this product on once a day and my hands stay soft the entire day. My skin hasn&#x27;t cracked even once since I&#x27;ve been on this and I now keep it stocked up. I found it at Vons on sale for half the price it is on Amazon and I bought about 8 bottles of the stuff. I would pay triple if I had to as this lotion has solved the problem with my hands. I hope they never stop making it. It really was a rescue for me.</li>
            <li> I work in medical and have to wash my hands alot.  This lotion helps me keep from getting very dry hands during the day.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Fantastis, light weight cream</li>
            <li> After trying a sample in my dermatologist&#x27;s office, I couldn&#x27;t believe how effective this product was compared to the higher end brands I&#x27;d purchased previously. I went back and got several more samples and after my morning shower I did half my body with the Intensive Rescue and half with two other brands that I&#x27;d been using. My arms and legs stayed noticeably soft and supple and I did not need to reapply during the day. Once rubbed in, my skin was not at all greasy feeling. I was so pleased with this find that I did a search to locate this product on Amazon. There is a slight scent to the unfragranced, but it dissipates quickly. I have allergies. No irritation with this product.</li>
            <li> I am 66 and have very sensitive, thin, and dry skin.  This lotion is the best I have ever tried.  It&#x27;s not hard to work with unlike some reviewers comments and it absorbs quickly and does last and last without having to reapply frequently.  It has worked wonders and works as well if not better than some of the $35 a bottle lotions from department stores.  Try it for sure.  You aren&#x27;t investing in a Mercedes for heaven&#x27;s sake.  Cowboy up and take my word for it.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Wish it was a bit cheaper, but the product just plum works. Can&#x27;t complain about that. It works.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been able to find this for a couple of years - best therapy lotion I&#x27;ve ever used - as soon as you use it you will agree.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you get &#x27;Intensive Rescue Clinical Therapy&#x27;. There are many others - but this is a little more expensive &amp; you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;So pleased to find it again - I bought 4 of them !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elaine Berlin</li>
            <li> Love this product and was glad to find it at less than $10 a bottle -- but can&#x27;t find that price anymore!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve reached the age when I have what I call that &amp;#34;creepy, crepey, crappy&amp;#34; wrinkling on my arms. This stuff actually makes it go away, at least for a while. I also really appreciate that it is has nofragrance.</li>
            <li> excellent product and transaction</li>
            <li> the expiration date on the product indicates it has expired. The date was January 2011. The problem is you cant find this product in any drug store anymore.</li>
            <li> This lotion is not greasy and really does heal dry cracked heals, you have to keep at it to see results. But it works!!</li>
            <li> This lotion is very effective to your skin.  Fragrance free.  Easy to apply and spread easily.  It does a good job in mending parts of your skin that are dry which it does almost instantly.  It is pure white.  It feels smooth and pleasant when you rub your skin after you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It contains dimethicone, labeled here as a skin protectant.  Dimethicone is also used in shampoos and conditioners (as dimethicone makes hair shiny and slippery).</li>
            <li> They discontinued this lotion in US and you can no longer buy it in stores.  It is the ONLY thing that helps with my severely dry skin that cracks open.</li>
            <li> I buy this every few months as a subscription, because I live in the south and it&#x27;s very dry here.  I love the moisture of this lotion!</li>
            <li> Vaseline clinical Therapy lotion  was referred to me as an over the counter lotion to use in place of a fabulous $100 prescription that I have been using for over a year for a dermatitis condition on my hands. I&#x27;ve used the Vaseline lotion 1-2 times per day for a couple of weeks and it has the same results as the prescribed Hylatopic. It&#x27;s a great product for the price.</li>
            <li> This lotion is just as good as the hand cream, leaving your body very smooth and silky feeling. It is just a shame that the products are sold in very small bottles. I have to buy several packs for my mom because it runs out quick. Please make larger bottles!</li>
            <li> I get dry patches of skin on my legs that itch like crazy.  So far, this has been the only over-the-counter lotion to keep them from itching terribly and to contribute to their healing.</li>
            <li> The advertising hype got me!  I have dry hands in the winter.  The ads claim this stuff cured a whole village in Alaska of dry hands in winter.  Well, good for them.  Perhaps if I moved to Alaska, it would work for me too.  But in North Carolina, it did not work any better in winter than the various other dozen or so moisturizers I have tried over the last five years.     Still, I have to admit  it must be good for something because it costs so much.  That is sensible, right?  It costs more so it is worth more???    Buyer beware!!!!!</li>
            <li> It seems you cannot purchase this anymore in the stores...so I am glad I can still get this...&lt;br /&gt;This is prescription strength and it really works!</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED THIS BODY LOTION FOR YEARS, BUT THEY HAVE QUIT MAKING IT SO I AM STOCKING UP.&lt;br /&gt;MY THUMBS AND FINGERS EVERY YEAR IN THE WINTER WOULD CRACK AND BLEED NO MATTER WHAT I TRYED. I BOUGHT SOME OF THIS LOTION AND STARTED APPLYING IT EVERY NIGHT AND NO MORE CRACKING OR BLEEDING.&lt;br /&gt;IF I DON&#x27;T APPLY IT FOR 3 OR 4 DAYS THEY START CRACKING AGAIN, IT REALLY IS AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ONLY HAVE TO USE IT IN THE WINTER; AND THATS GOOD, BECAUSE THEY HAVE QUIT MAKING IT.  SO BUY IT UP IF YOU CAN FIND IT.&lt;br /&gt;LINDA</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been hard to find this in the stores so I was pleased to be able to order it through Amazon. Good for very dry skin and absorbs pretty quickly. I would definitely recommend using this.</li>
            <li> My preschool-aged son gets horrible dry skin in the winter.  I have tried several lotions to no avail (both baby and regular lotions).  I even tried vitamin E oil mixed with a lotion per his pediatrician&#x27;s recommendation - messy but not very helpful.  Within three days of using this lotion at night and before getting dressed in the morning, his skin is REMARKABLY smoother and he is not scratching at all anymore.  It absorbs well into his skin and is somehow not greasy despite is viscosity.  It definitely made my baby feel better; I&#x27;ll keep buying this lotion for him.</li>
            <li> Ordered this product by mistake but have no regrets. Bottle size is easy to handle and lotion goes on and absorbs quickly. Found to be a great substitute for the Intensive Rescue CLINICAL THERAPY.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion I have ever used for my dry skin.  Lasts 24 hours!  Just wish it was available in stores, also.</li>
            <li> Good product but hard to find locally.  Walgreens and CVS no longer stock.  This was a good price.  Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Wish it wasn&#x27;t discontinued and would continue to buy it.  My stash is running low but too expensive since no longer making.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love, this product.  I just wish they didn&#x27;t discontinue it.  I haven&#x27;t found anything that works for me like this product does.</li>
            <li> I started using this on my dermatologist&#x27;s recommendation.  It feels great, no fragrance and seems to be more effective than many of the more frou-frou lotions I&#x27;ve tried.  The package is also tidy--a squeeze bottle as opposed to a jar.  The transaction from the Amazon vendor is easy--sometimes the product is hard to find in local drug stores.  Happy with the product and service.</li>
            <li> I paid a premium but it is worth it.  Why did they stop making this?</li>
            <li> Would of rated this 5 stars, but really didn&#x27;t need 3 bottles that all expire on the same date.  Only use this lotion on my face so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion!  Recently it has become impossible to find in the drugstores, etc.  Found it on Amazon and was thrilled.  My niece, who is a nurse anethetist and her nursing friends, swear by this.  They also cannot find it in the stores.  Don&#x27;t know what the problem is.  Everyone received a three-pack for Christmas.  Spread the word!</li>
            <li> I have tried many hand lotions with no good results.  A friend told me about this, and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Great for dry cracked hands.  Does not wash off right away. I can see results in 7 days when applying it a few times a day.  The best I have found but very hard to find.</li>
            <li> used to buy at walmart, not sure if they are not making this anymore, so if you get a chance, buy it!! not greasy!! wonderful product!!</li>
            <li> WHEN I FIRST STARTED USING THIS PRODUCT IT SEEMED TO BE OK BUT AS TIME WENT ON MY HANDS STARTED TO GET DRYER AND I HAD TO USE THE LOTION MUCH MORE THEN AT THE BEGINNING.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great for chapped hands!  It is non-greasy and absorbs in a minute or two.  You can even wash your hands and it doesn&#x27;t wash off.  It is a must purchase for the cold and flu season.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores and no other lotion does hydrates as well without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> This product has been discontinued for a while but it is the only one I found that works as well.  It is still in date but supplies will probably be used up soon.  Too bad, it works real good.</li>
            <li> Of course a lot of people have a hard time finding a moisturizer that actually works. I get eczema on my chest, neck, ears, chin &amp; eyes, so I am in constant search of a non-prescription cream. This stuff works better at preventing the worst of it than the prescription cream I use. I haven&#x27;t had a bad outbreak since I started using this. The best part is that I can use it on my face with no side effects like clogged pores &amp; acne outbreaks. I only need to use vaseline at night &amp; only very minimally. It&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
