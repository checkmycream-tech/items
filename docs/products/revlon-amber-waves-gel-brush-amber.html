            <li>And I don&#x27;t know what size gel they&#x27;re talking about, but it didn&#x27;t fit in my gel container.</li>
            <li>It brushes the edges smooth.</li>

            <li>The brush works pretty well.</li>
            <li>The brush is used exactly for that your edges.</li>
            <li>My first brush like this</li>
            <li>I love the fact that the brush is small and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Received the brushes and they&#x27;re better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really grab my hair the way I want it to.</li>

            <li>Very sturdy brush especially for using Hicks Edge Control.</li>
            <li>My hair is natural and this brush smoothed my edges without adding water or products.</li>
            <li>The stiff bristles and the shape of the brush definitely help you smooth and style your hair.</li>
            <li>I suppose the narrow size would be useful too, but I have yet to dip it into a jar.</li>
            <li>My edges were laid for a few minutes, but after that, they were right back lifted.</li>
            <li>This smooths just enough and doesn&#x27;t mess up the whole look of your hair style.</li>

            <li> This smooths just enough and doesn&#x27;t mess up the whole look of your hair style.</li>
            <li> The bristle are that much harder, so it really smoothes down my edges before I even use any product with it.  </li>
            <li> The brush was dry rotted or something because it broke into pieces the same day I received it.</li>
            <li> My only qualm is that I do with it Deere a harder bristled brush</li>
            <li> The bristles are hard but they are soft enough to not do damage to your hair.</li>
            <li> The bristles are rough</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend using it on soaking wet hair though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like any other brush.</li>
            <li> It works wonders for dealing with my rough edges!</li>
            <li> Just to explain a little.  </li>
            <li> I expected it to be hard</li>
            <li> Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Helps slick down my edges.</li>
            <li> It also is really tough on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have broken bristles in my hair.</li>
            <li> I thought I was crazy for buying another brush.</li>

            <li> Yaaaaassssssss!!!! Edges LAID!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural curly girl and this brush is great for smoothing my edges.  I love the fact that the brush is small and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The brush was soft  I expected it to be hard but it wasn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Not that great a little to narrow.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush for your edges. I use it as directed and my hair lays down very smoothly.</li>
            <li> Do not buy!!! I never leave reviews but this item was horrible. The brush was dry rotted or something because it broke into pieces the same day I received it. It literally crumbled in my hand after use. I have broken bristles in my hair.</li>
            <li> Received the brushes and they&#x27;re better than I expected. It&#x27;s perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> I have very course 4c natural hair. This brush did not work at all. It&#x27;s just like any other brush. My edges were laid for a few minutes, but after that, they were right back lifted. And I don&#x27;t know what size gel they&#x27;re talking about, but it didn&#x27;t fit in my gel container. Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> The brush works pretty well. My only qualm is that I do with it Deere a harder bristled brush but outherwise it serves it&#x27;s ourpose.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy brush especially for using Hicks Edge Control. It brushes the edges smooth. The bristles are rough so it&#x27;s not for necessarily brushing your hair 100 times but for gel or edge control it fits the bill.</li>
            <li> Love this brush not to hard not to soft just right. Helps slick down my edges.</li>
            <li> I know this brush is supposed to be used with gel for styling, but I use it as teasing brush instead.</li>
            <li> I use this to smooth out my edges with edge control.  Perfect.</li>
            <li> This brush works great with pulling my daughter&#x27;s hair back into a ponytail and smooth ing in edge gel.</li>

            <li> I thought I was crazy for buying another brush. It didn&#x27;t seem much different from one I already have.  Boy was I wrong!  This brush is awesome.  The bristle are that much harder, so it really smoothes down my edges before I even use any product with it.  I suppose the narrow size would be useful too, but I have yet to dip it into a jar.</li>
