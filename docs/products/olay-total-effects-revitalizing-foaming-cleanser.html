            <li>I love the way these wipes &amp;#34;suds up&amp;#34; when water is applied.</li>
            <li>I have been using the 4 in 1 Olay Washcloths for years and love them.  </li>
            <li>Who could ask for more.</li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>These are more like using a washcloth with suds - doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes when I remove eye make-up either.  </li>
            <li>Love these cloths but a bit pricey.  </li>

            <li>Love the way my face feels.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad Amazon still has these.</li>
            <li>I used get purchase them from Target, but Amazon is got better price now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these cloths for years and love them.  </li>
            <li>Being dry cloths, they are excellent for travel.</li>

            <li>it lathers beautifully and deep cleans your skin.</li>
            <li>They have really gone up in price, so I saw these as an Amazon add-on at an amazing price and decided to give them a try.  </li>
            <li>These are OK, I guess and do a good job at removing mascara, but don&#x27;t really produce much lather.</li>
            <li>Skin feels smooth and clean after using.  </li>
            <li>I leaves my face feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>These are perfect for my skin that is finally transitioning from oily, acne-prone to normal.</li>
            <li>you feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>these cloths clean well and leave skin feeling fresh and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>They are textured so they are also an great gentle daily scrub.</li>
            <li>They are convenience, quick and get the job well done.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I really love them and highly recommend for anyone.</li>
            <li>excellent product, really cleans the face very well,very soapy when wet and two side one is smooth and the other is like scrubbing your face gently and also the scent is pleasant.</li>
            <li>They seem to have more product, as far as a creamy lather.  </li>
            <li>The morning after, my skin feels really soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for 3 years and it really makes a difference to the quality of my skin, love this product, really fights 7 signs of aging</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use them as my daily cleaning but mostly for quick pick-ups and travel.  </li>
            <li>I also like that they are dry to begin with and lather up with warm water.</li>
            <li>These cloths are great for traveling but really hard to find..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using them since they first came out, and will continue to do so</li>
            <li>Actually, I like them much more than the pre-moistened types.  </li>
            <li>Compared to the Oil of Olay cleansing cloths for oily skin, Total Effects lathers more and lasts longer.  </li>
            <li>They are sudsy at first, but there is no sting.</li>
            <li>I love these facial clothes.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE these cleansing cloths and have a hard time finding them in the store so I am glad I found them at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>They leave your face feeling  squeaky clean and soft.</li>
            <li>It works better than Olay 4-in-1 wash cloths, removes makeup as it should without feeling dry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle on my skin, meaning it doesn&#x27;t dry it out or cause it to create more oil.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I really wish I had not bought 3 months worth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I think they remove makeup very well and exfoliate skin.  </li>
            <li>Nothing to write home about and at the end of the day very wasteful.</li>
            <li>AND I REALLY LIKE THEM.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling clean but not dry.  </li>
            <li>It is sudsy and gentle on my face.</li>
            <li>This product is extremely gentle.</li>
            <li>I think the other line exfoliates better, too.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t make me break out like so many other products do.  </li>
            <li>Hand towel apply dirt back on your face, these allow you to have a truly clean face each day.</li>
            <li>My dark spots have faded, and my skin tone is more even.</li>
            <li>I love Olay products, but this one was too harsh for my skin and way too soapy.</li>
            <li>and i get 3 facial washings from one cloth!...very economical...</li>
            <li>(Could easily be cut in half or fourths.)  </li>
            <li>I have always use Oil of Olay in some form or fashion but this is my first time trying the Total Effects cleansing cloths.  </li>
            <li>However, they must be the TOTAL EFFECTS DAILY CLEANSING cloths--no other Olay versions work as well at maintaining a fresh layer of smooth skin on your face.</li>
            <li>I love these little individual towelettes with soap.</li>
            <li>These have really improved the overall look and feel of my over-40 skin.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and revitalized.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t as soft as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>These cloths are the only cleansing product I need to use, followed by a decent moisturizer.</li>
            <li>They leave no detectable residue behind, just a soft, lightly moisturized effect, even in the hardest of water.</li>
            <li>I cut them in half but still too much product in the cloth.</li>

            <li> I will be going back to the other line, as long as Amazon carries them.</li>
            <li> They left my face feel a little bit dry after washing, but nothing can&#x27;t fix by a facial serum and night cream.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin or irritate.</li>
            <li> I then rinse them out, rinse my face and wipe again to remove all traces and dry my face.  </li>
            <li> It left my skin tight and dry feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to start cutting them in half to create more of a supply.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and you can&#x27;t even see my rough patches.</li>
            <li> Not as harsh as other facial cloths I have used.  </li>
            <li> I ordered two boxes but a half of a sheet will do the job.</li>
            <li> I cut these in half to stretch them and use them when traveling, or when I just need to remove makeup.  </li>
            <li> The Olay Total Effects cleansing cloths are just the ticket for a serious, but not too abrasive, exfoliating treatment.</li>
            <li> and then  it&#x27;s messy when you have to wash the product off with lots of water.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday and youll see a difference</li>
            <li> I like these cloths and have been using them for a few years.  </li>
            <li> I find that if I go without them (if I can&#x27;t find them in stock anywhere), my face begins to rebel and seems to get a dead cell build-up which can erupt into a breakout.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this was a knock of for not.</li>
            <li> However, I would prefer it to be a little less expensive.</li>
            <li> They are also getting hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I hate the wet cloths</li>
            <li> Olay...how can you go wrong...</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I love Olay products, but this one was too harsh for my skin and way too soapy. It left my skin tight and dry feeling. I cut them in half but still too much product in the cloth. Not what I thought as you have to use a lot water to get the lather going and then  it&#x27;s messy when you have to wash the product off with lots of water.</li>
            <li> I have been using oil of olay for years its good for my skin</li>
            <li> I love these cloths. They leave no detectable residue behind, just a soft, lightly moisturized effect, even in the hardest of water. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these cloths.  I&#x27;ve been using them since they first came out, and will continue to do so</li>
            <li> I carry these in my travel bag so I do not get makeup on rags when I travel. They are very handy</li>
            <li> Ample suds - leaves you feeling clean.  (Could easily be cut in half or fourths.)  Great for at home or while traveling on the road.</li>
            <li> Great buy. Does all it say it will. Shrink pores and look younger. Try it . Use it everyday and youll see a difference</li>
            <li> I love the way these wipes &amp;#34;suds up&amp;#34; when water is applied. They leave your face feeling  squeaky clean and soft.</li>
            <li> These things are made for the perfectionist. Hand towel apply dirt back on your face, these allow you to have a truly clean face each day. Lots of cleanser in them I&#x27;m going to start cutting them in half to create more of a supply. I ordered two boxes but a half of a sheet will do the job. My face looks and feels great. I have eczema and you can&#x27;t even see my rough patches.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this was a knock of for not. No copyright on package.</li>
            <li> Works great- nice lather. Nice to use when traveling</li>
            <li> I have been using the 4 in 1 Olay Washcloths for years and love them.  They have really gone up in price, so I saw these as an Amazon add-on at an amazing price and decided to give them a try.  I actually thought I was upgrading my skin care, since they were in the total effects line. I really wish I had not bought 3 months worth.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the 4-1 line.  They seem to have more product, as far as a creamy lather.  These are OK, I guess and do a good job at removing mascara, but don&#x27;t really produce much lather. I think the other line exfoliates better, too. I will be going back to the other line, as long as Amazon carries them. They are also getting hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> These cloths are really nice. Just add water and you get a lather to wash your face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is great and the product ingredients are pure. Who could ask for more. These cloths are a solid material where the regular Olay cloths are vented. They are both great products.</li>
            <li> I use these to take whenI travel.  They are convenient and work well</li>
            <li> I LOVE these cleansing cloths and have a hard time finding them in the store so I am glad I found them at Amazon.  They are the perfect thing for cleaning your face at the end of the day and there is a surprising amount of cleanser in each cloth.  They are textured so they are also an great gentle daily scrub.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the cloths for years and I love them. I just wish they start back selling them in the store.</li>
            <li> These are GREAT!!!  I use them in the shower for a &amp;#34;disposable washcloth&amp;#34;.  Not as harsh as other facial cloths I have used.  I also like that they are dry to begin with and lather up with warm water.</li>
            <li> I like these cloths and have been using them for a few years.  Actually, I like them much more than the pre-moistened types.  These are more like using a washcloth with suds - doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes when I remove eye make-up either.  It just feels cleaner and the cloth offers a little exfoliation too.</li>
            <li> These have really improved the overall look and feel of my over-40 skin. My dark spots have faded, and my skin tone is more even. I have combination skin (still, at my age!), and this has helped even it out. Great product.</li>
            <li> Love these cloths but a bit pricey.  I think they remove makeup very well and exfoliate skin.  Skin feels smooth and clean after using.  Will definitely buy again.  Doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin or irritate.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years with total satisfaction. However, I would prefer it to be a little less expensive.</li>
            <li> Use  Olay Total Effects cloths mornings and nights. It leaves my skin soft and revitalized. Will definitely recommend to a friend</li>
            <li> I love these convenient cleansing cloths for traveling or nightly use, leaves skin clean and taut. Convenient order from Amazon with great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always use and love Olay 4-in-1 wash cloths. They are convenience, quick and get the job well done. They left my face feel a little bit dry after washing, but nothing can&#x27;t fix by a facial serum and night cream. However, when I stumbled upon Olay Total Effects Lathering Cleansing Cloths, I know I have to make the switch. It works better than Olay 4-in-1 wash cloths, removes makeup as it should without feeling dry. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love that these pads remove all my make-up and leaves my skin clean.</li>
            <li> Olay...how can you go wrong...have a number of their products and never bought this one...very pleasant to use...and i get 3 facial washings from one cloth!...very economical...el fed</li>
            <li> I have always use Oil of Olay in some form or fashion but this is my first time trying the Total Effects cleansing cloths.  I&#x27;m in love with them.  It feels like you are giving yourself a mini facial every time you use them.  Compared to the Oil of Olay cleansing cloths for oily skin, Total Effects lathers more and lasts longer.  I feel as though my skin can breathe.  It&#x27;s gentle on my skin, meaning it doesn&#x27;t dry it out or cause it to create more oil.  Perfect.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for my skin that is finally transitioning from oily, acne-prone to normal. They lathered easily and it was easy to rinse. The morning after, my skin feels really soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get these locally anymore, and they&#x27;re my go-to for my evening cleansing ritual.</li>
            <li> Convenient and easy to use to cleanse your face .  Just add water . Could not be easier to use especially on a trip .</li>
            <li> Great item.  Love the way my face feels.</li>
            <li> These work well in a pinch but I definitely wouldn&#x27;t use them every day. They aren&#x27;t as soft as I&#x27;d like. I imagine it&#x27;s because of the cleanser on the cloths. They do smell really good and were good for my trip.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 years and it really makes a difference to the quality of my skin, love this product, really fights 7 signs of aging</li>
            <li> I cut these in half to stretch them and use them when traveling, or when I just need to remove makeup.  They are sudsy at first, but there is no sting. I then rinse them out, rinse my face and wipe again to remove all traces and dry my face.  I think they are convenient, work well to remove makeup, and travel well. Sometimes you can even reuse them once.</li>
            <li> These cloths are great for traveling but really hard to find.. I hate the wet cloths so I&#x27;m glad Amazon still has these.</li>
            <li> So luxurious! it lathers beautifully and deep cleans your skin. it moisturizes as it cleans, so my skin always looks more beautiful after using them. I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> This is so far the best cleansing that I have used. I used get purchase them from Target, but Amazon is got better price now.</li>
            <li> Nothing to write home about and at the end of the day very wasteful.</li>
            <li> Great product... very much worth the price.</li>
            <li> I GOT WHAT I ORDERED. I HAVE USED THESE BEFORE AND I REALLY LIKE THEM. I WILL ORDER THEM AGAIN.</li>
            <li> My wife loves these things and finds them to be a superior product. No offense to Amazon, but she wishes she could buy them in the store.</li>
            <li> The Olay Total Effects cleansing cloths are just the ticket for a serious, but not too abrasive, exfoliating treatment. I find that if I go without them (if I can&#x27;t find them in stock anywhere), my face begins to rebel and seems to get a dead cell build-up which can erupt into a breakout. These cloths are the only cleansing product I need to use, followed by a decent moisturizer. However, they must be the TOTAL EFFECTS DAILY CLEANSING cloths--no other Olay versions work as well at maintaining a fresh layer of smooth skin on your face. I really love them and highly recommend for anyone.</li>
            <li> very good face product,,  its a perfect cleanser, exfoliate, and a face wash.. perfect for travel,,, i love olay products.. thank you..</li>
            <li> these cloths clean well and leave skin feeling fresh and moisturized.  I don&#x27;t use them as my daily cleaning but mostly for quick pick-ups and travel.  This is a very good price as I&#x27;ve compared prices in retail stores.</li>
            <li> I love these cleansing cloths, they do a very good job of removing makeup and leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized. Being dry cloths, they are excellent for travel.</li>
            <li> I have used these cloths for years and can&#x27;t find them in the stores anymore.  It leaves my skin feeling clean but not dry.  They are a must when traveling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these cloths for years and love them.  They don&#x27;t make me break out like so many other products do.  I cut the sheets into fourths so they last a long time!</li>
            <li> I had difficulty finding this product at the stores I shop at.  This was a great find!  I leaves my face feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love these facial clothes.  It is sudsy and gentle on my face. I will order monthly.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.I use this product daily and appreciate having an ample supply on hand without running to store.</li>
            <li> I have been using them for a while and like them</li>
            <li> I love these little individual towelettes with soap. They lather well and one side can be used to exfoliate or get all the lipstick off:-)&lt;br /&gt;The product arrive before the estimated delivery. SO I would use Preferred Mart again.</li>
            <li> excellent product, really cleans the face very well,very soapy when wet and two side one is smooth and the other is like scrubbing your face gently and also the scent is pleasant.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wash my face with anything else. This product is extremely gentle. I have rosacea. This product improves my skin, makes my pores smaller, and helps reduce pigment. It never causes redness. I love it!</li>
