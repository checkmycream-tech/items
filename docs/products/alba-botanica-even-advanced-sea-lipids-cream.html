            <li>I can&#x27;t believe all the complaints on the smell it is a clean refreshing scent.</li>

            <li>This is my own personal experience.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s truly absorbed.</li>
            <li>that I&#x27;m making a living selling hot dogs in a strip club.</li>
            <li>I go through these bottles incredibly fast!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m running out of hot dogs, and patience.</li>
            <li>I also enjoy the enzyme scrub in the same line, and I use this a few times per week with great results.</li>
            <li>Now my skin is smooth and clear, and people are amazed when I tell them my real age.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier to buy things now</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s pretty thick, smells nice, and I do think it improves my skin texture and tone.</li>

            <li> I have very sensitive combination skin and other creams I&#x27;ve used have irritated my skin, caused breakouts, and turned my face into an oily, greasy mess.</li>
            <li> As long as they produce it, I will use it!</li>
            <li> I have combination dry skin</li>
            <li> It goes on thick enough to really moisturize my face without being too heavy.</li>
            <li> Great product but awful shipping.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Smell is sickening.  Did nothing for my skin.  I use it on my feet now.</li>
            <li> Love this cream. Also clears skin</li>
            <li> Love this cream. Has made a noticeable difference on my skin. Even hubby noticed ! Makes skin silky soft.using it on neck and arms too because I love it so much</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Just ordered my second jar (which is UNHEARD OF for me - I&#x27;m a chronic product-trier). It&#x27;s pretty thick, smells nice, and I do think it improves my skin texture and tone. It&#x27;s never caused any discomfort, it&#x27;s just a good soothing cream with a nice smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually use it with my foundation in the mornings now too, to make a customized tinted moisturizer. It makes the foundation go on real smooth and blends in well for a nice non-flaky finish.</li>
            <li> Great product! great price at amazon.&lt;br /&gt;i used to buy them at whole foods but amazon has better prices.&lt;br /&gt;it doesnt leave your skin oily.&lt;br /&gt;i use it everyday and am happy with this</li>
            <li> has helped even out my skin tone</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer ever</li>
            <li> Every time we shop in assorted stores in US cities she looks for this product. Now we found it on-line we will buy this way in future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently left an Amish community so I could use Alba Botanica&#x27;s Night Cream, and now I&#x27;ve tried their Daily Cream. It&#x27;s much easier to buy things now that I&#x27;m making a living selling hot dogs in a strip club. The salt in the sweat of my customers used dry up my facial skin, but rubbing this on after my morning shower solves the problem! Today I met a black person. I&#x27;m definitely very grateful that God created Alba Botanica. I go through these bottles incredibly fast! Sometimes, I lay awake at night imaging my mother crying about never seeing me again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish the product were cheaper. I&#x27;m running out of hot dogs, and patience.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It makes my skin soft and bright. I have combination dry skin and it really moisturizes my skin without making it look oily and greasy.</li>
            <li> This is the only face cream I will use.  I never break out and get lots of comments how great my skin looks.  As long as they produce it, I will use it!</li>
            <li> Great value.  I have used it for years.</li>
            <li> A lighter version of the Even Advanced night cream.  Smells nice, absorbs well, doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy at all.  I&#x27;ve been using the two creams for about 4 months now and have noticed improved skin tone and texture. Love love love this product and Alba&#x27;s line.</li>
            <li> Love it. This is a light moisturizer that my skin loves. However, it is not moisturizing enough for my very dry skin during the dry New England winters so I use the night Cream during this season. However, this cream started it all. My very picky, Sefora loving sister converted to this cream. Even my boyfriend uses it on a daily basis!  Before using this line of product my skin was a little angry. Now my skin is smooth and clear, and people are amazed when I tell them my real age. I highly recommend this affordable miracle product!  I also enjoy the enzyme scrub in the same line, and I use this a few times per week with great results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years now and I really love it. It goes on thick enough to really moisturize my face without being too heavy. The smell is pleasant and not too strong. I also like that the ingredients are great (no parabens, etc.) The container lasts me quite a while. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m putting two stars because I have combination skin and all it did was make my nose greasy and did not clean my pores. This is my own personal experience.</li>
            <li> Nice light texture. Great to wear under makeup.</li>
            <li> The only moisturizer that works for my skin without causing break outs. It is not anti aging though.</li>
            <li> This is the only moisturizer I will ever use on my face. I have very sensitive combination skin and other creams I&#x27;ve used have irritated my skin, caused breakouts, and turned my face into an oily, greasy mess. This one leaves my skin feeling soft and looking great. It has a light consistency and feels more like a lotion than a cream. It smells fantastic too.</li>
            <li> What can I say but this is great cream.  Price beats buying it in our local stores.</li>
            <li> Irritating for my skin.</li>
            <li> This has a nice scent to it. It is a light moisturizer which is great for warm weather. I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference in my complexion after one week. It is still too soon to get a good result.</li>
            <li> Great product but awful shipping. Product had spilled/opened inside the box, losing several applications.</li>
            <li> this is a great cream! I love the smell I can&#x27;t believe all the complaints on the smell it is a clean refreshing scent. I give credit to Alba Botanica I have used the peel&#x27;s cleansers and face washes and all have been awesome for my sensitive, adult acne prone skin.  Now my teenagers are using it too!!!</li>
            <li> I have to admit, I&#x27;m partial to Alba products. I use this over Day to Day vitamin C serum, and find it absorbs quickly and truly moisturizes.. Some day creams tend to just lie on the surface and roll off when you attempt to apply foundation. This one doesn&#x27;t and I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s truly absorbed. Will definitely stick with it.</li>
            <li> The consistency appears a bit goopy, not very creamy. But I actually love how it feels once its on.&lt;br /&gt;Love the smell. Its light weight and goes on well. I am able to wear it under my foundation.</li>
            <li> works well...great product! not greasy or oily!</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, use this cream as a matting agent. It is ideally struggling with excess sebum. I will be ordering more because for me he is irreplaceable.</li>
            <li> I am sad to say i am unable to use this product due to the scent. I reacted almosy instantly :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving it 3 stars because the when I opened the box after receiving  it  there was product all I&#x27;ve the outside of the container. There was still a lot of product in the container when I opened it so it&#x27;s not that big of a deal. Also the sent is kind of strong it reminded me of a men&#x27;s deodorant and I didn&#x27;t really like that. But I will say that I have been using it for a couple of days and my skin feels smooth and seem brighter so I will continue to use this.</li>
