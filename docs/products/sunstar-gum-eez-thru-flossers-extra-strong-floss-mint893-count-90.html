            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve been flossing for a couple years, I prefer thinner flossers, so that it reaches into more nooks &amp; crannies, like between my gums &amp; teeth.</li>
            <li>-Thru Flossers use a type of floss which slides between teeth more smoothly, and doesn&#x27;t shred as easily.  </li>
            <li>What I like about this product is that glides easily in/out between teeth which are close together.</li>
            <li>Excellent quality for someone with tight teeth.</li>
            <li>Since then, that&#x27;s all that I&#x27;ve used, as I find them much easier to manipulate than the kind on a roll.</li>
            <li>Most flossing tools are strung with \\&quot;normal\\&quot; type dental floss, which is fine for most people, but not for those with teeth that are really close together, or have fillings that shred normal floss.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> A number of years ago, my dental hygienist introduced me to the concept of floss on a handle (I think she actually gave me a dinosaur shpaed one to try!). Since then, that&#x27;s all that I&#x27;ve used, as I find them much easier to manipulate than the kind on a roll. I&#x27;ve tried a number of different brands, and prefer the Gum brand, but have had problems finding it locally. I was happy to find it on Amazon. This is so much simpler than constantly searching through different stores for it.</li>
            <li> Have used these for several years and have not found anything else as good. I highly recommend. Prompt shipper. Excellent quality for someone with tight teeth.</li>
            <li> These flossers actually make flossing an easy and pleasurable task.  They have a subtle fresh mint flavor, glide between my teeth easily and are very convenient.</li>
            <li> Thin and strong to get between the teeth.</li>
            <li> I love these tooth pick cum Flosser thing and have been buying for years. Does the job very well.</li>
            <li> Good product. Never liked flossing with the traditional spool of floss. These are great, easy to use, and make me not mind flossing. Can be taken on the go for when you need to pick something out of your teeth while out and about.</li>
            <li> Strong and net all requirements to effectively clean my teeth.  I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST and strongest floss I&#x27;ve ever tried</li>
            <li> The floss product does an excellent job at doing what it is primarily designed to do, floss between teeth. The plastic handle is hard and the pick end can be hazardous due to being quite sharp especially if you use this product while in a moving vehicle of any type. If you are a chewer like I am the plastic is likely to break into shards that could be swallowed accidentally.</li>
            <li> This is a branded item so it&#x27;s exactly as I thought it would be. Does a good job on the kids teeth. Saved me a trip to the grocery store.</li>
            <li> What I like about this product is that glides easily in/out between teeth which are close together. The white silky floss is the key here. Other similar products have stringy floss which breaks or gets stuck between teeth. The wide U shaped head makes it easy to reach teeth in the back of the mouth.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this type.  I a left-handed, and it is difficult for more to use floss with only my fingers.  My teeth feel like I&lt;br /&gt;really got food particles out from between my teeth.</li>
            <li> I have been looking all over for these.  Walgreens no longer carries them and told me that the manufacture was not longer making them.</li>
            <li> These are the only brand of flossers that my girlfriend and I can use. They are thin enough to fit easily between my teeth, and strong enough to last an entire flossing with just one. Also, they don&#x27;t give you that &amp;#34;nails on a chalkboard&amp;#34; feeling.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Not the best of these kinds of flossers but gets the job done for removing stubborn after meal bits. Cheap enough to keep a pack around.</li>
            <li> i have a few problem areas in between my teeth that just rips regular flossers &amp; floss apart.&lt;br /&gt;With regulars, I go through 4 flossers, usually to give my mouth a once-over.&lt;br /&gt;With these, I can do several all-mouth routines  using just one (sanitizing the flosser in between of course).&lt;br /&gt;Extremely sturdy floss that keeps it tightness throughout use. If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going for, it&#x27;s hard to go wrong with these.</li>
            <li> I like the convenience of it, and that I don&#x27;t have to touch the yuky floss, but the floss frequently breaks before the job is done.</li>
            <li> I use these everyday.</li>
            <li> Pros: very thick and sturdy&lt;br /&gt;Cons: very thick, won&#x27;t reach between gum &amp; teeth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first started flossing, I tried lots of brands.

Now that I&#x27;ve been flossing for a couple years, I prefer thinner flossers, so that it reaches into more nooks &amp; crannies, like between my gums &amp; teeth.</li>
            <li> Most flossing tools are strung with \\&quot;normal\\&quot; type dental floss, which is fine for most people, but not for those with teeth that are really close together, or have fillings that shred normal floss.  For those with problems using regular floss, GUM Eez-Thru Flossers might be a good option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eez-Thru Flossers use a type of floss which slides between teeth more smoothly, and doesn&#x27;t shred as easily.  With some flossers, the floss becomes loose and starts to sag after a couple of passes, but with Eez-Thru&#x27;s, the tension of the floss remains fairly stiff, even after repeated usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eez-Thru Flossers are available with regular or mint flavored floss.  The design of the handle provides a convenient place to grip, and the point at the end of the handle is helpful for removing plaque.  Convenient and easy to use, they are available in various quantities.  While the price for the 90 pack is generally quite reasonable, you might want to check your local drug store for a better deal.</li>
