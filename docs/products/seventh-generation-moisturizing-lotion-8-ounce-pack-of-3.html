            <li>If you love this product, let the company know!</li>
            <li>I think i overpaid for a ok product!</li>
            <li>These are very good for sensitive skin and have all the good ingredients.</li>
            <li>The reviews on Amazon for this product indicated the odor was pleasant and light.</li>
            <li>Very smooth on skin.</li>
            <li>This is ok-</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I tried this twice before deciding I&#x27;d have to continue with CeraVe until finding something better.</li>
            <li>Also, it does not have a strong scent and that is always a plus.</li>
            <li>Light smelling lotion.</li>
            <li>Also, all Seventh Generation products are cruelty free; they do no animal testing.  </li>
            <li>I do not like unscented lotions as such but this works great.</li>
            <li>Your skin will just fee moisturized and will smell clean with no added perfumes.</li>
            <li>It does absorb quickly into your skin and the scent is light.</li>
            <li>It seems to moisturize fairly well, but not any better than other products.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a non-scented or lightly-scented lotion suitable for sensitive skin, and this seemed to fit the bill.</li>
            <li>Soaks into the skin quickly.  </li>
            <li>I generally like nice smelling lotions but in winter I often reach out for these before going to bed.</li>
            <li>all natural lotion I like better.</li>
            <li>It has safe, mostly naturally derived ingredients and no unnatural fragrance.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this Seventh Generation Sensitive Care Lotion.  </li>
            <li>It takes lots of rubbing to be absorbed into the skin, or else it will just sit on top like old sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Lotion easily absorbed without greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It did not cause any reactions to my skin, but I ended up giving all 3 away to my aunt who didn&#x27;t mind the plastic smell and found it moisturized her skin well when used right after her</li>
            <li>This is a huge disappointment as I was thrilled to find such a great product!  </li>
            <li>It went on so easily and without any greasy residue left on the surface of my skin.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very light and not very chamomile-y.</li>
            <li>And, the lotion did not absorb into my skin really.</li>
            <li>It is gentle, creamy and does not irritate the skin at all.  </li>
            <li>It is much thicker than I am used to for lotions..</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like putting too much chemicals on the affected area.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Ok, so, I first bought this in a Target store some time ago and really liked that it was natural, and did not contain artificial fragrance as my skin is sometimes sensitive to lotions, etc.</li>
            <li>thick rich  lotion that leaves my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing, sinks right in and will not leave your skin greasy.  </li>
            <li>So much so that my husband could smell plastic when I was sitting in the back of the minivan with our kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this because it doesn&#x27;t have fragrance in it - or it is natural if it does - so it doesn&#x27;t cause any skin sensitivity issues.  </li>
            <li>This is not what you want on professional clothes in the morning.</li>
            <li>I tried it on my face, near my eyes, and even though it didn&#x27;t get in my eyes, the skin that I had put it on stung quite a lot, for quite a while (30 mins I&#x27;d say).</li>
            <li>This lotion is extremely thick; more like a cream.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion because it is really thick and creamy.</li>
            <li>The chamomile smell is really light and delicate.</li>
            <li>In my latest shipment, the lotion was much thicker than usual, and extremely hard to get out of the bottle.</li>

            <li> I tried using one bottle completely then tossed the other 2.</li>
            <li> does not go on smooth and leaves weird residue and white color on skin.</li>
            <li> Also if I&#x27;m out in the sun for long I get rashes on my skin.</li>
            <li> I guess I mistakenly thought this could be used as a face lotion, even temporarily, but it&#x27;s far too harsh for that.</li>
            <li> The lotion works well for dry winter skin.  </li>
            <li> And they peel off when they dry.</li>
            <li> It takes an eternity to apply, smells slightly medicinal, and leaves a white powdery residue that rubs off on clothes.  </li>
            <li> There are no harmful parabens and there are absolutely no smelly perfumes.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised that this lotion was so creamy and thick.  </li>
            <li> Positives: mild scent, moisturization for sensitive skin, kudos to Seventh Generation company for offering alternatives to chemical-laden skin products&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:  Once container is about half empty, hard plastic makes it difficult to squeeze out lotion.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as an alternative to other moisturizers which continue to do animal testing.  </li>
            <li> Every other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Long story short, the consistency of the lotion must have been compromised by the cold weather because all 3 bottles had lotion inside that would not squeeze out properly.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m just using this on my body, but I find the texture slightly chalky.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I rec&#x27;d a bad or older batch (seems impossible since this product is new to market), but the lotion smelled very much like plastic.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday after shower.</li>
            <li> After a few uses, my skin has a reddish color.</li>
            <li> Bought this to try to save myself some money instead of buying the California Baby which I usually buy.</li>
            <li> Scented lotions usually agitate my skin but this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> really small in size..even with the % off from Amazon</li>
            <li> The bottles are small and the lotion is hard to squeeze out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get out of the bottle and leaves a residue on the skin.</li>
            <li> Thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> moisturizer I have used stinks of perfumes and is very irritating to use on the skin.</li>
            <li> (winter/freezing cold).</li>
            <li> My sister who has extremely bad eczema loves it!</li>

            <li> Bought this to try to save myself some money instead of buying the California Baby which I usually buy. My daughter broke out into a rash. It took me 2 days to realize this was the culprit. Went back to the California Baby and had to pay extra for rush shipping.</li>
            <li> Light smelling lotion. Moisturizes well. I use it everyday after shower. Very smooth on skin. No greasy feeling. Packed well.</li>
            <li> Positives: mild scent, moisturization for sensitive skin, kudos to Seventh Generation company for offering alternatives to chemical-laden skin products&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:  Once container is about half empty, hard plastic makes it difficult to squeeze out lotion.</li>
            <li> Ok, so, I first bought this in a Target store some time ago and really liked that it was natural, and did not contain artificial fragrance as my skin is sometimes sensitive to lotions, etc. So when I ran out, I noticed that target didn&#x27;t carry this anymore, I went on Amazon, and I saw this came in a 3 pack, so I bought it. I think I ordered this in December (winter/freezing cold). Long story short, the consistency of the lotion must have been compromised by the cold weather because all 3 bottles had lotion inside that would not squeeze out properly. It, like, coagulated or something. And, the lotion did not absorb into my skin really. I tried using one bottle completely then tossed the other 2. I no longer use this brand and found another fragrance free/all natural lotion I like better.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a non-scented or lightly-scented lotion suitable for sensitive skin, and this seemed to fit the bill. It has safe, mostly naturally derived ingredients and no unnatural fragrance. The reviews on Amazon for this product indicated the odor was pleasant and light. I am not sure if I rec&#x27;d a bad or older batch (seems impossible since this product is new to market), but the lotion smelled very much like plastic. So much so that my husband could smell plastic when I was sitting in the back of the minivan with our kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did not cause any reactions to my skin, but I ended up giving all 3 away to my aunt who didn&#x27;t mind the plastic smell and found it moisturized her skin well when used right after her shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems like it would be a great product if it didn&#x27;t smell like chemicals/plastic.</li>
            <li> This lotion is extremely thick; more like a cream. It&#x27;s hard to get out of the bottle and leaves a residue on the skin. The scent is very light and not very chamomile-y. Meh. Won&#x27;t be re-ordering.</li>
            <li> In my latest shipment, the lotion was much thicker than usual, and extremely hard to get out of the bottle. Will be returning any future shipments if they are similar to this one.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as an alternative to other moisturizers which continue to do animal testing.  Every other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; moisturizer I have used stinks of perfumes and is very irritating to use on the skin. I absolutely love this Seventh Generation Sensitive Care Lotion.  It is gentle, creamy and does not irritate the skin at all.  It is very moisturizing, sinks right in and will not leave your skin greasy.  There are no harmful parabens and there are absolutely no smelly perfumes.  Your skin will just fee moisturized and will smell clean with no added perfumes. Also, all Seventh Generation products are cruelty free; they do no animal testing.  Unfortunately, any time I find a product I love, I learn the company is discontinuing it.  I just found out from Seventh Generation, they are discontinuing this lotion.  This is a huge disappointment as I was thrilled to find such a great product!  If you love this product, let the company know!</li>
            <li> I bought this because it doesn&#x27;t have fragrance in it - or it is natural if it does - so it doesn&#x27;t cause any skin sensitivity issues.  The lotion works well for dry winter skin.  It is much thicker than I am used to for lotions..</li>
            <li> I was surprised that this lotion was so creamy and thick.  It went on so easily and without any greasy residue left on the surface of my skin.  Seventh Generation scores a hit with this lotion.  Also, it does not have a strong scent and that is always a plus.</li>
            <li> i wanted to give it a chance since i like their products but this is not acceptable. does not go on smooth and leaves weird residue and white color on skin. wouldnt recommend.</li>
            <li> I do not like unscented lotions as such but this works great. I got these in a pack of 3 when they were on sale. I generally like nice smelling lotions but in winter I often reach out for these before going to bed. Also if I&#x27;m out in the sun for long I get rashes on my skin. And they peel off when they dry. During those times I often apply this coz I don&#x27;t feel like putting too much chemicals on the affected area. These are very good for sensitive skin and have all the good ingredients.</li>
            <li> Ironically, my skin doesn&#x27;t like this &amp;#34;sensitve care&amp;#34; lotion. After a few uses, my skin has a reddish color. Since I wasn&#x27;t tolerating it well, I offered it to my coworkers to see if they wanted to give it a shot. They loved it. It does absorb quickly into your skin and the scent is light.</li>
            <li> Thick and creamy. Moisturizes without a greasy feeling.  Soaks into the skin quickly.  My sister who has extremely bad eczema loves it! My mom got jealous so I had to give her my bottle.  You will want to keep this in stock through the winter months!</li>
            <li> This is ok- I don&#x27;t like it enough to justify the price. The bottles are small and the lotion is hard to squeeze out.</li>
            <li> love it. thick rich  lotion that leaves my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> best lotion but damn is it pricy</li>
            <li> We got rid of the remaining bottles of this stuff.  It takes an eternity to apply, smells slightly medicinal, and leaves a white powdery residue that rubs off on clothes.  This is not what you want on professional clothes in the morning.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion because it is really thick and creamy. Scented lotions usually agitate my skin but this one doesn&#x27;t. The chamomile smell is really light and delicate.</li>
            <li> really small in size..even with the % off from Amazon I think i overpaid for a ok product!</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion because it doesn&#x27;t have parabens like the CevaVe and Lubriderm I&#x27;ve been using. I tried it on my face, near my eyes, and even though it didn&#x27;t get in my eyes, the skin that I had put it on stung quite a lot, for quite a while (30 mins I&#x27;d say). I tried this twice before deciding I&#x27;d have to continue with CeraVe until finding something better. I guess I mistakenly thought this could be used as a face lotion, even temporarily, but it&#x27;s far too harsh for that. So I&#x27;m just using this on my body, but I find the texture slightly chalky. It takes lots of rubbing to be absorbed into the skin, or else it will just sit on top like old sunscreen. It seems to moisturize fairly well, but not any better than other products.</li>
            <li> Very good fragrance...not overbearing.  Lotion easily absorbed without greasy feeling.  Softens hands and arms.  Excellent for feet and ankles.  Highly recommend.</li>
