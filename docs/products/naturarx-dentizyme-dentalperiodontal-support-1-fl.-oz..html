            <li>Best thing I EVER brushed my teeth with!!!  </li>

            <li>wish I could love this product because of the great essential oils in it...</li>
            <li>This is a great product I noticed a major improvement in my gums within two weeks.  </li>
            <li>Clears up tender gums quickly!</li>
            <li>My little nephew likes it because it tastes good and makes his gums feel good.  </li>
            <li>I bought this glorious, clean product while out of town</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s a little pricy per bottle, BUT it sure beats having dental bills!! :)</li>
            <li>Received but haven&#x27;t used enough to form a real opinion - first impression in very good!</li>
            <li>And it would cost a whole lot more.  </li>

            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but I really like it!  </li>
            <li>I really like it, makes my teeth and gums feels cleaner than brushing alone.</li>
            <li>and since I couldnt find it in my whole foods, I ordered a refill here...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li>This product works well for anyone who wants a fresher mouth.</li>
            <li>I use it to clean my dental retainer - it doesn&#x27;t wear down or damage the plastic, as normal toothpaste does, and it does a better job of actually cleaning the plastic than toothpaste.</li>
            <li>This product is the real deal - real, natural ingredients and real, solid results.  </li>
            <li>So far my dentist can&#x27;t tell the difference.</li>
            <li>If your teeth are sensitive to sugar, this product can cause a reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Teeth can be fixed, capped, etc but gum disease needs to be avoided at all costs.  </li>
            <li>When I came back the following week for my first cleaning in years..</li>
            <li>The reviews are correct, this stuff is awesome, and even though it&#x27;s a little pricey for a small bottle, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>Only to have it arrive, bottle chipped, oozing liquid and completely empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have completely sworn off regular toothpaste forever.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s all natural, and relatively inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>6 months later, the stains are still gone and I barely use anything but toothpaste now.</li>
            <li>I bought a relatively cheap rechargeable electric toothbrush for kids at Walmart (Oral B Pro Health Jr) because the adult version was just expensive, then used a daily regimen of combining several products - StaiNo Tooth Stain Eraser to rub problem areas directly, brushed with Plus White Xtra Whitening Toothpaste, then brushed with Eucryl Smokers Toothpowder for an abrasive, rinsed with Nature&#x27;s Answer Complete Oral Care PerioWash, and then brushed my gums and gum line with NaturaRx Dentizyme drops.</li>

            <li> Although I take EXCELLENT care of my teeth (I love teeth and used to be in the dental field) I had issues with multiple cavities and excess lingual calculus (tartar) buildup at the gumline. I started using this after researching  the effects (negative) of fluoride. I went to the dentist for my usual checkup about 4.5 months later after starting (*did not use any other toothpaste) and didn&#x27;t have  a single cavity. I thought, \\&quot;Great!...but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a fluke\\&quot;....Well, it&#x27;s been 2 years since I started using Dentizyme and I&#x27;ve had no need of fillings since I started. I also have noticed (and also my hygenist) that I have little, if any, calculus  buildup. I know it&#x27;s a little pricy per bottle, BUT it sure beats having dental bills!! :)</li>
            <li> I picked this up because I&#x27;ve been looking for a toothpaste that doesn&#x27;t come in a plastic tube.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but I really like it!  It leaves my teeth and mouth feeling fresh and clean, and tastes pretty decent.  So far my dentist can&#x27;t tell the difference.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Tasty, more pleasant to use than toothpaste and gets teeth squeeky clean. A little pricey but lasts a long time. Glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a great product I noticed a major improvement in my gums within two weeks.  The only downfall at all is it&#x27;s in a glass bottle and I&#x27;m a clutz. I broke mine in week three.  it&#x27;s fairly pricey so I have to wait to order again but I definitely will.</li>
            <li> Flavor isn&#x27;t bad. I really like it, makes my teeth and gums feels cleaner than brushing alone. Also helps some with toothaches. My story - I bought a relatively cheap rechargeable electric toothbrush for kids at Walmart (Oral B Pro Health Jr) because the adult version was just expensive, then used a daily regimen of combining several products - StaiNo Tooth Stain Eraser to rub problem areas directly, brushed with Plus White Xtra Whitening Toothpaste, then brushed with Eucryl Smokers Toothpowder for an abrasive, rinsed with Nature&#x27;s Answer Complete Oral Care PerioWash, and then brushed my gums and gum line with NaturaRx Dentizyme drops. This was all to remove embarrassing dark brown stains along my gum line caused by years of smoking, coffee, tea, and soda.. that I thought was decay. My dentist verified this as being decay and said there was no way to remove it, but I was determined. I can&#x27;t say exactly which products did the job, as I bought everything I could find with a great review and used them all at once.. but the lines were deep stains, and the stains were gone in a matter of days using these products. When I came back the following week for my first cleaning in years.. I also had almost no plaque left, other than a small amount between my teeth. Fastest cleaning ever.. 6 months later, the stains are still gone and I barely use anything but toothpaste now. Amazing, and I&#x27;m no longer embarrassed to smile!! Pain that I was having from a filling also subsided. To me.. all of those products get 5 stars!!</li>
            <li> I have bad teeth, unfortunately it is genetic in my family. The reviews are correct, this stuff is awesome, and even though it&#x27;s a little pricey for a small bottle, a little goes a long way.  I&#x27;ve had mine for a few months and I still have alot in there.  Some reviews say that they use this over toothpaste.  I don&#x27;t.  I don&#x27;t feel it gives me enough &amp;#34;freshness&amp;#34; after using it.  Although my teeth do feel cleaner, I don&#x27;t feel as though I have brushed my teeth in the sense of the freshness one feels after using toothpaste.  So I&#x27;ll often rebrush my teeth with toothpaste after using this, or just gargle with mouthwash for that freshness feel and taste.</li>
            <li> Best stain remover and wonderful for gums, love it!</li>
            <li> Liquid toothpaste and breath freshener in a bottle. Better if it was in spray form though. Nice taste and texture.</li>
            <li> Nothing changed .except it made my teeth less white.</li>
            <li> I use it to clean my dental retainer - it doesn&#x27;t wear down or damage the plastic, as normal toothpaste does, and it does a better job of actually cleaning the plastic than toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Very helpful!  Reduced tooth sensitivity and teeth feel really clean!</li>
            <li> I bought this glorious, clean product while out of town and since I couldnt find it in my whole foods, I ordered a refill here... Only to have it arrive, bottle chipped, oozing liquid and completely empty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wasted money as the packaging was negligent and ill prepared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So sad... Hope to repurchase in a store soon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dentizyme for about a year now and I have completely sworn off regular toothpaste forever. Tastes great, removes plaque, makes my mouth feel wonderfully clean. I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love this product for traveling and maintenance.  Clears up tender gums quickly!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that this product was in a glycerine base, as opposed to other comparable products that are sold on the market with a healthier, organic oil base.  Glycerine - although making the product taste great - can leave a film on teeth that interferes with remineralization and contributes to bacterial growth.  If your teeth are sensitive to sugar, this product can cause a reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could love this product because of the great essential oils in it... but, alas, I cannot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the manufacture ever switched to an organic almond or coconut oil (antifungal and antibacterial) and ditched the glycerine, I would purchase it again!</li>
            <li> can I use it on my dog too?</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful for your gums/teeth.  Helps with dental hygiene.  Breath feels and smells fresh.</li>
            <li> This product does make your mouth feel clean and fresh. I use it with toothpaste, but I don&#x27;t think it will ever take the place of regular dental care. It won&#x27;t dissolve plaque, at least not in a short while, can&#x27;t say whether or not it will over a long period. It can&#x27;t help but make things better though.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use it as I did see improvement in my gum health.</li>
            <li> This product is the real deal - real, natural ingredients and real, solid results.  Teeth can be fixed, capped, etc but gum disease needs to be avoided at all costs.  And this is an excellent product for helping to ease tooth pain and also for rejuvenating gums.  My little nephew likes it because it tastes good and makes his gums feel good.  I like it because I know it&#x27;s going to help prevent gum disease down the road.  If this product were protected by a patent and produced by Big Pharma you&#x27;d be hearing a lot about it.  And it would cost a whole lot more.  But it&#x27;s all natural, and relatively inexpensive.  Try it for yourself and then get it for friends and family, too. It&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li> This product works well for anyone who wants a fresher mouth. The price is very reasonable and it is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> No improvement whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total waste of money</li>
            <li> Received but haven&#x27;t used enough to form a real opinion - first impression in very good!</li>
            <li> Best thing I EVER brushed my teeth with!!!  it really cleans and is non-toxic! love it!</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I have had amazing results with this product.  Our gums are healthier than they have been in years.  It has become part of our regular daily routine.</li>
