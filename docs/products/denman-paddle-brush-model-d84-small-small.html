            <li>ok great&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>This brush is my favorite.</li>
            <li>It creats zero static.  </li>
            <li>Be sure you notice that this is not a styling brush, if that is the type you are looking for.  </li>
            <li>The description of the brush made reference to an \\&quot;anti-static\\&quot; rubber pad, but the brush does create static.</li>
            <li>Such a great brush!</li>
            <li>great for tangles on my daughter&#x27;s fine straight hair without pulling or breaking..</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s easier to clean.</li>
            <li>It is cool.  </li>
            <li>Vary nice grate for my soft head.</li>
            <li>quick delivery.</li>
            <li>It is gentle on my scalp, easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>This is the best brush for straightening my naturally curly hair, paddle is not large - which helps to get closer to the roots.</li>
            <li>but this smaller one is perfect for little hands or to have on the go in the purse</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still my daily brush and very comfortable.</li>
            <li>It was my first one, so</li>
            <li>The reason I gave the product only 2 stars is because when using the brush,I have a lot of static.  </li>
            <li>The rest of the time I use the bigger Denman paddle brush which I love.</li>
            <li>Denman brand brushes are the best in quality, I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on any other brand.</li>
            <li>They dont last forever, and are diffult to clean, but they are worth it.</li>
            <li>I really like the brush</li>
            <li>and it works very well on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like this brush.</li>
            <li>Somehow this feels better than all my other brushes.</li>
            <li>I told him the brush would most likely last a life time.</li>
            <li>Denman brushes have proven to retain their high quality.  </li>
            <li>For me, it was better than any other travel brush I&#x27;ve used and did the job but not something I&#x27;d use daily.</li>
            <li>Natural bristle cushion brush&lt;br</li>
            <li>Natural 100% boar bristles</li>
            <li>Advertised as 100% natural boar bristle when in fact it&#x27;s those crappy plastic bristles.</li>
            <li>I will get a larger one when it is time to order a new one.</li>
            <li>It just lost it&#x27;s first bristle the other day, but has not made any difference in the comfort or ability to brush my hair.  </li>
            <li>Professional brush at a very low price.</li>
            <li>This recent purchase was for my son who&#x27;s got a sensitive scalp.  </li>
            <li>It combs through my wild curly long hair without tearing or pulling.  </li>

            <li> Professional brush at a very low price.</li>
            <li> Best hairbrush ever! My daughters would always steal mine so I bought both of them one!</li>
            <li> The description says:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Ideal for medium to thick hair&lt;br /&gt;  Natural bristle cushion brush&lt;br /&gt;  Natural 100% boar bristles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon delivered on time... ok great&lt;br /&gt;But the description says 100% boar hair bristles..These are totally plastic pins.&lt;br /&gt;100% disappointed and i wish there were zero star rating.. so i can only give it 1 star.</li>
            <li> Great quality which is what Denman always provides.  I bought this for travel, but ended up using it to brush wet hair on a daily basis.  Easy on the scalp.  Doesn&#x27;t pull or break my hair.  Small, but not so small its hard to handle.</li>
            <li> I like this brush, but the description makes it sound like you get two--- you only get one!</li>
            <li> Advertised as 100% natural boar bristle when in fact it&#x27;s those crappy plastic bristles. Totally misrepresented. Avoid like the plague.</li>
            <li> I love how durable and easy to use this brush is! The size makes for better/more thorough detangling and smoothing than big paddle brushes. I feel like i should buy another one of these for my purse so I never have to be without one...</li>
            <li> Just as expected. quick delivery. Great product. Denman brand brushes are the best in quality, I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on any other brand.</li>
            <li> This is my second Denman Paddle hair brush. I use it for basic maintenance on my short thick hair.  It is gentle on my scalp, easy to clean.  Great for the men in the family too.</li>
            <li> Salon style, smooth and perfect for your bangs</li>
            <li> I really like the brush and it works very well on my hair.  It is small though, and I probably should have ordered a medium sized one.  It was my first one, so I will get a larger one when it is time to order a new one.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s hair (2 y/o) and as a travel brush for us. It works great for my daughter. Even my husband likes it for her hair. For me, it was better than any other travel brush I&#x27;ve used and did the job but not something I&#x27;d use daily. I like my big brush.</li>
            <li> Only 1 salon that I know of locally where I can purchase these brushes and they are so overpriced! I order a couple at a time from amazon and then don&#x27;t have to each time I want to replace the brush. This is the best brush for straightening my naturally curly hair, paddle is not large - which helps to get closer to the roots.</li>
            <li> This brush is my favorite. It combs through my wild curly long hair without tearing or pulling.  It creats zero static.  They dont last forever, and are diffult to clean, but they are worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a nice brush and does a good job with smoothing the hair, getting out snarles, etc. Be sure you notice that this is not a styling brush, if that is the type you are looking for.  The reason I gave the product only 2 stars is because when using the brush,I have a lot of static.  The description of the brush made reference to an \\&quot;anti-static\\&quot; rubber pad, but the brush does create static.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like this brush. It gets tangled in my hair. I like the original Denman plastic brush better. It&#x27;s easier to clean. It&#x27;s very difficult to get hair out of this brush. However, I did receive the brush in a timely manner and the seller responded to a concern I had with the order almost immediately.</li>
            <li> Hands down, the best paddle brush I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush as a back-up to my other denman brush.  It is cool.  I like the wide mouth.</li>
            <li> great for tangles on my daughter&#x27;s fine straight hair without pulling or breaking..Feels good on scalp.&lt;br /&gt;I already have the bigger one but this smaller one is perfect for little hands or to have on the go in the purse</li>
            <li> Great brush!  My husband loves it and I use it for travel.  The rest of the time I use the bigger Denman paddle brush which I love.</li>
            <li> Such a great brush! I bought one years ago and it&#x27;s still in great condition--bought another one for my travel bag. Only brand I&#x27;ll buy!</li>
            <li> Perfect brush for brushing hair out and using when blow drying. Doesn&#x27;t tear hair. Feels good on scalp.</li>
            <li> Denman brushes have proven to retain their high quality.  I bought this same brush about 10 years ago and it&#x27;s still my daily brush and very comfortable. It just lost it&#x27;s first bristle the other day, but has not made any difference in the comfort or ability to brush my hair.  This recent purchase was for my son who&#x27;s got a sensitive scalp.  He loves it and is very happy with it.  I told him the brush would most likely last a life time.</li>
            <li> Somehow this feels better than all my other brushes. It&#x27;s become my go-to. Doesn&#x27;t snag, feels good.</li>
            <li> Vary nice grate for my soft head.</li>
            <li> Best brush I ever owned!</li>
