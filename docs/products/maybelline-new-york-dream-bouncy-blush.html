            <li>Excellent for the price.</li>
            <li>and she is very happy about it…</li>

            <li>This blush is perfect!!</li>
            <li>but I am impressed with Maybelline this summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>LOVE this blush!!!  </li>
            <li>I ordered this in rose petal and it&#x27;s a great shade for my very fair skin.</li>
            <li>If subtlety is your thing, this is a good one.</li>
            <li>Good price too.  </li>
            <li>I apply with a light hand and a stippling brush and it looks great!</li>
            <li>I was won over by the name at the store, &#x27;bouncy&#x27; sounded happy &#x3D;)  </li>
            <li>I have since been in love!  </li>
            <li>It is easy to apply, and looks great on.</li>
            <li>is amazing</li>
            <li>Rose Petal is my 1st attempts in trying this Maybelline blush and I must word that you&#x27;d see no color on your cheeks.</li>
            <li>, I love it so much the color is perfect</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s creamy but doesn&#x27;t seem to get on your finger or brush very easily.  </li>
            <li>it blends very easily with my fingertips.</li>
            <li>I have a few colors of the bouncy blush but the rose petal is perfect for my fair skin.</li>
            <li>and I love how theres so many to chose from</li>
            <li>I love this blush.</li>
            <li>It really does look great, but I won&#x27;t get it again because it takes me forever and a day to apply it.</li>
            <li>on this one and move onto a better brand.</li>
            <li>I love the color, but didn&#x27;t expect it to be so gel</li>
            <li>Thank goodness that I&#x27;ve ordered Nyx blush in Pinched, so that I can top Maybelline&#x27;s one with NYX.</li>
            <li>I use Missha 21 BB cream and powder blush clashes with the healthy glow</li>
            <li>I love that I get from my foundation.</li>
            <li>Love this color though and it truly is \\&quot;bouncy\\&quot;, making it fun and easy to use!!</li>
            <li>so you can have a very mild blush effect or more color.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a blush that would blend well into my skin and be easy to apply.</li>
            <li>The color was fine</li>
            <li>I was so excited to purchase this item and when it came, I fell in love.this blush</li>
            <li>it is a really nice, natural looking blush that is just so fun to wear and out on!</li>
            <li>bouncy was right!  </li>
            <li>It looks the same as the picture shows and there was a good description of the product .  </li>
            <li>Thanks Maybelline :)</li>
            <li>This blush is the perfect color and has a nice bit of glow, BUT it&#x27;s very difficult to put on.</li>
            <li>It is very light and natural looking.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite brand and color of blush.</li>
            <li>love this blush it rubs in and looks so natural you cannot tell you are wearing blush</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Pink Lift blush, but I like Maybelline&#x27;s Dream Bouncy blush a bit better, because it takes less product to give good coverage, and the price is better for the amount of product you get.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and looks very natural.</li>
            <li>so having another makeup piece I can easily apply with my finger (er thumb) is convenient and makes this a must wear for busy work mornings!</li>
            <li>If your looking for a light natural looking, fun blush</li>
            <li>I was a little surprised at the texture at first, but works great when applied with fingers or makeup sponge</li>
            <li>It usually lasts a good 6-8 hours</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m going to keep looking for a blush a bit more vivid and something that would last a bit longer.</li>
            <li>a fresh, completely natural-looking glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>even used it over a great Victorias Secret primer that makes your skin just glow.</li>
            <li>I really like this color.  </li>
            <li>but this is too much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The small, light case is easy to carry in a purse, and I had no questions getting through airport security with it because it&#x27;s not a liquid or</li>
            <li>For Maybelline, I figured it would be a decent product, but was very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it makes you appear to just have a natural pretty tone to your cheeks</li>
            <li>It was nice and left a wonderful pink color onto my cheeks, however I would recommend you use this with an application brush, because applying it with your fingers will leave a creamy pink residue behind.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally use any drug store make-up</li>
            <li>Mauve (totally natural if you have cool natural red lips)</li>
            <li>I found it in this New York Dream Bouncy Blush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very subtle, so I have to apply a good amount of it to my face for the color to show up the way I want it to.</li>
            <li>The texture can be made to look very light on your skin or very heavy.</li>
            <li>It is so weak in color, that I ended up needing to buy another rose colored blush and threw this one to the side.</li>
            <li>It looks so natural on my cheeks and not overbearing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural looking and has staying power.</li>
            <li>Soft and creamy, it goes on my skin like butter, but doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or pasty, and gave my cheeks</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned, very pale and still had trouble seeing any color difference on my skin with this product.  </li>
            <li>I never have enough time in the morning to get ready, especially when I have to be at work at 6am~</li>
            <li>This blush goes on much lighter than I expected, plus...</li>
            <li>It says to apply with your fingertips, but it&#x27;s very spongy and not much rubs off.  </li>

            <li> Strange texture to this blush.  </li>
            <li> I realized it was different than any other blush...</li>
            <li> Barely Branded, Bold Gold &amp; Bad to the Bronze&lt;br /&gt;Color</li>
            <li> This blush is pretty lame.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other non-powder blushes, and this product needs some work.</li>
            <li> For me, the color is just too little girl pink.</li>
            <li> Not worth it....</li>
            <li> I never feel like I&#x27;m doing it right, and I have to rub my cheeks like crazy to un-streak it.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s subtle enough for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Not even a little.</li>
            <li> I am very, very pale in the winter and it&#x27;s hard for me to find a blush</li>
            <li> like; I could hardly get anything on a brush at all.</li>
            <li> Still, no nice rosy cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Alas, Maybelline saw a problem and came up with a solution.</li>
            <li> IT lasts all day, I haven&#x27;t broken out or had any rash from using</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s kinda difficult to apply.  </li>
            <li> I guess I chose the wrong color because I can&#x27;t see that I&#x27;ve put anything on when I have used it.</li>
            <li> I picked this up at Target, and i became wierdly obsessed!</li>
            <li> The texture of this is too weird for me, and the application is very awkward.</li>

            <li> I was so excited to purchase this item and when it came, I fell in love.this blush is amazing, I love it so much the color is perfect and I love how theres so many to chose from</li>
            <li> I have a few colors of the bouncy blush but the rose petal is perfect for my fair skin. It usually lasts a good 6-8 hours but I have combination skin and that could be the culprit. Love this color though and it truly is \\&quot;bouncy\\&quot;, making it fun and easy to use!!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a blush that would blend well into my skin and be easy to apply. I found it in this New York Dream Bouncy Blush. It looks so natural on my cheeks and not overbearing. I will buy again!</li>
            <li> I love this blush. It is easy to apply, and looks great on. It is very light and natural looking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve often thought to myself my blush just isn&#x27;t bouncy enough. I can&#x27;t dribble it. Not even a little. Why oh why can&#x27;t it be bouncier! Alas, Maybelline saw a problem and came up with a solution. Way to problem solve Maybelline! I ordered this in rose petal and it&#x27;s a great shade for my very fair skin. It&#x27;s natural looking and has staying power.</li>
            <li> I was a little surprised at the texture at first, but works great when applied with fingers or makeup sponge</li>
            <li> This blush goes on much lighter than I expected, plus...it&#x27;s kinda difficult to apply.  It says to apply with your fingertips, but it&#x27;s very spongy and not much rubs off.  Not worth it....</li>
            <li> LOVE this blush!!!  Soft and creamy, it goes on my skin like butter, but doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or pasty, and gave my cheeks a fresh, completely natural-looking glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small, light case is easy to carry in a purse, and I had no questions getting through airport security with it because it&#x27;s not a liquid or powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Pink Lift blush, but I like Maybelline&#x27;s Dream Bouncy blush a bit better, because it takes less product to give good coverage, and the price is better for the amount of product you get.</li>

This blush is the perfect color and has a nice bit of glow, BUT it&#x27;s very difficult to put on. I never feel like I&#x27;m doing it right, and I have to rub my cheeks like crazy to un-streak it. It really does look great, but I won&#x27;t get it again because it takes me forever and a day to apply it.</li>
            <li> The title of the review sums it up. It doesn&#x27;t do a darn thing! Save your money and get... anything else.</li>
            <li> Strange texture to this blush.  I am fair skinned, very pale and still had trouble seeing any color difference on my skin with this product.  It&#x27;s creamy but doesn&#x27;t seem to get on your finger or brush very easily.  Like the packaging, but wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> It was nice and left a wonderful pink color onto my cheeks, however I would recommend you use this with an application brush, because applying it with your fingers will leave a creamy pink residue behind. It&#x27;s very subtle, so I have to apply a good amount of it to my face for the color to show up the way I want it to. If subtlety is your thing, this is a good one.

Still, no nice rosy cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pass on this one and move onto a better brand. I sometimes use a lip stain on my cheeks because it last all day!</li>
            <li> The texture of this is too weird for me, and the application is very awkward.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite brand and color of blush. It is easy to apply and looks very natural. The texture can be made to look very light on your skin or very heavy. It&#x27;s your choice. Excellent for the price.</li>
            <li> I was won over by the name at the store, &#x27;bouncy&#x27; sounded happy &#x3D;)  When I got home I realized it was different than any other blush... bouncy was right!  I went to the Maybeline website and watched their tutorial for applying it.  I have since been in love!  I never have enough time in the morning to get ready, especially when I have to be at work at 6am~ so having another makeup piece I can easily apply with my finger (er thumb) is convenient and makes this a must wear for busy work mornings!</li>
            <li> I gave this makeup product to my wife as a gift and she uses it on daily basics and she is very happy about it…</li>
            <li> I really like this color.  It looks the same as the picture shows and there was a good description of the product .  Good price too.  Thanks Maybelline :)</li>
            <li> I love the color, but didn&#x27;t expect it to be so gel like; I could hardly get anything on a brush at all. I knew it had a gel-like consistency but this is too much.</li>
            <li> I apply with a light hand and a stippling brush and it looks great!</li>
            <li> love this blush it rubs in and looks so natural you cannot tell you are wearing blush it makes you appear to just have a natural pretty tone to your cheeks</li>
            <li> I like how this goes on- it blends very easily with my fingertips. For me, the color is just too little girl pink. I&#x27;ve learned my lesson about not buying make-up on Amazon. I&#x27;ll stick with Sephora so I can see the colors in person.</li>
            <li> I picked this up at Target, and i became wierdly obsessed! it is a really nice, natural looking blush that is just so fun to wear and out on! The only thing is, im not sure what to apply it with, fingers work pretty well. If your looking for a light natural looking, fun blush, this is the perfect thing!</li>
            <li> Rose Petal is my 1st attempts in trying this Maybelline blush and I must word that you&#x27;d see no color on your cheeks. Thank goodness that I&#x27;ve ordered Nyx blush in Pinched, so that I can top Maybelline&#x27;s one with NYX.</li>
            <li> I guess I chose the wrong color because I can&#x27;t see that I&#x27;ve put anything on when I have used it.</li>
            <li> I use Missha 21 BB cream and powder blush clashes with the healthy glow I love that I get from my foundation. This blush is perfect!! IT lasts all day, I haven&#x27;t broken out or had any rash from using is. It&#x27;s build-able coverage  so you can have a very mild blush effect or more color. I use the &amp;#34;Coffee Cake&amp;#34; color as a contour under my cheek bones and I use this one &amp;#34;Rose Petal&amp;#34; on my cheek bones for color. I don&#x27;t normally use any drug store make-up but I am impressed with Maybelline this summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also tried and now use:&lt;br /&gt;Color tattoo eyeshadow gels: Barely Branded, Bold Gold &amp; Bad to the Bronze&lt;br /&gt;Color Whisper lips: Made-it Mauve (totally natural if you have cool natural red lips)</li>
            <li> The consistency is horrendous. I&#x27;ve tried other non-powder blushes, and this product needs some work. The color was fine and I did end up using this product because I don&#x27;t like the hassle of returning stuff, but I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    </ol>
