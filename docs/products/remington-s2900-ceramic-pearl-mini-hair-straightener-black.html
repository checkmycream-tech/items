            <li>So cute and easy to use.  </li>

            <li>I am happy with how well it works for the reasonable price and would definitely recommend it for those with shorter hair or for traveling.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>From the Wet 2 Straight temperature settings, this Mini Straightener is around a 15-20 , not that high, but perfect on the go .</li>
            <li>This product is bulky and is very diffiuct to get into the fine hairs and bangs.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get super hot</li>
            <li>if it&#x27;s the advertised ion exchange or ceramic, make my hair SIGNIFICANTLY look much healthier)  </li>
            <li>it heats up very fast and it doesn&#x27;t get super hot but just right.</li>
            <li>This flat iron is great if you have short hair.  </li>
            <li>Heats quickly and is very easy to operate due to reduced size.</li>
            <li>First off, I&#x27;m a man.</li>
            <li>Whatever the opposite of winning the genetic lottery for hair aesthetics is...</li>
            <li>The on/off switch is between the handles, which means your fingers get close to the hot plates when turning it off.</li>
            <li>HOT</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still glad I bought it for especially humid summer days.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and is just the right size.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed the handle getting too hot as some of the other reviews have said, though it does get a bit warm</li>
            <li>I like the results better than what I was getting from my Chi flat iron.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so tiny and powerful, it heats up quickly and delivers great long lasting results.</li>
            <li>It works perfectly for my small hair, and it even gets hot really fast so that I can straighten out without waiting for a long time.</li>
            <li>I noticed a positive linear relationship between using this product and getting girl&#x27;s digits.</li>
            <li>My hair stays relatively straight even on hot, humid days.</li>
            <li>the \\&quot;remington\\&quot; logo is fading away by now due to the oils in my hair and hands but the iron is still strong!</li>
            <li>The case is nice too, couldve been a little bit longer to accomodate the cord</li>
            <li>but we don&#x27;t use it as much as I thought we would so?.</li>
            <li>and I must say it worked really well.</li>
            <li>it cost me soo much money.</li>
            <li>Thanks,     D.</li>
            <li>Haha</li>
            <li>My hair goes from being curly and frizzy to shiny, smooth, and soft after use and so far, I haven&#x27;t noticed any severe hair damage or split-ends.</li>
            <li>The extreme heat is what is making the hair straight and sealing the cuticle of the hair, making is look more glossy.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s good to have for traveling because it&#x27;s very small.</li>
            <li>Thank God I decided on this particular iron.</li>
            <li>I only use it on my bangs or for a quick fix.</li>
            <li>but more ideally a tiny trim in the middle).  </li>
            <li>Look up tips online for how to straighten with high heat.</li>
            <li>Comes with a cute little carrying bag that my daughter now uses for her make up.</li>
            <li>Love this little guy.</li>
            <li>The ideal use for this product is for people with hair that is no more than 3 inches long, and perhaps up to six inches, but any longer and you should definitely go with a wider straightener that has lower heat settings.</li>
            <li>I have the 1 inch Wet 2 Straight recommended by a friend, and I instantly fell in love.</li>
            <li>small which is ideal for short hair, 2 years limited warranty and worldwide voltage which means it will work all over the world&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have fine, wavy hair and was looking for a VERY lightweight straightener because I am physically disabled and have strict lifting restrictions.</li>
            <li>I bought this hair straightener for my new bangs.</li>
            <li>but then i found this selling for like 20 bucks, and where i live they dont sell</li>
            <li>so my very porous hair which is thinning on top but thick around the sides has a lot of curl to it.</li>
            <li>I love this little thing!</li>
            <li>After it has been on for several minutes, the handle becomes uncomfortably hot and 2.)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s small and cute, which makes it convenient to carry wherever i go.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i really love it alot and recommend it to anyone with short hair ( male or female ) ^_^&lt;br /&gt;one</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s nearly twice the boiling point of water!</li>
            <li>It heated up instantly, and wasn&#x27;t so hot it damaged my hair.</li>
            <li>The only downer is it does get a bit hot on the handle where the ceramic plates are.</li>
            <li>This mini travel iron does its job of being small and portable, which is exactly what I needed for when I travel and don&#x27;t want to bring my full sized iron.</li>
            <li>I personally have fine, wavy hair and recently got it cut very short and</li>
            <li>Carry in my purse for my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t even worth the $15 I spent.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews and my old straighter burning my hair recently I decided I needed a new one.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking to get your short hair straight, this will do the job, however:  - This straightener only has one heat setting:</li>
            <li>It is just a tiny little tool, but it gets hot fast and is so much easier to use on his short hair than my larger straightener.  </li>
            <li>and wow does it last.</li>
            <li>I have short natural hair and this straightner straightens my hair without any problems.</li>
            <li>ive tried other 1/2 inch irons and they usually last a few months at MOST.</li>
            <li>I saw a few scratches on the ceramic plate from my first use.</li>
            <li>While this will certainly straighten your hair, it will also severely damage it very quickly (in as little as one use) in the hands of someone who does not know what they&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li>it went on sale quick and its a little depressing to see it more pricey on here.</li>

            <li> i used it in short hair and it work really well, its really small</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s so small in size, it takes a while to straighten my whole head, so I just use it for my bangs.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s only about 2 inches long.</li>
            <li> Stack this bad body with a nice blow dryer and Gatsby hair product and you look like you belong on a runway.   </li>
            <li> it will take too long for you to straighten all your hair.</li>
            <li> I use it to curl the ends of my long hair and every time I use it I get compliments of my hair :$</li>
            <li> Would totally recommend this product for other bros.</li>
            <li> Blow dry with quality hair dryer</li>
            <li> This is the initial result, and can be the continued result, but only if the hair is not overly straightened and is also cut often (at least once a month</li>
            <li> it comes in a flowery, pink pouch.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this to tame my husband&#x27;s unruly hair.  </li>
            <li> In the other reviews some talk about how their hair looks glossy because of the \\&quot;pearlized coating\\&quot; of the straightener.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for something small.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and straight but there are some that like to fall to the side a little.</li>
            <li> My hair is weak, extremely thick, very wavy, and looks kinda of dry and just dumb in general when I grow it out.</li>
            <li> Reduced overall size, makes it easier to straighten hard to reach areas, or bangs in front.  </li>
            <li> But as other reviewers have also said this is not a full fledge hair straighter, nor does it have temp adjustment.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not good for daily uses otherwise</li>
            <li> so if you have really thick or long hair you&#x27;ll probably dislike this.</li>
            <li> The item also travels well since it takes up so little space in your suitcase.</li>
            <li> I have short thin hair and it still takes a while.</li>
            <li> All in all, I probably spend 3-5 min on my hair everyday.   </li>
            <li> The cord weight seems to be in proportion to the straightener itself (i.e., not too heavy or bulky).</li>
            <li> Remington S2900 Straightner    Narrow  plates for directed straightening.  </li>
            <li> Plus I needed it that small to get down to the roots of my hair.</li>
            <li> ive had this one for the past year and a half</li>
            <li> It is extremely small and lightweight.</li>
            <li> This works about as well as expected but not great</li>
            <li> (not to mention six years old and in desperate need of replacement).</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s because it is as small as it is.</li>
            <li> Small and works well.</li>
            <li> No more am I ashamed to embarrass my family name due to poor hair now that I have the Remington s2900 Ceramic Pearl Mini Hair Straightener.</li>
            <li> Remington is a brand I trust but the design is not suitable for straitening small areas, not to mention is does not heat at all.</li>
            <li> But I was sick of short hair and wanted to grow it out.....</li>
            <li> I was unfortunate in life in the sense that my hair is a failure.</li>
            <li> I was soooo mad</li>
            <li> D&lt;br /&gt;nice thermal pouch but hate the color of it its so pinkish :</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s really tiny!  The 6\\&quot; size is the overall size.  The iron size itself is about 3\\&quot;.  I have short thin hair and it still takes a while. Wasn&#x27;t even worth the $15 I spent. Still keep it in my carry on just in case though as a &#x27;just in case&#x27;.</li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;m a man. I was unfortunate in life in the sense that my hair is a failure. Whatever the opposite of winning the genetic lottery for hair aesthetics is... I&#x27;m it. My hair is weak, extremely thick, very wavy, and looks kinda of dry and just dumb in general when I grow it out. But I was sick of short hair and wanted to grow it out..... So i Just went F*** it and went for it.   No more am I ashamed to embarrass my family name due to poor hair now that I have the Remington s2900 Ceramic Pearl Mini Hair Straightener. Stack this bad body with a nice blow dryer and Gatsby hair product and you look like you belong on a runway.   Here&#x27;s what I do:  Get hair pointcut&#x27;d to create some texture.  Blow dry with quality hair dryer (I noticed the quality ones, idk if it&#x27;s the advertised ion exchange or ceramic, make my hair SIGNIFICANTLY look much healthier)  Than use the remington s2900 to straighten (heats up in 30-1min, takes 30 seconds).   Use some Gatsby(pink one) hair product to get that final look.  All in all, I probably spend 3-5 min on my hair everyday.   *also added tip - invest in some good thinning sheers to add texture yourself.  Would totally recommend this product for other bros. I noticed a positive linear relationship between using this product and getting girl&#x27;s digits. Good luck.</li>
            <li> I have fine, wavy hair and was looking for a VERY lightweight straightener because I am physically disabled and have strict lifting restrictions. This straightener is absolutely perfect for me. It is extremely small and lightweight. The cord weight seems to be in proportion to the straightener itself (i.e., not too heavy or bulky). The unit heats up very quickly, although the temperature itself is not adjustable. The carrying case is wonderfully compact and handy. My only two qualms with this straightener are 1.) After it has been on for several minutes, the handle becomes uncomfortably hot and 2.) The on/off switch is between the handles, which means your fingers get close to the hot plates when turning it off. Therefore, I would recommend this straightener for travel or for individuals with semi-fine to fine hair. As for the pearlized shine on my locks, I have not noticed any difference.</li>
            <li> i used it in short hair and it work really well, its really small and i can take it for trips, good product for boys, the color is the only problem</li>
            <li> My hair is the worst. I am a male almost 40 so my very porous hair which is thinning on top but thick around the sides has a lot of curl to it. It is also lightweight and frizzes always. I can not use a blow dryer. Unless I want to look like a short hair treasure troll. I always kept a short militant cut because of this.  Thank God I decided on this particular iron. I&#x27;ve had it for two months and I&#x27;m in love with my hair. I even tried one of those \\&quot;professional\\&quot; irons and the Remington will be my tool of choice. The plates connect perfectly smoothing you hair in one or two glides. Heat is perfect. HOT but allows you to use the tool without a glove. Perfect for anyone with short hair.  Don&#x27;t forget to buy some Agadir argan oil hair treatment. Together these products can make the most trifling hair awesome.</li>
            <li> It does its job. I guess it&#x27;s good to have for traveling because it&#x27;s very small. but it&#x27;s not good for daily uses otherwise it will take too long for you to straighten all your hair.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is great if you have short hair.  It doesn&#x27;t get super hot but it does the job.</li>
            <li> This is very tiny so if you have really thick or long hair you&#x27;ll probably dislike this. I have very short hair and needed something for those hard-to-reach areas, and this was my perfect solution. It gets to my roots effortlessly and I luv d results. It heats up quickly, glides through my hair w/o pulling and I don&#x27;t experience frizz. I use this in addition to the Remington S5500 Digital 1 inch anti-static ceramic flat iron. Remington products are great!</li>
            <li> ive tried other 1/2 inch irons and they usually last a few months at MOST. ive had this one for the past year and a half and wow does it last. the \\&quot;remington\\&quot; logo is fading away by now due to the oils in my hair and hands but the iron is still strong! recommend this 100Xs!   oh also i bought this at target for like 14bucks. it went on sale quick and its a little depressing to see it more pricey on here.</li>
            <li> i love this mini hair straightener. it&#x27;s small and cute, which makes it convenient to carry wherever i go. it heats up very fast and it doesn&#x27;t get super hot but just right. works great on my semi-short hair and gets the job done. got it for around 15$. great deal!</li>
            <li> This works about as well as expected but not great but we don&#x27;t use it as much as I thought we would so?. Comes with a cute little carrying bag that my daughter now uses for her make up.</li>
            <li> The Remington Ceramic Pearl Mini is the perfect size for short hair. My hair stays relatively straight even on hot, humid days. I like the results better than what I was getting from my Chi flat iron. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Remington S2900 Straightner    Narrow  plates for directed straightening.  Excellent heating system, no damage to curly hair.  Heats quickly and is very easy to operate due to reduced size. Reduced overall size, makes it easier to straighten hard to reach areas, or bangs in front.  No Frizz remains</li>
            <li> I actually bought this to tame my husband&#x27;s unruly hair.  It is just a tiny little tool, but it gets hot fast and is so much easier to use on his short hair than my larger straightener.  I am happy with how well it works for the reasonable price and would definitely recommend it for those with shorter hair or for traveling.</li>
            <li> I love this little thing! I bought this hair straightener for my new bangs. It&#x27;s so tiny and powerful, it heats up quickly and delivers great long lasting results. My hair goes from being curly and frizzy to shiny, smooth, and soft after use and so far, I haven&#x27;t noticed any severe hair damage or split-ends. I would definitely recommend this for those who needs a hair straightener for their bangs or for very short hair. Because it&#x27;s so small in size, it takes a while to straighten my whole head, so I just use it for my bangs. The heat-proof pouch that comes with it is great for storage and travel.</li>
            <li> I personally have fine, wavy hair and recently got it cut very short and my Wet2Straight just was too big to use with my hair anymore (not to mention six years old and in desperate need of replacement). I looked around and decided I would try this product and I must say it worked really well. Admittedly it does take awhile to straighten but that&#x27;s because it is as small as it is. Plus I needed it that small to get down to the roots of my hair. All in all 10/10 for short haired users. :)</li>
            <li> I bought a ceramic plate straightener , and my boyfriend broke it...I was soooo mad cause it cost me soo much money. but then i found this selling for like 20 bucks, and where i live they dont sell any so YES THIS ANSWERED MY PRAYERS</li>
            <li> **update**&lt;br /&gt;yes its 390F but it did not burn my hair or any thing and heats up quick giving you nice look in a matter of seconds&lt;br /&gt;also have a nice length between the plates and the plastic cover to ensure you will not burn your head or hand :D&lt;br /&gt;nice thermal pouch but hate the color of it its so pinkish :P&lt;br /&gt;i really love it alot and recommend it to anyone with short hair ( male or female ) ^_^&lt;br /&gt;one last thing it closes perfectly there is no gap between the plates when you close both leads together i will try to add photo of it :)&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;silk smooth on the hair and gives you a great hair finish i liked it and will buy it again if i had to&lt;br /&gt;its small which is ideal for short hair, 2 years limited warranty and worldwide voltage which means it will work all over the world&lt;br /&gt;comes with nice pouch for carrying when travailing or so&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only disadvantage it that it is only set to 390F which is alot if u dont use heat hair protector and will burn your hair</li>
            <li> I love this product! I use it to curl the ends of my long hair and every time I use it I get compliments of my hair :$</li>
            <li> So cute and easy to use.  Now I have the collection of the curling wand, hair dryer, and straightener!</li>
            <li> Carry in my purse for my naturally curly hair. I only use it on my bangs or for a quick fix.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to get your short hair straight, this will do the job, however:  - This straightener only has one heat setting: ~392 degrees! That&#x27;s nearly twice the boiling point of water! While this will certainly straighten your hair, it will also severely damage it very quickly (in as little as one use) in the hands of someone who does not know what they&#x27;re doing. The ideal use for this product is for people with hair that is no more than 3 inches long, and perhaps up to six inches, but any longer and you should definitely go with a wider straightener that has lower heat settings. In the other reviews some talk about how their hair looks glossy because of the \\&quot;pearlized coating\\&quot; of the straightener. In my opinion this is not the case. The extreme heat is what is making the hair straight and sealing the cuticle of the hair, making is look more glossy. This is the initial result, and can be the continued result, but only if the hair is not overly straightened and is also cut often (at least once a month but more ideally a tiny trim in the middle).  - Those things said I like this straightener and use it daily. My hair stays straighter, longer with this than it does a wider model and it&#x27;s easier to use as I have hair that&#x27;s only about 2 inches long. I haven&#x27;t noticed the handle getting too hot as some of the other reviews have said, though it does get a bit warm which only makes sense.  - So again you can get great results but only if you know what you&#x27;re doing and take care of your hair. Look up tips online for how to straighten with high heat.</li>
            <li> I am probably biased about all Remington products. I have the 1 inch Wet 2 Straight recommended by a friend, and I instantly fell in love. I was looking for a travel sized straightener to bring with me and was very impressed by this purchase.     It heated up instantly, and wasn&#x27;t so hot it damaged my hair. From the Wet 2 Straight temperature settings, this Mini Straightener is around a 15-20 , not that high, but perfect on the go . It is perfect for bangs and short hair in that you can get VERY close to your roots without scorching yourself. It&#x27;s a perfect compact size and has ample holding space as to not burn your hand.    My hair feels very smooth after straightening , my mom even thought I had put on some straightening oil,  maybe it&#x27;s the pearls :D    I would definitely recommend this to anyone considering buying an on the go straightener.    Notes: There is only one temperature setting and there is no \\&quot;close lock\\&quot; on this device    Thanks,     D.</li>
            <li> I use this product to straighten my bangs. But as other reviewers have also said this is not a full fledge hair straighter, nor does it have temp adjustment.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. Great for bangs!</li>
            <li> This product is bulky and is very diffiuct to get into the fine hairs and bangs. Remington is a brand I trust but the design is not suitable for straitening small areas, not to mention is does not heat at all.</li>
            <li> Great for beard straightening. Small and works well. Just a shame it comes in a flowery, pink pouch. Haha</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly. I have short natural hair and this straightner straightens my hair without any problems. The case is nice too, couldve been a little bit longer to accomodate the cord but it does the job.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my wife at her work place</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews and my old straighter burning my hair recently I decided I needed a new one. I have a short bob and it works great. I also travel a lot and the heat resistant carrying case puts my mind at ease, even when storing it at home.</li>
            <li> I have short hair and this item is perfect for me.  It gets nice and hot and straightens my hair perfectly.  The item also travels well since it takes up so little space in your suitcase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and I use this for my short hair. My hair is thin and straight but there are some that like to fall to the side a little. This straightener works great. The only downer is it does get a bit hot on the handle where the ceramic plates are. You have to literally hold it at the farther end away from the ceramic plates. So, if you have big hands, you&#x27;re out of luck. Another thing I notice is the coating might be easily scratch. I saw a few scratches on the ceramic plate from my first use. It might be there or not but I notice it after I used it. I&#x27;m just going to let time tell that part. Also it&#x27;s only one setting which is another bummer.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly for my small hair, and it even gets hot really fast so that I can straighten out without waiting for a long time. Great product!</li>
            <li> This hair straightener is great to keep my desk at work, but I wish it were a bit hotter. I&#x27;m still glad I bought it for especially humid summer days.</li>
            <li> This mini travel iron does its job of being small and portable, which is exactly what I needed for when I travel and don&#x27;t want to bring my full sized iron. The straightener does its job, but it obviously takes longer because it&#x27;s a smaller product. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for something small.</li>
            <li> I needed a dual-voltage straightener just to straighten my bangs; this is perfect!  Heats up fast, comes with a cute travel bag, does the trick!</li>
            <li> Love this little guy. I take it with me for when I may need a touch up later and it works great. Heats up fast and is just the right size.</li>
