    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Love this!!!!</li>
            <li>I get the perfect c-curve with this clamp.</li>
            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>Makes a beautiful c-curve.</li>
            <li>but it was shipped and arrived on time and just as advertised it&#x27;s great buy</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>I love this pinching tool!</li>
            <li>Nice though for the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with the tool I received :)</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s okay for the price.</li>
            <li>really came in handy &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>Also, you must have a high tolerance for discomfort as it has strong clamping power.</li>
            <li>and they came pretty quick and work like a charm</li>
            <li>You must have very strong finger muscles to squeeze this tool open.</li>
            <li>even at the very end it is still very tight, making more of a curve than you&#x27;d probably want.</li>
            <li>I actually wish it applied just a little more pressure.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay not exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>Just got my pincher today, can&#x27;t wait to start using it, came in just a few days, and has a nice tight holdðŸ˜Œ</li>

            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but I&#x27;d imagine you can only make a very tight curve with it,</li>
            <li> As Expected!</li>
            <li> All these ppl saying they&#x27;re hard to open or they hurt are just complainers.</li>
            <li> Small, not what&#x27;s expected.</li>
            <li> Pinches too hard, so I won&#x27;t be using it again.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised however please note that it pinches very hard and may cause pain to you or your client.</li>

            <li> Small, not what&#x27;s expected. I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but I&#x27;d imagine you can only make a very tight curve with it, even at the very end it is still very tight, making more of a curve than you&#x27;d probably want. Nice though for the price.</li>

            <li> You must have very strong finger muscles to squeeze this tool open. Also, you must have a high tolerance for discomfort as it has strong clamping power. However, it does what it promises.</li>
            <li> really came in handy &amp;#60;3</li>
