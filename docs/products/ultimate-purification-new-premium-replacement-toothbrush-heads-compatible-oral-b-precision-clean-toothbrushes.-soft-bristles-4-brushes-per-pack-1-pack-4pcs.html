            <li>The connection it wasn&#x27;t perfect</li>
            <li>very good - just as advertised.</li>
            <li>Perfect for our electric toothbrush and a good price.</li>
            <li>Plus the price is great.</li>
            <li>Great price</li>
            <li>For the price difference I&#x27;ll happily keep them!(maybe more vibration is good!!!</li>
            <li>and they fit my Braun electric brush perfectly.</li>
            <li>These fit my oral b perfectly.  </li>
            <li>All good.</li>
            <li>Perfect OEM couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied</li>
            <li>Great price and fit my Kroger brand  electric toothbrush!</li>
            <li>These were perfect and were a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad i got them.</li>
            <li>In fact, I like these replacement brush heads better than the original oral b</li>
            <li>but it works fine.</li>
            <li>These brushes fit my Oral B electronic toothbrush just fine.  </li>
            <li>Works pretty good,only thing is, it vibrates more than the original.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not as sturdy as the original, so if you apply a lot of pressure when brushing you&#x27;ll break them.</li>
            <li>Easier to clean my teeth.</li>
            <li>I loved it, it&#x27;s smaller than the original size.</li>
            <li>For my particular way of using it they are fine.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>They arrived in reasonable time.  </li>
            <li>and I must say that the Ultimate Purification (TM) is as close as you could come to the original brand.</li>
            <li>Just the the OEM that came the my Oral-B professional electric toothbrush!</li>
            <li>The price for the &amp;#34;official replacement&amp;#34; in the local pharmacy was quite a bit higher than the on-line price I paid.  </li>
            <li>So, I will say that they&#x27;re not as tight a fit as the brand name refills; HOWEVER, they do still work.  </li>
            <li>Feels a little different than original Oral-B head but works well.</li>
            <li>Wow, finally found quality generic brand.</li>
