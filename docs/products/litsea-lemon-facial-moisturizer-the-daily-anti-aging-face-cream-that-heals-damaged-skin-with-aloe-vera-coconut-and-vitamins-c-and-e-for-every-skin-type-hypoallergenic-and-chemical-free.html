            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Even though this is a totally natural product, it has a scent that isn&#x27;t that pleasant to me.  </li>
            <li>For the title Lemon Crush, I guess I was expecting more of the fresh scent of lemon</li>
            <li>I bought at the special price and it&#x27;s worth it!  </li>
            <li>The fact that it is all natural and organic for the price is amazing.</li>
            <li>and I use it as a belly cream while I&#x27;m pregnant,.</li>
            <li>It has the exact scent of lemon heads candy!</li>
            <li>I love that everything in this cream is organic and natural, and it is very affordable!</li>

            <li>If anything it has made my acne heal faster and as of right now I have clear skin!</li>

            <li>I  am excited to try some other products and maybe even give some as Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li>Such a lovely cream with a texture like none other.</li>
            <li>The lemon scent smells very fresh, not artificial, and it&#x27;s noticeable but not strong enough to annoy you.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s organic and natural.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin really soft.  </li>
            <li>but the lemon is very subtle and there are other scents combined with it that don&#x27;t smell good together, in my opinion anyway as I can smell things very strongly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and dry and nothing has ever worked.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it and am looking forward to trying other products from Organic Fields of Heather.</li>
            <li>but I have chronic dry eyes and ones sensitive to cosmetics and lotions so it doesn&#x27;t work for my face.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I  have been really loving this face cream! It keeps my skin nourished and moisturized, which  I need some extra moisture in the Fall and Winter months. The scent of this cream is lemon so if you are not a fan of lemons then you won&#x27;t like this cream. I  have oily acne prone skin,  and  this cream doesn&#x27;t break me out. If anything it has made my acne heal faster and as of right now I have clear skin! I am happy I stumbled upon this brand! I  am excited to try some other products and maybe even give some as Christmas gifts. I love that everything in this cream is organic and natural, and it is very affordable! Shipping was fast and there was tracking too. I  am happy with the products I bought and would recommend them to anyone who likes affordable, natural and effective skincare!</li>

            <li> I like this alot.  Seems a little heavy, but then skin just drinks it in.</li>
            <li> I like this moisturizer overall.  It is a little on the greasy side, but tolerable with very dry skin.  I love the smell too... very lemon-y.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging definitely looks different than the image shown, but that didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> The smell was not too bad but the product was just ok to me. Seemed a bit oily for me as well.</li>

            <li> The smell is amazing! The price is even more amazing!</li>

After using this for a few weeks, I&#x27;ve noticed my face heals faster and every dry spot is gone. I swear by Organic Fields of Heather!</li>
            <li> This is my second order.  I will continue to order this product.  For the price and quality it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! The fact that it is all natural and organic for the price is amazing. I have only applied it a couple of times and already notice a big difference in the feel and look of my skin. My skin is very sensitive and dry and nothing has ever worked. I highly recommend it and am looking forward to trying other products from Organic Fields of Heather.</li>
            <li> Just amazing. Must buy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought 2! They were on sale so I figured, why not? Shipping was fast. The lemon scent smells very fresh, not artificial, and it&#x27;s noticeable but not strong enough to annoy you. I&#x27;ve only been using it a few days and I already notice a difference in how my skin looks. I&#x27;m very happy with this product and will continue to buy this brand. Can&#x27;t really complain, I&#x27;m getting great results and it&#x27;s organic and natural.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim because it wasn&#x27;t very expensive, and I find the scent of lemon to be invigorating. Once I used it, I realized the price is amazing for the quality of the product! I have really dry skin, and most of the moisturizers I have used in the past leave my face feeling dry again after only a few hours. This product leaves my skin feeling hydrated and smooth for 8+ hours!! A little goes a long way, and it smells amazing!</li>

            <li> Not good for my face, but smells great and I use it as a belly cream while I&#x27;m pregnant,.</li>
            <li> I bought at the special price and it&#x27;s worth it!  I love it...keeps my face soft and smooth and I am 53. I have good skin already so that could help. I don&#x27;t think I would pay $20 for it but that&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t like spending $20 in any face cream even though I have in the past. This works every bit as good as those of not better AND I have the pleasure of knowing the ingredients and able to pronounce them!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Makes my skin really soft.  I have oily skin but this moisturizer doesn&#x27;t cause me to breakout.  Want to order again, but looks like it is not currently available.  When will you have this product again, Amazon?</li>
