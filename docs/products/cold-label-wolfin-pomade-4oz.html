            <li>love this pomade, will buy on the reg</li>
            <li>love it look in on All clod label products 2 thumbs up.</li>
            <li>Great product, all natural ingredients, and speedy delivery!!!</li>
            <li>but it smells way better than wave builder and it has a strong hold and believe me</li>
            <li>it has great hold for when waves are getting wild and makes your waves look more defined</li>
            <li>All wavers need this it is all natural and smells great</li>
            <li>ok hold probably better for thinner hair or fresh cuts.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t get over the strong grapefruit smell.</li>
            <li>This hold may have been too strong for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful product for people who actually know how to wolf period.</li>
            <li>It has that musky old school &amp;#34;Blue Magic&amp;#34; smell thats not so pleasant and can become overpowering.</li>
            <li>It smells great and doesnt leave an enormous amount of build up.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t break me out which was good because I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Love this stuff right here.</li>
            <li>Thanks !!!</li>
            <li>also helps train waves its easy to wash out not greasy and promotes great healthy thick hair growth by giving your hair a nutritious hair environment..</li>
            <li>This pomade is not too heavy, doesn&#x27;t leave buildup and smells very good.</li>
            <li>It actually maintained my hair for a good number of hours.</li>
            <li>if not almost a full day.</li>
            <li>love it keep my hair silky and shiny thanks</li>
            <li>Other than that, great product</li>
            <li>Again another natural product that really isnt that good.</li>
            <li>Smells good but too costly for long term usage.</li>
            <li>imma leave wavebuilder alone and start using my new favorite product</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the money</li>
            <li>Not quite the hold that Murrays gives, but having no chemicals on his hair and scalp is worth it.  </li>
            <li>After washing and conditioning my hair, then applying this pomade the first thing I noticed was how it made my waves pop even though I&#x27;m in a wolfing session and how it held my hair in place.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always needed a nice, organic product that keeps my waves patted down during &amp;#34;wolfin&#x27;&amp;#34; season, and this is absolutely it!</li>
            <li>I bet the whole thing falls out in one piece.</li>
            <li>thanks again</li>
            <li>and u cant really put too much n</li>
            <li>Cold label best products made just for waves</li>
            <li>However, it is very pungent and overpowers my deodorant - much to my dismay.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have the regular one too and use it right after a fresh cut and from then out I use this one.</li>
            <li>It is an okay product that doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling greasy  nor weighed down even though it has some hold.</li>
            <li>In my opinion overall, cold label wolfin pomade is the best pomade on the market right now.</li>
            <li>you can add a little more too your edges.</li>
            <li>three butters is much better, and gives your hair a natural shine and silkier waves, trust me, one again another overrated product to take black men&#x27;s money.</li>
            <li>thank you cold label I will be buying more of this and trying more of your products</li>
            <li>Feels very natural in you hair and hasn&#x27;t caused me scalp irritation or itching.</li>
            <li>Very thick and smells nice.</li>
            <li>I slept with a du-rag and woke up the next day and took my braids out and my hair was wavy and completely defined.  </li>
            <li>I love the simplistic packaging and old fashion tin can.</li>
            <li>sure if these are long discontinued dried out surplus and being sold by a liquidator but please be aware you will not be able to scrape anything from this hard hard hard</li>

            <li> or shoot the one solid piece of pomade down the ice !&lt;</li>
            <li> Sticking with the Luster&#x27;s Pink and Carrot oil</li>
            <li> I sectioned my hair then worked this product through out my hair and thoroughly detangled my hair with a wide tooth comb</li>
            <li> This left my hair laid down and did not dry my hair out overnight leaving it hard like wavebuilder.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend using this product especially if your a serious waver.</li>
            <li> It left my hair looking and feeling heavy sticky and weighd down.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t flake like some of the other pomades.</li>
            <li> Stay away from the conventional pomades containing petrolatum or mineral oil in the ingredients.</li>
            <li> it keep my hair shinning and lays it down</li>
            <li> Lays my hair down well.</li>
            <li> I would say the product lasted a little over a month because I was using other products in conjuntion with this one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any other!</li>
            <li> It kept my waves it line and made a lot of people think I had less hair than I did</li>
            <li> In my opinion, it does leave a little bit of a build up.</li>
            <li> Might have to pick a few grease balls out of your hair.</li>
            <li> It was brick hard.</li>
            <li> This hair Pomade is as hard as surfboard wax.</li>
            <li> I thought this pomade was going to be really thick</li>
            <li> This is for thick hair</li>
            <li> and I have some thick hair.</li>
            <li> Not good in my opinion</li>
            <li> but I got tired of using wavebuilder even tho wavebuilder</li>
            <li> Will def help your wave game.</li>
            <li> Extremely difficult to brush through my hair.  </li>
            <li> I was sadly mistaken.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients are organic and there is little to no oil residue and nasty build up -- a must buy!</li>
            <li> but it was very difficult getting the pomade out the can.  </li>
            <li> Cold label is the coldest!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product..</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t anything I can say bad about it!!!</li>

            <li> Again another natural product that really isnt that good. Sticking with the Luster&#x27;s Pink and Carrot oil</li>
            <li> Beautiful product for people who actually know how to wolf period.</li>

            <li> Great product, all natural ingredients, and speedy delivery!!!</li>
            <li> Smells good. Arrived on time but it was very difficult getting the pomade out the can.  It was brick hard.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff right here. It kept my waves it line and made a lot of people think I had less hair than I did and I didn&#x27;t have to use a lot of it. It didn&#x27;t break me out which was good because I have sensitive skin so I was able to keep it in my hair overnight with a tsurag on. I would say the product lasted a little over a month because I was using other products in conjuntion with this one. Definitely recommend using this product especially if your a serious waver.</li>
            <li> Not going to lie. I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product.. It left my hair looking and feeling heavy sticky and weighd down. Extremely difficult to brush through my hair.  Same thing with the sculpting butter and the juices and berries.. Not good in my opinion</li>
            <li> After washing and conditioning my hair, then applying this pomade the first thing I noticed was how it made my waves pop even though I&#x27;m in a wolfing session and how it held my hair in place.  Everything was good, until the smell hit my nose.  I assumed it would smell similar to the Wave and Scalp Butter.  I was sadly mistaken.  The only thing that stops me from purchasing this pomade again is the smell.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because I had found out about it from WAVERS on YOU TUBE. It is an okay product that doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling greasy  nor weighed down even though it has some hold. Smells good but too costly for long term usage.</li>
            <li> This hair Pomade is as hard as surfboard wax. If I knock the side of the can on the table I bet the whole thing falls out in one piece. I could use this as a hockey puck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not able to use. Beware !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you need a spare hockey puck !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if these are long discontinued dried out surplus and being sold by a liquidator but please be aware you will not be able to scrape anything from this hard hard hard pomade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you buy this you&#x27;re either going to yell &#x27;Surfs Up ! &#x27; or shoot the one solid piece of pomade down the ice !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No Thanks !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant  about buying wave grease off Amazon but I got tired of using wavebuilder even tho wavebuilder was costing about 3 or 4 dollars a jar I wanted to try something different. I thought this pomade was going to be really thick but it wasn&#x27;t thank god but it smells way better than wave builder and it has a strong hold and believe me it&#x27;s worth the money thank you cold label I will be buying more of this and trying more of your products imma leave wavebuilder alone and start using my new favorite product thanks again</li>
            <li> Great pomade was a true upgrade from Murray&#x27;s or sporting waves</li>
            <li> A great product to enhance your waves</li>
            <li> Its simply amazing, theres nothin else to say</li>
            <li> ok hold probably better for thinner hair or fresh cuts. can&#x27;t get over the strong grapefruit smell.</li>
            <li> It really does the job!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product made my scalp ITCH!!! And took the moisture out of my hair, even after applying moisturizer!!! I will NOT purchase again.</li>
            <li> It actually maintained my hair for a good number of hours. if not almost a full day. I sectioned my hair then worked this product through out my hair and thoroughly detangled my hair with a wide tooth comb then put my hair in two French Braids. I slept with a du-rag and woke up the next day and took my braids out and my hair was wavy and completely defined.  This stuff gives my hair great hold. you can add a little more too your edges.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always needed a nice, organic product that keeps my waves patted down during &amp;#34;wolfin&#x27;&amp;#34; season, and this is absolutely it! The ingredients are organic and there is little to no oil residue and nasty build up -- a must buy!</li>
            <li> Great product smells great great hold and light weight</li>
            <li> I like it keep my hair shinning and lays it down and u cant really put too much n ya head its good though</li>
            <li> All wavers need this it is all natural and smells great it has great hold for when waves are getting wild and makes your waves look more defined also helps train waves its easy to wash out not greasy and promotes great healthy thick hair growth by giving your hair a nutritious hair environment.. I got the wave and scalp butter great for  maintaining waves and fresh haircuts.. I just ordered the 7 juices and berries can&#x27;t wait to review it I&#x27;ve heard great things... Cold label best products made just for waves</li>
            <li> This is for thick hair and I have some thick hair. I have to put a lot of this on to get everything perfect. I love the smell, I love the hold. This can get pricer as you keep &amp;#34;wolfing&amp;#34; but you shouldn&#x27;t have to go through maybe two cans before a haircut. I know when my hair is shorter, this will last awhile.</li>
            <li> Stay away from the conventional pomades containing petrolatum or mineral oil in the ingredients. This left my hair laid down and did not dry my hair out overnight leaving it hard like wavebuilder.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t anything I can say bad about it!!! I don&#x27;t use any other! Cold label is the coldest!</li>
            <li> This is best wolfing pomade I have used to date. However, it is very pungent and overpowers my deodorant - much to my dismay.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use it until a comparably effective but fragrant-free wolfing pomade becomes available.</li>
            <li> I love the simplistic packaging and old fashion tin can. It works for wolfin your waves. Has very good hold and sheen. Feels very natural in you hair and hasn&#x27;t caused me scalp irritation or itching. What I don&#x27;t like is the smell. It has that musky old school &amp;#34;Blue Magic&amp;#34; smell thats not so pleasant and can become overpowering. The product doesn&#x27;t dissipate in the hands so evenly and some chunks are present. Might have to pick a few grease balls out of your hair.</li>
            <li> love it keep my hair silky and shiny thanks</li>
            <li> love this pomade, will buy on the reg</li>
            <li> Great product. Lays my hair down well. In my opinion, it does leave a little bit of a build up. Other than that, great product</li>
            <li> Overrated Shea moisture three butters is much better, and gives your hair a natural shine and silkier waves, trust me, one again another overrated product to take black men&#x27;s money.</li>
            <li> Awesome hold! Applies nice and easy.</li>
            <li> Smells great and washes out easy too. This one is just like the regular pomade but this one is a bit stronger of a hold. I have the regular one too and use it right after a fresh cut and from then out I use this one. Will def help your wave game.</li>
            <li> I have spinnin shiny waves because of this.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best pomade I have used and now I can retire my can of Murray&#x27;s pomade. This pomade is not too heavy, doesn&#x27;t leave buildup and smells very good. Holds well and doesn&#x27;t make your hair look like you have a ton of beeswax in it</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Made for that wolfing season!!!</li>
            <li> This is definitely a great product. It smells great and doesnt leave an enormous amount of build up. The only thing was it&#x27;s brickhard in the can but once you get some it lathers together well.</li>
            <li> great product plus very fast delivery</li>
            <li> if your wolfin dont put anything in your hair but this! period. great great product</li>
            <li> Trying to switch from Murrays (chemicals), my husband bought this to hold his hair.  Initially, it took a lot of brushing and reapplying, but it worked.  Not quite the hold that Murrays gives, but having no chemicals on his hair and scalp is worth it.  Very thick and smells nice.</li>
            <li> This hold may have been too strong for my hair.  I found that it actually caused my wave pattern to fork in a couple of spots after only 1 overnight sleep with my Tsu Rag.  Not impressed.  Would have voted 2.5 if given the option.</li>
            <li> A great product smell amazingly good a must have when wolfin....love it look in on All clod label products 2 thumbs up.</li>
