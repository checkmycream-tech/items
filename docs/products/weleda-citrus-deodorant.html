            <li>Great product,</li>
            <li>Weleda Wildrose Deodorant spray is made with great odor neutralizers, like citronella.</li>

            <li>A great product.  </li>
            <li>, the product does a great job preventing body odor for me.</li>
            <li>Thankfully it hasn&#x27;t been to the point of embarrassment and one great thing is that this product does not stain my shirts, nor does my sweat.</li>

            <li>It comes in a very nice glass bottle with a sprayer that never breaks.</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t seem very effective.</li>
            <li>With Weleda, that doesn&#x27;t happen, the smell kind of lingers on in a very pleasant way, without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing!</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t think it would work for me, all I have to do is think about getting b.o. and bada bing!</li>
            <li>I like the citrus scent better, but works wonderfully!</li>
            <li>I tried many deodorants (non-antiperspirants) and this one works the best!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m REALLY loving it!</li>
            <li>I love the Weleda deodorants, they are the best I can find out without aluminum</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant.  </li>
            <li>This has a pleasant, not overpowering smell.  </li>
            <li>The scent is VERY STRONG!  </li>
            <li>This product is good - it neutralizes the odors, but it didn&#x27;t stop the sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved the scent.</li>
            <li>Good ingredients.</li>
            <li>It smells great--- like rose perfume.</li>
            <li>I like it as it&#x27;s non-toxic and smells good.</li>
            <li>Anyways, I loved it as soon as I tried it.</li>
            <li>smelling good from morning to bed time.</li>
            <li>This smells so good.  </li>
            <li>The rose smell is great but something in this product cause my skin to breakout in a rash.  </li>
            <li>It smells good and is not poisonous.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work well for me as deodorant but has good smell.</li>
            <li>and I think it is really good</li>
            <li>Spray this on your pits and feel good about yourself.</li>
            <li>this is good deodorant.  </li>

            <li>The smell is good...</li>
            <li>This deodorant smells really good and does the job.</li>
            <li>An excellent all-natural deodorant, light rose scent.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it works great with my chemistry.</li>
            <li>I love this deodorant and this is a great price.</li>
            <li>The fragrance was VERY overwhelming.</li>

            <li>This deodorant works great, much better than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Great stuff:-)</li>
            <li>Was expecting better judging from the great reviews.</li>
            <li>Anyway, perhaps it is just my own chemistry and would be good on others?</li>
            <li>Its best right out of the shower.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The deodorant can also be used as a light fragrance mist upon the body itself, as the properties are actually good for the skin!</li>
            <li>It works great, smells good and is very good for my sensitive underarm skin!  </li>
            <li>The smell of this on my skin isn&#x27;t very pleasant and it doesn&#x27;t keep me fresh.</li>

            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love the smell!</li>
            <li>The fragrance is lovely!  </li>
            <li>I actually really love the floral smell of this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love this deodorant!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Best deodorant on the planet~*!*!*!.&lt;br /&gt;Exotic, pretty scent~</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this deodorant!</li>
            <li>I love this deodorant!  </li>
            <li>The sage one, however, smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Not as amazing as I was hoping.</li>
            <li>If you like rose smell with a touch of lemon you will like this.</li>
            <li>It has a spicier, earthy rose scent from the geranium oil in it.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of rose water.</li>
            <li>It kind of does.</li>
            <li>I did just start to use a rose water with aloe and hyaluronic acid in it as well</li>
            <li>Mostly Effective.</li>
            <li>Reduced sweating, Not as good with odor control, but Much better than the Jason Brand deodorants (had to throw them away after using 1 time).</li>
            <li>Nice rose odor.</li>
            <li>Rose odor can be unisex, not too feminine.</li>
            <li>All it does is overpower your nose with rose.</li>
            <li>I loved the smell of the citrus version but this one works much better.</li>
            <li>and I bought the Rose one for myself and the Sage one for my boyfriend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the type of rose smell that I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Perhaps the rose just doesn&#x27;t cut it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The rose smell on its own is nice though, maybe it&#x27;ll serve as a nice body spray in the summer.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s be honest.</li>
            <li>But the scent is nice</li>
            <li>May make a nice body spray, but doesn&#x27;t cut it for keeping the funk away.</li>
            <li>I was beyond thrilled when I found a rose-scented deodorant.  </li>
            <li>It was an absolute dream to find that scent in a deodorant -- how perfect was that?!  </li>
            <li>I suggest avalon organics grapefruit and geranium spray if you are looking for something effective (you may have to reapply it once or twice if it is warm weather</li>
            <li>I also wasn&#x27;t thrilled with any of the scent options for the Weleda deodorant.</li>
            <li>Smells like a funky rose</li>
            <li>and so it&#x27;s considered hazardous and not returnable.</li>
            <li>Smells nice when you spray it on, but does NOT control odor throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Smell nice.  </li>
            <li>I like the rose sent as well.</li>
            <li>The product smells nice but did not work out for me.</li>
            <li>this smelled nice.</li>
            <li>The rose scent is more like a gorgeous perfume.</li>
            <li>One thing I like about the rose versus the citrus is that it doesn&#x27;t sting my skin at all after I shave.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise it doesn&#x27;t seem to be too effective.  </li>
            <li>Nice smelling.</li>
            <li>I might get a hint of rose but never body odor.  </li>
            <li>This is a very strong rose smell, which I should have known from the name.</li>
            <li>It works well, and best of all, it smells (to my nose, at least) simply wonderful!</li>
            <li>Great price and quick delivery from this seller, will use again.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells very strongly of roses.</li>
            <li>Very strong floral/baby powderish smell.</li>
            <li>The fragrance begins very strong but very pleasant and genuinely rose-y, not artificial rose.  </li>
            <li>The best thing is that I think it works even better than the natural deodorant I had before which I was very satisfied with.  </li>
            <li>It works and even though I don&#x27;t love the smell of roses, I love when my pits smell like roses!</li>
            <li>this one just happens to be perfect for my body chemistry and i completely trust this company!</li>
            <li>I get comments all the time on how nice my \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; is :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s effective, smells lovely, and a bottle lasts for *months*.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of natural deodorants and this is the best.  </li>
            <li>you are not a &amp;#34;floral&amp;#34; person, meaning you don&#x27;t enjoy or smell as good with perfumes or products with floral based notes</li>
            <li>On top of it all, you can not return it because it is classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases and cannot be returned to Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>Like all Weleda products, this one is excellent, and the odor is natural and pleasing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soooo convenient to use &amp; I love the rose scent.</li>
            <li>This is the best of the bunch by far.</li>
            <li>I SO wanted to love this product, and again, it&#x27;s definitely a rose scent (</li>
            <li>Best natural deodorant I have found.</li>
            <li>This is the best I&#x27;ve found so far</li>
            <li>Amazon handled this situation with excellent professional courtesy.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a non stick, safe, yet effective deodorant.  </li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s not a horrible smell, just kind of...grandmotherly).  </li>
            <li>I believe what I experienced is the result of the deodorant getting too hot since all of these shipments arrived extremely warm out of the packaging.</li>
            <li>I do love it though &amp; it seems to work good &amp; is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>I bought this because of the good reviews and was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>Of the natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried throughout the years, this one works the best and smells fabulous!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m so happy this is offered on Amazon and at such a great price.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE the scent of rose, and love using rose-scented products, like bubble baths, lotions, etc.  </li>
            <li>The smell is VERY strong and overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>i bought this product because of the reviews talking very good of if, but i tried it and the first day it worked very good, but its been a couple of weeks and by middle of the  day its not working.</li>
            <li>this product have too strong of a &#x27;rose&#x27; scent, making me smell like a hippy?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>not something weirdly rose like some \\&quot;rose\\&quot;-scented products), but it&#x27;s just too strong and perfume-y for my taste.  </li>
            <li>Most important thing to remind folks is that it&#x27;s a very strong rose smell.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients says it is fragrance free, but the smell is overwhelming!</li>
            <li>, I can say that this one works okay, but the rose scent is too strong.</li>
            <li>love the smell and effectiveness of this fine product, have been using for some years now - a zippy winner!</li>
            <li>The scent of this deodorant is amazingly wonderful as I love the scent of wild roses but after 3 hours there is a strong perspiration odor</li>
            <li>you tell I love the smell of roses?</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this deoderant.  </li>
            <li>I try to be a healthy person for the most part.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;ok</li>
            <li>I was impressed, but I wasn&#x27;t totally sold...</li>
            <li>I really love the scent of this.</li>
            <li>I love this deodorant.</li>
            <li>My husband loves the way it smells.  :-)  </li>
            <li>(Mostly user error)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very happy with this stuff overall.</li>
            <li>I love this product -</li>
            <li>Thank you amazon you save me money and time!!! :)</li>
            <li>I also love that it comes in a glass bottle instead of plastic, so A+ for packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>I would like to say that immediately after you stop using mainstream, toxic deodorant, you will sweat and smell more for a WHILE, no matter what product you use.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll be trying out more scents of Weleda soon.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>It is way too potent and intoxicating.  </li>
            <li>Love the scent of this deodorant and that it is spray.</li>
            <li>On the days that I have more pain</li>
            <li>and I use it on my under arms before I  use the deodorant now and it seems to help even more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you Weleda - An Outstanding Product</li>
            <li>But for me I absolutely love the scent, it reminds me of the tea-rose perfume oil they used to sell at the body shop years ago (Canada).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to any lady wanting a more healthy deodorant</li>
            <li>And personally I love the fragrance.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more of these to stock up for sure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Weleda deodorant for three or four months now, and have been generally pleased.  </li>
            <li>The Sage Deodorant, I purchased for my husband and he is equally pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I think this product is better for people with deodorant allergies like me.</li>
            <li>I love Weleda</li>
            <li>I want to love this product..</li>
            <li>In fact, I think I smell better when I&#x27;m not using any product at all - this spray</li>
            <li>and I wanted something more</li>
            <li>But no doubt I&#x27;ll be able to use this through the cooler months.  </li>
            <li>I also use the almond face cream and more.</li>
            <li>The smell is okay</li>
            <li>Arm &amp; hammer works way better</li>
            <li>The fragrance of this does not smell like roses, but more a chemical smell.</li>
            <li>I tried applying more... still no difference.</li>
            <li>It is definitely more of a manly smell</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t my favorite either - a mixture of alcohol and roses.</li>
            <li>Firstly, I enjoy the rose fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It smells good and worth the money.</li>
            <li>Ok yes it works but:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>It has a rose scent combined with an abrasive cheap perfume odor.</li>
            <li>Unless you like the smell of cheap perfume (and your own BO), keep looking.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I have been buying it for over 2 years now, and it lasts most of the day.</li>
            <li>I mostly love it for the scent -</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear most perfumes because they give me headaches (probably from the synthetic ingredients), so this kills 2 birds with one stone.</li>
            <li>This deoderant smells so uplifting and refreshing.</li>
            <li>Love this spray.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of roses, but this is a bit musty for me.</li>
            <li>the smell is lovely.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the smell of this deodorant.</li>
            <li>** from me:-)</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>I love roses.</li>
            <li>I switched to Lafe&#x27;s spray deodorant, which is a 0 on the toxin scale, and it works MUCH better without any toxins.</li>
            <li>I really love the smell of this deodorant but</li>
            <li>I love all three scents.</li>
            <li>love this deodorant and I won&#x27;t give up on it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS DEODERANT AND WILL CONTINUE TO BUY IT</li>
            <li>ALSO LOVE THE SAGE FRAGRANCE.  </li>
            <li>I love that we can now get it on Amazon for a fraction of the price</li>
            <li>It might be okay as a body spray..but not as a deodorant.</li>
            <li>The deodorant works well, even after many hours of sweaty activity, and provides a pleasing scent that isn&#x27;t too overpowering.</li>
            <li>I really love the scent of this deodorant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to sweat, thanks; I&#x27;m a mammal.</li>
            <li>It would be a bit better with jasmine or something to off set it.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have to carry it with me to make sure I was OK by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite~</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>Love this product it works</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell as nice as it would sound.</li>
            <li>pat it in, then spray 2 more pumps.  </li>
            <li>No mixture of funky sweat and flowers,  just a light ,feminine ,very confident, sweet smelling armpit!</li>
            <li>This pleasant-smelling Weleda Wild Rose deodorant is very effective for me, a 100 lb salsa dancing vegan living in a tropical climate.</li>
            <li>This deodorant spray smells wonderful, but if I&#x27;m being honest, it works like more of a body spray and less of a deodorant.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and leaves a light fresh rose scent for most of the day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But even with the many good products out there, prior to using Weleda Wildrose Deodorant, never before have I been so delighted with the performance and ingredients of Weleda</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good deodorant, though it does sting a lot if you use it after shaving, hence the 4 stars.</li>
            <li>Very important-if you don&#x27;t like rose smelling things this is not for you!</li>
            <li>I have used sprays and roll on&#x27;s for a long time but this deodorant is the BEST.</li>
            <li>They need to come up with a much better and easier spray and go easy on the alcohol; it stings when used after shaving.  </li>
            <li>Rose smell is a bit string in application but calms quickly</li>
            <li>thankfully, after an easy call to Amazon, they were able to refund the purchase price.</li>
            <li>The scent is very feminine, gentle, and just perfect.</li>
            <li>Honestly, it is much like using rose extract or rose oil.</li>
            <li>When you have to use natural products there aren&#x27;t a lot to choose from and on top of that the products vary in quality greatly.</li>
            <li>After trying so many natural deodorants that don&#x27;t work at all this was a great discovery.</li>
            <li>Rose fragrance is a bit too strong and sweet for my tastes.</li>
            <li>It is very overwhelming when you first apply the product.</li>
            <li>I let her use deodorant but wanted a natural alternative and found this all the reviews were great.</li>
            <li>I LOVE my wild rose deodorant!  </li>
            <li>Was looking for a mor natural option and this product works great</li>
            <li>I was really amazed by how much I loved this product.</li>
            <li>Refreshing summer deodorant cooling with clean refreshing light scent.</li>
            <li>still looking for the perfect deodorant without aluminum and other quimicals  </li>
            <li>Finally something that works and smells good!</li>
            <li>Its easy to apply</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t too overwhelmingly floral and it keeps her smelling fresh most days.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a nice rose, not too old lady.</li>
            <li>I can understand some of the reviewers take on the smell being strong, or powdery</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell strong either.</li>
            <li>IS WAY TO STRONG</li>
            <li>Since purchasing it online and using it for months now, I can say that I&#x27;m part of the group of people who don&#x27;t like the strong scent.</li>
            <li>otherwise but this is so strong it makes you sick.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is just a really strong smelling body spray.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice scent, not powdery or old ladyish like some rose things can be.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just strong.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this after reading a number of good reviews on here.</li>
            <li>I gave it a 4 because it does smell a bit strong when you first put it on, but it is a nice floral scent to me.  </li>
            <li>I first started trying this product about a year ago, and it was amazing.</li>
            <li>but all natural deodorants are not the most effective… Has a nice scent and works better than the crystal…</li>
            <li>it happens), I need to reapply or supplement with baking soda, but generally it&#x27;s pretty effective.</li>
            <li>It smelled exactly like a rose picked from the garden.</li>
            <li>A bit alcohol-y when it first goes on, but then the rose smell takes over.  </li>
            <li>I have had this particular problem with all deodorants and antiperspirants, this one works the best and is natural.</li>
            <li>I like the scent of this just fine.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fine if I&#x27;m going to the gym and prepared to sweat.</li>
            <li>It smells fine in the bottle so perhaps that is the case.</li>
            <li>When I was done, I was sweating like a pregnant nun in church, like I had just showered in my yoga clothes!</li>
            <li>This smells like cheap, strong cologne</li>
            <li>Natural, pleasant smelling, and the alcohol disinfects any bacteria.</li>
            <li>Best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried so far!</li>
            <li>Pure Rose scentl</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Usually a huge fan of Weleda products (lip balm, toothpaste, lotion, oils, etc)</li>
            <li>None of them worked very well at keeping me from getting stinky on warm days.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It really does eliminate odor well - although it some times has to be reapplied throughout the day, the nice thing is you can do that</li>
            <li>You REALLY have to pour it on for it to be effective.</li>
            <li>It smells like cheap perfume.  </li>
            <li>I very much enjoy the zero chemical fix.  </li>
            <li>but the rose smell is very granny like.</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic all the time</li>
            <li>The deodorant smells fantastic and works well.</li>
            <li>but i really enjoy this one.</li>
            <li>Since we are all different, I can&#x27;t say how it will work for you, but I was kinda happy with it as a Freshen-Upper until I started to itch.</li>
            <li>free</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many natural deodorants and even made my own.</li>
            <li>Planning to buy the full line of Wild Rose scent!</li>
            <li>I love the scent (more like a perfume than a deodorant) and it works really well.  </li>
            <li>By about 12:00 the old lady smell went away and emerge a lovely rose smell which is still there at 6:00pm.</li>
            <li>For me, this product did not work very well overall, but was good for now and then use - like after a good workout, etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m done looking; this is by far the most effective deodorant I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I love Weleda products and really wanted to love this, but I just can&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>After putting it on at 10:00am (2 sprays) with a layer of coconut oil over the top to easy the smell at first.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t sweat very much, don&#x27;t mind smelling flowery and are able to reapply through out the day this product will work fine.</li>
            <li>I love how this product feels on my skin, it is a nice mist and it leaves my skin feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li>I love how this product feels on my skin, it is a nice mist and it leaves my skin feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li>I was really expecting to smell a combination of b.o. and roses, but there was no sign of b.o. at all!!!</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve decided that sweating is fine and first tried the Healthy Deodorant stick and even with reapplication throughout the day i felt like i had BO.</li>
            <li>The rose scent is pretty strong at first</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to use a light deodorant that smells good, has a slightly astringent quality, and does not coat one&#x27;s underarms with a waxy build-up that transfers (and can discolor)</li>
            <li>Finally found a deodorant that works, amazing!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>Fantastic Rose oil makes this &#x27;old school&#x27; spray on a delight to the senses!  </li>
            <li>and it was worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Smells great and lasts long.  </li>
            <li>I love it and absolutely works for me!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is worth the price,save your money don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li>May try the tea tree one next and see if that&#x27;s more effective.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind the smell but even though I am a light sweater, the scent is quickly overridden by BO.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several nontoxic varieties of deodorant and was struggling to find one with a pleasant scent that worked well and didn&#x27;t cost a fortune.</li>
            <li>but although this one is initially strong it tempers quickly and remains mild throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Smells mildly rose, the mild scent lingers somewhat, seems to be reasonably effective though not as much so as the natural mineral stone.  </li>
            <li>On really hot or sweaty days, reapplying is a must, but this works the best by far of all the natural deodorants she&#x27;s tried.</li>
            <li>Of the natural deodorants I have tried this is definitely my favorite!</li>
            <li>I have also been becoming more environmentally aware and trying to use more natural products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I switched to natural deodorants and have tried magnesium oil (cannot use after shaving) and a couple of Lush brand deodorants (somewhat effective, but not that convenient), but this is effective, and the rose scent is really nice, but does not interfere with other scents in lotions or perfumes.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m probably 90-95% odor free, and with this maybe 80-85%, but that 10% is worth it to not use chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;i</li>
            <li>The spray is nice because there&#x27;s no stickiness and it allows you to sweat naturally while masking odor.</li>
            <li>This deodorant is really lovely and very feminine .</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even begin to explain the scent, it is a nauseating, old lady rose smell, with a burst of stench that permeates throughout the NYC subway.  </li>
            <li>I am thrilled that I switched to this deodorant from my old aluminum based brand.</li>
            <li>These products have kept me fresh, comfortable and benefited my skin completely.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought hey I will do some of my own research and look into some natural deodorants.</li>
            <li>was also expecting this to smell sweet (I don&#x27;t know why)</li>
            <li>only good thing that came from this is that I kept the bottle.</li>
            <li>Works very well, but I don&#x27;t love the floral scent.</li>
            <li>Good quality just a tad pricey but will order again next summer.</li>
            <li>I would probably recommend the sage flavor and would probably buy it again for my boyfriend just because I love the smell so much, but for me, I&#x27;m gonna either use Toms deodorant which I like or use the one I made myself.</li>
            <li>I ended up ordering wild rose.</li>
            <li>In addition, the wild rose scent reminds me of a grandma.  </li>
            <li>Bought this product based on two different reports that it was a good option for deodorant without the harmful chemicals found in anti-perspirant.</li>
            <li>and I the a full day of protection.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Since it is marked as hazardous no way to return for refund.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so surprised honestly.</li>
            <li>I might have to see if they have a wild rose perfume too.</li>
            <li>It does have a VERY strong scent at first, very perfume-y, but then it wears off.</li>
            <li>Okay, not to turn into a Calgon commercial here, but I really do LOVE this deodorant.</li>
            <li>I quickly moved on to the Herban Cowboy brand and haven&#x27;t been happier.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells great and it works well and seems to last me the whole day, even after doing yoga.</li>
            <li>I am allergic to most main stream deodorants and antiperspirants.</li>
            <li>Came to my door quickly.</li>
            <li>I have used many commercial deodorant products throughout my lifetime until I became better informed about the \\&quot;ingredients\\</li>
            <li>Wears off too quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pregnant and sweat alot too...</li>
            <li>I was super reluctant to buy this because I sweat.</li>
            <li>The high humidity and temperatures should prove as a better indicator as to</li>
            <li>That would give it more of a chemical smell in comparison to rose water made by other means.</li>
            <li>The rose smell is STRONG, but only when it first goes on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to live a more natural/holistic lifestyle.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t have to use much as the scent is strong.</li>
            <li>I had growing concerns about using many chemicals on my skin because as I get older I have noticed my skin seems to be more sensitive to things.</li>
            <li>Its made out of glass and after dumping the contents down the sink and peeling off the label, I have this really cute and functional bottle that I can throw my own diy beauty products in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I went through many stinky days searching for a natural deodorant that worked and this one ended my search!</li>
            <li>It may not be the most potent deodorant, but it kept me fresh for a long day of 4th of July picnics!</li>
            <li>Finally, a responsible and effective natural deodorant!</li>
            <li>Organic Island and Green Tidings work great and don&#x27;t cause that sting.</li>
            <li>Excersize, eat healthy, use natural products when they are convenient or if they work..   </li>
            <li>think most naturals items won&#x27;t stop the sweat (after all it is the natural thing that our body does), so maybe the problem is me.</li>
            <li>If your nose isn&#x27;t as sensitive as mine, you may do better.</li>
            <li>Works well staying fresh all day.</li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>found that the scent stayed fresh from around 7am when I applied it, to around 1130am.</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>Despite the price, this is my favorite natural deodorant (some just don&#x27;t cut it for me--</li>
            <li>This is a nice alternative to traditional deodorants.  </li>
            <li>i use it in conjunction with my salt rock to kill bacteria + smell nice &amp; it works swell for the latter job.</li>
            <li>Great if you&#x27;re only into all natural stuff-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitly worth trying.</li>
            <li>I wanted to switch from using deodorants with aluminum to more of a natural deodorant</li>
            <li>I love roses wild and</li>
            <li>This one did okay working with your body&#x27;s natural smell</li>
            <li>it makes you feel fresh after applying it</li>
            <li>This deodorant keeps me feeling fresh all day.  </li>
            <li>this product definitely doesn&#x27;t smell like roses but it works and it does spray on nicely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried quite a few natural deodorants looking for the one that works best for me.</li>
            <li>It was okay, but had an \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; vibe.</li>
            <li>I purchased the white rose fragrances.</li>
            <li>This is by far one of my favorite deodorants.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product as I am looking for a more natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>rose only detectable if you get your face all up in your arm pit.  </li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to chemical fragrances, so I was happy to find out that this is natural and does not negatively affect me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is \\&quot;wild rose\\&quot; and the Weleda take seems to have a hint of citrus in it as well, but it is fresh and lovely, and again, to my nose, not very cloying, or overly sweet as some rose scents can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was too excited to write this review, and my armpits still smell fresh (the rest of my body, not so much)   </li>
            <li>Pretty pleased so far!</li>
            <li>The package does recommend that you spray it, as you need to, since it isn&#x27;t made with chemicals that normally \\&quot;kill\\&quot; scent, as well as serve as strong anti-persiparant components.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s really hot (or I&#x27;m super stressed -</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m 31) but it mellows out pretty quick.</li>
            <li>In frustration I marched right into my nearest drugstore and grabbed some Lady</li>
            <li>Oh, right...</li>
            <li>The sample lotion that came with it smelled right though.</li>
            <li>But this product just doesn&#x27;t smell right on me.</li>
            <li>I am hoping to find a local store that sells it in the hopes that I can get back to using the beautiful rose-scented deodorant that this use to be when I tried it a year ago.</li>
            <li>It has a VERY strong smell, and to me is similar to mosquito repellant.</li>
            <li>It is a lovely rose scent, but it was too strong for me, very perfume-y, and I don&#x27;t know about anyone else, but I want my deodorant to smell subtle, and my scented body lotion to be what people smell</li>
            <li>I purposely try to get a little on my hair in the mornings because I love the rose scent so much.</li>
            <li>I spray the Weleda first then after it dries (pretty quickly)</li>
            <li>So, either buy this from a local store or be super sure you want it before you purchase.</li>
            <li>I carry it with me because like most natural deodorants on me, it doesn&#x27;t last for more than 8 hours.</li>
            <li>(Usually Amazon is great about this.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well, when I was at our local Whole Foods Market recently, and saw a sample/tester available of this product, I tried it, and oh my gosh, did I smell like rose for a while!  </li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s ok for the first 4-5 hours of the day, if you work for 10-12 hours like I do, the positive effects of the spray have COMPLETELY worn off before the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>Of course, if you absolutely abhor roses and have a tendency to smell intensely, then you would probably be better served with a traditional strong deodorant+antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>On the days that I am not in as much pain I will smell like a rose until the following day.&#x27;</li>
            <li>I very much wanted to like this, but its application is a bit impractical.  </li>
            <li>I love Weleda products, as they are all natural and high quality.  </li>
            <li>I tried the deodorant the first day I got it.</li>
            <li>And to my surprise, it really worked!</li>
            <li>So this morning, I laced up my tennis shoes and did a 45 minute high endurance work-out burning over 800 calories!!</li>
            <li>but first I&#x27;m hitting the shower.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful when you apply it, and then the scent fades so that you can wear other perfumes... just as other reviews said.  </li>
            <li>, I love that I can use every last drop that comes in each bottle (no wasting that nub at the end of a stick of deodorant).  </li>
            <li>I love my regular deodorant/antiperspirant the way it smells, and blocks sweat.</li>
            <li>I only wish I were more efficient at aiming it at my armpit</li>
            <li>Finds out, the aluminum in deodorants can cause breast cancer, and thus begins my struggle for a natural, aluminum free</li>
            <li>I tried sticking it out for two weeks thinking maybe my body had to get used to the sudden change in deos, but it seems the more</li>
            <li>I really do!  </li>
            <li>I thought for sure this would be the same.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for a few days now, pretty good.</li>
            <li>First ...</li>
            <li>I have tried quite a few natural deodorants and this is the best so far.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work as well as regular deodorant but better than Toms</li>
            <li>the first ingredient is alcohol and it burns.</li>
            <li>Products are always consistent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen first hand what alzheimers does to a person.</li>
            <li>Love the product line but this deodorant smells a like a French Granny and doesn&#x27;t work....</li>
            <li>Price is on par with Sprouts store where I bought my first bottle.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every natural aluminum free deodorant out there - nothing works for me except this one.  </li>
            <li>and you are willing to reapply it throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought although I would never put it on my body, I could use it for an air freshener.  </li>
            <li>However, during hot summer months you will have to reapply a couple of times.</li>
            <li>Regular deodorant (not clinical strength) works just great for me, and I don&#x27;t actually sweat much</li>
            <li>My choice when it comes to deodorants ;)</li>
            <li>it is safe and it actually works!</li>
            <li>This finally made me feel ok in my lifestyle choices.</li>
            <li>I had higher hopes for this.  </li>
            <li>It does smell pretty though and will probably use it as a body spray in the summer.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for several months now, and totally love it.</li>
            <li>i have tried ALL of the natural, chemical free, etc., etc., etc.</li>
            <li>I first purchased the Weleda Citrus spray and it&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Through out the day if I&#x27;m running around or get hot</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is pleasant, but a little too strong for me - I didn&#x27;t think I could wear my fragrance and the deodorant at the same time - that&#x27;s why I gave the four stars.</li>
            <li>The wild rose scent isn&#x27;t so strong that it is obtrusive, yet, isn&#x27;t so subtle that you don&#x27;t feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I wear the rose in the summer and citrus and sage other times of the year.  </li>
            <li>The smell is attractive, the product is effective, and for the quality the price isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, but for an active person like myself it just didn&#x27;t cut it.  </li>
            <li>but I wear that one occasionally just because I love it so much.</li>
            <li>light fresh sent has kept me coming back year after year.</li>
            <li>I needed freshening up during the day as I went back to using my Dove Wild Rose scented antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>All natural, doesn&#x27;t stain my shirt, and believe it or not I&#x27;ve had it on all day and as I&#x27;m preparing for my shower, I did the special sniff test....</li>
            <li>So I decided to give this one a shot given the positive feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one scared me off because of the price and because I don&#x27;t love the smell of roses, but it was recommended by someone who works at my local naturals store, so I bought a small travel sized bottle and loved it so much that I&#x27;m now on my 3rd full sized bottle of this!</li>
            <li>If you are in doubt, I know that most natural food stores (i.e. \\&quot;Whole Paycheck\\&quot;, \\&quot;Wild</li>
            <li>I used it for two days (giving it a fair chance), but now I&#x27;m going back to my previous deodorant and throwing the full bottle of this Wildrose in the trash.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend if you are looking for a natural, aluminum free deodorant.</li>
            <li>typically like rose scent, but not this.</li>
            <li>There is a rather odd smell to it and the nice rose scent wears away to an odd smell I do not care for.  </li>
            <li>well my pits certainly don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>This is the first and only one that has left me not avoiding my own pits by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>We were using Toms of Main and OMG we stunk!</li>
            <li>I think this must have a very high alcohol content.</li>
            <li>Traditional antiperspirants/deodorants tend to build up defeating the purpose of wearing a deodorant in the first place: to feel clean.</li>
            <li>Does smell a bit strong, similar to the strength of a body spray (not near as strong as a perfume).</li>
            <li>can see here on the reviews that some folks didn&#x27;t really care for the scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m switching my whole family to this product, if it works for me, it will work for anyone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>really well</li>
            <li>, however, it works very well.</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>I think you can even use it as a perfume/body spray if you really like the scent.</li>
            <li>real test will be when I go to Asia this spring.</li>
            <li>, The price is reasonable and so is the shipping.</li>
            <li>product did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>I smelled as if I never even heard of deodorant my whole life.</li>
            <li>This one really works, but you may need to reapply during the day depending on your funk level.  </li>
            <li>If I were to continue using this product, it would only be used as a light scent or body mist.</li>
            <li>This is a spray deodorant that feels much lighter and cleaner than a roll on stick.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy this if I sweat a lot or did a lot of intense workouts.  </li>
            <li>Works very well as a deodorant</li>
            <li>Does not work very well to eliminate odor.</li>
            <li>This has worked really well for me.  </li>
            <li>No I have really smelly armpit odor</li>
            <li>so I expected this one to smell better.</li>
            <li>I really like the scent</li>
            <li>I probably reapply 2-3 times in winter and twice that much in summer.</li>
            <li>I am someone who tends to sweat a lot (which means I  can get really stinky).</li>
            <li>Once that happens, reapplication doesn&#x27;t really help.</li>
            <li>This finally makes me feel comfortable in my hippy self.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want any aluminum, thanks, and don&#x27;t want something that is against my perspiration.</li>
            <li>some white and lightly colored clothing.  </li>
            <li>If I sweat a lot, I do have to reapply, but I like the scent so much that it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li>Does not leave residue on shirts, and lasts for the whole day.</li>
            <li>The smell is too much for me.</li>
            <li>I spray it on in the morning, probably too much because I like the smell so much.  </li>
            <li>and I have tried MANY natural deodorants over the years with mixed results.</li>
            <li>I even tried adding my own essential oils (rosemary and peppermint) in order to do something, but no such luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you like rose, don&#x27;t like chemical heavy antiperspirants</li>
            <li>So when I put this product on it did smell like an old lady&#x27;s perfume, but I found that if you put coconut oil over the top it does reduce the smell enough that it isn&#x27;t over powering.</li>
            <li>But I can&#x27;t detect any rose smell on myself after a few minutes, so</li>
            <li>lost my head and left Weleda Wild Rose for awhile, I cheaped out and bought some arm n hammer natural 2 pack at CVS.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the rose smell</li>
            <li>Be aware that this product is reminiscent of perfume and has a mild floral scent.</li>
            <li>Very strongly scented, a little much.  </li>
            <li>It lasts long and isn&#x27;t an incredibly strong smell.</li>
            <li>Smells awesome, but it burns horribly when you put it on especially right after shaving.</li>
            <li>I think it is better smelling than the other Weleda scents.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the other fragrances Weleda makes, too, but I really love this one.</li>
            <li>I THINK THIS DEODORANT IS PRETTY STINKY AND COULD HAVE BEEN MADE A LITTLE BETTER SMELL.</li>
            <li>I would love to try one of the other scents as well.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>My first few sprays resulted with more product in the air then on my armpit.</li>
            <li>My wife has incredibly sensitive skin and spent years looking for a gentle, yet effective natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>If your underarms are just bare with no other material, you&#x27;ll be sweating &amp; stinking pretty quick &amp; this will not help that much.</li>
            <li>Better for me than conventional deodorants, even.</li>
            <li>Finally found the right deodorant!</li>
            <li>Smells nice but did very little to mask my body odor.</li>
            <li>and i think it&#x27;s the right amount, not too much to burn and enough to be effective for a few hours</li>
            <li>I have tried several natural deodorants, and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>It has a natural rather than synthetic scent and does exactly what it is made to do.</li>
            <li>It worked at first and then stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;After trying tons of natural deodorants</li>
            <li>Also I think if this is the first &#x27;natural&#x27; item you try it might take some getting used to the smell.</li>
            <li>The deodorant works very well in normal situations.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many natural deodorants now that I&#x27;m about to give up &amp; go back to the old Degree stuff I used to wear.</li>
            <li>This is ok, but doesn&#x27;t keep odor down that well.</li>
            <li>The scent also lasts very long which is unusual because natural deodorants tend to fade very quickly, making me feel self-conscious.</li>
            <li>Of course, I&#x27;ll have to get the more masculan, less rosey scent for the hubby..</li>
            <li>I have bought just about every natural one on the market, including the crystals, and even made my own deodorant, which worked, but was messy.  </li>
            <li>My main concern was with the odor control......</li>
            <li>and I think it does a decent job of making me feel and smell fresher if I spritz throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Particularly the cancer factor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(hope when I get older this will change).</li>
            <li>I never thought I was particularly smelly</li>
            <li>I mainly use it as a body spray.</li>
            <li>I think the citrus extracts in the other version caused a slight sting although it was NOT nearly bad enough to deter me from using (and loving!)</li>
            <li>I would reek to high heaven every time I used this spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works so much better than other natural ones in the summer.  </li>
            <li>and it works way better than any other natural deodorant that I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d suggest finding it, as I did, as a tester in a store, to see if you personally like it, because each person is different and will like different scents/strength of scents -- and you might love this!</li>
            <li>it makes me feel a little fancy too. :)</li>
            <li>Works pretty well, smells nice, just a little pricey for how long it lasts.</li>
            <li>and that seems to work really for me, when it comes to the natural stuff I like to layer since I can&#x27;t find any one product that does the trick.</li>
            <li>I was really looking for a natural product to replace my antiperspirant addiction, but even though I knew to expect sweat, this didn&#x27;t keep up with the smell.  </li>
            <li>This really was unexpected too.  </li>
            <li>and it is like starting fresh at the beginning of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have purchased this multiple times and will use this as long as it is available!</li>
            <li>I love how long it last on my arms.</li>
            <li>It reminds my of my grandma, and hopefully I&#x27;ll still be able to remember her in years to come because I haven&#x27;t destroyed my brain with heavy chemicals in my cosmetics.</li>
            <li>Anyways if you are natural and want a deoderant that doesnt stain and last all day and night, this is highly recommended by the sweaty pregnant woman...</li>
            <li>I think sometimes we put more thinking into what we put into our bodies and less about what we put on our bodies!</li>
            <li>&quot; thereof, and quickly opted to use only the natural applications that are not harmful to the body</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for organic deodorants that truly work and, unfortunately, this deodorant didn&#x27;t prove very effective for me.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll try one of the other scents but they weren&#x27;t available when I ordered.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one didn&#x27;t work as well as the regular deodorants that are full of  gross chemicals, but it did work better than some of the other natural deodorants I tried.</li>
            <li>I do not dislike the rose scent but find it to be a little bit too present, and it stays with you -- does not dissipate.  </li>
            <li>Goats\\&quot;, and \\&quot;New Sneezins\\&quot;,(PDX))</li>
            <li>and I live in AZ.</li>
            <li>I live in the tropics</li>
            <li>I like the other Weleda deodorants better, as the scents are more subtle.  </li>
            <li>Applying it right out of the shower while effective was so painful I&#x27;d rather stick with the tried and true perfumed talc powder.</li>
            <li>It worked throughout the whole day of stress chasing around a 2 year old in a busy farmers market and festival.</li>
            <li>far as the &amp;#34;old lady perfume&amp;#34; that I see other reviewers referencing: Yes you do smell it strongly when putting it on, probably because you have your arm in the air and are spraying it near your face!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very conscious of what I put on my skin and on which companies I support with my money</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re in the market for a natural deo, I highly recommend the Weleda citrus one.</li>
            <li>And I forgot to do an extra couple sprays in the afternoon (which I try to do on hot days just in case).</li>
            <li>And since the price in these stores is often double what it is on Amazon, this is a real treat for me to order it here!</li>
            <li>This has been the answer to my natural deodorant search!</li>
            <li>It pretty much last all day without any embarassing wear off as the day progresses.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and not sticky, like some other natural products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>not giving up on my search for a natural deo!</li>
            <li>I usually do not like using deoderant</li>
            <li>I have used the citrus in the past and think I like the citrus scent better.  </li>
            <li>But the first spray was definitely a tad overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t usually buy a lot of items with strong perfume, so it may not smell as strong with other people.  </li>
            <li>Definitely a huge let down.</li>
            <li>I love this deodarant, gave 4 only because it won&#x27;t last for whole day, although, its expected.</li>
            <li>Like other natural deodorants, it does not prevent odor from developing if I&#x27;m wearing a shirt that I&#x27;ve worn more than twice without washing it, even if I&#x27;ve only ever worn the shirt with deodorant on.  </li>
            <li>However, I have found this layers quite nicely with my other scents and as I mentioned before, this spray settles down to a nice subtle powdery</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only natural deodorant that really works !  </li>
            <li>I have used every natural deodorant from here to the Mississippi and Weleda Wildrose is the only one that really works!</li>
            <li>Not only are their products void of chemicals and harmful ingredients, but they always perform better than any other product I&#x27;ve ever known!</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t lovely, as I had expected, but it fades a bit when dry.</li>
            <li>However, I pretty quickly developed a sensitivity to the fragrance or some ingredient and had to stop using it due to a very itchy reaction.  </li>
            <li>Finally, I decided to spend a little more than what I&#x27;m used to on a deodorant</li>
            <li>I eat a little bit better, I wear sunscreen daily, and I&#x27;ve done my research on things that can cause cancer.</li>
            <li>However in the summer I may have to go back to something with a little more protection.  </li>
            <li>I really wish it worked for me, but this was my last try with a natural deo.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I have gone a whole day and then gone to Zumba the next morning and STILL was not stinky.</li>
            <li>and I wanted something natural.</li>
            <li>I know, cue the music, and the soft twirling of pettycoats!)&lt;br /&gt;Can</li>
            <li>mom, whatever, I&#x27;ll deal with that later, but for now I don&#x27;t want to stink and thanks to the genes that were given me by YOU</li>
            <li>As soon as I caught my breath, I did the old lift the arm and sniff test..</li>
            <li>but I would suggest to someone who&#x27;s never smelled it to go to a Whole Foods or your local health food store and try out the samples they have there.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for years for a natural deodorant that works.  </li>
            <li>Smells like old lady perfume.  </li>
            <li>on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>So far this is the one that keeps me the freshest the longest.</li>
            <li>My 7 year old was coming home from school smelling like BO.  </li>
            <li>This really seems to cut back on my sweating.</li>
            <li>Contains a lot of alcohol and fragrance; not just natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>So I wanted to try to switch to a natural deodorant after speaking with a co-worker that does research on cancer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But as far as I am concerned it works, and I am completely surprised that it does.</li>
            <li>I use it with Schmidt&#x27;s Natural Deodorant in Lavendar Sage (http://www.amazon.com/Schmidts-Natural-Deodorant-Lavender-Sage/dp/B00D2KW68Y/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1435274796&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;deoderant+cream)</li>
            <li>Would recommend to everyone who is looking for  natural ones</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experimented with a lot of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants and found that my favorites are in stick form and 100% natural.</li>
            <li>A friend said it smells like an old lady&#x27;s perfume.</li>
            <li>But at least I can get a break from the chemicals for most of the year.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a few months and really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>I wanted something natural without alum in it.</li>
            <li>like fruit loops (which after a while gets old).</li>
            <li>Users need to bear in mind that this is a natural product.</li>
            <li>For my natural deodorant, I&#x27;ll be sticking to the Soapwalla cream deodorant (A+) and Trader Joes brand deodorant (also A+)</li>
            <li>I guess if I or someone wanted to take the extra time and make the extra effort, you could maybe find a separate, empty spray bottle, and put only SOME of this rose deodorant in there and then distilled water(?)</li>
            <li>Even after discovering that it didn&#x27;t work I might have used it as a body spray except for the fact that it smells like a 90 year old lady&#x27;s perfume.</li>
            <li>I tried Tom&#x27;s and some homemade all natural deodorant from Etsy, but nothing worked and I ended up smelling by 2pm.</li>
            <li>and I want an all natural product.  </li>
            <li>All natural.</li>
            <li>but this deodorant makes me smell like an old lady.</li>
            <li>Lately I&#x27;ve learned not to assume that a product is safe just because it&#x27;s sold in a health food store.</li>
            <li>I do sometimes have to reapply later in the day (like I said I sweat a lot), but it does work really well on the odor.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s its name) and was very hesitant to buy something that was only a deodorant -</li>
            <li>I was trying to go all natural, but for someone like me who sweat with the blink of an eye, I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this product again.</li>
            <li>The bigger issue, in my case is that it didn&#x27;t really work that well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a variety of natural deodorants for years</li>
            <li>so I &#x27;ve been doing a lot of research to find a natural deodorant that works.</li>
            <li>As far as its effectiveness, I&#x27;ve worn it to work and</li>
            <li>I found another natural wax based alternative that has meet my needs.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s worse, it doesn&#x27;t work very well, so you have to spray more on throughout the day.</li>
            <li>If you are an extremely active person like me, you may want to reapply after a super sweaty exercise session.</li>
            <li>I ran out of a natural deodorant that Lush made, and found they didn&#x27;t make it any more, so I was forced to make another choice.  </li>
            <li>It took my body about 6 weeks after I stopped using Secret deodorant to stabilize my sweat production and BO on its own.</li>
            <li>This one keeps me fresh for a whole working day, and it has none of the unhealthy ingredients that many other products have.</li>
            <li>It really keeps the BO at bay, and the only reason I did not give this product 5 stars is because the high alcohol content can cause my underarms to break out, especially if I apply just after shaving.</li>
            <li>Seriously, I&#x27;ve tried them all in my quest to avoid aluminum and this product is the ONLY one I have ever tried that is actually effective.  </li>
            <li>This product will not replace your standard anti-perspirant but its not a bad natural option if you don&#x27;t sweat much and its not hot outside</li>
            <li>I wish it was a bit more subtle.  </li>
            <li>main concerns when I bought this product were obviously the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not typically fond of floral scents</li>
            <li>this burns my armpits and is a little too sweet smelling.</li>
            <li>I am not sure about the other varieties, but I do not like how Wild Rose smells, it does have a sort of baby powder/alchohol smell to it  </li>
            <li>I will order one more time and possibly transfer the contents of the bottle into a cheap plastic container as soon as possible, but I am altogether not impressed with the company&#x27;s illogical packaging decision.</li>
            <li>I like my natural, pure and safe products to come without scary warnings, beyond those aimed towards people with severe allergies.  </li>
            <li>the only thing that bothered me is that I could still smell the strong rosy odor even after a few hours.  </li>
            <li>This product does not prevent perspiration, so my underarms do get wet on really hot days.</li>
            <li>I normally have to use clinical strength deodorant because the regular strength doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li>Keeps me dry all day, no sickening artificial scents and it is simply lovely.</li>
            <li>I like the scent and that it&#x27;s natural, but it only protects me so far...</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how well it holds up even after moderate exercise, especially for someone like me who normally needs a stronger strength deodorant.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mostly a rose smell with lemon, but the lemon is very subtle and definitely an undertone.  </li>
            <li>I smell different due to whether or not I am in more or less pain.</li>
            <li>also, it really does last all day long.</li>
            <li>carry this in the natural beauty sections, and often have a sample open.</li>
            <li>It definitely smells like roses and it also smells natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been trying different brands of natural deodorants and nothing seemed to work.</li>
            <li>I was happily surprised to receive this larger volume.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to find a natural deodorant that actually works.</li>
            <li>A natural deodorant that actually works!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything and this is the only natural deodorant that works for my family.  </li>
            <li>I have spent a fortune trying to find a natural deodorant that actually works on me, a girl who doesn&#x27;t smell much.</li>
            <li>I just recently decided to go natural with my beauty product when I came across this gem.</li>
            <li>I thought the spray bottle would be handy, but unfortunately that wasn&#x27;t the case.</li>
            <li>I am not a clumsy person (meaning I have not broken or dropped any other beauty products in my memory), but at a slight wobble, the Weleda bottle once crashed to the floor and into many sharp, difficult-to-see shards; when I reordered to replace the lost deodorant, the bottle fell through the bottom of the pink box and smashed on the ground again.</li>
            <li>This deo definitely seem to have accelerated that, probably due to the fact that it didn&#x27;t work at all in the first place.</li>
            <li>The scent doesn&#x27;t last very long because I only really smell it when spraying it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to go back to my regular old chemical laced one.  </li>
            <li>I have been trying to find something that it is natural but without the aluminum elements that most anti-antiperspirants have, however I understand this is a difficult task.</li>
            <li>Even though it only kept me smelling fresh for a few hours, I figured it was better/safer than the drugstore brand I had been using.</li>
            <li>when i first attempted to return it, i was disappointed to see that it was categorized as hazardous and therefore un-returnable.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about it until I used up about half the small bottle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing, works so much better than regular deodorant from the drugstore that is awful for you.</li>
            <li>The rest of my summer shipments smelled the same and I was really upset that they were not returnable due to the chemicals in it</li>
            <li>It did help, just not long term.  </li>
            <li>main complaint would be that because it contains alcohol it can be a bit drying, and really stings if you have shaved within a day or so of use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells fake and just way too strong and I&#x27;m not even sensitive to smells!</li>
            <li>and I really think it helps me sweat less.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying natural deodorants for a long time now, with mixed results.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t work exactly the same as a chemically heavy drugstore antiperspirant, you may need to reapply mid-day or in the evening.</li>
            <li>You know when other deodorants advertise that there is no dry time, when we all know that not true, but this really does dry fast</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t shave them every day, but a few times a week—enough to make this stuff largely unusable for me.  </li>
            <li>I have finally found an all natural deodorant that WORKS and LAST LONG!!</li>
            <li>A few notes on this product; it is expensive, it will sting if you spray it on right after you shave your underarms, the scent is quite strong (but dissipates quickly)&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>A little too much scent for me, personally.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much to say other than it works!!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> and this is great for spring.</li>
            <li> Great product,</li>
            <li> Weleda Wildrose Deodorant spray is made with great odor neutralizers, like citronella.</li>

            <li> A great product.  </li>
            <li> , the product does a great job preventing body odor for me.</li>
            <li> Thankfully it hasn&#x27;t been to the point of embarrassment and one great thing is that this product does not stain my shirts, nor does my sweat.</li>

            <li> I sweat and it doesn&#x27;t smell very nice either</li>
            <li> It comes in a very nice glass bottle with a sprayer that never breaks.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t seem very effective.</li>
            <li> With Weleda, that doesn&#x27;t happen, the smell kind of lingers on in a very pleasant way, without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t think it would work for me, all I have to do is think about getting b.o. and bada bing!</li>
            <li> I like the citrus scent better, but works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> I tried many deodorants (non-antiperspirants) and this one works the best!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m REALLY loving it!</li>

            <li> This has a pleasant, not overpowering smell.  </li>
            <li> The scent is VERY STRONG!  </li>
            <li> This product is good - it neutralizes the odors, but it didn&#x27;t stop the sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I loved the scent.</li>
            <li> Good ingredients.</li>
            <li> It smells great--- like rose perfume.</li>
            <li> I like it as it&#x27;s non-toxic and smells good.</li>
            <li> Anyways, I loved it as soon as I tried it.</li>
            <li> smelling good from morning to bed time.</li>
            <li> This smells so good.  </li>
            <li> The rose smell is great but something in this product cause my skin to breakout in a rash.  </li>
            <li> It smells good and is not poisonous.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work well for me as deodorant but has good smell.</li>

            <li> I love this deodorant and this is a great price.</li>

            <li> This deodorant works great, much better than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Great stuff:-)</li>
            <li> Was expecting better judging from the great reviews.</li>
            <li> Anyway, perhaps it is just my own chemistry and would be good on others?</li>
            <li> Its best right out of the shower.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The deodorant can also be used as a light fragrance mist upon the body itself, as the properties are actually good for the skin!</li>
            <li> It works great, smells good and is very good for my sensitive underarm skin!  </li>
            <li> The smell of this on my skin isn&#x27;t very pleasant and it doesn&#x27;t keep me fresh.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant!</li>

            <li> I actually really love the floral smell of this stuff!</li>

            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Best deodorant on the planet~*!*!*!.&lt;br /&gt;Exotic, pretty scent~</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant!</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant!  </li>
            <li> The sage one, however, smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Not as amazing as I was hoping.</li>
            <li> If you like rose smell with a touch of lemon you will like this.</li>
            <li> It has a spicier, earthy rose scent from the geranium oil in it.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of rose water.</li>
            <li> It kind of does.</li>
            <li> I did just start to use a rose water with aloe and hyaluronic acid in it as well</li>
            <li> Mostly Effective.</li>
            <li> Reduced sweating, Not as good with odor control, but Much better than the Jason Brand deodorants (had to throw them away after using 1 time).</li>
            <li> Nice rose odor.</li>
            <li> Rose odor can be unisex, not too feminine.</li>
            <li> All it does is overpower your nose with rose.</li>
            <li> I loved the smell of the citrus version but this one works much better.</li>
            <li> and I bought the Rose one for myself and the Sage one for my boyfriend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the type of rose smell that I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the rose just doesn&#x27;t cut it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The rose smell on its own is nice though, maybe it&#x27;ll serve as a nice body spray in the summer.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be honest.</li>
            <li> But the scent is nice</li>
            <li> May make a nice body spray, but doesn&#x27;t cut it for keeping the funk away.</li>
            <li> I was beyond thrilled when I found a rose-scented deodorant.  </li>
            <li> It was an absolute dream to find that scent in a deodorant -- how perfect was that?!  </li>
            <li> I suggest avalon organics grapefruit and geranium spray if you are looking for something effective (you may have to reapply it once or twice if it is warm weather</li>
            <li> I also wasn&#x27;t thrilled with any of the scent options for the Weleda deodorant.</li>
            <li> Smells like a funky rose</li>
            <li> and so it&#x27;s considered hazardous and not returnable.</li>
            <li> Smells nice when you spray it on, but does NOT control odor throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Smell nice.  </li>
            <li> I like the rose sent as well.</li>
            <li> The product smells nice but did not work out for me.</li>
            <li> this smelled nice.</li>
            <li> The rose scent is more like a gorgeous perfume.</li>
            <li> One thing I like about the rose versus the citrus is that it doesn&#x27;t sting my skin at all after I shave.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise it doesn&#x27;t seem to be too effective.  </li>
            <li> Nice smelling.</li>
            <li> I might get a hint of rose but never body odor.  </li>
            <li> This is a very strong rose smell, which I should have known from the name.</li>
            <li> It works well, and best of all, it smells (to my nose, at least) simply wonderful!</li>
            <li> Great price and quick delivery from this seller, will use again.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells very strongly of roses.</li>
            <li> Very strong floral/baby powderish smell.</li>
            <li> The fragrance begins very strong but very pleasant and genuinely rose-y, not artificial rose.  </li>
            <li> The best thing is that I think it works even better than the natural deodorant I had before which I was very satisfied with.  </li>
            <li> It works and even though I don&#x27;t love the smell of roses, I love when my pits smell like roses!</li>
            <li> this one just happens to be perfect for my body chemistry and i completely trust this company!</li>
            <li> I get comments all the time on how nice my \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; is :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s effective, smells lovely, and a bottle lasts for *months*.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of natural deodorants and this is the best.  </li>
            <li> you are not a &amp;#34;floral&amp;#34; person, meaning you don&#x27;t enjoy or smell as good with perfumes or products with floral based notes</li>
            <li> On top of it all, you can not return it because it is classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases and cannot be returned to Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Like all Weleda products, this one is excellent, and the odor is natural and pleasing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soooo convenient to use &amp; I love the rose scent.</li>
            <li> This is the best of the bunch by far.</li>
            <li> I SO wanted to love this product, and again, it&#x27;s definitely a rose scent (</li>
            <li> Best natural deodorant I have found.</li>
            <li> This is the best I&#x27;ve found so far</li>
            <li> Amazon handled this situation with excellent professional courtesy.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a non stick, safe, yet effective deodorant.  </li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s not a horrible smell, just kind of...grandmotherly).  </li>
            <li> I believe what I experienced is the result of the deodorant getting too hot since all of these shipments arrived extremely warm out of the packaging.</li>
            <li> I do love it though &amp; it seems to work good &amp; is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the good reviews and was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Of the natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried throughout the years, this one works the best and smells fabulous!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy this is offered on Amazon and at such a great price.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE the scent of rose, and love using rose-scented products, like bubble baths, lotions, etc.  </li>
            <li> The smell is VERY strong and overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> i bought this product because of the reviews talking very good of if, but i tried it and the first day it worked very good, but its been a couple of weeks and by middle of the  day its not working.</li>
            <li> this product have too strong of a &#x27;rose&#x27; scent, making me smell like a hippy?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> not something weirdly rose like some \\&quot;rose\\&quot;-scented products), but it&#x27;s just too strong and perfume-y for my taste.  </li>
            <li> Most important thing to remind folks is that it&#x27;s a very strong rose smell.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients says it is fragrance free, but the smell is overwhelming!</li>
            <li> , I can say that this one works okay, but the rose scent is too strong.</li>
            <li> love the smell and effectiveness of this fine product, have been using for some years now - a zippy winner!</li>
            <li> The scent of this deodorant is amazingly wonderful as I love the scent of wild roses but after 3 hours there is a strong perspiration odor</li>
            <li> you tell I love the smell of roses?</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this deoderant.  </li>
            <li> I try to be a healthy person for the most part.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;ok</li>
            <li> I was impressed, but I wasn&#x27;t totally sold...</li>
            <li> I really love the scent of this.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the way it smells.  :-)  </li>
            <li> (Mostly user error)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very happy with this stuff overall.</li>
            <li> I love this product -</li>
            <li> Thank you amazon you save me money and time!!! :)</li>
            <li> I also love that it comes in a glass bottle instead of plastic, so A+ for packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> I would like to say that immediately after you stop using mainstream, toxic deodorant, you will sweat and smell more for a WHILE, no matter what product you use.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll be trying out more scents of Weleda soon.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> It is way too potent and intoxicating.  </li>
            <li> Love the scent of this deodorant and that it is spray.</li>
            <li> On the days that I have more pain</li>
            <li> and I use it on my under arms before I  use the deodorant now and it seems to help even more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you Weleda - An Outstanding Product</li>
            <li> But for me I absolutely love the scent, it reminds me of the tea-rose perfume oil they used to sell at the body shop years ago (Canada).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to any lady wanting a more healthy deodorant</li>
            <li> And personally I love the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more of these to stock up for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Weleda deodorant for three or four months now, and have been generally pleased.  </li>
            <li> The Sage Deodorant, I purchased for my husband and he is equally pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I think this product is better for people with deodorant allergies like me.</li>
            <li> I love Weleda</li>
            <li> I want to love this product..</li>
            <li> In fact, I think I smell better when I&#x27;m not using any product at all - this spray</li>
            <li> and I wanted something more</li>
            <li> But no doubt I&#x27;ll be able to use this through the cooler months.  </li>
            <li> I also use the almond face cream and more.</li>
            <li> The smell is okay</li>
            <li> Arm &amp; hammer works way better</li>
            <li> The fragrance of this does not smell like roses, but more a chemical smell.</li>
            <li> I tried applying more... still no difference.</li>
            <li> It is definitely more of a manly smell</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t my favorite either - a mixture of alcohol and roses.</li>
            <li> Firstly, I enjoy the rose fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It smells good and worth the money.</li>
            <li> Ok yes it works but:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> It has a rose scent combined with an abrasive cheap perfume odor.</li>
            <li> Unless you like the smell of cheap perfume (and your own BO), keep looking.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I have been buying it for over 2 years now, and it lasts most of the day.</li>
            <li> I mostly love it for the scent -</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear most perfumes because they give me headaches (probably from the synthetic ingredients), so this kills 2 birds with one stone.</li>
            <li> This deoderant smells so uplifting and refreshing.</li>
            <li> Love this spray.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of roses, but this is a bit musty for me.</li>
            <li> the smell is lovely.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell of this deodorant.</li>
            <li> ** from me:-)</li>
            <li> I love the smell.</li>
            <li> I love roses.</li>
            <li> I switched to Lafe&#x27;s spray deodorant, which is a 0 on the toxin scale, and it works MUCH better without any toxins.</li>
            <li> I really love the smell of this deodorant but</li>
            <li> I love all three scents.</li>
            <li> love this deodorant and I won&#x27;t give up on it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS DEODERANT AND WILL CONTINUE TO BUY IT</li>
            <li> ALSO LOVE THE SAGE FRAGRANCE.  </li>
            <li> I love that we can now get it on Amazon for a fraction of the price</li>
            <li> It might be okay as a body spray..but not as a deodorant.</li>
            <li> The deodorant works well, even after many hours of sweaty activity, and provides a pleasing scent that isn&#x27;t too overpowering.</li>
            <li> I really love the scent of this deodorant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to sweat, thanks; I&#x27;m a mammal.</li>
            <li> It would be a bit better with jasmine or something to off set it.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have to carry it with me to make sure I was OK by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite~</li>
            <li> Love</li>
            <li> Love this product it works</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell as nice as it would sound.</li>
            <li> pat it in, then spray 2 more pumps.  </li>
            <li> No mixture of funky sweat and flowers,  just a light ,feminine ,very confident, sweet smelling armpit!</li>
            <li> This pleasant-smelling Weleda Wild Rose deodorant is very effective for me, a 100 lb salsa dancing vegan living in a tropical climate.</li>
            <li> This deodorant spray smells wonderful, but if I&#x27;m being honest, it works like more of a body spray and less of a deodorant.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and leaves a light fresh rose scent for most of the day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But even with the many good products out there, prior to using Weleda Wildrose Deodorant, never before have I been so delighted with the performance and ingredients of Weleda</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good deodorant, though it does sting a lot if you use it after shaving, hence the 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Very important-if you don&#x27;t like rose smelling things this is not for you!</li>
            <li> I have used sprays and roll on&#x27;s for a long time but this deodorant is the BEST.</li>
            <li> They need to come up with a much better and easier spray and go easy on the alcohol; it stings when used after shaving.  </li>
            <li> Rose smell is a bit string in application but calms quickly</li>
            <li> thankfully, after an easy call to Amazon, they were able to refund the purchase price.</li>
            <li> The scent is very feminine, gentle, and just perfect.</li>
            <li> Honestly, it is much like using rose extract or rose oil.</li>
            <li> When you have to use natural products there aren&#x27;t a lot to choose from and on top of that the products vary in quality greatly.</li>
            <li> After trying so many natural deodorants that don&#x27;t work at all this was a great discovery.</li>
            <li> Rose fragrance is a bit too strong and sweet for my tastes.</li>
            <li> It is very overwhelming when you first apply the product.</li>
            <li> I let her use deodorant but wanted a natural alternative and found this all the reviews were great.</li>
            <li> I LOVE my wild rose deodorant!  </li>
            <li> Was looking for a mor natural option and this product works great</li>
            <li> I was really amazed by how much I loved this product.</li>
            <li> Refreshing summer deodorant cooling with clean refreshing light scent.</li>
            <li> still looking for the perfect deodorant without aluminum and other quimicals  </li>
            <li> Finally something that works and smells good!</li>
            <li> Its easy to apply</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t too overwhelmingly floral and it keeps her smelling fresh most days.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a nice rose, not too old lady.</li>
            <li> I can understand some of the reviewers take on the smell being strong, or powdery</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell strong either.</li>
            <li> IS WAY TO STRONG</li>
            <li> Since purchasing it online and using it for months now, I can say that I&#x27;m part of the group of people who don&#x27;t like the strong scent.</li>
            <li> otherwise but this is so strong it makes you sick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is just a really strong smelling body spray.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice scent, not powdery or old ladyish like some rose things can be.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just strong.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this after reading a number of good reviews on here.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 4 because it does smell a bit strong when you first put it on, but it is a nice floral scent to me.  </li>
            <li> I first started trying this product about a year ago, and it was amazing.</li>
            <li> but all natural deodorants are not the most effective… Has a nice scent and works better than the crystal…</li>
            <li> it happens), I need to reapply or supplement with baking soda, but generally it&#x27;s pretty effective.</li>
            <li> It smelled exactly like a rose picked from the garden.</li>
            <li> A bit alcohol-y when it first goes on, but then the rose smell takes over.  </li>
            <li> I have had this particular problem with all deodorants and antiperspirants, this one works the best and is natural.</li>
            <li> I like the scent of this just fine.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s fine if I&#x27;m going to the gym and prepared to sweat.</li>
            <li> It smells fine in the bottle so perhaps that is the case.</li>
            <li> When I was done, I was sweating like a pregnant nun in church, like I had just showered in my yoga clothes!</li>
            <li> This smells like cheap, strong cologne</li>
            <li> Natural, pleasant smelling, and the alcohol disinfects any bacteria.</li>
            <li> Best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried so far!</li>
            <li> Pure Rose scentl</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Usually a huge fan of Weleda products (lip balm, toothpaste, lotion, oils, etc)</li>
            <li> None of them worked very well at keeping me from getting stinky on warm days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It really does eliminate odor well - although it some times has to be reapplied throughout the day, the nice thing is you can do that</li>
            <li> You REALLY have to pour it on for it to be effective.</li>
            <li> It smells like cheap perfume.  </li>
            <li> I very much enjoy the zero chemical fix.  </li>
            <li> but the rose smell is very granny like.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic all the time</li>
            <li> The deodorant smells fantastic and works well.</li>
            <li> but i really enjoy this one.</li>
            <li> Since we are all different, I can&#x27;t say how it will work for you, but I was kinda happy with it as a Freshen-Upper until I started to itch.</li>
            <li> free</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many natural deodorants and even made my own.</li>
            <li> Planning to buy the full line of Wild Rose scent!</li>
            <li> I love the scent (more like a perfume than a deodorant) and it works really well.  </li>
            <li> By about 12:00 the old lady smell went away and emerge a lovely rose smell which is still there at 6:00pm.</li>
            <li> For me, this product did not work very well overall, but was good for now and then use - like after a good workout, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m done looking; this is by far the most effective deodorant I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I love Weleda products and really wanted to love this, but I just can&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> After putting it on at 10:00am (2 sprays) with a layer of coconut oil over the top to easy the smell at first.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t sweat very much, don&#x27;t mind smelling flowery and are able to reapply through out the day this product will work fine.</li>
            <li> I love how this product feels on my skin, it is a nice mist and it leaves my skin feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I love how this product feels on my skin, it is a nice mist and it leaves my skin feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I was really expecting to smell a combination of b.o. and roses, but there was no sign of b.o. at all!!!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve decided that sweating is fine and first tried the Healthy Deodorant stick and even with reapplication throughout the day i felt like i had BO.</li>
            <li> The rose scent is pretty strong at first</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to use a light deodorant that smells good, has a slightly astringent quality, and does not coat one&#x27;s underarms with a waxy build-up that transfers (and can discolor)</li>
            <li> Finally found a deodorant that works, amazing!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> Fantastic Rose oil makes this &#x27;old school&#x27; spray on a delight to the senses!  </li>
            <li> and it was worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Smells great and lasts long.  </li>
            <li> I love it and absolutely works for me!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is worth the price,save your money don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> May try the tea tree one next and see if that&#x27;s more effective.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind the smell but even though I am a light sweater, the scent is quickly overridden by BO.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several nontoxic varieties of deodorant and was struggling to find one with a pleasant scent that worked well and didn&#x27;t cost a fortune.</li>
            <li> but although this one is initially strong it tempers quickly and remains mild throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Smells mildly rose, the mild scent lingers somewhat, seems to be reasonably effective though not as much so as the natural mineral stone.  </li>
            <li> On really hot or sweaty days, reapplying is a must, but this works the best by far of all the natural deodorants she&#x27;s tried.</li>
            <li> Of the natural deodorants I have tried this is definitely my favorite!</li>
            <li> I have also been becoming more environmentally aware and trying to use more natural products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I switched to natural deodorants and have tried magnesium oil (cannot use after shaving) and a couple of Lush brand deodorants (somewhat effective, but not that convenient), but this is effective, and the rose scent is really nice, but does not interfere with other scents in lotions or perfumes.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m probably 90-95% odor free, and with this maybe 80-85%, but that 10% is worth it to not use chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;i</li>
            <li> The spray is nice because there&#x27;s no stickiness and it allows you to sweat naturally while masking odor.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is really lovely and very feminine .</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even begin to explain the scent, it is a nauseating, old lady rose smell, with a burst of stench that permeates throughout the NYC subway.  </li>
            <li> I am thrilled that I switched to this deodorant from my old aluminum based brand.</li>
            <li> These products have kept me fresh, comfortable and benefited my skin completely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought hey I will do some of my own research and look into some natural deodorants.</li>
            <li> was also expecting this to smell sweet (I don&#x27;t know why)</li>
            <li> only good thing that came from this is that I kept the bottle.</li>
            <li> Works very well, but I don&#x27;t love the floral scent.</li>
            <li> Good quality just a tad pricey but will order again next summer.</li>
            <li> I would probably recommend the sage flavor and would probably buy it again for my boyfriend just because I love the smell so much, but for me, I&#x27;m gonna either use Toms deodorant which I like or use the one I made myself.</li>
            <li> I ended up ordering wild rose.</li>
            <li> In addition, the wild rose scent reminds me of a grandma.  </li>
            <li> Bought this product based on two different reports that it was a good option for deodorant without the harmful chemicals found in anti-perspirant.</li>
            <li> and I the a full day of protection.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Since it is marked as hazardous no way to return for refund.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so surprised honestly.</li>
            <li> I might have to see if they have a wild rose perfume too.</li>
            <li> It does have a VERY strong scent at first, very perfume-y, but then it wears off.</li>
            <li> Okay, not to turn into a Calgon commercial here, but I really do LOVE this deodorant.</li>
            <li> I quickly moved on to the Herban Cowboy brand and haven&#x27;t been happier.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and it works well and seems to last me the whole day, even after doing yoga.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to most main stream deodorants and antiperspirants.</li>
            <li> Came to my door quickly.</li>
            <li> I have used many commercial deodorant products throughout my lifetime until I became better informed about the \\&quot;ingredients\\</li>
            <li> Wears off too quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pregnant and sweat alot too...</li>
            <li> I was super reluctant to buy this because I sweat.</li>
            <li> The high humidity and temperatures should prove as a better indicator as to</li>
            <li> That would give it more of a chemical smell in comparison to rose water made by other means.</li>
            <li> The rose smell is STRONG, but only when it first goes on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to live a more natural/holistic lifestyle.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have to use much as the scent is strong.</li>
            <li> I had growing concerns about using many chemicals on my skin because as I get older I have noticed my skin seems to be more sensitive to things.</li>
            <li> Its made out of glass and after dumping the contents down the sink and peeling off the label, I have this really cute and functional bottle that I can throw my own diy beauty products in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I went through many stinky days searching for a natural deodorant that worked and this one ended my search!</li>
            <li> It may not be the most potent deodorant, but it kept me fresh for a long day of 4th of July picnics!</li>
            <li> Finally, a responsible and effective natural deodorant!</li>
            <li> Organic Island and Green Tidings work great and don&#x27;t cause that sting.</li>
            <li> Excersize, eat healthy, use natural products when they are convenient or if they work..   </li>
            <li> think most naturals items won&#x27;t stop the sweat (after all it is the natural thing that our body does), so maybe the problem is me.</li>
            <li> If your nose isn&#x27;t as sensitive as mine, you may do better.</li>
            <li> Works well staying fresh all day.</li>
            <li> Worth it.</li>
            <li> found that the scent stayed fresh from around 7am when I applied it, to around 1130am.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> Despite the price, this is my favorite natural deodorant (some just don&#x27;t cut it for me--</li>
            <li> This is a nice alternative to traditional deodorants.  </li>
            <li> i use it in conjunction with my salt rock to kill bacteria + smell nice &amp; it works swell for the latter job.</li>
            <li> Great if you&#x27;re only into all natural stuff-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitly worth trying.</li>
            <li> I wanted to switch from using deodorants with aluminum to more of a natural deodorant</li>
            <li> I love roses wild and</li>
            <li> This one did okay working with your body&#x27;s natural smell</li>
            <li> it makes you feel fresh after applying it</li>
            <li> This deodorant keeps me feeling fresh all day.  </li>
            <li> this product definitely doesn&#x27;t smell like roses but it works and it does spray on nicely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few natural deodorants looking for the one that works best for me.</li>
            <li> It was okay, but had an \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; vibe.</li>
            <li> I purchased the white rose fragrances.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of my favorite deodorants.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as I am looking for a more natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> rose only detectable if you get your face all up in your arm pit.  </li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to chemical fragrances, so I was happy to find out that this is natural and does not negatively affect me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is \\&quot;wild rose\\&quot; and the Weleda take seems to have a hint of citrus in it as well, but it is fresh and lovely, and again, to my nose, not very cloying, or overly sweet as some rose scents can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was too excited to write this review, and my armpits still smell fresh (the rest of my body, not so much)   </li>
            <li> Pretty pleased so far!</li>
            <li> The package does recommend that you spray it, as you need to, since it isn&#x27;t made with chemicals that normally \\&quot;kill\\&quot; scent, as well as serve as strong anti-persiparant components.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s really hot (or I&#x27;m super stressed -</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m 31) but it mellows out pretty quick.</li>
            <li> In frustration I marched right into my nearest drugstore and grabbed some Lady</li>
            <li> Oh, right...</li>
            <li> The sample lotion that came with it smelled right though.</li>
            <li> But this product just doesn&#x27;t smell right on me.</li>
            <li> I am hoping to find a local store that sells it in the hopes that I can get back to using the beautiful rose-scented deodorant that this use to be when I tried it a year ago.</li>
            <li> It has a VERY strong smell, and to me is similar to mosquito repellant.</li>
            <li> It is a lovely rose scent, but it was too strong for me, very perfume-y, and I don&#x27;t know about anyone else, but I want my deodorant to smell subtle, and my scented body lotion to be what people smell</li>
            <li> I purposely try to get a little on my hair in the mornings because I love the rose scent so much.</li>
            <li> I spray the Weleda first then after it dries (pretty quickly)</li>
            <li> So, either buy this from a local store or be super sure you want it before you purchase.</li>
            <li> I carry it with me because like most natural deodorants on me, it doesn&#x27;t last for more than 8 hours.</li>
            <li> (Usually Amazon is great about this.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well, when I was at our local Whole Foods Market recently, and saw a sample/tester available of this product, I tried it, and oh my gosh, did I smell like rose for a while!  </li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s ok for the first 4-5 hours of the day, if you work for 10-12 hours like I do, the positive effects of the spray have COMPLETELY worn off before the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> Of course, if you absolutely abhor roses and have a tendency to smell intensely, then you would probably be better served with a traditional strong deodorant+antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> On the days that I am not in as much pain I will smell like a rose until the following day.&#x27;</li>
            <li> I very much wanted to like this, but its application is a bit impractical.  </li>
            <li> I love Weleda products, as they are all natural and high quality.  </li>
            <li> I tried the deodorant the first day I got it.</li>
            <li> And to my surprise, it really worked!</li>
            <li> So this morning, I laced up my tennis shoes and did a 45 minute high endurance work-out burning over 800 calories!!</li>
            <li> but first I&#x27;m hitting the shower.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful when you apply it, and then the scent fades so that you can wear other perfumes... just as other reviews said.  </li>
            <li> , I love that I can use every last drop that comes in each bottle (no wasting that nub at the end of a stick of deodorant).  </li>
            <li> I love my regular deodorant/antiperspirant the way it smells, and blocks sweat.</li>
            <li> I only wish I were more efficient at aiming it at my armpit</li>
            <li> Finds out, the aluminum in deodorants can cause breast cancer, and thus begins my struggle for a natural, aluminum free</li>
            <li> I tried sticking it out for two weeks thinking maybe my body had to get used to the sudden change in deos, but it seems the more</li>
            <li> I really do!  </li>
            <li> I thought for sure this would be the same.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a few days now, pretty good.</li>
            <li> First ...</li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few natural deodorants and this is the best so far.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as well as regular deodorant but better than Toms</li>
            <li> the first ingredient is alcohol and it burns.</li>
            <li> Products are always consistent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen first hand what alzheimers does to a person.</li>
            <li> Love the product line but this deodorant smells a like a French Granny and doesn&#x27;t work....</li>
            <li> Price is on par with Sprouts store where I bought my first bottle.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every natural aluminum free deodorant out there - nothing works for me except this one.  </li>
            <li> and you are willing to reapply it throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought although I would never put it on my body, I could use it for an air freshener.  </li>
            <li> However, during hot summer months you will have to reapply a couple of times.</li>
            <li> Regular deodorant (not clinical strength) works just great for me, and I don&#x27;t actually sweat much</li>
            <li> My choice when it comes to deodorants ;)</li>
            <li> it is safe and it actually works!</li>
            <li> This finally made me feel ok in my lifestyle choices.</li>
            <li> I had higher hopes for this.  </li>
            <li> It does smell pretty though and will probably use it as a body spray in the summer.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several months now, and totally love it.</li>
            <li> i have tried ALL of the natural, chemical free, etc., etc., etc.</li>
            <li> I first purchased the Weleda Citrus spray and it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Through out the day if I&#x27;m running around or get hot</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is pleasant, but a little too strong for me - I didn&#x27;t think I could wear my fragrance and the deodorant at the same time - that&#x27;s why I gave the four stars.</li>
            <li> The wild rose scent isn&#x27;t so strong that it is obtrusive, yet, isn&#x27;t so subtle that you don&#x27;t feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I wear the rose in the summer and citrus and sage other times of the year.  </li>
            <li> The smell is attractive, the product is effective, and for the quality the price isn&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, but for an active person like myself it just didn&#x27;t cut it.  </li>
            <li> but I wear that one occasionally just because I love it so much.</li>
            <li> light fresh sent has kept me coming back year after year.</li>
            <li> I needed freshening up during the day as I went back to using my Dove Wild Rose scented antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> All natural, doesn&#x27;t stain my shirt, and believe it or not I&#x27;ve had it on all day and as I&#x27;m preparing for my shower, I did the special sniff test....</li>
            <li> So I decided to give this one a shot given the positive feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one scared me off because of the price and because I don&#x27;t love the smell of roses, but it was recommended by someone who works at my local naturals store, so I bought a small travel sized bottle and loved it so much that I&#x27;m now on my 3rd full sized bottle of this!</li>
            <li> If you are in doubt, I know that most natural food stores (i.e. \\&quot;Whole Paycheck\\&quot;, \\&quot;Wild</li>
            <li> I used it for two days (giving it a fair chance), but now I&#x27;m going back to my previous deodorant and throwing the full bottle of this Wildrose in the trash.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you are looking for a natural, aluminum free deodorant.</li>
            <li> typically like rose scent, but not this.</li>
            <li> There is a rather odd smell to it and the nice rose scent wears away to an odd smell I do not care for.  </li>
            <li> well my pits certainly don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This is the first and only one that has left me not avoiding my own pits by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> We were using Toms of Main and OMG we stunk!</li>
            <li> I think this must have a very high alcohol content.</li>
            <li> Traditional antiperspirants/deodorants tend to build up defeating the purpose of wearing a deodorant in the first place: to feel clean.</li>
            <li> Does smell a bit strong, similar to the strength of a body spray (not near as strong as a perfume).</li>
            <li> can see here on the reviews that some folks didn&#x27;t really care for the scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m switching my whole family to this product, if it works for me, it will work for anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> really well</li>
            <li> , however, it works very well.</li>
            <li> Haha.</li>
            <li> I think you can even use it as a perfume/body spray if you really like the scent.</li>
            <li> real test will be when I go to Asia this spring.</li>
            <li> , The price is reasonable and so is the shipping.</li>
            <li> product did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> I smelled as if I never even heard of deodorant my whole life.</li>
            <li> This one really works, but you may need to reapply during the day depending on your funk level.  </li>
            <li> If I were to continue using this product, it would only be used as a light scent or body mist.</li>
            <li> This is a spray deodorant that feels much lighter and cleaner than a roll on stick.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy this if I sweat a lot or did a lot of intense workouts.  </li>
            <li> Works very well as a deodorant</li>
            <li> Does not work very well to eliminate odor.</li>
            <li> This has worked really well for me.  </li>
            <li> No I have really smelly armpit odor</li>
            <li> so I expected this one to smell better.</li>
            <li> I really like the scent</li>
            <li> I probably reapply 2-3 times in winter and twice that much in summer.</li>
            <li> I am someone who tends to sweat a lot (which means I  can get really stinky).</li>
            <li> Once that happens, reapplication doesn&#x27;t really help.</li>
            <li> This finally makes me feel comfortable in my hippy self.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want any aluminum, thanks, and don&#x27;t want something that is against my perspiration.</li>
            <li> some white and lightly colored clothing.  </li>
            <li> If I sweat a lot, I do have to reapply, but I like the scent so much that it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> Does not leave residue on shirts, and lasts for the whole day.</li>
            <li> The smell is too much for me.</li>
            <li> I spray it on in the morning, probably too much because I like the smell so much.  </li>
            <li> and I have tried MANY natural deodorants over the years with mixed results.</li>
            <li> I even tried adding my own essential oils (rosemary and peppermint) in order to do something, but no such luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you like rose, don&#x27;t like chemical heavy antiperspirants</li>
            <li> So when I put this product on it did smell like an old lady&#x27;s perfume, but I found that if you put coconut oil over the top it does reduce the smell enough that it isn&#x27;t over powering.</li>
            <li> But I can&#x27;t detect any rose smell on myself after a few minutes, so</li>
            <li> lost my head and left Weleda Wild Rose for awhile, I cheaped out and bought some arm n hammer natural 2 pack at CVS.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the rose smell</li>
            <li> Be aware that this product is reminiscent of perfume and has a mild floral scent.</li>
            <li> Very strongly scented, a little much.  </li>
            <li> It lasts long and isn&#x27;t an incredibly strong smell.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome, but it burns horribly when you put it on especially right after shaving.</li>
            <li> I think it is better smelling than the other Weleda scents.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the other fragrances Weleda makes, too, but I really love this one.</li>
            <li> I THINK THIS DEODORANT IS PRETTY STINKY AND COULD HAVE BEEN MADE A LITTLE BETTER SMELL.</li>
            <li> I would love to try one of the other scents as well.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> My first few sprays resulted with more product in the air then on my armpit.</li>
            <li> My wife has incredibly sensitive skin and spent years looking for a gentle, yet effective natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> If your underarms are just bare with no other material, you&#x27;ll be sweating &amp; stinking pretty quick &amp; this will not help that much.</li>
            <li> Better for me than conventional deodorants, even.</li>
            <li> Finally found the right deodorant!</li>
            <li> Smells nice but did very little to mask my body odor.</li>
            <li> and i think it&#x27;s the right amount, not too much to burn and enough to be effective for a few hours</li>
            <li> I have tried several natural deodorants, and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> It has a natural rather than synthetic scent and does exactly what it is made to do.</li>
            <li> It worked at first and then stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;After trying tons of natural deodorants</li>
            <li> Also I think if this is the first &#x27;natural&#x27; item you try it might take some getting used to the smell.</li>
            <li> The deodorant works very well in normal situations.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many natural deodorants now that I&#x27;m about to give up &amp; go back to the old Degree stuff I used to wear.</li>
            <li> This is ok, but doesn&#x27;t keep odor down that well.</li>
            <li> The scent also lasts very long which is unusual because natural deodorants tend to fade very quickly, making me feel self-conscious.</li>
            <li> Of course, I&#x27;ll have to get the more masculan, less rosey scent for the hubby..</li>
            <li> I have bought just about every natural one on the market, including the crystals, and even made my own deodorant, which worked, but was messy.  </li>
            <li> My main concern was with the odor control......</li>
            <li> and I think it does a decent job of making me feel and smell fresher if I spritz throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Particularly the cancer factor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (hope when I get older this will change).</li>
            <li> I never thought I was particularly smelly</li>
            <li> I mainly use it as a body spray.</li>
            <li> I think the citrus extracts in the other version caused a slight sting although it was NOT nearly bad enough to deter me from using (and loving!)</li>
            <li> I would reek to high heaven every time I used this spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works so much better than other natural ones in the summer.  </li>
            <li> and it works way better than any other natural deodorant that I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d suggest finding it, as I did, as a tester in a store, to see if you personally like it, because each person is different and will like different scents/strength of scents -- and you might love this!</li>
            <li> it makes me feel a little fancy too. :)</li>
            <li> Works pretty well, smells nice, just a little pricey for how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> and that seems to work really for me, when it comes to the natural stuff I like to layer since I can&#x27;t find any one product that does the trick.</li>
            <li> I was really looking for a natural product to replace my antiperspirant addiction, but even though I knew to expect sweat, this didn&#x27;t keep up with the smell.  </li>
            <li> This really was unexpected too.  </li>
            <li> and it is like starting fresh at the beginning of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have purchased this multiple times and will use this as long as it is available!</li>
            <li> I love how long it last on my arms.</li>
            <li> It reminds my of my grandma, and hopefully I&#x27;ll still be able to remember her in years to come because I haven&#x27;t destroyed my brain with heavy chemicals in my cosmetics.</li>
            <li> Anyways if you are natural and want a deoderant that doesnt stain and last all day and night, this is highly recommended by the sweaty pregnant woman...</li>
            <li> I think sometimes we put more thinking into what we put into our bodies and less about what we put on our bodies!</li>
            <li> &quot; thereof, and quickly opted to use only the natural applications that are not harmful to the body</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for organic deodorants that truly work and, unfortunately, this deodorant didn&#x27;t prove very effective for me.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll try one of the other scents but they weren&#x27;t available when I ordered.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one didn&#x27;t work as well as the regular deodorants that are full of  gross chemicals, but it did work better than some of the other natural deodorants I tried.</li>
            <li> I do not dislike the rose scent but find it to be a little bit too present, and it stays with you -- does not dissipate.  </li>
            <li> Goats\\&quot;, and \\&quot;New Sneezins\\&quot;,(PDX))</li>
            <li> and I live in AZ.</li>
            <li> I live in the tropics</li>
            <li> I like the other Weleda deodorants better, as the scents are more subtle.  </li>
            <li> Applying it right out of the shower while effective was so painful I&#x27;d rather stick with the tried and true perfumed talc powder.</li>
            <li> It worked throughout the whole day of stress chasing around a 2 year old in a busy farmers market and festival.</li>
            <li> far as the &amp;#34;old lady perfume&amp;#34; that I see other reviewers referencing: Yes you do smell it strongly when putting it on, probably because you have your arm in the air and are spraying it near your face!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very conscious of what I put on my skin and on which companies I support with my money</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re in the market for a natural deo, I highly recommend the Weleda citrus one.</li>
            <li> And I forgot to do an extra couple sprays in the afternoon (which I try to do on hot days just in case).</li>
            <li> And since the price in these stores is often double what it is on Amazon, this is a real treat for me to order it here!</li>
            <li> This has been the answer to my natural deodorant search!</li>
            <li> It pretty much last all day without any embarassing wear off as the day progresses.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and not sticky, like some other natural products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> not giving up on my search for a natural deo!</li>
            <li> I usually do not like using deoderant</li>
            <li> I have used the citrus in the past and think I like the citrus scent better.  </li>
            <li> But the first spray was definitely a tad overpowering.  </li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t usually buy a lot of items with strong perfume, so it may not smell as strong with other people.  </li>
            <li> Definitely a huge let down.</li>
            <li> I love this deodarant, gave 4 only because it won&#x27;t last for whole day, although, its expected.</li>
            <li> Like other natural deodorants, it does not prevent odor from developing if I&#x27;m wearing a shirt that I&#x27;ve worn more than twice without washing it, even if I&#x27;ve only ever worn the shirt with deodorant on.  </li>
            <li> However, I have found this layers quite nicely with my other scents and as I mentioned before, this spray settles down to a nice subtle powdery</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only natural deodorant that really works !  </li>
            <li> I have used every natural deodorant from here to the Mississippi and Weleda Wildrose is the only one that really works!</li>
            <li> Not only are their products void of chemicals and harmful ingredients, but they always perform better than any other product I&#x27;ve ever known!</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t lovely, as I had expected, but it fades a bit when dry.</li>
            <li> However, I pretty quickly developed a sensitivity to the fragrance or some ingredient and had to stop using it due to a very itchy reaction.  </li>
            <li> Finally, I decided to spend a little more than what I&#x27;m used to on a deodorant</li>
            <li> I eat a little bit better, I wear sunscreen daily, and I&#x27;ve done my research on things that can cause cancer.</li>
            <li> However in the summer I may have to go back to something with a little more protection.  </li>
            <li> I really wish it worked for me, but this was my last try with a natural deo.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I have gone a whole day and then gone to Zumba the next morning and STILL was not stinky.</li>
            <li> and I wanted something natural.</li>
            <li> I know, cue the music, and the soft twirling of pettycoats!)&lt;br /&gt;Can</li>
            <li> mom, whatever, I&#x27;ll deal with that later, but for now I don&#x27;t want to stink and thanks to the genes that were given me by YOU</li>
            <li> As soon as I caught my breath, I did the old lift the arm and sniff test..</li>
            <li> but I would suggest to someone who&#x27;s never smelled it to go to a Whole Foods or your local health food store and try out the samples they have there.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for years for a natural deodorant that works.  </li>
            <li> Smells like old lady perfume.  </li>
            <li> on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> So far this is the one that keeps me the freshest the longest.</li>
            <li> My 7 year old was coming home from school smelling like BO.  </li>
            <li> This really seems to cut back on my sweating.</li>
            <li> Contains a lot of alcohol and fragrance; not just natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> So I wanted to try to switch to a natural deodorant after speaking with a co-worker that does research on cancer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But as far as I am concerned it works, and I am completely surprised that it does.</li>
            <li> I use it with Schmidt&#x27;s Natural Deodorant in Lavendar Sage (http://www.amazon.com/Schmidts-Natural-Deodorant-Lavender-Sage/dp/B00D2KW68Y/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1435274796&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;deoderant+cream)</li>
            <li> Would recommend to everyone who is looking for  natural ones</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experimented with a lot of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants and found that my favorites are in stick form and 100% natural.</li>
            <li> A friend said it smells like an old lady&#x27;s perfume.</li>
            <li> But at least I can get a break from the chemicals for most of the year.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months and really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I wanted something natural without alum in it.</li>
            <li> like fruit loops (which after a while gets old).</li>
            <li> Users need to bear in mind that this is a natural product.</li>
            <li> For my natural deodorant, I&#x27;ll be sticking to the Soapwalla cream deodorant (A+) and Trader Joes brand deodorant (also A+)</li>
            <li> I guess if I or someone wanted to take the extra time and make the extra effort, you could maybe find a separate, empty spray bottle, and put only SOME of this rose deodorant in there and then distilled water(?)</li>
            <li> Even after discovering that it didn&#x27;t work I might have used it as a body spray except for the fact that it smells like a 90 year old lady&#x27;s perfume.</li>
            <li> I tried Tom&#x27;s and some homemade all natural deodorant from Etsy, but nothing worked and I ended up smelling by 2pm.</li>
            <li> and I want an all natural product.  </li>
            <li> All natural.</li>
            <li> but this deodorant makes me smell like an old lady.</li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve learned not to assume that a product is safe just because it&#x27;s sold in a health food store.</li>
            <li> I do sometimes have to reapply later in the day (like I said I sweat a lot), but it does work really well on the odor.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s its name) and was very hesitant to buy something that was only a deodorant -</li>
            <li> I was trying to go all natural, but for someone like me who sweat with the blink of an eye, I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> The bigger issue, in my case is that it didn&#x27;t really work that well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a variety of natural deodorants for years</li>
            <li> so I &#x27;ve been doing a lot of research to find a natural deodorant that works.</li>
            <li> As far as its effectiveness, I&#x27;ve worn it to work and</li>
            <li> I found another natural wax based alternative that has meet my needs.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s worse, it doesn&#x27;t work very well, so you have to spray more on throughout the day.</li>
            <li> If you are an extremely active person like me, you may want to reapply after a super sweaty exercise session.</li>
            <li> I ran out of a natural deodorant that Lush made, and found they didn&#x27;t make it any more, so I was forced to make another choice.  </li>
            <li> It took my body about 6 weeks after I stopped using Secret deodorant to stabilize my sweat production and BO on its own.</li>
            <li> This one keeps me fresh for a whole working day, and it has none of the unhealthy ingredients that many other products have.</li>
            <li> It really keeps the BO at bay, and the only reason I did not give this product 5 stars is because the high alcohol content can cause my underarms to break out, especially if I apply just after shaving.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I&#x27;ve tried them all in my quest to avoid aluminum and this product is the ONLY one I have ever tried that is actually effective.  </li>
            <li> This product will not replace your standard anti-perspirant but its not a bad natural option if you don&#x27;t sweat much and its not hot outside</li>
            <li> I wish it was a bit more subtle.  </li>
            <li> main concerns when I bought this product were obviously the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not typically fond of floral scents</li>
            <li> this burns my armpits and is a little too sweet smelling.</li>
            <li> I am not sure about the other varieties, but I do not like how Wild Rose smells, it does have a sort of baby powder/alchohol smell to it  </li>
            <li> I will order one more time and possibly transfer the contents of the bottle into a cheap plastic container as soon as possible, but I am altogether not impressed with the company&#x27;s illogical packaging decision.</li>
            <li> I like my natural, pure and safe products to come without scary warnings, beyond those aimed towards people with severe allergies.  </li>
            <li> the only thing that bothered me is that I could still smell the strong rosy odor even after a few hours.  </li>
            <li> This product does not prevent perspiration, so my underarms do get wet on really hot days.</li>
            <li> I normally have to use clinical strength deodorant because the regular strength doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> Keeps me dry all day, no sickening artificial scents and it is simply lovely.</li>
            <li> I like the scent and that it&#x27;s natural, but it only protects me so far...</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how well it holds up even after moderate exercise, especially for someone like me who normally needs a stronger strength deodorant.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mostly a rose smell with lemon, but the lemon is very subtle and definitely an undertone.  </li>
            <li> I smell different due to whether or not I am in more or less pain.</li>
            <li> also, it really does last all day long.</li>
            <li> carry this in the natural beauty sections, and often have a sample open.</li>
            <li> It definitely smells like roses and it also smells natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been trying different brands of natural deodorants and nothing seemed to work.</li>
            <li> I was happily surprised to receive this larger volume.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find a natural deodorant that actually works.</li>
            <li> A natural deodorant that actually works!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything and this is the only natural deodorant that works for my family.  </li>
            <li> I have spent a fortune trying to find a natural deodorant that actually works on me, a girl who doesn&#x27;t smell much.</li>
            <li> I just recently decided to go natural with my beauty product when I came across this gem.</li>
            <li> I thought the spray bottle would be handy, but unfortunately that wasn&#x27;t the case.</li>
            <li> I am not a clumsy person (meaning I have not broken or dropped any other beauty products in my memory), but at a slight wobble, the Weleda bottle once crashed to the floor and into many sharp, difficult-to-see shards; when I reordered to replace the lost deodorant, the bottle fell through the bottom of the pink box and smashed on the ground again.</li>
            <li> This deo definitely seem to have accelerated that, probably due to the fact that it didn&#x27;t work at all in the first place.</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t last very long because I only really smell it when spraying it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to go back to my regular old chemical laced one.  </li>
            <li> I have been trying to find something that it is natural but without the aluminum elements that most anti-antiperspirants have, however I understand this is a difficult task.</li>
            <li> Even though it only kept me smelling fresh for a few hours, I figured it was better/safer than the drugstore brand I had been using.</li>
            <li> when i first attempted to return it, i was disappointed to see that it was categorized as hazardous and therefore un-returnable.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about it until I used up about half the small bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing, works so much better than regular deodorant from the drugstore that is awful for you.</li>
            <li> The rest of my summer shipments smelled the same and I was really upset that they were not returnable due to the chemicals in it</li>
            <li> It did help, just not long term.  </li>
            <li> main complaint would be that because it contains alcohol it can be a bit drying, and really stings if you have shaved within a day or so of use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells fake and just way too strong and I&#x27;m not even sensitive to smells!</li>
            <li> and I really think it helps me sweat less.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying natural deodorants for a long time now, with mixed results.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t work exactly the same as a chemically heavy drugstore antiperspirant, you may need to reapply mid-day or in the evening.</li>
            <li> You know when other deodorants advertise that there is no dry time, when we all know that not true, but this really does dry fast</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t shave them every day, but a few times a week—enough to make this stuff largely unusable for me.  </li>
            <li> I have finally found an all natural deodorant that WORKS and LAST LONG!!</li>
            <li> A few notes on this product; it is expensive, it will sting if you spray it on right after you shave your underarms, the scent is quite strong (but dissipates quickly)&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> A little too much scent for me, personally.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much to say other than it works!!</li>
            <li> I love that it lasts pretty long, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about the aluminium, glycols, parabens, mineral oils or any other crap that a reasonable person should steer away</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other natural versions but this is only one that works.</li>
            <li> Buy the large size, the small will only last you just over a month or so.</li>
            <li> I was a little unsure about this deodorant, mainly because it is a spray.</li>
            <li> It also works, which certainly wasn&#x27;t true with other products, natural or artificial.</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers who said it&#x27;s like an old smell.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as some other natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried, but it comes close.</li>
            <li> only plus is that I&#x27;ve been using this bottle daily for 4+ months now and have gotten through about a third of it, so one bottle lasts long.</li>
            <li> It may take multiple applications during the course of a hot day, but this does not bother me in the least.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a long time, especially compared to other natural ones that I have tried and needed to keep reapplying.  </li>
            <li> My first thought when I sprayed it was, &amp;#34;Hello, Grandma&#x27;s house,&amp;#34; although not in a negative way.</li>
            <li> Last a long time too.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as stick deodorants, either.</li>
            <li> I stopped my subscribe and save then since apparently no one noticed that the product was being &amp;#34;damaged&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for the fragrance but not at all for long lasting odor control.</li>
            <li> Hands down this is a must if you are trying to use natural beauty products.</li>
            <li> The doctors just always said it was a reaction to bacteria and their response was to tell me to stop shaving or do it less frequently, but this stopped my swelling probably because of the alcohol in it.</li>
            <li> I typically use the chemical deodorant and have been looking to make the switch to natural.</li>
            <li> It seems that the wildrose scent is very polarizing, as people either love it or hate it.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that it stings pretty bad after shaving, but wouldn&#x27;t any alcohol sting on a fresh shaven pit?</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;ve read a few negative reviews for this from people first switching to natural non-toxic deodorant.</li>
            <li> And unfortunately, I&#x27;m sorry to say that I don&#x27;t mean in a good way.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little old lady-ish.</li>
            <li> but I do think it smells a little mature for me</li>
            <li> The bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time now and will never again use anything else.</li>
            <li> A bottle lasts a LONG time, and I use it after my evening shower and also in the morning before work.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many natural deodorant before and was disappointed.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that is stings like a dickens if you spray it on newly shaved underarms.  </li>
            <li> Not only did it NOT keep my usually mild BO at bay, it made it worse!</li>
            <li> However this scent is a little stronger than the sage and smells a little too much like my grandmother.</li>
            <li> I have used various deodorants with levels of aluminum and other ingredients that have been connected with breast cancer and Alzheimers.</li>
            <li> Some times, due to my body letting out toxins from being injured, I do have extra Bo.</li>
            <li> The other reviewers must have low expectations.</li>
            <li> Tested in extreme situations, such as job interviews!!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for very long at all.</li>
            <li> I try to leave my arms up for 30 seconds to a minute so the product can dry (which reduces the smell)</li>
            <li> Seriously, this stuff works really well.</li>
            <li> It really works to control odor (though I am not a very smelly person to begin with, so I am not sure how it works for extreme odor needs).</li>
            <li> Reapplying a natural deodorant is nothing new to me, but I don&#x27;t enjoy having to do it so often and with such an awful scent.</li>
            <li> like I did with my past natural deodorant.  </li>
            <li> All natural too, so no more rashes.</li>
            <li> This definitely cuts down on my sweaty smell</li>
            <li> no high fructose</li>
            <li> I typically wear perfumes and body sprays that are floral-based however so after dries it does get cloaked by similar scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is a warning in the packet not to get it on mucus membrane tissue which I found odd, as you spray it onto your pits and obviously breathe the air close to it as well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not super convenient to use this spray deodorant multiple times a day.  </li>
            <li> I typically use about 4-5 pumps under each arm and am always shocked by the astounding amount of rose-scent sieging my senses.</li>
            <li> Second only to Black Chicken from Australia as far as natural deodorants.  </li>
            <li> It is not an antiperspirant, so you will sweat; in my opinion, blocking sweat glands is a terrible plan, so I just buy clothes that you can&#x27;t see mega-wet pit stains in LOL</li>
            <li> i am generally a sweater, although usually dont have odor.</li>
            <li> This really does make you smell extra weird when you perspire.</li>
            <li> I only rated it 3 stars because it is expensive for as fast as it gets used up.</li>
            <li> For this product don&#x27;t expect to wear a green or blue shirt w/o seeing the sweat spots in the armpits....</li>
            <li> Be careful when ordering because you can&#x27;t return it since it is flammable.  </li>
            <li> Since having breast cancer I wanted to be careful about what I was using for deodorant.  </li>
            <li> Before this I was using clinical strength secret (not a secret,</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just too heavy of a sweater, but I couldn&#x27;t use this on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> After searching everywhere for a natural alternative to standard (and frighteningly unhealthy) deodorants, I discovered this product and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I hate the smell of the Rose one.</li>
            <li> It does work for a short time but frankly plain soap and water work just as well.</li>
            <li> I am a server at a restaurant in Florida, where it is often hot and muggy outside and I have never smelled foul odors from my underarms since I switched.</li>
            <li> I am afraid to even buy it again online because I tried purchasing it again in the fall and it smelled exactly the same -</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and while the spray took some getting used to (I&#x27;m not very coordinated, so I&#x27;ve sprayed myself in the face and hair a few times)</li>
            <li> A little spray goes a long way.</li>
            <li> have read the 1- and 2- start review of this product, and I can&#x27;t fathom how it could be reviewed at anything other than 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Outside of this situation, I can&#x27;t imagine why you would not LOVE this item.</li>
            <li> I use other Weleda products and am always amazed by how well they work.  </li>
            <li> I plan to try the other scents, as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Weleda products and deodorants</li>
            <li> I use other Weleda products</li>
            <li> my job is extremely laborious and I do tend to sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Some people complain about the smell and other things.</li>
            <li> I believe this smell is what the other people on here are referring to when they say it smells nothing like roses.</li>
            <li> I have used other Weleda products and deodorant</li>
            <li> Every other product over the counter made my underarms burn &amp; itch.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Apparently, this is due to</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the other scents.</li>
            <li> And conflicts with any other scent you might want to wear.  </li>
            <li> I want to reduce the use of aluminum and other chemicals</li>
            <li> The sent of the parfum doesn&#x27;t last past 1-2hrs.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t sweat excessively under my arms or anything (actually probably less underarm than normal people), but when using this deodorant, my pits were not pleasant.  </li>
            <li> Pair it with a little talc powder and you&#x27;ll be dry all day.  </li>
            <li> To me at least, it smells like artificial roses: a pinch of roses with the overwhelming scent of alcohol.</li>
            <li> I have also suffered from severe acne and cysts under my arms, and those have also disappeared since I left behind my traditional antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> The only negative for me is the smell.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that bees are attracted to the floral scent.</li>
            <li> Rather annoyed this is marketed as a natural deodorant however contains parfum which means I am allergic.</li>
            <li> The other problem is that this contains quite a few chemicals, even without aluminum.</li>
            <li> , I WILL stink if I don&#x27;t use 12 and a half swipes of deodorant on each armpit.. and even then, I will still probably end up with b.o. by end of day...</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it takes a few uses to get used to the sprayer.</li>
            <li> I now realize that was from my previous products, not my sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I now realize that was from my previous products, not my sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I expected a hint of rose, but instead I got a terrible headache.  </li>
            <li> I did the &amp;#34;sniff test&amp;#34; after doing some aerobics and noticed a very faint odor (which is normal even if I use my regular deodorant when I work out) but it wasn&#x27;t bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was having allergic reactions to almost all typical deodorants</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t wear deo at all, maybe at the end of the day there will be some slight odor, but I have to search for it.  </li>
            <li> Another complaint, albeit a minor one, is that I also found the spray bottle was less user-friendly in the locker room at the gym.</li>
            <li> Since I am looking for an all-day natural deodorant, I am forced to say that this deodorant is a failure.</li>
            <li> It works but not on days that are very active, you will offend, trust me.</li>
            <li> It lasts probably half a day for myself and a few hours for my boyfriend before we need to reapply (and thats without working out or running around doing things).</li>
            <li> I was a little bit worried that the scent may be &amp;#34;cheap smelling&amp;#34; as one of the reviewers mentioned.</li>
            <li> who doesn&#x27;t want to smell a little rosier?</li>
            <li> I had BO by the end of every day I used it, and it is a little sticky as well.  </li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the price!</li>
            <li> I also find the spray-on application a bit awkward, and realized I really prefer a stick.</li>
            <li> and it mellows out after a few minutes too.</li>
            <li> But it does vanish a lot a few minutes after spraying it on so that&#x27;s a plus.  </li>
            <li> Aluminium and heavy chemicals in deodorants frighten me to death.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to use harsh chemicals, so I resign myself to the fact that sweat is a part of life.</li>
            <li> but it was not available</li>
            <li> I feel like I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I had tried a deodorant from a health food store and it just didn&#x27;t work, then I gave up for another few years.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I&#x27;ve tried this deodorant for a few days and it lasts about 4 hours before the underarm smell begins to break through.</li>
            <li> something that I&#x27;ve never experienced before actually.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having trouble with natural deodorants, some just plain don&#x27;t work, and some make me smell weird...</li>
            <li> Big old waste of money :(</li>
            <li> Sounds negative, but any other deodorant I would use gives up after a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> The main problem for me is that it stings like CRAZY when I apply it within 12 hours of shaving my armpits.</li>
            <li> It also burns pretty bad if you apply it after shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this a few times and I&#x27;m still not sure if I like it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to carry this stuff around and reapply-- especially because it&#x27;s quite wet and awkward to apply with clothes still on.  </li>
            <li> and it usually lasts all day.</li>
            <li> do sweat, and it&#x27;s not cute.</li>
            <li> I also purchased the small travel sizes in another order.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this deoderant, especially since I usually use an anti-perspirant.</li>
            <li> I received it in the mail I was anxious to try it.</li>
            <li> I keep the small bottle with me in case</li>
            <li> I can usually stand the smelly shampoos and perfumes and soaps.</li>
            <li> I have a bottle in my bathroom and a small travel one that goes in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter sometimes has excessive perspiration and swears by this product.</li>
            <li> or if you are a heavy sweater but at least it does work).</li>
            <li> all of a sudden it just started smelling so weird.</li>
            <li> I bought this deodorant a year ago and I was not satisfied because I continually had to apply it.</li>
            <li> She swears by this stuff, but we could only ever find it at expensive &amp;#34;natural food stores&amp;#34; that over charge you for everything.  </li>
            <li> You may have to reapply it once throughout the day if you sweat a lot, but I usually don&#x27;t have to.</li>
            <li> However, know that the unnecessary thick glass bottle that the deodorant comes in is extremely prone to breakage.</li>
            <li> Afraid of becoming &amp;#34;that person&amp;#34; at work (you know, the one who has bad b.o,</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, I actually feel like it lasts longer than my previous brand (Dove&#x27;s Cucumber and Melon scented stick) and I told my coworkers and friends to tell me if I ever smell bad</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m a \\&quot;hard case\\&quot; in the deodorant department.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product, at least not until you find it in a store and try the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> ;: no matter how cold it is outside and Im freezing my pits still sweat.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s negative effect on women.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little hesitant because I&#x27;m afraid that the rosy odor would bother me (and other people).  </li>
            <li> ( I mean, $16 for deodorant?</li>
            <li> ;, I mean I get sweat stains that look like the outline of Italy under my arms.</li>
            <li> It works as well if not better than Secret.</li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed in any Weleda product thus far.</li>
            <li> Not a pleasant smell and hard to get off.</li>
            <li> It seriously works.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> Subtle fragrance.</li>
            <li> But chemicals in deodorant are not good for you</li>
            <li> Its somewhat expensive but a bottle lasts me a few months.</li>
            <li> I had my hubby asking me why I smell like rubbing alcohol (not good).</li>
            <li> It burns after shaving too, but it goes away in a few minutes, and I would rather have that then use the crap with all the foreign ingredients!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like some awful DEET/citronella scent and it is very over-powering.</li>
            <li> I stopped using antiperspirant years ago when I learned how dangerous the heavy metals are.</li>
            <li> but this one really smells terrible.  </li>
            <li> But alas, this did not work for me.  </li>
            <li> NOT an antiperspirant (those are unhealthy to use anyway).</li>
            <li> I felt like it made me smell even worse at times.</li>
            <li> For whatever reason, this made my underarms smell so much worse than without anything on them after sweating.</li>
            <li> Alas, the search continues.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost worse than if I didn&#x27;t wear any deodorant at all.  </li>
            <li> I developed a horrible allergic reaction to this product.  </li>
            <li> ,DOESNT BLEND WELL WITH OTHER PERFUMES &amp; BODY SPRAYS THAT YOU HAVE ON!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I found it difficult to breathe the air around me and the smell triggered headaches.</li>
            <li> The scent lasts and doesn&#x27;t merely cover body odor.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I did not like the scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say this</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that it would work for me, but I was proven wrong.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I sweat, work strenuous 12 hours shifts and am unable to reapply at work.</li>
            <li> BECAUSE IT JUST WREAKED AND HAD NO PLEASANT SMELL TO IT :(</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this product I have found that I can go longer without concern of my deodorant wearing off, and I can wear black without fear of the evil &amp;#34;white stripes of embarrassment&amp;#34; from appearing around my waist line from pulling my clothes on after application.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this deodorant! It is like a deodorant and a perfume in one. I am a fan of rose-y perfumes, so this hits the spot. The scent is very feminine, gentle, and just perfect. I love that it lasts pretty long, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about the aluminium, glycols, parabens, mineral oils or any other crap that a reasonable person should steer away from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read the 1- and 2- start review of this product, and I can&#x27;t fathom how it could be reviewed at anything other than 5 stars. Of course, if you absolutely abhor roses and have a tendency to smell intensely, then you would probably be better served with a traditional strong deodorant+antiperspirant. Outside of this situation, I can&#x27;t imagine why you would not LOVE this item.</li>
            <li> arrived with some leakage....</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  It works great, smells good and is very good for my sensitive underarm skin!  Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many natural deodorants and even made my own. None of them worked very well at keeping me from getting stinky on warm days. I still used them and just tried to wash and reapply during the day. With Weleda Wildrose Deodorant, I don&#x27;t have to do that. In fact, I have gone a whole day and then gone to Zumba the next morning and STILL was not stinky. And I forgot to do an extra couple sprays in the afternoon (which I try to do on hot days just in case). I was literally shocked at how well it works. Better for me than conventional deodorants, even. I can understand some of the reviewers take on the smell being strong, or powdery but it doesn&#x27;t smell that way to me. I like it and it mellows out after a few minutes too. If you like rose smell with a touch of lemon you will like this. I am going to try the citrus version as well next time just to change things up, but I&#x27;ll never use anything but Weleda now.</li>
            <li> Horrible smell, not very effective.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my crystal stick just wasnt cutting it and I wanted something natural. This works but I usually have to use it twice a day when its really hot.</li>
            <li> Great scent to manage your scent without the worry of the aluminum in anti antiperspirants.  The scent doesn&#x27;t last very long because I only really smell it when spraying it but it neutralizes any odor you may have..Its easy to apply and you never have to worry about the white chalk marks on clothes anymore...Their citrus scent is great for the summer and this is great for spring.</li>
            <li> Okay, not to turn into a Calgon commercial here, but I really do LOVE this deodorant. It works well, and best of all, it smells (to my nose, at least) simply wonderful! ( I know, I know, cue the music, and the soft twirling of pettycoats!)&lt;br /&gt;Can you tell I love the smell of roses? This is \\&quot;wild rose\\&quot; and the Weleda take seems to have a hint of citrus in it as well, but it is fresh and lovely, and again, to my nose, not very cloying, or overly sweet as some rose scents can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see here on the reviews that some folks didn&#x27;t really care for the scent. If you are in doubt, I know that most natural food stores (i.e. \\&quot;Whole Paycheck\\&quot;, \\&quot;Wild Goats\\&quot;, and \\&quot;New Sneezins\\&quot;,(PDX)) carry this in the natural beauty sections, and often have a sample open. And since the price in these stores is often double what it is on Amazon, this is a real treat for me to order it here! ( I mean, $16 for deodorant? That&#x27;s enough to wilt even the heartiest of \\&quot;Flowers\\&quot;...) Woo-hoo!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. The smell is attractive, the product is effective, and for the quality the price isn&#x27;t too bad. The mini bottle is perfect for your purse. I get comments all the time on how nice my \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; is :)</li>
            <li> i am generally a sweater, although usually dont have odor. i&#x27;ve decided that sweating is fine and first tried the Healthy Deodorant stick and even with reapplication throughout the day i felt like i had BO. I started using this and spritz once at night after my shower and once in the morning and it usually lasts all day. i feel like with deodarant/antipersperants i&#x27;m probably 90-95% odor free, and with this maybe 80-85%, but that 10% is worth it to not use chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;i even accidentally used it the same night after waxing my underarms, and there was a 10-second sting but no irritation and the sting went away.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this deoderant.  Works so much better than other natural ones in the summer.  I use other Weleda products and am always amazed by how well they work.  This one finally did the job.  They even have a travel size, so you can take it with you on the go.  I&#x27;m very impressed.  I gave it a 4 because it does smell a bit strong when you first put it on, but it is a nice floral scent to me.  It smells kinda like perfume without the added chemicals and synthetic fragrances.  Lasts a long time, especially compared to other natural ones that I have tried and needed to keep reapplying.  I will definitely be buying a bottle of this as my deoderant from now on!  I plan to try the other scents, as well.</li>
            <li> I try to be a healthy person for the most part. Excersize, eat healthy, use natural products when they are convenient or if they work..   No Trans fats - check, no preservatives - check, no high fructose corn syrup - check, no aluminum chloride -  wait, what??   I think sometimes we put more thinking into what we put into our bodies and less about what we put on our bodies! My mom has told me for years that deodorant causes alzheimers disease... \\&quot;ok mom, whatever, I&#x27;ll deal with that later, but for now I don&#x27;t want to stink and thanks to the genes that were given me by YOU, I WILL stink if I don&#x27;t use 12 and a half swipes of deodorant on each armpit.. and even then, I will still probably end up with b.o. by end of day...\\&quot;   I ordered this deodorant because it&#x27;s cheaper and bigger than the L&#x27;Occitane deodorant I&#x27;ve been using, which still had the aluminum in it. I honestly didn&#x27;t think it would work for me, all I have to do is think about getting b.o. and bada bing! I stink.  I tried the deodorant the first day I got it. And to my surprise, it really worked! I was impressed, but I wasn&#x27;t totally sold... I had to put this product to the ultimate test! So this morning, I laced up my tennis shoes and did a 45 minute high endurance work-out burning over 800 calories!! When I was done, I was sweating like a pregnant nun in church, like I had just showered in my yoga clothes! As soon as I caught my breath, I did the old lift the arm and sniff test.. I was really expecting to smell a combination of b.o. and roses, but there was no sign of b.o. at all!!! I still haven&#x27;t showered yet.. I was too excited to write this review, and my armpits still smell fresh (the rest of my body, not so much)   I&#x27;m switching my whole family to this product, if it works for me, it will work for anyone. Of course, I&#x27;ll have to get the more masculan, less rosey scent for the hubby.. but first I&#x27;m hitting the shower.</li>
            <li> The smell, to me, is horrific. It&#x27;s like some awful DEET/citronella scent and it is very over-powering. I basically had the same reaction to it that I do bug spray - I found it difficult to breathe the air around me and the smell triggered headaches. Duration was lacking, as well. Seemed to last three to four hours, then required reapplication. Reapplying a natural deodorant is nothing new to me, but I don&#x27;t enjoy having to do it so often and with such an awful scent. I quickly moved on to the Herban Cowboy brand and haven&#x27;t been happier.</li>
            <li> This really does make you smell extra weird when you perspire. It does work for a short time but frankly plain soap and water work just as well.</li>
            <li> I really love the scent of this. It has a spicier, earthy rose scent from the geranium oil in it. I carry it with me because like most natural deodorants on me, it doesn&#x27;t last for more than 8 hours. I apply it twice throughout the day for total freshness. The spray is nice because there&#x27;s no stickiness and it allows you to sweat naturally while masking odor. I even sometimes use it as a perfume. Great product, but I would suggest to someone who&#x27;s never smelled it to go to a Whole Foods or your local health food store and try out the samples they have there. I love the smell and it works great with my chemistry.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant. It&#x27;s effective, smells lovely, and a bottle lasts for *months*.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the good reviews and was not disappointed.  I love it!  I ran out of a natural deodorant that Lush made, and found they didn&#x27;t make it any more, so I was forced to make another choice.  It smells wonderful when you apply it, and then the scent fades so that you can wear other perfumes... just as other reviews said.  It&#x27;s mostly a rose smell with lemon, but the lemon is very subtle and definitely an undertone.  It&#x27;s not a FURNITURE POLISH SMELL AT ALL (like one review said).  My husband loves the way it smells.  :-)  The best thing is that I think it works even better than the natural deodorant I had before which I was very satisfied with.  I never have to reapply it during the day.  And even if I don&#x27;t shower in the morning the day after applying it, I don&#x27;t worry about it not lasting through my work-out like I did with my past natural deodorant.  I&#x27;d highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have used various deodorants with levels of aluminum and other ingredients that have been connected with breast cancer and Alzheimers. It was time for a change.  Weleda Wildrose Deodorant spray is made with great odor neutralizers, like citronella. The wild rose scent isn&#x27;t so strong that it is obtrusive, yet, isn&#x27;t so subtle that you don&#x27;t feel fresh and clean. The scent lasts and doesn&#x27;t merely cover body odor. The package does recommend that you spray it, as you need to, since it isn&#x27;t made with chemicals that normally \\&quot;kill\\&quot; scent, as well as serve as strong anti-persiparant components. Pretty pleased so far!</li>
            <li> This deodorant is really lovely and very feminine . It reminds me of rose water. It definitely smells like roses and it also smells natural. I am very sensitive to chemical fragrances, so I was happy to find out that this is natural and does not negatively affect me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it and you don&#x27;t have to use much as the scent is strong.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find something that it is natural but without the aluminum elements that most anti-antiperspirants have, however I understand this is a difficult task. This product is good - it neutralizes the odors, but it didn&#x27;t stop the sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think most naturals items won&#x27;t stop the sweat (after all it is the natural thing that our body does), so maybe the problem is me. For this product don&#x27;t expect to wear a green or blue shirt w/o seeing the sweat spots in the armpits....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is pleasant, but a little too strong for me - I didn&#x27;t think I could wear my fragrance and the deodorant at the same time - that&#x27;s why I gave the four stars.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for years for a natural deodorant that works.  I have bought just about every natural one on the market, including the crystals, and even made my own deodorant, which worked, but was messy.  So I decided to give this one a shot given the positive feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  I like that it&#x27;s a pump spray and that it is in glass, not plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Didn&#x27;t cover my body odor after wearing for only 5 hours.  The scent is VERY STRONG!  Smells like old lady perfume.  The ingredients says it is fragrance free, but the smell is overwhelming!</li>
            <li> The stench that comes from this bottle made me feel like I was being gassed to death. I had to pitch it. If your nose isn&#x27;t as sensitive as mine, you may do better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of natural deodorants and this is the best.  It also erases odor you might have had before application.  It may take multiple applications during the course of a hot day, but this does not bother me in the least.  The bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I went through many stinky days searching for a natural deodorant that worked and this one ended my search! The reviews are spot on. A few notes on this product; it is expensive, it will sting if you spray it on right after you shave your underarms, the scent is quite strong (but dissipates quickly)&lt;br /&gt;But for the pro of it working, and working really well it&#x27;s definitely worth it! Buy the large size, the small will only last you just over a month or so.</li>
            <li> Smells disgusting like roach spray</li>
            <li> Works, like the smell</li>
            <li> Of the natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried throughout the years, this one works the best and smells fabulous!</li>
            <li> Best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried so far! Does smell a bit strong, similar to the strength of a body spray (not near as strong as a perfume). Lasts all day and no irritation, even when applying after shaving. My only complaint is that it takes a few uses to get used to the sprayer. My first few sprays resulted with more product in the air then on my armpit. (Mostly user error)</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and it works well and seems to last me the whole day, even after doing yoga. I think it is better smelling than the other Weleda scents. I will probably reapply after doing sports, and I smell great again and I&#x27;m very happy with this stuff overall. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> best deodorant, good for you and smells good too</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even begin to explain the scent, it is a nauseating, old lady rose smell, with a burst of stench that permeates throughout the NYC subway.  Just horrible.</li>
            <li> Burns after shaving arm pits. Does nothing to stop underarm odor for me. I loved the scent.</li>
            <li> I love this product - I wear the rose in the summer and citrus and sage other times of the year.  Though they are all wonderful and great year round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy this is offered on Amazon and at such a great price.  Thank you amazon you save me money and time!!! :)</li>
            <li> This has been the answer to my natural deodorant search! Will definitely be trying all scents in the coming years.</li>
            <li> A great product.  This stuff does not cause any type of reaction. on my sensitive skin.  Has to be reapplied at times, however, it works very well.</li>
            <li> I like the scent and that it&#x27;s natural, but it only protects me so far...gonna have to find something else for summer maybe.</li>
            <li> This deodorant was everything I hoped for!! It smells amazing and leaves a light fresh rose scent for most of the day. I also love that it comes in a glass bottle instead of plastic, so A+ for packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Note: I&#x27;ve read a few negative reviews for this from people first switching to natural non-toxic deodorant. I would like to say that immediately after you stop using mainstream, toxic deodorant, you will sweat and smell more for a WHILE, no matter what product you use. It took my body about 6 weeks after I stopped using Secret deodorant to stabilize my sweat production and BO on its own. That was about 6 months ago. I have tried several natural deodorants, and this is by far my favorite. I&#x27;m on my second bottle and I&#x27;ll be trying out more scents of Weleda soon.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled that I switched to this deodorant from my old aluminum based brand. I had growing concerns about using many chemicals on my skin because as I get older I have noticed my skin seems to be more sensitive to things. I have also been becoming more environmentally aware and trying to use more natural products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main concerns when I bought this product were obviously the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Will I be smelly?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, the product does a great job preventing body odor for me. I am a server at a restaurant in Florida, where it is often hot and muggy outside and I have never smelled foul odors from my underarms since I switched. Surprisingly, I actually feel like it lasts longer than my previous brand (Dove&#x27;s Cucumber and Melon scented stick) and I told my coworkers and friends to tell me if I ever smell bad and I have only received compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Does this product have too strong of a &#x27;rose&#x27; scent, making me smell like a hippy?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, yeah. It kind of does. Haha. Honestly, it is much like using rose extract or rose oil. It is very overwhelming when you first apply the product. I try to leave my arms up for 30 seconds to a minute so the product can dry (which reduces the smell) before I finish getting dressed. I typically use about 4-5 pumps under each arm and am always shocked by the astounding amount of rose-scent sieging my senses. I typically wear perfumes and body sprays that are floral-based however so after dries it does get cloaked by similar scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are not a &amp;#34;floral&amp;#34; person, meaning you don&#x27;t enjoy or smell as good with perfumes or products with floral based notes then I would recommend getting a different scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, my last concern...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Will I start sweating buckets?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do sweat, and it&#x27;s not cute. This product does not prevent perspiration, so my underarms do get wet on really hot days. Thankfully it hasn&#x27;t been to the point of embarrassment and one great thing is that this product does not stain my shirts, nor does my sweat. Before this, my white shirts would get stains under the arms from sweating. I now realize that was from my previous products, not my sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product I have found that I can go longer without concern of my deodorant wearing off, and I can wear black without fear of the evil &amp;#34;white stripes of embarrassment&amp;#34; from appearing around my waist line from pulling my clothes on after application. I love how this product feels on my skin, it is a nice mist and it leaves my skin feeling clean and soft. I won&#x27;t use regular deodorant ever again.int of embarrassment and one great thing is that this product does not stain my shirts, nor does my sweat.

            <li> I love this product.  It has a natural rather than synthetic scent and does exactly what it is made to do.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product.  When used with sleeveless tops/dresses it didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> I like the citrus scent better, but works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> This deodorant smells WONDERFUL, has no aluminum, and does not test on animals. Probably the best and longest-lasting &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorant I have ever tried, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot. It really keeps the BO at bay, and the only reason I did not give this product 5 stars is because the high alcohol content can cause my underarms to break out, especially if I apply just after shaving. The sage-scented deodorant, though, never caused breakouts.</li>
            <li> Fantastic Rose oil makes this &#x27;old school&#x27; spray on a delight to the senses!  Weleda rules!</li>
            <li> I stopped using antiperspirant years ago when I learned how dangerous the heavy metals are. I&#x27;m very conscious of what I put on my skin and on which companies I support with my money and I have tried MANY natural deodorants over the years with mixed results. This one scared me off because of the price and because I don&#x27;t love the smell of roses, but it was recommended by someone who works at my local naturals store, so I bought a small travel sized bottle and loved it so much that I&#x27;m now on my 3rd full sized bottle of this! It lasts a long time and while the spray took some getting used to (I&#x27;m not very coordinated, so I&#x27;ve sprayed myself in the face and hair a few times), I love that I can use every last drop that comes in each bottle (no wasting that nub at the end of a stick of deodorant).  I&#x27;ve tried the other fragrances Weleda makes, too, but I really love this one. It works and even though I don&#x27;t love the smell of roses, I love when my pits smell like roses! Seriously, this stuff works really well. I think you can even use it as a perfume/body spray if you really like the scent.</li>
            <li> Great Deoderant! It pretty much last all day without any embarassing wear off as the day progresses. It&#x27;s light and not sticky, like some other natural products I&#x27;ve used. I really love the citrus and was skeptical about this one, but it&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> It is way too potent and intoxicating.  I&#x27;ve used other Weleda products and deodorants but this one really smells terrible.  Be careful when ordering because you can&#x27;t return it since it is flammable.  This is not the vendors fault who delivers it or sells it.</li>
            <li> Love the scent of this deodorant and that it is spray. Works well staying fresh all day. Planning to buy the full line of Wild Rose scent!</li>
            <li> I am allergic to most main stream deodorants and antiperspirants. I use other Weleda products so thought I would give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really does eliminate odor well - although it some times has to be reapplied throughout the day, the nice thing is you can do that and it is like starting fresh at the beginning of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main complaint would be that because it contains alcohol it can be a bit drying, and really stings if you have shaved within a day or so of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically like rose scent, but not this. This smells like cheap, strong cologne and I will definitely choose something different the next time.</li>
            <li> I love the scent (more like a perfume than a deodorant) and it works really well.  My only complaint is that is stings like a dickens if you spray it on newly shaved underarms.  You have been warned!</li>
            <li> I was really amazed by how much I loved this product. I&#x27;d been trying different brands of natural deodorants and nothing seemed to work. Finally, I decided to spend a little more than what I&#x27;m used to on a deodorant and it was worth every penny! Traditional antiperspirants/deodorants tend to build up defeating the purpose of wearing a deodorant in the first place: to feel clean. The scent also lasts very long which is unusual because natural deodorants tend to fade very quickly, making me feel self-conscious. With Weleda, that doesn&#x27;t happen, the smell kind of lingers on in a very pleasant way, without being overpowering. I purposely try to get a little on my hair in the mornings because I love the rose scent so much. The only drawback would be the bees being too attracted to the floral aroma, which I can forsee happening in the outdoors.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only natural deodorant that really works !  I&#x27;ve been using it for a long time now and will never again use anything else.</li>
            <li> I was happily surprised to receive this larger volume. The quality is excellent and it is nice to have a deodorant that does not smell of aerosol or perfume. Pure Rose scentl</li>
            <li> Every time I try a Weleda product, I am blown away by the quality and satisfaction it delivers!  Not only are their products void of chemicals and harmful ingredients, but they always perform better than any other product I&#x27;ve ever known!</li>
            <li> Great stuff! There isn&#x27;t much to say other than it works!! It seriously works. I am very happy with it and my husband uses the Sage and he loves it too. We were using Toms of Main and OMG we stunk! It didn&#x27;t work at all... but this doesn&#x27;t surprise me as they are owned by Colgate... Stick with this stuff I will never use a different deodorant again.</li>
            <li> I THINK THIS DEODORANT IS PRETTY STINKY AND COULD HAVE BEEN MADE A LITTLE BETTER SMELL. I HAD TO THROW IT AWAY BECAUSE IT JUST WREAKED AND HAD NO PLEASANT SMELL TO IT :(</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant and this is a great price. I also purchased the small travel sizes in another order. Came to my door quickly.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! So far this is the one that keeps me the freshest the longest. My husband loves it too! My mom uses it and now one of my friends does too. Some times, due to my body letting out toxins from being injured, I do have extra Bo. I wash every day and every day I smell different due to whether or not I am in more or less pain. On the days that I have more pain I smell like I haven&#x27;t showered in days, so I have to wash off again. On the days that I am not in as much pain I will smell like a rose until the following day.&#x27; I have had this particular problem with all deodorants and antiperspirants, this one works the best and is natural. It does smell like rosewater with alcohol in it. That would give it more of a chemical smell in comparison to rose water made by other means. I did just start to use a rose water with aloe and hyaluronic acid in it as well and I use it on my under arms before I  use the deodorant now and it seems to help even more.</li>
            <li> Keeps me dry all day, no sickening artificial scents and it is simply lovely. All natural too, so no more rashes.</li>
            <li> My 7 year old was coming home from school smelling like BO.  I let her use deodorant but wanted a natural alternative and found this all the reviews were great. This smells like roses and I also bought the sage which smells great I even use it too sometimes, But I still need an antiperspirant.  Last a long time too. Worth it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for very long at all. Tried reapplying but it just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I have used many commercial deodorant products throughout my lifetime until I became better informed about the \\&quot;ingredients\\&quot; thereof, and quickly opted to use only the natural applications that are not harmful to the body topically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But even with the many good products out there, prior to using Weleda Wildrose Deodorant, never before have I been so delighted with the performance and ingredients of Weleda (I also purchased Weleda Wildrose Body Lotion).  These products have kept me fresh, comfortable and benefited my skin completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deodorant can also be used as a light fragrance mist upon the body itself, as the properties are actually good for the skin! What a great choice to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Weleda - An Outstanding Product</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this deoderant, especially since I usually use an anti-perspirant. This really seems to cut back on my sweating. The only negative for me is the smell. It&#x27;s a little old lady-ish. I think when this bottle runs out, I&#x27;ll try a different scent. Overall, though, I think I&#x27;ll stick with this product!</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product, at least not until you find it in a store and try the fragrance.  The smell is VERY strong and overwhelming.  Contains a lot of alcohol and fragrance; not just natural ingredients. On top of it all, you can not return it because it is classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases and cannot be returned to Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> My go-to deodorant after a cancer scare. Natural, pleasant smelling, and the alcohol disinfects any bacteria.</li>
            <li> It works!  Why only 3 stars?  They need to come up with a much better and easier spray and go easy on the alcohol; it stings when used after shaving.  I have to push the spray harder in order for the contents to come out and most of the time all I get is a thin squirt which drips all the way to my waist and had to use my fingers to spread it on my armpit.  I also need to use a tissue to  wipe my side if I don&#x27;t want to smell roses in alcohol all day.</li>
            <li> So I wanted to try to switch to a natural deodorant after speaking with a co-worker that does research on cancer. She was saying that they have found that  the harmful materials in regular deodorant can cause cancer. And that because antiperspirants clog your pores, this hinders your body from sweating out toxins from your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I thought hey I will do some of my own research and look into some natural deodorants. I came across this Weleda Wildrose Deodorant 3.4oz here. I read the reviews and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The initial cost and shipping was reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received it in the mail I was anxious to try it. I was a little bit worried that the scent may be &amp;#34;cheap smelling&amp;#34; as one of the reviewers mentioned. However I did not find that to be the case. I know that scents are a very personal experience so every one may differ in theirs. But for me I absolutely love the scent, it reminds me of the tea-rose perfume oil they used to sell at the body shop years ago (Canada).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to put it to the test before I made my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work in a hospital and my job is extremely laborious and I do tend to sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that the scent stayed fresh from around 7am when I applied it, to around 1130am. I found that I needed a second application at that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as far as I am concerned it works, and I am completely surprised that it does. I love my regular deodorant/antiperspirant the way it smells, and blocks sweat. But if there are ways to improve my health without smelling like a hippie I am all for it.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s what I was worried about when I was looking into trying this out. I didn&#x27;t want to smell like BO mixed with some scent. That&#x27;s what I thought was going to happen. That this would just mask the smell. But it seems to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real test will be when I go to Asia this spring. The high humidity and temperatures should prove as a better indicator as to how well this works. So I will update my review then as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line I would recommend this to any lady wanting a more healthy deodorant, The price is reasonable and so is the shipping. And personally I love the fragrance. I will be buying more of these to stock up for sure.</li>
            <li> Update: It worked at first and then stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;After trying tons of natural deodorants, I can say that this one works okay, but the rose scent is too strong. My boyfriend hated it. If you&#x27;re in the market for a natural deo, I highly recommend the Weleda citrus one. I love it!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good deodorant, though it does sting a lot if you use it after shaving, hence the 4 stars. I use it with Schmidt&#x27;s Natural Deodorant in Lavendar Sage (http://www.amazon.com/Schmidts-Natural-Deodorant-Lavender-Sage/dp/B00D2KW68Y/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1435274796&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;deoderant+cream) and that seems to work really for me, when it comes to the natural stuff I like to layer since I can&#x27;t find any one product that does the trick. I spray the Weleda first then after it dries (pretty quickly) I put on the Schmidt&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> There is a rather odd smell to it and the nice rose scent wears away to an odd smell I do not care for.  There is a warning in the packet not to get it on mucus membrane tissue which I found odd, as you spray it onto your pits and obviously breathe the air close to it as well.  This has led to an awkward application process of fear and my avoiding the product often all together.  I like my natural, pure and safe products to come without scary warnings, beyond those aimed towards people with severe allergies.  I will likely not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love the smell! Feminine without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> Mostly Effective. Very effective for an (alternative) deodorant!  Reduced sweating, Not as good with odor control, but Much better than the Jason Brand deodorants (had to throw them away after using 1 time). Nice rose odor. Not offensive odor. Rose odor can be unisex, not too feminine. My main concern was with the odor control......You REALLY have to pour it on for it to be effective. Then it would be wasteful</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Weleda deodorant for three or four months now, and have been generally pleased.  Unlike Tom&#x27;s of Maine, or Kiss My Face (which used to work for me, but has not been working since they reformulated), Weleda prevents odor from developing under my armpits within the span of a day.  Like other natural deodorants, it does not prevent odor from developing if I&#x27;m wearing a shirt that I&#x27;ve worn more than twice without washing it, even if I&#x27;ve only ever worn the shirt with deodorant on.  I put it on immediately after showering, and every morning.  I think in the end, the bottle will end up lasting for six or seven months, given my use of 4-6 sprays per armpit once a day, seven days a week, plus after every shower (about an extra 2-3 times per week).  The smell is pleasant.  I do not feel compelled to search for an alternative product, unless this one stops working.</li>
            <li> I like the scent of this just fine. It lasts me a several months. Compared to roll-ons I only wish I were more efficient at aiming it at my armpit, I&#x27;m probably wasting a bit of it every time (it&#x27;s easier using the travel size). For me it&#x27;s sufficient to use it once in the morning, maybe again in the evening if I&#x27;m going out.</li>
            <li> Like all Weleda products, this one is excellent, and the odor is natural and pleasing. The Sage Deodorant, I purchased for my husband and he is equally pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I know that everyone has a different body chemistry, so what works on one person doesn&#x27;t work on another. that is the case here. The smell of this on my skin isn&#x27;t very pleasant and it doesn&#x27;t keep me fresh. My search continues.</li>
            <li> Some people complain about the smell and other things. I think this product is better for people with deodorant allergies like me. When you have to use natural products there aren&#x27;t a lot to choose from and on top of that the products vary in quality greatly. This has been my favorite so far. It doesn&#x27;t smell strong either. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> For me, this was truly a horrible product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since my breast biopsy in 2013 (where my doctor found out the cyst was benign, thank god) I&#x27;ve been trying to live a more natural/holistic lifestyle. I eat a little bit better, I wear sunscreen daily, and I&#x27;ve done my research on things that can cause cancer. Finds out, the aluminum in deodorants can cause breast cancer, and thus begins my struggle for a natural, aluminum free deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product did absolutely nothing. I applied 4 sprays to each pit, then rubbed in with my fingers. By 8:30am-9am I REEKED. I smelled as if I never even heard of deodorant my whole life. I tried sticking it out for two weeks thinking maybe my body had to get used to the sudden change in deos, but it seems the more I wore it, the smellier I became. Afraid of becoming &amp;#34;that person&amp;#34; at work (you know, the one who has bad b.o, but everyone is too polite/too intimidated to say anything about it to said person) In frustration I marched right into my nearest drugstore and grabbed some Lady Speedstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also expecting this to smell sweet (I don&#x27;t know why) however to me it smells nothing like roses. To me at least, it smells like artificial roses: a pinch of roses with the overwhelming scent of alcohol. Im also what I like to call a &amp;#34;cold sweat-er&amp;#34;: no matter how cold it is outside and Im freezing my pits still sweat. This deo definitely seem to have accelerated that, probably due to the fact that it didn&#x27;t work at all in the first place. I even tried adding my own essential oils (rosemary and peppermint) in order to do something, but no such luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only good thing that came from this is that I kept the bottle. Its made out of glass and after dumping the contents down the sink and peeling off the label, I have this really cute and functional bottle that I can throw my own diy beauty products in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im not giving up on my search for a natural deo! In the meantime I have ordered a different type from another amazon user and am patiently waiting its arrival.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last throughout the day</li>
            <li> This stuff smells very strongly of roses. I could get over that, but it also doesn&#x27;t seem to work. All it does is overpower your nose with rose.</li>
            <li> This one really works, but you may need to reapply during the day depending on your funk level.  The fragrance is lovely!  Despite the price, this is my favorite natural deodorant (some just don&#x27;t cut it for me-- I do Bikram yoga... go fig).  It is not an antiperspirant, so you will sweat; in my opinion, blocking sweat glands is a terrible plan, so I just buy clothes that you can&#x27;t see mega-wet pit stains in LOL</li>
            <li> Only brand of deodorant we buy.</li>
            <li> I love this deodarant, gave 4 only because it won&#x27;t last for whole day, although, its expected. Would recommend to everyone who is looking for  natural ones</li>
            <li> I love Weleda but this product just doesn&#x27;t work. At all. Smells good though!</li>
            <li> I want to love this product.. I really do!  After searching everywhere for a natural alternative to standard (and frighteningly unhealthy) deodorants, I discovered this product and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I love Weleda products, as they are all natural and high quality.  I thought for sure this would be the same.  But alas, this did not work for me.  Within an hour of spraying this on, I would already be sweating and smelling.  Now, I&#x27;m not at all a smelly person by any means.  In fact, I think I smell better when I&#x27;m not using any product at all - this spray just didn&#x27;t work with my body chemistry at all.  Very sad!  If I were to continue using this product, it would only be used as a light scent or body mist.</li>
            <li> This is a spray deodorant that feels much lighter and cleaner than a roll on stick.  Have been using this over the roll on and have switched to spray deodorant.</li>
            <li> The fragrance was VERY overwhelming. I expected a hint of rose, but instead I got a terrible headache.  I immediately passed it on to my mother.</li>
            <li> I actually really love the floral smell of this stuff! The main problem for me is that it stings like CRAZY when I apply it within 12 hours of shaving my armpits. I don&#x27;t shave them every day, but a few times a week—enough to make this stuff largely unusable for me.  I also find the spray-on application a bit awkward, and realized I really prefer a stick. This doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as stick deodorants, either. The other problem is that this contains quite a few chemicals, even without aluminum. I&#x27;ve experimented with a lot of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants and found that my favorites are in stick form and 100% natural. Organic Island and Green Tidings work great and don&#x27;t cause that sting.</li>
            <li> My wife has incredibly sensitive skin and spent years looking for a gentle, yet effective natural deodorant. After trying several baking soda or coconut oil based deodorants and ending up with rashes/welts under her arms, she finally found this one. The smell isn&#x27;t too overwhelmingly floral and it keeps her smelling fresh most days. On really hot or sweaty days, reapplying is a must, but this works the best by far of all the natural deodorants she&#x27;s tried. Be warned, this is alcohol based, so you might want to wait a bit after shaving to use this under your arms.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a few days now, pretty good. I may need to apply twice throughout day but it does work great.</li>
            <li> It does not last all day at all. Stay away from this product. The bottle is glass, so you cannot even carry it around with you.</li>
            <li> Second only to Black Chicken from Australia as far as natural deodorants.  NOT an antiperspirant (those are unhealthy to use anyway).</li>
            <li> I normally have to use clinical strength deodorant because the regular strength doesn&#x27;t cut it. But chemicals in deodorant are not good for you and I wanted something more natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I am not a fan of the scent.  It smells like cheap perfume.  A friend said it smells like an old lady&#x27;s perfume. lol  But it does vanish a lot a few minutes after spraying it on so that&#x27;s a plus.  The scent is why I docked a star. Maybe I&#x27;ll try one of the other scents but they weren&#x27;t available when I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I was pleasantly surprised at how well it holds up even after moderate exercise, especially for someone like me who normally needs a stronger strength deodorant.  So thumbs up for that.  I did the &amp;#34;sniff test&amp;#34; after doing some aerobics and noticed a very faint odor (which is normal even if I use my regular deodorant when I work out) but it wasn&#x27;t bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy this if I sweat a lot or did a lot of intense workouts.  Someone else also mentioned they didn&#x27;t like it because they sweat a lot so take note of that.  But no doubt I&#x27;ll be able to use this through the cooler months.  However in the summer I may have to go back to something with a little more protection.  But at least I can get a break from the chemicals for most of the year.</li>
            <li> Weleda is great. Good ingredients. I also use the almond face cream and more. I trust this company.</li>
            <li> Smells just like the description says, roses. Works very well as a deodorant and I live in AZ. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is a nice alternative to traditional deodorants.  Smells great and lasts long.  A little spray goes a long way.</li>
            <li> this stuff is terrific. i use it in conjunction with my salt rock to kill bacteria + smell nice &amp; it works swell for the latter job. the smell is so delightful, i forego perfume some days. also, it really does last all day long.</li>
            <li> Works very well, but I don&#x27;t love the floral scent.</li>
            <li> The best deodorant I have ever used. I have purchased this multiple times and will use this as long as it is available!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months and really enjoy it. It smells great--- like rose perfume. I spray it a couple times a day.</li>
            <li> This works great for me. No itchy underarms. My hubby uses the lime scent.</li>
            <li> The smell is okay but this product does NOT last at all! It&#x27;s over priced &amp; I want to return this product! Arm &amp; hammer works way better and it&#x27;s only $4!</li>
            <li> Very important-if you don&#x27;t like rose smelling things this is not for you! Also I think if this is the first &#x27;natural&#x27; item you try it might take some getting used to the smell. If you like rose, don&#x27;t like chemical heavy antiperspirants then this is for you!</li>
            <li> I LOVE my wild rose deodorant!  I tried many deodorants (non-antiperspirants) and this one works the best!  Its somewhat expensive but a bottle lasts me a few months.</li>
            <li> BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!AMAZON WILL NOT ALLOW THIS PURCHASE TO BE RETURNED!!!SCENT IS WAY TO STRONG,DOESNT BLEND WELL WITH OTHER PERFUMES &amp; BODY SPRAYS THAT YOU HAVE ON!!!!!!</li>
            <li> First ...The fragrance of this does not smell like roses, but more a chemical smell. It does dissipate in a short while though.&lt;br /&gt;Second.. I used this for 4 days. Although it was summer it didn&#x27;t matter what level of activity, this product did not give any deodorant protection. I tried applying more... still no difference. But upon rereading the pamphlet that came with it... it stated it could be applied 3 times daily. Well, I have enough to remember to do during the day and don&#x27;t want to take deodorant with me and reapply throughout the day. Save your $$ ... squirting body spray under your arms would do the same.</li>
            <li> Great if you&#x27;re only into all natural stuff- but all natural deodorants are not the most effective… Has a nice scent and works better than the crystal… May try the tea tree one next and see if that&#x27;s more effective.</li>
            <li> Refreshing summer deodorant cooling with clean refreshing light scent. Good quality just a tad pricey but will order again next summer.</li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few natural deodorants and this is the best so far. I loved the smell of the citrus version but this one works much better. It takes awhile to get used to using a spray and I always use 2 or 3 sprays per arm. It lasts all day and I don&#x27;t feel stinky except on a really bad day. I keep the small bottle with me in case I feel the need to reapply. It&#x27;s definitly worth trying. I wasn&#x27;t sure about it until I used up about half the small bottle. If you give it a chance it might work for you too. Great price and quick delivery from this seller, will use again.</li>
            <li> i bought this product because of the reviews talking very good of if, but i tried it and the first day it worked very good, but its been a couple of weeks and by middle of the  day its not working. still looking for the perfect deodorant without aluminum and other quimicals  that actually works.</li>
            <li> I wanted to switch from using deodorants with aluminum to more of a natural deodorant and I bought the Rose one for myself and the Sage one for my boyfriend. I hate the smell of the Rose one. It smells fake and just way too strong and I&#x27;m not even sensitive to smells! I can usually stand the smelly shampoos and perfumes and soaps. The sage one, however, smells amazing. It is definitely more of a manly smell but I wear that one occasionally just because I love it so much. They don&#x27;t last all day though. It lasts probably half a day for myself and a few hours for my boyfriend before we need to reapply (and thats without working out or running around doing things). If you work out, you definitely will need to reapply. I would probably recommend the sage flavor and would probably buy it again for my boyfriend just because I love the smell so much, but for me, I&#x27;m gonna either use Toms deodorant which I like or use the one I made myself.</li>
            <li> This deodorant spray smells wonderful, but if I&#x27;m being honest, it works like more of a body spray and less of a deodorant.</li>
            <li> This definitely controls odor. But it will not control wetness. That&#x27;s fine if I&#x27;m going to the gym and prepared to sweat. But if I&#x27;m giving a presentation and want to limit my perspiration, this is not the deodorant I would reach for. The smell isn&#x27;t my favorite either - a mixture of alcohol and roses. Overall, I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as well as regular deodorant but better than Toms ..I wanted something natural without alum in it.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant! It&#x27;s soooo convenient to use &amp; I love the rose scent. It does smell like it has a lot of alcohol in it though kinda &amp; sometimes burns if I put it on after shaving my under arms. I do love it though &amp; it seems to work good &amp; is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> The deodorant works very well in normal situations.  Does not keep up with stress sweat!  I recommend carrying this with you wherever you go so that you can reapply as needed.  Of the natural deodorants I have tried this is definitely my favorite!</li>
            <li> This is ok, but doesn&#x27;t keep odor down that well.</li>
            <li> Firstly, I enjoy the rose fragrance.  I very much enjoy the zero chemical fix.  I will use this again.  Oh, right...yes, it seems to work.</li>
            <li> Finally something that works and smells good! I&#x27;ve been having trouble with natural deodorants, some just plain don&#x27;t work, and some make me smell weird... like fruit loops (which after a while gets old). My friend recommended this product to me, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> I love how long it last on my arms. It&#x27;s the best thing I had ever tried. It smells good and worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for organic deodorants that truly work and, unfortunately, this deodorant didn&#x27;t prove very effective for me. I felt like it made me smell even worse at times. It seems that the wildrose scent is very polarizing, as people either love it or hate it. Since purchasing it online and using it for months now, I can say that I&#x27;m part of the group of people who don&#x27;t like the strong scent. I agree with other reviewers who said it&#x27;s like an old smell. I definitely won&#x27;t be buying this again.&lt;br /&gt;The only plus is that I&#x27;ve been using this bottle daily for 4+ months now and have gotten through about a third of it, so one bottle lasts long.</li>
            <li> Finally found a deodorant that works, amazing! Smells great, excellent service! Thank you!</li>
            <li> So when I put this product on it did smell like an old lady&#x27;s perfume, but I found that if you put coconut oil over the top it does reduce the smell enough that it isn&#x27;t over powering. It worked throughout the whole day of stress chasing around a 2 year old in a busy farmers market and festival. After putting it on at 10:00am (2 sprays) with a layer of coconut oil over the top to easy the smell at first. By about 12:00 the old lady smell went away and emerge a lovely rose smell which is still there at 6:00pm. I do recommend it is healthy and works, a great combo.</li>
            <li> I would give it 0 stars if I could. Ok yes it works but:&lt;br /&gt;1) it stinks to the point that is rather smell myself than that. I love roses wild and otherwise but this is so strong it makes you sick.&lt;br /&gt;2) the first ingredient is alcohol and it burns. Please be careful if you have sensitive skin. Applying it right out of the shower while effective was so painful I&#x27;d rather stick with the tried and true perfumed talc powder.</li>
            <li> Natural/healthy products shouldn&#x27;t rate out so badly on ewg.org.  I threw it out.</li>
            <li> I guess it works ok but the rose smell is very granny like. It&#x27;s not the type of rose smell that I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic all the time and I never have to think about ordering with subscribe and save! Products are always consistent.</li>
            <li> Aluminium and heavy chemicals in deodorants frighten me to death. I&#x27;ve seen first hand what alzheimers does to a person. No thank you, I&#x27;m going to do anything and everything to reduce that risk. I&#x27;ve been trying natural deodorants for a long time now, with mixed results. This is the best of the bunch by far. Users need to bear in mind that this is a natural product. It won&#x27;t work exactly the same as a chemically heavy drugstore antiperspirant, you may need to reapply mid-day or in the evening. I have a bottle in my bathroom and a small travel one that goes in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the &amp;#34;old lady perfume&amp;#34; that I see other reviewers referencing: Yes you do smell it strongly when putting it on, probably because you have your arm in the air and are spraying it near your face! After putting it on, I don&#x27;t find it lingers, besides I&#x27;m putting on scented body lotion anyway. It reminds my of my grandma, and hopefully I&#x27;ll still be able to remember her in years to come because I haven&#x27;t destroyed my brain with heavy chemicals in my cosmetics.</li>
            <li> Usually a huge fan of Weleda products (lip balm, toothpaste, lotion, oils, etc) so I thought this deodorant would be great! Definitely a huge let down. Not only did it NOT keep my usually mild BO at bay, it made it worse! I would reek to high heaven every time I used this spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend, however, has had PERFECT results with this deodorant, but in the sage scent, and my stepmom swears by the citrus scent. Perhaps the rose just doesn&#x27;t cut it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rose smell on its own is nice though, maybe it&#x27;ll serve as a nice body spray in the summer. For my natural deodorant, I&#x27;ll be sticking to the Soapwalla cream deodorant (A+) and Trader Joes brand deodorant (also A+)</li>
            <li> My daughter sometimes has excessive perspiration and swears by this product. I like it as it&#x27;s non-toxic and smells good.</li>
            <li> neither I or my family likes the smell, plus it feels sticky</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find a natural deodorant that actually works. This one did okay working with your body&#x27;s natural smell but I didn&#x27;t like the smell of it once it mixed. I do like that it makes you feel fresh after applying it but it didn&#x27;t keep odor away enough for me so the search continues!</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be honest. With any non-chemical deodorant, you&#x27;re still going to sweat, and it&#x27;s still going to smell. Anyone who tells you otherwise might also believe in fairies. But the scent is nice and I think it does a decent job of making me feel and smell fresher if I spritz throughout the day. I don&#x27;t want to use harsh chemicals, so I resign myself to the fact that sweat is a part of life.</li>
            <li> I like perfumed deodorant, so I thought I would try this one since it is so inexpensive. Now I know why it is so inexpensive. It smells horrible. I could not stand the smell of the product after spraying it on myself. It has a rose scent combined with an abrasive cheap perfume odor. What&#x27;s worse, it doesn&#x27;t work very well, so you have to spray more on throughout the day. I used it for two days (giving it a fair chance), but now I&#x27;m going back to my previous deodorant and throwing the full bottle of this Wildrose in the trash. Unless you like the smell of cheap perfume (and your own BO), keep looking.</li>
            <li> I have to apply it several times a day and it&#x27;s winter! Not as amazing as I was hoping.</li>
            <li> This may work for some people, but it didn&#x27;t for me. For whatever reason, this made my underarms smell so much worse than without anything on them after sweating. May make a nice body spray, but doesn&#x27;t cut it for keeping the funk away.</li>
            <li> I was beyond thrilled when I found a rose-scented deodorant.  I LOVE the scent of rose, and love using rose-scented products, like bubble baths, lotions, etc.  It was an absolute dream to find that scent in a deodorant -- how perfect was that?!  Well, when I was at our local Whole Foods Market recently, and saw a sample/tester available of this product, I tried it, and oh my gosh, did I smell like rose for a while!  And unfortunately, I&#x27;m sorry to say that I don&#x27;t mean in a good way.  It is a lovely rose scent, but it was too strong for me, very perfume-y, and I don&#x27;t know about anyone else, but I want my deodorant to smell subtle, and my scented body lotion to be what people smell (but that too to a not-so-strong degree).  I guess if I or someone wanted to take the extra time and make the extra effort, you could maybe find a separate, empty spray bottle, and put only SOME of this rose deodorant in there and then distilled water(?) with it to dilute the fragrance, but then I&#x27;d have to wonder if the deodorant would work as well.  I don&#x27;t know.  I SO wanted to love this product, and again, it&#x27;s definitely a rose scent (not something weirdly rose like some \\&quot;rose\\&quot;-scented products), but it&#x27;s just too strong and perfume-y for my taste.  I&#x27;d suggest finding it, as I did, as a tester in a store, to see if you personally like it, because each person is different and will like different scents/strength of scents -- and you might love this!</li>
            <li> Smells nice but did very little to mask my body odor.</li>
            <li> Love the product line but this deodorant smells a like a French Granny and doesn&#x27;t work.... I smell bad by lunch time.</li>
            <li> who doesn&#x27;t want to smell a little rosier? stop and smell my armpit, yo. you think your s don&#x27;t stink? well my pits certainly don&#x27;t. HOW YOU LIKE ME NOW?</li>
            <li> I think this deodorant smells great.  For me I have to refresh it a couple times a day.  It doesn&#x27;t sting after shaving.  Price is on par with Sprouts store where I bought my first bottle.  I subscribe to it here now.</li>
            <li> This pleasant-smelling Weleda Wild Rose deodorant is very effective for me, a 100 lb salsa dancing vegan living in a tropical climate.</li>
            <li> A natural deodorant that actually works!  Seriously, I&#x27;ve tried them all in my quest to avoid aluminum and this product is the ONLY one I have ever tried that is actually effective.  My only complaint is that bees are attracted to the floral scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years now. I stopped using ant-perspirants when I found out about the aluminum contant and it&#x27;s negative effect on women. Particularly the cancer factor.&lt;br /&gt;The light fresh sent has kept me coming back year after year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every natural aluminum free deodorant out there - nothing works for me except this one.  If it&#x27;s really hot (or I&#x27;m super stressed - it happens), I need to reapply or supplement with baking soda, but generally it&#x27;s pretty effective.</li>
            <li> This deodorant keeps me feeling fresh all day.  It is NOT an antiperspirant, therefore it will not keep you from sweating.  What it WILL do, is kill the bacteria on your skin that thrive off the sweat, creating body odor.  This has a pleasant, not overpowering smell.  Since using this I have watched the dark skin under my arms return to a normal color.  I have also suffered from severe acne and cysts under my arms, and those have also disappeared since I left behind my traditional antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this after reading a number of good reviews on here. The other reviewers must have low expectations. Seriously. This does not stop odor. It is just a really strong smelling body spray. Even after discovering that it didn&#x27;t work I might have used it as a body spray except for the fact that it smells like a 90 year old lady&#x27;s perfume. Very strong floral/baby powderish smell. It gave me a headache. I suggest avalon organics grapefruit and geranium spray if you are looking for something effective (you may have to reapply it once or twice if it is warm weather or if you are a heavy sweater but at least it does work). That is what I will be going back to. I tried this because I just wanted to try something different and there were glowing reviews. Big old waste of money :(</li>
            <li> this product definitely doesn&#x27;t smell like roses but it works and it does spray on nicely. The sample lotion that came with it smelled right though. I just disguise the scent by masking it with perfume.</li>
            <li> The deodorant smells fantastic and works well. I apply in the morning and re-apply in the middle of the day, using baby powder to absorb sweat. I&#x27;ve tried other natural versions but this is only one that works. I&#x27;m really happy to have something that keeps me smelling great and doesn&#x27;t have aluminum in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few natural deodorants looking for the one that works best for me. This one didn&#x27;t work as well as the regular deodorants that are full of  gross chemicals, but it did work better than some of the other natural deodorants I tried. I thought the spray bottle would be handy, but unfortunately that wasn&#x27;t the case. The alcohol stung my skin if I applied the deodorant after shaving. Another complaint, albeit a minor one, is that I also found the spray bottle was less user-friendly in the locker room at the gym. I had to be contentious to not spray any women standing nearby. I also wasn&#x27;t thrilled with any of the scent options for the Weleda deodorant. I ended up ordering wild rose. It was okay, but had an \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; vibe.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have been buying it for over 2 years now, and it lasts most of the day. I mostly love it for the scent - it&#x27;s like a perfume! I don&#x27;t wear most perfumes because they give me headaches (probably from the synthetic ingredients), so this kills 2 birds with one stone. If you are looking for something that will cover up smelly armpits, go for this. If you are an extremely active person like me, you may want to reapply after a super sweaty exercise session.</li>
            <li> Does not work very well to eliminate odor.</li>
            <li> Works I carry a small one with me on hot days to reapply.</li>
            <li> This has worked really well for me.  Since having breast cancer I wanted to be careful about what I was using for deodorant.  No I have really smelly armpit odor and this product has kept it under control  I use about 3 pumps per side and rub it into the underarm area.  I feel good about recommending this product!</li>
            <li> I purchased the white rose fragrances. I have finally found an all natural deodorant that WORKS and LAST LONG!! I will definitely buy this product  again.The scent is just heavenly. I sniff my underarm often because of the great scent.lol</li>
            <li> This product will not replace your standard anti-perspirant but its not a bad natural option if you don&#x27;t sweat much and its not hot outside and you are willing to reapply it throughout the day.  I put this on in the heat of Southern CA and I started to stink within 2 hours. In addition, the wild rose scent reminds me of a grandma.  I only use this deodorant as a refresher before going to the gym.</li>
            <li> The rose smell is STRONG, but only when it first goes on. My first thought when I sprayed it was, &amp;#34;Hello, Grandma&#x27;s house,&amp;#34; although not in a negative way. But I can&#x27;t detect any rose smell on myself after a few minutes, so whatever it smells like when I spray it doesn&#x27;t ultimately matter. It also works, which certainly wasn&#x27;t true with other products, natural or artificial. Hope the Weleda deodorant works as well in summer as in winter. I will likely try a different scent next time.</li>
            <li> Words cannot describe how disgusting this stuff is!!!  I ended up throwing it in the trash.  At first I thought although I would never put it on my body, I could use it for an air freshener.  It was too disgusting for even that!!  Don&#x27;t even think about it!!!</li>
            <li> In my ongoing search for a women&#x27;s deodorant (NOT antiperspirant), I decided to give this Euro spray a try.  While it&#x27;s ok for the first 4-5 hours of the day, if you work for 10-12 hours like I do, the positive effects of the spray have COMPLETELY worn off before the end of the day.  I don&#x27;t want to carry this stuff around and reapply-- especially because it&#x27;s quite wet and awkward to apply with clothes still on.  I will not buy it again!  If only someone would make a women&#x27;s flavored Speed Stick, or some equivalent.  Alas, the search continues.</li>
            <li> This deoderant smells so uplifting and refreshing. I feel like for once a deoderant to raise my vibes!! I usually do not like using deoderant but i really enjoy this one. it makes me feel a little fancy too. :)</li>
            <li> Love this spray. Pair it with a little talc powder and you&#x27;ll be dry all day.  Rose smell is a bit string in application but calms quickly</li>
            <li> Smells like a funky rose and i did not help with underarm odor. Wears off too quickly. Will not buy again</li>
            <li> Alcohol kills bacteria and i think it&#x27;s the right amount, not too much to burn and enough to be effective for a few hours, i am a stinky male</li>
            <li> Bought this product based on two different reports that it was a good option for deodorant without the harmful chemicals found in anti-perspirant. It has a VERY strong smell, and to me is similar to mosquito repellant. Not a pleasant smell and hard to get off. It is not returnable, so buyers beware. I would not purchase this product again. I was happier with Lafes Lavendar spray and Arm and Hammer non-fragrance deodorant stick.</li>
            <li> I first started trying this product about a year ago, and it was amazing. I was having allergic reactions to almost all typical deodorants and I have had recurring swollen lymph nodes for years. The doctors just always said it was a reaction to bacteria and their response was to tell me to stop shaving or do it less frequently, but this stopped my swelling probably because of the alcohol in it. Anyways, I loved it as soon as I tried it. It smelled exactly like a rose picked from the garden. I started on the subscribe and save plan and was getting it regularly. I received my June shipment in 2014 and all of a sudden it just started smelling so weird. I believe this smell is what the other people on here are referring to when they say it smells nothing like roses. The rest of my summer shipments smelled the same and I was really upset that they were not returnable due to the chemicals in it - I couldn&#x27;t even find a way to request a replacement through Amazon. I believe what I experienced is the result of the deodorant getting too hot since all of these shipments arrived extremely warm out of the packaging. I think it chemically changed the deodorant. I stopped my subscribe and save then since apparently no one noticed that the product was being &amp;#34;damaged&amp;#34;. I am afraid to even buy it again online because I tried purchasing it again in the fall and it smelled exactly the same - I am thinking it might be overheating in whatever warehouse it was being stored it. I am hoping to find a local store that sells it in the hopes that I can get back to using the beautiful rose-scented deodorant that this use to be when I tried it a year ago.</li>
            <li> It works well even during a work out at the gym.  The fragrance does not last.</li>
            <li> Best natural deodorant I have found. I tried Tom&#x27;s and some homemade all natural deodorant from Etsy, but nothing worked and I ended up smelling by 2pm. This product was suggested to me from Glitter Guide and I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. I&#x27;m REALLY loving it! It does have a VERY strong scent at first, very perfume-y, but then it wears off. I have told all my friends about it. I think I will try the citrus one when this is gone. Love it!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I did not like the scent. I don&#x27;t know why but it made me nauseous. I can&#x27;t speak for the effectiveness of the product. Future buyers should note that it cannot be returned.</li>
            <li> I have used other Weleda products and deodorant so I expected this one to smell better. I wanted to order the citrus scent but it was not available so I decided to try Wildrose. BAD DECISION! The smell is so offensive that I prefer my BO to it. I can&#x27;t stand it. I tried to return it but it wouldn&#x27;t let me. I hate it. I feel like I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> This deodorant works great, much better than others I&#x27;ve tried. I just didn&#x27;t care for the smell. I love the smell of roses, but this is a bit musty for me. I&#x27;ll try the citrus one next.</li>
            <li> For me, this product did not work very well overall, but was good for now and then use - like after a good workout, etc. just to chase away any un-freshness.  However, I pretty quickly developed a sensitivity to the fragrance or some ingredient and had to stop using it due to a very itchy reaction.  Since we are all different, I can&#x27;t say how it will work for you, but I was kinda happy with it as a Freshen-Upper until I started to itch.</li>
            <li> Very strongly scented, a little much.  I like the other Weleda deodorants better, as the scents are more subtle.  However it works well as a deodorant.</li>
            <li> The best deodorant ever.  I live in the tropics and I want an all natural product.  The alcohol in this kills bacteria and the smell is lovely.  Using it 1-2x a day this last about 6 mos</li>
            <li> This is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever gotten.  Every other product over the counter made my underarms burn &amp; itch.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of my favorite deodorants. All natural. No aluminum. I only wish I could by a gallon refill jug (at a steep discount, of course)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell of this deodorant. All natural, doesn&#x27;t stain my shirt, and believe it or not I&#x27;ve had it on all day and as I&#x27;m preparing for my shower, I did the special sniff test.... guess what... I smell like just the deodorant. No mixture of funky sweat and flowers,  just a light ,feminine ,very confident, sweet smelling armpit! I&#x27;m pregnant and sweat alot too... lol. Anyways if you are natural and want a deoderant that doesnt stain and last all day and night, this is highly recommended by the sweaty pregnant woman... eelk ... but yeah Great stuff:-) ***** from me:-)</li>
            <li> I had tried a deodorant from a health food store and it just didn&#x27;t work, then I gave up for another few years. Wish I had tried this back then. It works as well if not better than Secret.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well, smells nice, just a little pricey for how long it lasts. It burns after shaving too, but it goes away in a few minutes, and I would rather have that then use the crap with all the foreign ingredients!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I love the smell. It really works to control odor (though I am not a very smelly person to begin with, so I am not sure how it works for extreme odor needs). It will not keep you from sweating, but I don&#x27;t mind. I think the body needs to sweat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say this but this deodorant makes me smell like an old lady. It&#x27;s almost worse than if I didn&#x27;t wear any deodorant at all.  I was so disappointed.  I am trying to stop wearing products that can be toxic.  I love roses. But this product just doesn&#x27;t smell right on me. Anyway, perhaps it is just my own chemistry and would be good on others? It smells fine in the bottle so perhaps that is the case.</li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve learned not to assume that a product is safe just because it&#x27;s sold in a health food store. I recently discovered the Skin Deep Database, where you can look up products and ingredients to find out if they contain toxins. I&#x27;d used this deodorant for two years. Even though it only kept me smelling fresh for a few hours, I figured it was better/safer than the drugstore brand I had been using. Wrong! When I looked it up on the Skin Deep Database, I found out that this deodorant rates a 4 on the toxin scale, which is the \\&quot;caution\\&quot; range. I switched to Lafe&#x27;s spray deodorant, which is a 0 on the toxin scale, and it works MUCH better without any toxins. Lafe&#x27;s keeps me and my husband smelling good from morning to bed time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been going out of my mind trying different deodorants as I&#x27;m trying to give up antiperspirants. This is the best I&#x27;ve found so far and I keep coming back to it. I really like the scent, it&#x27;s a nice rose, not too old lady. However, this does not keep you from sweating, none of them do, so you need to reapply throughout the day. I probably reapply 2-3 times in winter and twice that much in summer. I&#x27;m a sweater though, keep that in mind. It&#x27;s not sticky or tacky nor does it smell like hippy. Oh, also, this will not work with bare underarms, ie with dropped long sleeves/dolman cut or tank tops that are low. If your underarms are just bare with no other material, you&#x27;ll be sweating &amp; stinking pretty quick &amp; this will not help that much. I&#x27;ve resigned to just use regular deodorant/antiperspirants on those days. You can&#x27;t win them all.</li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking that I could return it if I didn&#x27;t like it. (Usually Amazon is great about this.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently, this is due to it being a liquid and so it&#x27;s considered hazardous and not returnable. So, either buy this from a local store or be super sure you want it before you purchase.</li>
            <li> This smells so good.  I do use with a crystal stone.</li>
            <li> One of the bottles was broken, glas was all over I almost cut my hand!! Item needs to replaced asap.</li>
            <li> I really love the smell of this deodorant but the lasting power just isn&#x27;t there.  I definitely had to reapply this product numerous times during the day to keep odor at bay.  It&#x27;s just not super convenient to use this spray deodorant multiple times a day.  I would recommend this product for the fragrance but not at all for long lasting odor control.</li>
            <li> Finally found the right deodorant!</li>
            <li> Smells awesome, but it burns horribly when you put it on especially right after shaving. For this reason I will not order it again!</li>
            <li> The rose smell is great but something in this product cause my skin to breakout in a rash.  Could be the base chemical concoction and/or the perfume.</li>
            <li> I am someone who tends to sweat a lot (which means I  can get really stinky). I was a little unsure about this deodorant, mainly because it is a spray. However it works great. I do sometimes have to reapply later in the day (like I said I sweat a lot), but it does work really well on the odor. The scent in my opinion isn&#x27;t too great, but it fades once it dries.</li>
            <li> it just didn&#x27;t work for my wife. when i first attempted to return it, i was disappointed to see that it was categorized as hazardous and therefore un-returnable. thankfully, after an easy call to Amazon, they were able to refund the purchase price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything and this is the only natural deodorant that works for my family.  I love all three scents.</li>
            <li> I bought this deodorant a year ago and I was not satisfied because I continually had to apply it. Twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;Now I realize that my body got used to it and I the a full day of protection.&lt;br /&gt;I love this deodorant and I won&#x27;t give up on it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS DEODERANT AND WILL CONTINUE TO BUY IT ALSO LOVE THE SAGE FRAGRANCE.  WILL TRY THE PURSE SIZE.</li>
            <li> The scent of this deodorant is amazingly wonderful as I love the scent of wild roses but after 3 hours there is a strong perspiration odor so you have to wash up and reapply.  Sometimes you are not in a position to wash up.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Smells nice when you spray it on, but does NOT control odor throughout the day.</li>
            <li> This deodorant works like a charm during cooler months. It smells good and is not poisonous. However, during hot summer months you will have to reapply a couple of times.</li>
            <li> Rose fragrance is a bit too strong and sweet for my tastes. I prefer their citrus fragrance.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a mor natural option and this product works great</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work well for me as deodorant but has good smell.</li>
            <li> this burns my armpits and is a little too sweet smelling. Please re-formulate.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I sweat a lot, especially after having a baby. This definitely cuts down on my sweaty smell and I really think it helps me sweat less. The rose scent is pretty strong at first and I think it is really good but I do think it smells a little mature for me (I&#x27;m 31) but it mellows out pretty quick.Performance wise, I think it&#x27;s perfect and it works way better than any other natural deodorant that I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;I am definitely going to buy again but will probably try a different scent just to try them out.</li>
            <li> The only deodorant my wife will use.  She swears by this stuff, but we could only ever find it at expensive &amp;#34;natural food stores&amp;#34; that over charge you for everything.  I love that we can now get it on Amazon for a fraction of the price AND it&#x27;s Prime!  Smell nice.  A bit alcohol-y when it first goes on, but then the rose smell takes over.  Spray this on your pits and feel good about yourself.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as I am looking for a more natural deodorant. This product didn&#x27;t work for me. It might be okay as a body spray..but not as a deodorant. I had my hubby asking me why I smell like rubbing alcohol (not good). It also burns pretty bad if you apply it after shaving.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase a spray deodorant. I&#x27;ve tried several nontoxic varieties of deodorant and was struggling to find one with a pleasant scent that worked well and didn&#x27;t cost a fortune. I&#x27;m done looking; this is by far the most effective deodorant I&#x27;ve tried. Be aware that this product is reminiscent of perfume and has a mild floral scent. It could clash with another perfume/cologne or may be too floral for some people. I&#x27;m not typically fond of floral scents but although this one is initially strong it tempers quickly and remains mild throughout the day. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I typically use the chemical deodorant and have been looking to make the switch to natural. Regular deodorant (not clinical strength) works just great for me, and I don&#x27;t actually sweat much so I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m a \\&quot;hard case\\&quot; in the deodorant department. Anyway, I&#x27;ve tried this deodorant for a few days and it lasts about 4 hours before the underarm smell begins to break through. Once that happens, reapplication doesn&#x27;t really help. Since I am looking for an all-day natural deodorant, I am forced to say that this deodorant is a failure.</li>
            <li> I sweat and it doesn&#x27;t smell very nice either (hope when I get older this will change). Weleda is the only deodorant that halfway saves me. Sounds negative, but any other deodorant I would use gives up after a couple of hours. This one keeps me fresh for a whole working day, and it has none of the unhealthy ingredients that many other products have. The usage of aluminum in Europe is not allowed, which should tell us something about the danger it provides for our bodies. I like the rose sent as well. My choice when it comes to deodorants ;)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind the smell but even though I am a light sweater, the scent is quickly overridden by BO.  I was really looking for a natural product to replace my antiperspirant addiction, but even though I knew to expect sweat, this didn&#x27;t keep up with the smell.  I did keep it for a gym bag stash in case I needed freshening up during the day as I went back to using my Dove Wild Rose scented antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> The deodorant works well, even after many hours of sweaty activity, and provides a pleasing scent that isn&#x27;t too overpowering. However, know that the unnecessary thick glass bottle that the deodorant comes in is extremely prone to breakage. I am not a clumsy person (meaning I have not broken or dropped any other beauty products in my memory), but at a slight wobble, the Weleda bottle once crashed to the floor and into many sharp, difficult-to-see shards; when I reordered to replace the lost deodorant, the bottle fell through the bottom of the pink box and smashed on the ground again. I will order one more time and possibly transfer the contents of the bottle into a cheap plastic container as soon as possible, but I am altogether not impressed with the company&#x27;s illogical packaging decision.</li>
            <li> I think this must have a very high alcohol content. It stings until it dries. The smell isn&#x27;t lovely, as I had expected, but it fades a bit when dry. Was expecting better judging from the great reviews.</li>
            <li> I have used every natural deodorant from here to the Mississippi and Weleda Wildrose is the only one that really works! It keep the armpit stink at bay without any of the scary cancer causing ingredients in most deodorants. The deodarant comes in a beautiful glass bottle, sprays the perfect amount, smells great and best of all it is safe and it actually works! Hands down this is a must if you are trying to use natural beauty products.</li>
            <li> I was super reluctant to buy this because I sweat. Not the polite girl sweat &amp;#34;glisten&amp;#34;, I mean I get sweat stains that look like the outline of Italy under my arms. Before this I was using clinical strength secret (not a secret, that&#x27;s its name) and was very hesitant to buy something that was only a deodorant - BUT IT WORKS. Shocked. It&#x27;s great. I can even wear it to the gym and not smell like a foot afterwards!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BONUS: the armpits of my white t-shirts no longer yellow because they don&#x27;t have whatever chemical was in the antiperspirant to interact with.</li>
            <li> love the smell and effectiveness of this fine product, have been using for some years now - a zippy winner!</li>
            <li> I really love the scent of this deodorant. It doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as some other natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried, but it comes close.</li>
            <li> I developed a horrible allergic reaction to this product.  This really was unexpected too.  The product smells nice but did not work out for me. Amazon handled this situation with excellent professional courtesy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Tom&#x27;s of Maine, crystals, et cetera. This finally makes me feel comfortable in my hippy self. I don&#x27;t want any aluminum, thanks, and don&#x27;t want something that is against my perspiration. I&#x27;m happy to sweat, thanks; I&#x27;m a mammal. I just don&#x27;t want to stink. This finally made me feel ok in my lifestyle choices.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to use a light deodorant that smells good, has a slightly astringent quality, and does not coat one&#x27;s underarms with a waxy build-up that transfers (and can discolor) some white and lightly colored clothing.  It even feels great after shaving one&#x27;s underarms!</li>
            <li> I work and exercise...this smelled nice. but didn&#x27;t last an hour...</li>
            <li> Ilike the product but I do not like the spray.  Could this be made into a roll on??</li>
            <li> I love the Weleda deodorants, they are the best I can find out without aluminum (I&#x27;ve tried about 20 brands). However this scent is a little stronger than the sage and smells a little too much like my grandmother. It would be a bit better with jasmine or something to off set it.</li>
            <li> I have used this deodorant for years and I love it. The rose scent is more like a gorgeous perfume. If I sweat a lot, I do have to reapply, but I like the scent so much that it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. It comes in a very nice glass bottle with a sprayer that never breaks. The bottle last me 6 months or so.</li>
            <li> Rather annoyed this is marketed as a natural deodorant however contains parfum which means I am allergic. Since it is marked as hazardous no way to return for refund.</li>
            <li> Best healthy deoderant I&#x27;ve ever found!</li>
            <li> I do not dislike the rose scent but find it to be a little bit too present, and it stays with you -- does not dissipate.  A little too much scent for me, personally.</li>
            <li> I love it. Have been using it for years. I was looking for a non stick, safe, yet effective deodorant.  I found it in Weleda! Does not leave residue on shirts, and lasts for the whole day. Tested in extreme situations, such as job interviews!!! Subtle fragrance. Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I was trying to go all natural, but for someone like me who sweat with the blink of an eye, I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this product again. It works but not on days that are very active, you will offend, trust me.</li>
            <li> This smells nothing like roses :( I wish I had tried this on at a store before purchasing it. The smell is too much for me. The citrus Weleda Deodorant is my fav.</li>
            <li> I am not sure about the other varieties, but I do not like how Wild Rose smells, it does have a sort of baby powder/alchohol smell to it  However, it does seem to work.  I think I will try another scent.</li>
            <li> I had higher hopes for this.  Maybe I&#x27;m just too heavy of a sweater, but I couldn&#x27;t use this on a daily basis.  I found that I started to stink 1/2 way through the day.  I think it just doesn&#x27;t work with my body chemistry.  Not that it doesn&#x27;t.  It did help, just not long term.  I&#x27;d have to carry it with me to make sure I was OK by the end of the day.  It does smell pretty though and will probably use it as a body spray in the summer.</li>
            <li> this is good deodorant.  I have used the citrus in the past and think I like the citrus scent better.  This is a very strong rose smell, which I should have known from the name. Also, the citrus scent has a cooling affect when applied that this one does not.</li>
            <li> I have spent a fortune trying to find a natural deodorant that actually works on me, a girl who doesn&#x27;t smell much. This is the first and only one that has left me not avoiding my own pits by the end of the day.  I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the rose smell (hope they develop a lavender or something else soon) but it is so great at being what it is, I will take it!</li>
            <li> Use this all the time. Not a fan of the other scents.</li>
            <li> This actually works! I&#x27;m so surprised honestly. After trying so many natural deodorants that don&#x27;t work at all this was a great discovery. It may not be the most potent deodorant, but it kept me fresh for a long day of 4th of July picnics! I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> Smells great and keeps odor away.</li>
            <li> Best deodorant on the planet~*!*!*!.&lt;br /&gt;Exotic, pretty scent~*, just deliciously decadent~*. It&#x27;s my favorite~*, I&#x27;ve tried tons of aluminum free deodorants- this is the best scent, presentation, &amp; it works perfectly ~*! Love it*~*!*!*!</li>
            <li> I have used sprays and roll on&#x27;s for a long time but this deodorant is the BEST. It lasts long and isn&#x27;t an incredibly strong smell.</li>
            <li> I very much wanted to like this, but its application is a bit impractical.  When you spray it on your underarms, some of it will miss and linger in the air (smells rather chemical) which you then get to breath in.  Also, your clothes will smell like it (it&#x27;s not a horrible smell, just kind of...grandmotherly).  And conflicts with any other scent you might want to wear.  The bigger issue, in my case is that it didn&#x27;t really work that well.  I&#x27;ve used a variety of natural deodorants for years so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s because I haven&#x27;t given it a chance.  It just doesn&#x27;t seem very effective.</li>
            <li> Love this product it works</li>
            <li> I love it and absolutely works for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many natural deodorant before and was disappointed. I want to reduce the use of aluminum and other chemicals so I &#x27;ve been doing a lot of research to find a natural deodorant that works. I read some great reviews about Weleda Wildrose and I purchased. I love it! no B/O all day. I can smell the essential oils. I will be buying it again. I also purchased jungleman but I haven&#x27;t tried it yet. So once I do I will compare the two.</li>
            <li> This product does not work.I don&#x27;t think it is worth the price,save your money don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several months now, and totally love it. I switched to natural deodorants and have tried magnesium oil (cannot use after shaving) and a couple of Lush brand deodorants (somewhat effective, but not that convenient), but this is effective, and the rose scent is really nice, but does not interfere with other scents in lotions or perfumes. A bottle lasts a LONG time, and I use it after my evening shower and also in the morning before work.&lt;br /&gt;I see they make it in Sage, and will try that next. Highly recommend if you are looking for a natural, aluminum free deodorant. It is not an antiperspirant, but then, you may no longer need and antiperspirant anyway, just a stink preventer.</li>
            <li> i have tried ALL of the natural, chemical free, etc., etc., etc. this brand is the best i have tried. at the end of the day, i still smell delicious. this one just happens to be perfect for my body chemistry and i completely trust this company!</li>
            <li> I just recently decided to go natural with my beauty product when I came across this gem. It&#x27;s amazing, works so much better than regular deodorant from the drugstore that is awful for you. Has good ingredient so you can have a piece of mind about what you&#x27;re putting in your body.  You know when other deodorants advertise that there is no dry time, when we all know that not true, but this really does dry fast and you don&#x27;t have to worry about stains YEAH! I was skeptical that it would work for me, but I was proven wrong. I won&#x27;t buy anything else from now on.&lt;br /&gt;And a giant plus is that amazon has it $15 cheaper than Target.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant!</li>
            <li> An excellent all-natural deodorant, light rose scent. Excellent value.</li>
            <li> Does not work! No way no how. Try primal paste!</li>
            <li> Very effective deodorant! I first purchased the Weleda Citrus spray and it&#x27;s awesomeness prompted my to try out this one.  The fragrance begins very strong but very pleasant and genuinely rose-y, not artificial rose.  The fragrance strength eventually fades but the efficacy does not.  I could see this possibly clashing with perfume, especially if you prefer a robust fragrance. However, I have found this layers quite nicely with my other scents and as I mentioned before, this spray settles down to a nice subtle powdery rose only detectable if you get your face all up in your arm pit.  One thing I like about the rose versus the citrus is that it doesn&#x27;t sting my skin at all after I shave.  I think the citrus extracts in the other version caused a slight sting although it was NOT nearly bad enough to deter me from using (and loving!) this brand.  Finally, a responsible and effective natural deodorant!</li>
            <li> I love Weleda products and really wanted to love this, but I just can&#x27;t.  The smell is good...but it doesn&#x27;t work as a deodorant for me.  I never thought I was particularly smelly and I don&#x27;t sweat excessively under my arms or anything (actually probably less underarm than normal people), but when using this deodorant, my pits were not pleasant.  I dunno if it was just my body chemistry or what, but I could smell myself...something that I&#x27;ve never experienced before actually.  If I don&#x27;t wear deo at all, maybe at the end of the day there will be some slight odor, but I have to search for it.  With this deo, I could smell myself when I was just sitting in a chair.  :(  I really wish it worked for me, but this was my last try with a natural deo.  I&#x27;ve had to go back to my regular old chemical laced one.  Boo.  I hope this works for you!</li>
            <li> This stuff did not work for me :( I&#x27;ve tried so many natural deodorants now that I&#x27;m about to give up &amp; go back to the old Degree stuff I used to wear. Wish they could make one that would work for people who have stronger BO.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell as nice as it would sound. I mainly use it as a body spray. The sent of the parfum doesn&#x27;t last past 1-2hrs. Its best right out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Smells mildly rose, the mild scent lingers somewhat, seems to be reasonably effective though not as much so as the natural mineral stone.  I spray 2 or 3 pumps, pat it in, then spray 2 more pumps.  Otherwise it doesn&#x27;t seem to be too effective.  I only rated it 3 stars because it is expensive for as fast as it gets used up. Besides, there are some chemical ingredients.</li>
            <li> Nice smelling. Remember it won&#x27;t stop you from sweating but will help you from stinking. It will sting if sprayed immediately after shaving. It&#x27;s one of the best non-antiperspirant sprays I have found. I have not been disappointed in any Weleda product thus far. I would love to try one of the other scents as well.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant!  I might have to see if they have a wild rose perfume too. It&#x27;s a nice scent, not powdery or old ladyish like some rose things can be.  I spray it on in the morning, probably too much because I like the smell so much.  Through out the day if I&#x27;m running around or get hot I might get a hint of rose but never body odor.  I will purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;Update 8/8/17&lt;br /&gt;I lost my head and left Weleda Wild Rose for awhile, I cheaped out and bought some arm n hammer natural 2 pack at CVS.  I proceeded to smell and sweat like a football player after practice.  I ended up throwing out both bars and coming back to Weleda, now i smell like roses again and don&#x27;t have any sweat stains after a walk.  I will never leave again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this a few times and I&#x27;m still not sure if I like it.  Most important thing to remind folks is that it&#x27;s a very strong rose smell.  Now I don&#x27;t usually buy a lot of items with strong perfume, so it may not smell as strong with other people.  But the first spray was definitely a tad overpowering.  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad.  It&#x27;s just strong.  As far as its effectiveness, I&#x27;ve worn it to work and the only thing that bothered me is that I could still smell the strong rosy odor even after a few hours.  I don&#x27;t like that.  I wish it was a bit more subtle.  That&#x27;s the reason why I haven&#x27;t tried this while going to the gym.  I&#x27;m a little hesitant because I&#x27;m afraid that the rosy odor would bother me (and other people).  So I give it 4 stars, because I&#x27;m a fan of Weleda, but take one star away because of the overpowering odor.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, but for an active person like myself it just didn&#x27;t cut it.  I had BO by the end of every day I used it, and it is a little sticky as well.  Definitely not worth the price!</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t sweat very much, don&#x27;t mind smelling flowery and are able to reapply through out the day this product will work fine. Unfortunately I sweat, work strenuous 12 hours shifts and am unable to reapply at work. I smell horrible by the end of the day. I found another natural wax based alternative that has meet my needs.</li>
            <li> I always used Secret deodorant and it works great, but obviously, it&#x27;s unhealthy to use anti-antiperspirants. This deodorant smells really good and does the job. You may have to reapply it once throughout the day if you sweat a lot, but I usually don&#x27;t have to. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that it stings pretty bad after shaving, but wouldn&#x27;t any alcohol sting on a fresh shaven pit? Other than that, I absolutely love it.</li>
