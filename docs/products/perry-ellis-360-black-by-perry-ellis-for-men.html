            <li>Good price, good product</li>
            <li>and I get a lot of comments about how good I smell.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell good at all</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great smell on any man, and the bottle is nice to look at as well.</li>
            <li>BUT NOT AS GOOD</li>
            <li>A patient checked in and he smelled so good</li>
            <li>Great juice I do love this scent.</li>
            <li>Best buy, the order arrived within the agreed time, the perfume is designed for elderly gentlemen because its scent is very classic.</li>
            <li>This juice will trick people into thinking you&#x27;re a lawyer or some kind of CEO.  </li>
            <li>The cologne itself is a nice manly scent that I prefer to use evenings going out and the scent is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>For the price, nice fragrance.  </li>
            <li>, i use it every day and people liked my smell</li>
            <li>Love the scent, not to strong, just perfect and it does not wear off to quickly.</li>
            <li>, very good quality is much charm</li>
            <li>Was Perry Ellis 360 Black - made a great gift and now my husband smells wonderful too!</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t feel it is fair to compare them to the original 360.  </li>
            <li>It arrived quickly, as scheduled and in good condition.</li>
            <li>This is my husband&#x27;s favorite scent and he said alot of people comment on it.</li>
            <li>He is picky about his colognes so it&#x27;s not always safe to buy it for him, but I knew there was no way he wouldn&#x27;t love this scent.</li>
            <li>I have to many colognes (5), and this one is one of my favorites...</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I love Perry Ellis ( I have 3 of them</li>
            <li>Smells okay.</li>
            <li>Makes my husband smell soooo sexy.</li>
            <li>THE PERFUME IS OKAY</li>
            <li>Smells awesome and last all day!</li>

            <li>love the smell.</li>
            <li>What you get is 360 sexy</li>
            <li>Ok here we go.</li>
            <li>, picture shows Perry Ellis 360 Sexy</li>
            <li>I get many compliments from wearing this.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it smells on him.</li>
            <li>looking for more of a manly scent..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s elegant but and the same time kind of attractive...</li>
            <li>This product can put a spell on women if you&#x27;re a smooth talker so use it wisely ;)</li>
            <li>This smells great ,wow</li>
            <li>Well, I have to admit, it does smell quite good, and lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li>Smells great (kind of a cross between soap and musk), cheap price, lasts all day</li>
            <li>smelled good  fast shipping</li>
            <li>It works very well, surprising as it seems.</li>
            <li>I love the original Perry Ellis 360 Degrees.</li>
            <li>The original 360 is also better.</li>
            <li>the scent starts off with a strong bite...</li>
            <li>maybe women would like it&#x27;s fragrance, but for me, it just seems - for lack of a better phrase - too almost powdery sweet.</li>
            <li>The bottle is huge, it applies very well, and comes in a nice case.</li>
            <li>Nice, big bottle lasts awhile and it smells so amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ah, welcome back Perry Ellis 360 Degrees!</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>i see now what I have been missing, i am very happy with my purchase, thank you</li>
            <li>It has a smooth velvety aroma, with just the slightest touches of vanilla &amp; spice.</li>
            <li>Nice price / fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>even though this is for older men, it smells really nice</li>
            <li>EXELENTE PRODUCTO Y ORIGINAL, ENTREGADO EN EL TIEMPO CONVENIDO</li>
            <li>I got the original 360 Degrees instead (not the 360 Degrees</li>
            <li>in all, the product is either tampered or diluted, in any case, is not the original smell, therefor, a</li>
            <li>and it is original at the mall stores</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know what to expect, I just took advantage of the super shipping offered by Amazon and the suuper cheap price for a 3oz bottle...</li>
            <li>The product is original and is in good conditions for its use personal.</li>
            <li>Not for a special ocassion or special date.</li>
            <li>But it is good for daily use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, but I prefer the 360 simple.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell good per several woman.  </li>
            <li>Got it as a gift for a friend, they loved, would differently by again</li>
            <li>But, it&#x27;s just too sweet for me.</li>
            <li>and it is pretty strong.</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love the Black.</li>
            <li>It was shipped quickly but the cologne didnt smell like its supposed</li>
            <li>everybody couldnt possibly be telling the same lie ladies, this cologne is awesome, it&#x27;s definately a panty dropper!</li>
            <li>Got the Original Perry Ellis 360 as a present, which i liked ...</li>
            <li>The bottle was larger than expected, and the scent was a perfect fit for my hubby.  </li>
            <li>I love Amazon, but I think I will stick with going to the mall for trying new fragrances.</li>
            <li>With all the great reviews that the 360 Black had, wife could not stand it.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Great, that I was expected!!!</li>
            <li>Elegant and professional.</li>
            <li>Perry Ellis is never a disappointment.</li>
            <li>Try the Perry Ellis Portfolio, it is far better.</li>
            <li>Has a nice masculine scent, but with a touch of modern day fresh powder to it.</li>
            <li>I guess he liked, I never got a feed back from him.</li>
            <li>I bought this cologne for my husband for Christmas and it is definitely my favorite men&#x27;s cologne by far.</li>
            <li>Not a romantic scent ...but a comforting warm perfume...</li>
            <li>It is not as good as the other Perry Ellis perfumes I have bought.</li>
            <li>Having loved Perry Ellis Red, I had high hope for the &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; version.  </li>
            <li>Enamora fragrance&lt;br /&gt;Perry is a captivating scent that France alone, each time I use it gives the feeling of excellence to attract attention by the sweet scent that combines the delight of the perfume with the image of a current</li>
            <li>Worth every penny, he is absolutely irresistible when he wears this!</li>
            <li>It is a good choice to wear because you won&#x27;t smell like every other guy!</li>
            <li>the product was for a birthday gift and the person who was present was very happy because I wanted for a few days</li>
            <li>Much to my surprise, considering I love the original, this version is leagues above the first.  </li>
            <li>drys down very fast to a warm creamy touch of sweet and spice...</li>
            <li>It had no packaging (like plastic or something) to ensure the product is new or original.</li>
            <li>The first time I smelled this cologne was on a stranger...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Besides, it gets her all hot and bothered, so I see no downside.</li>
            <li>Many comments on what it is I&#x27;m wearing from female co-workers.  </li>
            <li>Perry Ellis white smells way better.</li>
            <li>When my fiance and I first met he used to wear this</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know when I bought it that I would not be able to send it back.</li>
            <li>Red allot better product.</li>
            <li>While it projects well at first, it doesn&#x27;t last more than a couple hours.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always chosen to buy perfumes amazom directly as I receive 100% original.</li>
            <li>I own other Perry Ellis  colognes and they did not dissapointed on this one either.</li>
            <li>perfume has a scent is sweet soft and durable, like women very much recommend it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would say that 360 Red and Perry Reserve are daytime/warmer weather colognes or for those who just want to smell fresh with a light scent.  </li>
            <li>I would not have purchased it if I knew because I wasn&#x27;t positive</li>
            <li>The smell is good but it does not last very long.</li>
            <li>This has a very manly smell.</li>
            <li>Really like the price and scent to this cologne.  </li>
            <li>I saw it on here so much cheaper</li>
            <li>You can really smell the spice and amber in this, and the hint of tobacco leaf blends</li>
            <li>Very delivery.</li>
            <li>But the case has been damaged at the top, and the part where it hold the spray (the metalic part) is very loose.</li>
            <li>thanks a lot</li>
            <li>really will recomend to my friends and paratentals the product and seller.</li>
            <li>The red one is far better...</li>
            <li>But over all, especially for summer would prefer something more masculine.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll buy more for other gifts.</li>
            <li>For the price a nice perfume not sure If I would rebuy it though...</li>
            <li>Decent cologne ...</li>
            <li>So I will only buy at a local store for cologne unless you know what you want for sure then order thru Amazon.</li>
            <li>I do highly recommend it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly reccommend this product.</li>
            <li>The scent is very strong, and it smells like something a 40 year old would wear (definitely not something for a 19 year old male ).</li>
            <li>it live up to her hype?</li>
            <li>I WAS JUST TRYING SOMETHING NEW</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my boyfriend and although it smells really good, it doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as some of his other colognes.</li>
            <li>Perry Ellis colognes last a very long time, easily 10 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I never have smelled the 360 Black before, to confirm or deny that the product is original.</li>
            <li>So naturally, I&#x27;d get another Perry Ellis...</li>
            <li>My wife picked this out for me because she likes the Perry Ellis white so much.</li>
            <li>It goes away way too early from &amp;#34;Eau De Toilette&amp;#34; point of view as well.</li>
            <li>This smells like something a 35 year old bachelor would wear, or your 40 something teacher/</li>
            <li>all the Perry Ellis colognes has made in the past 15 years and this new reformulated cologne is my all time favorite not only of his line, but of all colognes I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>The scent lasts all day long, and it is so distinct and DELICIOUS, but also subtle and not too over-the-top.</li>
            <li>The product seems to be not original since the actual scent of it fades away very quickly once it&#x27;s on the user&#x27;s body.</li>
            <li>I do not regret this purchase was exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>This one&#x27;s a little mild.</li>
            <li>Actually I had never smelled this cologne before, I wanted to suprise my hubby with something new.  </li>
            <li>BUT I WILL STAY WITH MY OLD ONE RED</li>
            <li>If you like 360 White (a JPG La Male clone) you will love 360 Black because they are similar, but black has an extra tea spice note to it which makes it slightly more masculine and complex.  </li>
            <li>The problem is, that I ordered the 360 black, but its not the right smell, if you compare it to one you buy in a mall or a specific place for perfumes, you can diferentiate the smells.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>I heard Perry Ellis black smell better than the previous Perry Ellis in the grey container.</li>
            <li>sweet and a little dark yet seductive.</li>

            <li> Ok here we go.</li>
            <li> , picture shows Perry Ellis 360 Sexy</li>
            <li> I get many compliments from wearing this.  </li>
            <li> I love the way it smells on him.</li>
            <li> looking for more of a manly scent..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s elegant but and the same time kind of attractive...</li>
            <li> This product can put a spell on women if you&#x27;re a smooth talker so use it wisely ;)</li>
            <li> This smells great ,wow</li>
            <li> Well, I have to admit, it does smell quite good, and lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li> Smells great (kind of a cross between soap and musk), cheap price, lasts all day</li>
            <li> smelled good  fast shipping</li>
            <li> It works very well, surprising as it seems.</li>
            <li> I love the original Perry Ellis 360 Degrees.</li>
            <li> The original 360 is also better.</li>
            <li> the scent starts off with a strong bite...</li>
            <li> maybe women would like it&#x27;s fragrance, but for me, it just seems - for lack of a better phrase - too almost powdery sweet.</li>
            <li> The bottle is huge, it applies very well, and comes in a nice case.</li>
            <li> Nice, big bottle lasts awhile and it smells so amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ah, welcome back Perry Ellis 360 Degrees!</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> i see now what I have been missing, i am very happy with my purchase, thank you</li>
            <li> It has a smooth velvety aroma, with just the slightest touches of vanilla &amp; spice.</li>
            <li> Nice price / fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> even though this is for older men, it smells really nice</li>
            <li> EXELENTE PRODUCTO Y ORIGINAL, ENTREGADO EN EL TIEMPO CONVENIDO</li>
            <li> I got the original 360 Degrees instead (not the 360 Degrees</li>
            <li> in all, the product is either tampered or diluted, in any case, is not the original smell, therefor, a</li>
            <li> and it is original at the mall stores</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect, I just took advantage of the super shipping offered by Amazon and the suuper cheap price for a 3oz bottle...</li>
            <li> The product is original and is in good conditions for its use personal.</li>
            <li> Not for a special ocassion or special date.</li>
            <li> But it is good for daily use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, but I prefer the 360 simple.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell good per several woman.  </li>
            <li> Got it as a gift for a friend, they loved, would differently by again</li>
            <li> But, it&#x27;s just too sweet for me.</li>
            <li> and it is pretty strong.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love the Black.</li>
            <li> It was shipped quickly but the cologne didnt smell like its supposed</li>
            <li> everybody couldnt possibly be telling the same lie ladies, this cologne is awesome, it&#x27;s definately a panty dropper!</li>
            <li> Got the Original Perry Ellis 360 as a present, which i liked ...</li>
            <li> The bottle was larger than expected, and the scent was a perfect fit for my hubby.  </li>
            <li> I love Amazon, but I think I will stick with going to the mall for trying new fragrances.</li>
            <li> With all the great reviews that the 360 Black had, wife could not stand it.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Great, that I was expected!!!</li>
            <li> Elegant and professional.</li>
            <li> Perry Ellis is never a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Try the Perry Ellis Portfolio, it is far better.</li>
            <li> Has a nice masculine scent, but with a touch of modern day fresh powder to it.</li>
            <li> I guess he liked, I never got a feed back from him.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne for my husband for Christmas and it is definitely my favorite men&#x27;s cologne by far.</li>
            <li> Not a romantic scent ...but a comforting warm perfume...</li>
            <li> It is not as good as the other Perry Ellis perfumes I have bought.</li>
            <li> Having loved Perry Ellis Red, I had high hope for the &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; version.  </li>
            <li> Enamora fragrance&lt;br /&gt;Perry is a captivating scent that France alone, each time I use it gives the feeling of excellence to attract attention by the sweet scent that combines the delight of the perfume with the image of a current</li>
            <li> Worth every penny, he is absolutely irresistible when he wears this!</li>
            <li> It is a good choice to wear because you won&#x27;t smell like every other guy!</li>
            <li> the product was for a birthday gift and the person who was present was very happy because I wanted for a few days</li>
            <li> Much to my surprise, considering I love the original, this version is leagues above the first.  </li>
            <li> drys down very fast to a warm creamy touch of sweet and spice...</li>
            <li> It had no packaging (like plastic or something) to ensure the product is new or original.</li>
            <li> The first time I smelled this cologne was on a stranger...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Besides, it gets her all hot and bothered, so I see no downside.</li>
            <li> Many comments on what it is I&#x27;m wearing from female co-workers.  </li>
            <li> Perry Ellis white smells way better.</li>
            <li> When my fiance and I first met he used to wear this</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know when I bought it that I would not be able to send it back.</li>
            <li> Red allot better product.</li>
            <li> While it projects well at first, it doesn&#x27;t last more than a couple hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always chosen to buy perfumes amazom directly as I receive 100% original.</li>
            <li> I own other Perry Ellis  colognes and they did not dissapointed on this one either.</li>
            <li> perfume has a scent is sweet soft and durable, like women very much recommend it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would say that 360 Red and Perry Reserve are daytime/warmer weather colognes or for those who just want to smell fresh with a light scent.  </li>
            <li> I would not have purchased it if I knew because I wasn&#x27;t positive</li>
            <li> The smell is good but it does not last very long.</li>
            <li> This has a very manly smell.</li>
            <li> Really like the price and scent to this cologne.  </li>
            <li> I saw it on here so much cheaper</li>
            <li> You can really smell the spice and amber in this, and the hint of tobacco leaf blends</li>
            <li> Very delivery.</li>
            <li> But the case has been damaged at the top, and the part where it hold the spray (the metalic part) is very loose.</li>
            <li> thanks a lot</li>
            <li> really will recomend to my friends and paratentals the product and seller.</li>
            <li> The red one is far better...</li>
            <li> But over all, especially for summer would prefer something more masculine.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy more for other gifts.</li>
            <li> For the price a nice perfume not sure If I would rebuy it though...</li>
            <li> Decent cologne ...</li>
            <li> So I will only buy at a local store for cologne unless you know what you want for sure then order thru Amazon.</li>
            <li> I do highly recommend it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly reccommend this product.</li>
            <li> The scent is very strong, and it smells like something a 40 year old would wear (definitely not something for a 19 year old male ).</li>
            <li> it live up to her hype?</li>
            <li> I WAS JUST TRYING SOMETHING NEW</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my boyfriend and although it smells really good, it doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as some of his other colognes.</li>
            <li> Perry Ellis colognes last a very long time, easily 10 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I never have smelled the 360 Black before, to confirm or deny that the product is original.</li>
            <li> So naturally, I&#x27;d get another Perry Ellis...</li>
            <li> My wife picked this out for me because she likes the Perry Ellis white so much.</li>
            <li> It goes away way too early from &amp;#34;Eau De Toilette&amp;#34; point of view as well.</li>
            <li> This smells like something a 35 year old bachelor would wear, or your 40 something teacher/</li>
            <li> all the Perry Ellis colognes has made in the past 15 years and this new reformulated cologne is my all time favorite not only of his line, but of all colognes I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> The scent lasts all day long, and it is so distinct and DELICIOUS, but also subtle and not too over-the-top.</li>
            <li> The product seems to be not original since the actual scent of it fades away very quickly once it&#x27;s on the user&#x27;s body.</li>
            <li> I do not regret this purchase was exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> This one&#x27;s a little mild.</li>
            <li> Actually I had never smelled this cologne before, I wanted to suprise my hubby with something new.  </li>
            <li> BUT I WILL STAY WITH MY OLD ONE RED</li>
            <li> If you like 360 White (a JPG La Male clone) you will love 360 Black because they are similar, but black has an extra tea spice note to it which makes it slightly more masculine and complex.  </li>
            <li> The problem is, that I ordered the 360 black, but its not the right smell, if you compare it to one you buy in a mall or a specific place for perfumes, you can diferentiate the smells.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> I heard Perry Ellis black smell better than the previous Perry Ellis in the grey container.</li>
            <li> sweet and a little dark yet seductive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely try out the \\&quot;New\\&quot; Perry Ellis in the clear rectangular bottle (with black wooden cap).  </li>
            <li> The scent is long lasting.</li>
            <li> the scent doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have pointed out this is a classic scent for gentlemen not a sexy scent for young dudes going to a club.</li>
            <li> if you try it out you&#x27;ll understand exactly what I mean</li>
            <li> and it was much different than what I expected.</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t see a need to have BOTH the Black and the White since they are so similar.  </li>
            <li> Women melt over the smell of both the 360 White and the 360 Black.  </li>
            <li> What I received does not smell like Black that I have smelled in local stores.</li>
            <li> what I expected and meets loa offer made.</li>
            <li> 360 sexy is crap next to 360 Black</li>
            <li> It smelled like an old-fashioned, old man&#x27;s cologne...very heavy, too sweet-smelling, and hard to wash off from my wrists and neck.</li>
            <li> ; Portfolio, Reserve and 360 \\&quot;original\\&quot;)Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this Perry Ellis is the ok, NOT GREAT THOUGH.</li>
            <li> When I asked the guy what cologne he was wearing, I immediately wrote it down...</li>
            <li> Still prefer the Original, but the 360 Black aint bad ..</li>
            <li> so decided to try out the 360 Black ...</li>
            <li> 360 Black Cologne by Perry Ellis for men Colognes360 Black Cologne by Perry Ellis for men Colognes.</li>
            <li> I never tried the perry Ellis before in black</li>
            <li> that is shown in pic not the discription 360 Black.  </li>
            <li> Beware that the Perry Ellis 360 Black could not be returned for a refund.</li>
            <li> Description says Perry Ellis 360 Black</li>
            <li> 360 black</li>
            <li> I use this perfume for everyday use.</li>
            <li> got this as a gift a few years ago, haven&#x27;t stopped wearing it since.</li>
            <li> it just smells like plain rubbing alcohol ..</li>
            <li> Apparently I bought the wrong scent for my boyfriend for Christmas but this product is not returnable or exchangeable.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in my purchase and am now out money for something I did not want, if I had wanted the sexy scent I would have ordered it.</li>
            <li> Not love...</li>
            <li> Both are cold weather, romantic or evening colognes though</li>
            <li> Or any Cologne from Amazon some thing to do with the content in the cologne and shipping rules when open... Crazy.</li>
            <li> unfortunately this time I tried the Perry Ellis 360 Black.</li>
            <li> only bad thing is the packaging is disarmed</li>
            <li> Look elsewhere because this is deception and false advertisement.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I got a bad batch, or this is how 360 is meant to smell like, but I was thinking, I smell like soap wearing this.</li>
            <li> Wrong move.</li>
            <li> He ran out and it&#x27;s so expensive in stores</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen others describe it as a a Winter scent and maybe this makes some sense - since I can imagine it on a cold day, maybe adding some warmth.  </li>
            <li> Let me tell you, I didnt go wrong!</li>
            <li> So I read the reviews on this bad boy and decided to test it out</li>
            <li> I wore it to work, applying two sprays to my wrist and spreading it to my neck&#x27;s pulse points and the base of my throat.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to get this for your sweetie, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excelente Product! I recommend it 100%</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite scent and he said alot of people comment on it.</li>
            <li> This juice will trick people into thinking you&#x27;re a lawyer or some kind of CEO.  Great juice I do love this scent. Elegant and professional.</li>
            <li> Very good attention I get the product on time, in perfect condition, very good quality is much charm I recommend them 100% on the entire community of amazon ....</li>
            <li> My Dad always used to wear Perry Ellis products so this was bought for my brother for Christmas. Great smelling cologne. Perry Ellis is never a disappointment.</li>
            <li> The first time I smelled this cologne was on a stranger...I thought it was the best cologne I had ever smelled in my life! When I asked the guy what cologne he was wearing, I immediately wrote it down...then I went home and ordered it for my boyfriend. He is picky about his colognes so it&#x27;s not always safe to buy it for him, but I knew there was no way he wouldn&#x27;t love this scent. The scent lasts all day long, and it is so distinct and DELICIOUS, but also subtle and not too over-the-top. You&#x27;ll definitely get the ladies with this one!!</li>
            <li> I do not regret this purchase was exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> perfume has a scent is sweet soft and durable, like women very much recommend it. only bad thing is the packaging is disarmed</li>
            <li> This is a great perfume. I spray it on me in the morning and my girlfriend can still smell it at around 9pm. I&#x27;ve even gone to the gym and i can still smell it on me after i&#x27;ve done my workout. Really great purchase.</li>
            <li> My wife bought me this, and said it smells like \\&quot;an instant orgasm in a bottle.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it live up to her hype? Well, I have to admit, it does smell quite good, and lasts the whole day. I do highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides, it gets her all hot and bothered, so I see no downside.</li>
            <li> hey guys, I&#x27;m 25. I didn&#x27;t know what to expect, I just took advantage of the super shipping offered by Amazon and the suuper cheap price for a 3oz bottle... I wore it to work, applying two sprays to my wrist and spreading it to my neck&#x27;s pulse points and the base of my throat. As the day progressed, my friend&#x27;s girlfriend followed me around the store asking me questions and each time I&#x27;d answer... she&#x27;d get closer to me.  I also asked my friend Laura what she thought of it and she took one sniff followed by a bigger whiff of my wrist.. Her ass turned into a vampire.  I definitely recommend this product as part of your collection. It lasted a throughout my entire work shift and drew compliments.. This product can put a spell on women if you&#x27;re a smooth talker so use it wisely ;)</li>
            <li> It was very good thank you</li>
            <li> Best buy, the order arrived within the agreed time, the perfume is designed for elderly gentlemen because its scent is very classic. I&#x27;ve always chosen to buy perfumes amazom directly as I receive 100% original.</li>
            <li> Received this cologne through Amazon and came packaged nicley. The cologne itself is a nice manly scent that I prefer to use evenings going out and the scent is not overpowering. It is a good choice to wear because you won&#x27;t smell like every other guy!</li>
            <li> This has a very manly smell. You should try this.</li>
            <li> EXELENTE PRODUCTO Y ORIGINAL, ENTREGADO EN EL TIEMPO CONVENIDO Y BAJO LAS CONDICIONES DESCRITAS, MUY AGRADECIDO POR EL TIEMPO DE RESPUESTA.</li>
            <li> I love the original Perry Ellis 360 Degrees. I get compliments whenever I wear it. So naturally, I&#x27;d get another Perry Ellis...unfortunately this time I tried the Perry Ellis 360 Black. Wrong move. It smelled like an old-fashioned, old man&#x27;s cologne...very heavy, too sweet-smelling, and hard to wash off from my wrists and neck. UGH! Good thing the department store I got it from accepts returns. I got the original 360 Degrees instead (not the 360 Degrees Blue).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ah, welcome back Perry Ellis 360 Degrees!</li>
            <li> I have to many colognes (5), and this one is one of my favorites... It&#x27;s elegant but and the same time kind of attractive...</li>
            <li> The scent is long lasting. Smells fantastic. I own other Perry Ellis  colognes and they did not dissapointed on this one either. Highly reccommend this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent cologne, excellent delivery</li>
            <li> EXCELENT CHOICE I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance. I had another Perry Ellis cologne that was similar and so I bought this for a gift, but checked it out. For the price, nice fragrance.  I&#x27;ll buy more for other gifts.</li>
            <li> The product seems to be not original since the actual scent of it fades away very quickly once it&#x27;s on the user&#x27;s body.</li>
            <li> I like the herbal escence of its smell.  It  is a perfum that can be used for different places .</li>
            <li> I bought this Perry Ellis because of a friend&#x27;s Recommendation. I love Perry Ellis ( I have 3 of them; Portfolio, Reserve and 360 \\&quot;original\\&quot;)Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this Perry Ellis is the ok, NOT GREAT THOUGH. Try the Perry Ellis Portfolio, it is far better. The original 360 is also better.</li>
            <li> Decent cologne ... Got the Original Perry Ellis 360 as a present, which i liked ... so decided to try out the 360 Black ... Still prefer the Original, but the 360 Black aint bad ..</li>
            <li> Another very good choice .</li>
            <li> ive always used. its like my &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; and everyone i know likes it. i even ise chrome to mix them up a bit. i like the price. took a while to ge to my house but i had orderd on a thursday.</li>
            <li> My Wife loves this and uses this ....</li>
            <li> I use this perfume for everyday use. It is good for the office. It is discrete. Not for a special ocassion or special date. But it is good for daily use.</li>
            <li> I must buy again this perfume, for me this is the best of 360 series and the price is cheap too.</li>
            <li> 360 Black Cologne by Perry Ellis for men Colognes360 Black Cologne by Perry Ellis for men Colognes.Good price, good product</li>
            <li> fragrance, the product is very good in fact excellent, but the problem is in the package as it is not hermetically sealed, and has boat, the product evaporates as the seal is presented under the applicator drain ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;should improve the product packaging</li>
            <li> Excellent gift for me and the smell is very rich, I loved it, very nice presentation and the price was very good.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love the Black.</li>
            <li> Really like the price and scent to this cologne.  Many comments on what it is I&#x27;m wearing from female co-workers.  Defiently would reccomend.</li>
            <li> This is another good smelling product from perry ellis, once again, {the females like it}!! stays on all day i like it alot.</li>
            <li> package was damaged...</li>
            <li> Smells great (kind of a cross between soap and musk), cheap price, lasts all day</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have pointed out this is a classic scent for gentlemen not a sexy scent for young dudes going to a club. After a while it does have that powdery/woman&#x27;s makeup hint to it.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> My wife picked this out for me because she likes the Perry Ellis white so much. It stays with you and I get a lot of comments about how good I smell.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT ARTICLE. EXPECTATIONS FULFILLED THAT DESCRIBED IN THE SITE. VERY GOOD SUPPLIER. I RECOMMEND IT. VERY GOOD CARE.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell good at all</li>
            <li> It was shipped quickly but the cologne didnt smell like its supposed to.. its like expired or something I have no idea it just smells like plain rubbing alcohol ..</li>
            <li> If you like 360 White (a JPG La Male clone) you will love 360 Black because they are similar, but black has an extra tea spice note to it which makes it slightly more masculine and complex.  Both are cold weather, romantic or evening colognes though so I don&#x27;t feel it is fair to compare them to the original 360.  Women melt over the smell of both the 360 White and the 360 Black.  However, I don&#x27;t see a need to have BOTH the Black and the White since they are so similar.  Just get one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say that 360 Red and Perry Reserve are daytime/warmer weather colognes or for those who just want to smell fresh with a light scent.  Perry Ellis colognes last a very long time, easily 10 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely try out the \\&quot;New\\&quot; Perry Ellis in the clear rectangular bottle (with black wooden cap).  I&#x27;ve had or have all the Perry Ellis colognes has made in the past 15 years and this new reformulated cologne is my all time favorite not only of his line, but of all colognes I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I got a bad batch, or this is how 360 is meant to smell like, but I was thinking, I smell like soap wearing this. Then a friend commented I smell like soap, so I am going to stop wearing 360. Just looked up the return policy. YOU CAN NOT RETURN FRAGRANCES. I love Amazon, but I think I will stick with going to the mall for trying new fragrances.</li>
            <li> It is a product of excellent quality and price was axactamente what you buy good expectation the aroma of the product is ideal for my</li>
            <li> Smells okay. Perry Ellis white smells way better.</li>
            <li> Thank you for this item.</li>
            <li> The bottle was larger than expected, and the scent was a perfect fit for my hubby.  He loved it!  A home run for Father&#x27;s Day!</li>
            <li> smelled good  fast shipping</li>
            <li> When my fiance and I first met he used to wear this and it reminds me of chocolate; sweet and a little dark yet seductive. He ran out and it&#x27;s so expensive in stores he hasn&#x27;t worn it in four years. I saw it on here so much cheaper I had to buy it for his birthday! Worth every penny, he is absolutely irresistible when he wears this! It&#x27;s a great smell on any man, and the bottle is nice to look at as well. You can really smell the spice and amber in this, and the hint of tobacco leaf blends well if you happen to smoke cigars, it doesn&#x27;t make you stinky. If you&#x27;re looking to get this for your sweetie, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> My husband smell excellent</li>
            <li> got this as a gift a few years ago, haven&#x27;t stopped wearing it since.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing! Very delivery.</li>
            <li> the scent doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Apparently I bought the wrong scent for my boyfriend for Christmas but this product is not returnable or exchangeable. I didn&#x27;t know when I bought it that I would not be able to send it back. I would not have purchased it if I knew because I wasn&#x27;t positive I was buying the correct Perry Ellis scent and could not have asked because it was a gift. Now I am short $30 and stuck with this smelly cologne.</li>
            <li> Makes my husband smell soooo sexy. Love the scent, not to strong, just perfect and it does not wear off to quickly.</li>
            <li> The delivery&#x27;s time was very good. But the case has been damaged at the top, and the part where it hold the spray (the metalic part) is very loose. It had no packaging (like plastic or something) to ensure the product is new or original. I never have smelled the 360 Black before, to confirm or deny that the product is original. It&#x27;s good, but I prefer the 360 simple.</li>
            <li> THE PERFUME IS OKAY BUT NOT AS GOOD AS PERRY ELLIS RED 360 I WAS JUST TRYING SOMETHING NEW BUT I WILL STAY WITH MY OLD ONE RED</li>
            <li> the packaging and design is excellent. what I expected and meets loa offer made. I arrive on time. happy with the purchase</li>
            <li> Im so happy to shoping with us thanks a lot</li>
            <li> The red one is far better... This one&#x27;s a little mild.</li>
            <li> This smells great ,wow i see now what I have been missing, i am very happy with my purchase, thank you</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell good per several woman.  Red allot better product. Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again. I never tried the perry Ellis before in black</li>
            <li> Has a nice masculine scent, but with a touch of modern day fresh powder to it. It works very well, surprising as it seems. The bottle is huge, it applies very well, and comes in a nice case. It arrived quickly, as scheduled and in good condition. I was overly impressed by the scent, and it lasts quite a while.</li>
            <li> The problem is, that I ordered the 360 black, but its not the right smell, if you compare it to one you buy in a mall or a specific place for perfumes, you can diferentiate the smells.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the product is either tampered or diluted, in any case, is not the original smell, therefor, a ripoff.&lt;br /&gt;The originall product, I would recommend to anyone, the one being sold by the person that I bought this from, I would not recomend to anyone.</li>
            <li> The price it&#x27;s good.&lt;br /&gt;I like the fragance and bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I really will recomend to my friends and paratentals the product and seller.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome and last all day!</li>
            <li> Great product. I love the smell</li>
            <li> Got it as a gift for a friend, they loved, would differently by again</li>
            <li> I love using this product</li>
            <li> love the smell. a lot of compliments for it.</li>
            <li> What you get is 360 sexy that is shown in pic not the discription 360 Black.  360 sexy is crap next to 360 Black</li>
            <li> A patient checked in and he smelled so good I called his wife to find out what he was using. Was Perry Ellis 360 Black - made a great gift and now my husband smells wonderful too! Can&#x27;t inhale enough!!</li>
            <li> Great for the price and it is original at the mall stores this same cologne goes for $60 so I think it&#x27;s a great buy on here</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my boyfriend and although it smells really good, it doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as some of his other colognes.</li>
            <li> This was a xmas gift for my brother in law. I guess he liked, I never got a feed back from him. It smells great is all I can say.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne for my husband for Christmas and it is definitely my favorite men&#x27;s cologne by far. Nice, big bottle lasts awhile and it smells so amazing.</li>
            <li> Having loved Perry Ellis Red, I had high hope for the &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; version.  But, it&#x27;s just too sweet for me. I&#x27;ve seen others describe it as a a Winter scent and maybe this makes some sense - since I can imagine it on a cold day, maybe adding some warmth.  But over all, especially for summer would prefer something more masculine.  While it projects well at first, it doesn&#x27;t last more than a couple hours. Conclusion - maybe women would like it&#x27;s fragrance, but for me, it just seems - for lack of a better phrase - too almost powdery sweet.</li>
            <li> Great, that I was expected!!!</li>
            <li> Not atomizing the cologne when being sprayed.......</li>
            <li> It is not as good as the other Perry Ellis perfumes I have bought. The smell is good but it does not last very long. It goes away way too early from &amp;#34;Eau De Toilette&amp;#34; point of view as well. I would recommend Red and white perry ellis but not this.</li>
            <li> Much to my surprise, considering I love the original, this version is leagues above the first.  It has a smooth velvety aroma, with just the slightest touches of vanilla &amp; spice.</li>
            <li> So I read the reviews on this bad boy and decided to test it out and it was much different than what I expected. The scent is very strong, and it smells like something a 40 year old would wear (definitely not something for a 19 year old male ). I have to admit though, even though this is for older men, it smells really nice and it is pretty strong. I would hold off on this if you&#x27;re around the 20-30 age range. This smells like something a 35 year old bachelor would wear, or your 40 something teacher/professor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sorry about a;; this agism, but if you try it out you&#x27;ll understand exactly what I mean</li>
            <li> Ok here we go. With all the great reviews that the 360 Black had, wife could not stand it.&lt;br /&gt;Also Beware that the Perry Ellis 360 Black could not be returned for a refund. Or any Cologne from Amazon some thing to do with the content in the cologne and shipping rules when open... Crazy. So I will only buy at a local store for cologne unless you know what you want for sure then order thru Amazon. Good luck for that best smell......</li>
            <li> Actually I had never smelled this cologne before, I wanted to suprise my hubby with something new.  So I read the reviews and based my decision off of that.  Let me tell you, I didnt go wrong! everybody couldnt possibly be telling the same lie ladies, this cologne is awesome, it&#x27;s definately a panty dropper! lol</li>
            <li> the product was for a birthday gift and the person who was present was very happy because I wanted for a few days</li>
            <li> Description says Perry Ellis 360 Black, picture shows Perry Ellis 360 Sexy and that&#x27;s what you receive, should you go by pictures or descriptions.  What I received does not smell like Black that I have smelled in local stores. Look elsewhere because this is deception and false advertisement. I am very disappointed in my purchase and am now out money for something I did not want, if I had wanted the sexy scent I would have ordered it.</li>
            <li> I heard Perry Ellis black smell better than the previous Perry Ellis in the grey container. They were not lying. To me this is a chick magnet.</li>
            <li> I get many compliments from wearing this.  Nice price / fast shipping.  A+++</li>
            <li> Enamora fragrance&lt;br /&gt;Perry is a captivating scent that France alone, each time I use it gives the feeling of excellence to attract attention by the sweet scent that combines the delight of the perfume with the image of a current</li>
            <li> I bougth the perry elis 360 black and i&#x27;m totally satisfacted, i like the smell, i use it every day and people liked my smell</li>
            <li> the case and the bottle looks great and it smells lovely.&lt;br /&gt;got this as a gift for my bf and he loves it. I love the way it smells on him. Perfect.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my son in law for v day...I like ..Not love...the scent starts off with a strong bite...drys down very fast to a warm creamy touch of sweet and spice...Not a romantic scent ...but a comforting warm perfume...For the price a nice perfume not sure If I would rebuy it though...looking for more of a manly scent..does not make you turn your head....and 5 hours later the smell is gone...</li>
            <li> The product is original and is in good conditions for its use personal. I wait buy others fragances come soon</li>
