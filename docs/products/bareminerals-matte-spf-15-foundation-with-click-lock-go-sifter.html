            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>Great product and cheaper than stores</li>
            <li>I ordered \\&quot;Light\\&quot; and the matte finish is great, but it takes a lot of work \\&quot;buffing\\&quot; the product onto/into my skin to make it work.  </li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>I went onto their official website to check out what tone/colors I should use, then found it on amazon for a great price.</li>
            <li>Im happy with my purchase.</li>

            <li>Love this product and a great price!</li>
            <li>Its light weight and makes my skin look nearly flawless.  </li>
            <li>instead, otherwise it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>Great product....always dependable and easy to use!</li>
            <li>I assume she is very pleased with this purchase as well.</li>

            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>my favorite make up!  </li>
            <li>All in all, I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>This is the best mineral make-up hands down, it&#x27;s perfect for oily skin and it feels amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice color too.</li>
            <li>Blends in perfectly with the skin, just like all bareMinerals and stays on the whole day.</li>
            <li>Definitley a good buy :)</li>
            <li>I used the original foundation, but I&#x27;m so happy they came out with a matte finish version.  </li>
            <li>Excellent foundation for sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find my favorite make-up on Amazon at a great price and hoped it would be just the same as what I spend all that money on at the mall....</li>
            <li>fast and a great price.  </li>
            <li>so glad I found it on amazon</li>
            <li>I broke a nail and sent a pair of tweezers flying across the room before I was finally able to get the tab off with scissors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure fewer holes might help portion your powder better, but I see no need to cover the holes under the lid that already comes on the container.</li>
            <li>The color fits me perfectly in the summer, but it is a bit yellow in the winter.</li>
            <li>Even better customer service</li>
            <li>I love bareMinerals.</li>
            <li>on top to de-orange the tone.</li>
            <li>This is FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>They want me to write more words</li>
            <li>so here are some more words for this review lalalalalla lallala</li>
            <li>Top rated product for me.</li>
            <li>I have known many a woman that swears by this stuff (my mom and sister included).</li>
            <li>Admittedly they do look better, and there isn&#x27;t a bunch of added junk in it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this foundation.  </li>
            <li>Matte SPF is way better for those who have acne.</li>
            <li>It covers the face with &amp;#34;some&amp;#34; spf which is better for scars.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it, but I&#x27;m sure it will be fine.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this kind of container</li>
            <li>Once I got the hang of applying it without dumping half the product onto the countertop, I was very pleased with how it looks and even more delighted with the way my skin looked after a week or so of using it.</li>
            <li>it goes on smooth,  </li>
            <li>And the click lock sifter is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>This makeup provides excellent coverage, without the heavy feel or look of makeup.  </li>
            <li>It blends well, offers nice coverage and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>The difference between the matte and the original formula?</li>
            <li>The original formula has bismuth, which is known to agravate rosacea.</li>
            <li>I always loved Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li>The original formula is has a sheen coverage, and is great for dry skin.</li>
            <li>You get full coverage from a mineral foundation.</li>
            <li>I love it so much it has improved my skin</li>
            <li>The delivery was quick but the color was a bit off.  </li>
            <li>Shipped quickly</li>
            <li>This bare mineral makeup is really amazing</li>
            <li>I use \\&quot;MATTE\\&quot; foundation first and finish lightly with \\&quot;original\\&quot; to give glow.</li>
            <li>Service was super fast and love this make up so much</li>
            <li>The containers do not dispense all of the product, so power tools are required for full value ;)</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth, clean and is amazingly clear now.</li>
            <li>The product is good, just like other powders.</li>
            <li>Bare escentual matte does not contain this ingredient so it is better for sensitve skin and for those suffering from roseaca.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been purchasing bare minerals from Amazon for a while now because the price is so much better.</li>
            <li>I love bare minerals products.</li>
            <li>I love this,  could not find the color in the local stores,  </li>
            <li>Exactly the product it said it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>bareMinerals is the only make up I use on my face, so obviously I love it.</li>
            <li>The shade is a bit yellow, but works OK anyway.</li>
            <li>This is the first time something like this has happened to me despite hundreds of orders with Amazon, so I don&#x27;t think this is a reflection on their quality or service.</li>
            <li>There is no weird smell and it stays on about 6 - 8 hours.</li>
            <li>Keeps skin smooth and clear.</li>
            <li>At first, I used it with a concealer in certain scar areas, but after awhile those have lightened, so I use just this, bronzer and blush for my face plush eyeshadow, liner and mascara.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>So easy and simple.</li>
            <li>, it makes dry skin more noticeable.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend bareMinerals to EVERYONE!</li>
            <li>She really likes bareMinerals products.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty sensitive and oily, and it actually keeps my skin dryer and clearer.  </li>
            <li>This was not the product that is advertised, I compared it directly to one that I had purchased as a replacement from the BareMinerals store.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The box had a different insert than the real thing.</li>
            <li>My whole face takes ten minutes now!&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give me breakouts or redness and the look is totally natural.</li>
            <li>I chose 5 stars due to the fact that I have been using this product for years &amp; never fails!</li>
            <li>Looks natural and gives decent coverage at the same time.</li>
            <li>I dropped it on my tile floor on the first day I had it and the container broke, so be careful.</li>
            <li>There is one major difference though, which is why I&#x27;m writing this review - the container hardware, namely the Click, Lock, Go Sifter.</li>
            <li>This powder is pretty much exactly as I expected and consistent with what I&#x27;ve previously purchased.</li>
            <li>I like the bare escentual products, they work well in covering blemishes without feeling like I have a ton of make-up on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Bare Minerals for 6years.</li>
            <li>I have been using Bare Minerals for years and it never disappoints.  </li>
            <li>I was worried that I wouldn&#x27;t get enough coverage, and after one use (and everyday since) I am a true fan of this product.</li>
            <li>this product to several people, with no regrets.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a waste of plastic and more moving parts mean more opportunity to trap your powder in an unreachable space, or even worse, to trap bacteria.</li>
            <li>It is long lasting and gives the skin a natural appearance.</li>
            <li>The actual foundation was a way different color, lighter than bare minerals lightest shade - which makes me believe its not bare minerals foundation inside at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> The actual foundation was a way different color, lighter than bare minerals lightest shade - which makes me believe its not bare minerals foundation inside at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Did not receive the matte received original instead which is horrible for my oily skin should be more specific on item description</li>
            <li> This product meet my expectations as a Bare Minerals product for less.  </li>
            <li> It was missing the standard sticker that comes on the back with the barcode that you peel away to find the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I was not sure that I would like this, but I have been very pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> I probably should have gone to a bare minerals store to confirm my color, but it&#x27;ll match up after a few days in the Texas sun.</li>
            <li> I am 31, I have t-zone oil, acne and dryness everywhere else due to using acne treatments.</li>
            <li> I probably will not buy this again due to the size and price.</li>
            <li> This foundation is not the real thing, the color is off and the texture is wrong.</li>
            <li> It looks and feels as if I bought it at Sephora and costs twice less.</li>
            <li> stays like a liquid without the grease or mess.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with random breakouts since I was a teenager and since I have started using this makeup, my skin has been consistently clear!</li>
            <li> Well its deffinitly Bbare Minerals and for such a reasonable price without having to deal with the annoying membership.</li>
            <li> The only difference between this and the sifter in previous containers is that this sifter has fewer holes and can be twisted so the holes are covered.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve figured out how to use the sifter, I&#x27;m not really sure what it adds to the product.</li>
            <li> No more spilling your (expensive) mineral makeup all over the vanity or bathroom counter every time you open it.  </li>
            <li> This is an expensive little foundation.</li>
            <li> And boy, do I mean struggle!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been disappointed.</li>

            <li> great makeup.  I love this,  could not find the color in the local stores,  so here it is.  fast and a great price.  love it!!  it goes on smooth,  stays like a liquid without the grease or mess.</li>
            <li> Very light and flawless.  Doesn&#x27;t give the feeling you are wearing makeup.</li>
            <li> This foundation is not the real thing, the color is off and the texture is wrong. It&#x27;s like chalk. Even the container is different.</li>
            <li> Love it!  I have used it every day since it arrived. It is simple to apply; just swirl, tap, and apply to your skin. You get full coverage from a mineral foundation. The difference between the matte and the original formula? The original formula is has a sheen coverage, and is great for dry skin. This formula is great for the matte look and works well for me. The original formula has bismuth, which is known to agravate rosacea. Bare escentual matte does not contain this ingredient so it is better for sensitve skin and for those suffering from roseaca.</li>
            <li> Great price for a great product.</li>
            <li> Was on time/early.  Exactly the product it said it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the makeup I always purchase and never disappoints.</li>
            <li> my favorite make up!  so glad I found it on amazon</li>
            <li> bareMinerals is the only make up I use on my face, so obviously I love it. I&#x27;ve been using the products for over five years now. This powder is pretty much exactly as I expected and consistent with what I&#x27;ve previously purchased. There is one major difference though, which is why I&#x27;m writing this review - the container hardware, namely the Click, Lock, Go Sifter. This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this kind of container and I don&#x27;t like it. It comes sealed with a plastic tab you have to struggle to remove in order to access the sifter. And boy, do I mean struggle! I broke a nail and sent a pair of tweezers flying across the room before I was finally able to get the tab off with scissors. Now that I&#x27;ve figured out how to use the sifter, I&#x27;m not really sure what it adds to the product. The only difference between this and the sifter in previous containers is that this sifter has fewer holes and can be twisted so the holes are covered. I&#x27;m sure fewer holes might help portion your powder better, but I see no need to cover the holes under the lid that already comes on the container. It&#x27;s a waste of plastic and more moving parts mean more opportunity to trap your powder in an unreachable space, or even worse, to trap bacteria. I will continue to use this foundation, but in the future I will try to buy containers that omit this feature.</li>
            <li> Been using this for several years now. Its light weight and makes my skin look nearly flawless.  Especially love getting this cheaper from seller</li>
            <li> I always loved Bare Minerals. The shade is a bit yellow, but works OK anyway.</li>
            <li> This foundation is great! The color fits me perfectly in the summer, but it is a bit yellow in the winter. I dropped it on my tile floor on the first day I had it and the container broke, so be careful. All in all, I love it!</li>
            <li> This was not the product that is advertised, I compared it directly to one that I had purchased as a replacement from the BareMinerals store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was way off, from the plastic container to the box. It was missing the standard sticker that comes on the back with the barcode that you peel away to find the ingredients. The container itself had a different bottom. The box had a different insert than the real thing. The actual foundation was a way different color, lighter than bare minerals lightest shade - which makes me believe its not bare minerals foundation inside at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll never order from \\&quot;123 Deals from A to Z\\&quot; ever again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that I am very happy with how Amazon handled the situation, and will continue to be a dedicated Amazon shopper. This is the first time something like this has happened to me despite hundreds of orders with Amazon, so I don&#x27;t think this is a reflection on their quality or service.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Even better customer service</li>
            <li> Did not receive the matte received original instead which is horrible for my oily skin should be more specific on item description</li>
            <li> I love bareMinerals. It blends well, offers nice coverage and is easy to use. I highly recommend bareMinerals to EVERYONE!</li>
            <li> I wear minerals every day. Lightweight and covers well.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this product and a great price!</li>
            <li> Great product and cheaper than stores</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find my favorite make-up on Amazon at a great price and hoped it would be just the same as what I spend all that money on at the mall....it is!! Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I probably should have gone to a bare minerals store to confirm my color, but it&#x27;ll match up after a few days in the Texas sun.</li>
            <li> I was not sure that I would like this, but I have been very pleasantly surprised.  Once I got the hang of applying it without dumping half the product onto the countertop, I was very pleased with how it looks and even more delighted with the way my skin looked after a week or so of using it. I have struggled with random breakouts since I was a teenager and since I have started using this makeup, my skin has been consistently clear! I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered \\&quot;Light\\&quot; and the matte finish is great, but it takes a lot of work \\&quot;buffing\\&quot; the product onto/into my skin to make it work.  I can&#x27;t use this foundation to build any coverage without it being really obvious on my skin. I had to use my regular \\&quot; powder [...] on top to de-orange the tone. I&#x27;m wishing I&#x27;d ordered \\&quot;Fair\\&quot; instead, otherwise it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife.  She really likes bareMinerals products.  I assume she is very pleased with this purchase as well.</li>
            <li> I chose 5 stars due to the fact that I have been using this product for years &amp; never fails! Product lasts me over 3 months!</li>
            <li> Service was super fast and love this make up so much</li>
            <li> I like the bare escentual products, they work well in covering blemishes without feeling like I have a ton of make-up on.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Works well.  I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it, but I&#x27;m sure it will be fine.  Nice color too.</li>
            <li> So easy and simple. I use \\&quot;MATTE\\&quot; foundation first and finish lightly with \\&quot;original\\&quot; to give glow. I&#x27;ve been using Bare Minerals for 6years.</li>
            <li> This bare mineral makeup is really amazing I love it so much it has improved my skin and it is the best makeup I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> This is FANTASTIC! I was worried that I wouldn&#x27;t get enough coverage, and after one use (and everyday since) I am a true fan of this product. I was a liquid foundation user since age 15, and never thought that I would switch. My skin feels smooth, clean and is amazingly clear now. At first, I used it with a concealer in certain scar areas, but after awhile those have lightened, so I use just this, bronzer and blush for my face plush eyeshadow, liner and mascara. My whole face takes ten minutes now!&lt;br /&gt;As someone who has always suffered from acne, I never thought a makeup would HELP my skin! I am 31, I have t-zone oil, acne and dryness everywhere else due to using acne treatments. I went onto their official website to check out what tone/colors I should use, then found it on amazon for a great price. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Well its deffinitly Bbare Minerals and for such a reasonable price without having to deal with the annoying membership. Im happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This is an expensive little foundation. The product is good, just like other powders. I probably will not buy this again due to the size and price.</li>
            <li> This is the best mineral make-up hands down, it&#x27;s perfect for oily skin and it feels amazing. There is no weird smell and it stays on about 6 - 8 hours. Looks natural and gives decent coverage at the same time. It&#x27;s the only make-up I wear even when I have a acne break out, but that&#x27;s because it actually has shrunk my pores and helped my acne. Great product!</li>
            <li> Thumbs up. They want me to write more words so here are some more words for this review lalalalalla lallala</li>
            <li> I love this product! It looks and feels as if I bought it at Sephora and costs twice less. Blends in perfectly with the skin, just like all bareMinerals and stays on the whole day. Top rated product for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the matte, it makes dry skin more noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have known many a woman that swears by this stuff (my mom and sister included). Admittedly they do look better, and there isn&#x27;t a bunch of added junk in it. I have &amp;#34;introduced&amp;#34; this product to several people, with no regrets. The containers do not dispense all of the product, so power tools are required for full value ;)</li>
            <li> I have been using Bare Minerals for years and it never disappoints.  Keeps skin smooth and clear. Hip Hip Hooray!</li>
            <li> The delivery was quick but the color was a bit off.  Lighter than it should be.  I am still using it anyway.</li>
            <li> This product meet my expectations as a Bare Minerals product for less.  You cant beat that! Shipped quickly and I am very satisfied and will order again</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this foundation.  I used the original foundation, but I&#x27;m so happy they came out with a matte finish version.  And the click lock sifter is fantastic.  No more spilling your (expensive) mineral makeup all over the vanity or bathroom counter every time you open it.  This makeup provides excellent coverage, without the heavy feel or look of makeup.  My skin is pretty sensitive and oily, and it actually keeps my skin dryer and clearer.  Perfection at last!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing bare minerals from Amazon for a while now because the price is so much better. I&#x27;ve never been disappointed. Package arrives in &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; perfect condition and always on time. I would recommend anyone using this product to purchase from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great product....always dependable and easy to use!</li>
            <li> Matte SPF is way better for those who have acne. It covers the face with &amp;#34;some&amp;#34; spf which is better for scars.</li>
            <li> Got on time and as stated</li>
            <li> I love bare minerals products. The foundation covers and evens out skin tone, even though it&#x27;s a powder. It is long lasting and gives the skin a natural appearance. Definitley a good buy :)</li>
            <li> Excellent foundation for sensitive skin like mine. It doesn&#x27;t give me breakouts or redness and the look is totally natural.</li>
