            <li>LOVE!</li>
            <li>Really nice I love at</li>
            <li>The free earrings were cute too!</li>
            <li>These work just as well, and their is more color choices</li>
            <li>The free shipping was a plus as well!</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>Cute colors</li>
            <li>These liners are easy to maneuver around the curve of the eyelid, making them my go-to choice.</li>
            <li>Nice bright colors, some of the brushed are mis shapen so to use them for everyday make up might be a chore but perfect for what we needed the for</li>
            <li>But the product itself is fine and lasts.</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite brand!</li>
            <li>Absolutely Fabulous..</li>
            <li>They glide on easily and are true to their color.  </li>
            <li>She says this stuff is really easy to apply and makes a bold statement.  </li>
            <li>Very sparkly, and the color choices are fine.</li>
            <li>They are worth the money</li>
            <li>Just a fair warning that THESE ARE PACKED FULL OF GLITTER, if you like a little glitter but not a lot I would say look for something else.</li>
            <li>The color smudges easily and won&#x27;t stay for more than half a day without needing reapplication</li>
            <li>Exactly what I had hoped for.</li>
            <li>I love these, wish they had solid matte colors!</li>
            <li>i love the differents color and definitely would buy</li>
            <li>My daughter absolutely loves this stuff.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s sparkly, but you get what you pay for, really.</li>
            <li>Better than what I expected!  </li>
            <li>So I underestimated the picture, and didn&#x27;t realize just how vibrant these colors are, even the darker ones.</li>
            <li>Also I mostly wanted a purple that pops, but what I thought was purple in this pack is just a slightly different blue</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
            <li>It does not mix with the other eye make-up and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>The brush is so small that you can line more than one line at a time for a different look.</li>
            <li>I was attracted to the price, but man...the stuff barely shows up no matter what color you use</li>

            <li> but I won&#x27;t give a bad review over that because these are supper easy to apply.</li>
            <li> brushes skip, product is dried out...</li>
            <li> These are ridiculously glittery and that is not my cup of tea</li>
            <li> Not great quality at all...</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is noticable, and I like it because it is glittery and adds to a dramatic eye.</li>
            <li> I was really sad when they discontinued my Essence brand, but,</li>
            <li> so that was a bit of disappointment.</li>

            <li> Better than what I expected!  They glide on easily and are true to their color.  They are worth the money and I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I was really sad when they discontinued my Essence brand, but, These work just as well, and their is more color choices, I apply  them in the am and it&#x27;s good all day.</li>
            <li> My daughter absolutely loves this stuff.  She&#x27;s a Varsity cheerleader so they use a lot of eye makeup to make it stand out while they cheer.  She says this stuff is really easy to apply and makes a bold statement.  Overall, if she likes it--then I like it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely Fabulous..&lt;br /&gt;Phenomenal!</li>

            <li> Very sparkly, and the color choices are fine. No gift earrings in my shipment though. Also I mostly wanted a purple that pops, but what I thought was purple in this pack is just a slightly different blue so that was a bit of disappointment. But the product itself is fine and lasts.</li>
            <li> Love them ! Bright and stay on all day !</li>

            <li> Totally not a fan of these. I was attracted to the price, but man...the stuff barely shows up no matter what color you use</li>
            <li> WE bought these for Halloween make up and they are going to work perfect for that. Nice bright colors, some of the brushed are mis shapen so to use them for everyday make up might be a chore but perfect for what we needed the for</li>
            <li> Great brushes make the difference. These liners are easy to maneuver around the curve of the eyelid, making them my go-to choice. Lots of colors that last all day.</li>
            <li> Cute colors and it&#x27;s sparkly, but you get what you pay for, really. The color smudges easily and won&#x27;t stay for more than half a day without needing reapplication</li>
