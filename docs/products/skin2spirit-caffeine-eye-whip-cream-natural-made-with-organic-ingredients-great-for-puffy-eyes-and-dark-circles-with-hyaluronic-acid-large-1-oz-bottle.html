            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>We love this company and buy their deodorant too!</li>
            <li>Try it, you&#x27;ll love it!...</li>
            <li>what more could you ask for!</li>
            <li>I love the smell - chocolately coffee - it&#x27;s yummy!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s like magic!</li>
            <li>My morning puffiness is gone in about 20 mins and the moisture is perfect to apply makeup: not greasy and not dry, so makeup stays on and does its job.&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy to find</li>
            <li>This stuff smells amazing and goes on nicely.</li>
            <li>But the results were too amazing to let the coffee smell deter me from using it.  </li>
            <li>This company is amazing.</li>
            <li>The whip goes on smoothly and feels great and helps with the allergy swelling that I get around the eyes.</li>
            <li>Amazing for your eyes</li>
            <li>But nice result.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve been able to get good sleep, nutrition, and exercise</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best eye cream ever!!!</li>
            <li>so I have used my Aveeno night cream which does make the skin feel really nice and moist</li>

            <li>Honest reviews can improve products because it gives companies feedback, without having to pay focus groups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worked in skin studies and NO company can honestly make this claim.</li>
            <li>The whip is still nice to the touch</li>
            <li>I liked the cream</li>
            <li>My skin feels nice.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs nicely, and I can notice a difference in puffiness and darkness under my eyes.</li>
            <li>So I wanted to leave this honest review.  </li>
            <li>product itself is nice and delivers moisture and flexibility to the eye area.</li>
            <li>Be honest..</li>
            <li>but I got this eye cream and the skin around the eyes feels so nice and &amp;#34;velvety&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>The best part is that is all natural!!</li>
            <li>First, let me thank Kathi for her incredible service.  </li>
            <li>When I received it at work I was so happy I couldn&#x27;t believe it came so quick.</li>
            <li>It feels wonderful and does tighten up those 1st morning bags that sometimes come about by either allergies, no sleep or over indulging...:) It did smell like coffee but not too much</li>
            <li>Thanks to Kathi for her superb customer service and fantastic caffeine eye whip!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very very strong.</li>
            <li>The coffee scent is very strong....</li>
            <li>It smells delightful, and I mean DELIGHTFUL!</li>
            <li>I dont know how to tell if it is effective or not for my eyes, but it is very smooth and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It has a strong but pleasant coffee scent, which is ok if you are a coffee lover, and don&#x27;t mind the scent.</li>
            <li>I love skin care products that smell sweet and edible and this one is at the very top #1 spot on my list!</li>
            <li>(the good news there is that there&#x27;s an unscented version available from the seller&#x27;s store, which is cool).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All natural, inexpensive, great customer service, and IT WORKS!</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s even more amazing is the customer service.</li>
            <li>Perfect for sensitive skin and all skin types.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m very impressed with the results so far.</li>
            <li>This smells amazing as well and has a lovely consistency.</li>
            <li>Has worked awesome so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of organic eye creams and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>I love the smell (it kind of smells like a Starbucks).</li>
            <li>It has an interesting smell, kind of like a mocha frappaccino:)</li>
            <li>More importantly, it is organic and made of ingredients that are good for you and not \\&quot;toxic\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I love the container pump, I love the heavenly coffee/vanilla smell, and I loved the smooth velvety feel.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need her to, but I thought it was great that she was willing to do that for her customers.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if the rich coffee smell would bother me, but I got used to it (plus it smells good).</li>
            <li>I looked at all the reviews with good rates,and decided to buy two with no trial  (the price is not bad ),but it did not work  for me.</li>
            <li>The consistency is gel-like and very smooth.</li>
            <li>feels very smooth,</li>
            <li>I like this better than some over the counter eye cream, including Olay Regenerist or Laureal.</li>
            <li>Interesting caffeine ingredient seems working on my under eyes after 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li>glad I purchased it though</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>should also add that Kathi is as fabulous as her products!  </li>
            <li>I would give it 10 stars if I could! :)</li>
            <li>I bought this on the seller&#x27;s Etsy shop and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Does help a bit with debugging and feels/smells lovely.</li>
            <li>Love the all-natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>so I ordered 3 more.</li>
            <li>Love the fragrance and my eyes look better than before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to keep putting cucumbers on my eyes but will probably buy this again for its outstanding moisturizing properties.</li>
            <li>I love Olay and Aveeno products</li>
            <li>&#x3D;) ....</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>have now been using this eye cream for about two months, and I have to say, I&#x27;ve grown to like it more and more.</li>
            <li>I use it more then twice a day.  </li>
            <li>Smells so good,feels good and worth the money.</li>
            <li>YOU CANNOT FIND A BETTER EYE CREAM</li>
            <li>Buy it, you will love it.</li>
            <li>is what I love about this product:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>wait to give this as a gift :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been bothered by under eye puffiness for many years</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried more than a dozen of them</li>
            <li>Most eye creams I can&#x27;t use during the day because my makeup will smudge but not with this one.&lt;br /&gt;There is a smell resembling coffee but it fades in a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>Love this product and the way it smells.  </li>
            <li>Looking forward to trying to more of her organic products.</li>
            <li>I DO know that it helps my eyes feel more awake and moisturized while I&#x27;m wearing it, and works well under makeup.</li>
            <li>I love the eye whip.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I found this one.  </li>
            <li>and it so creamy that I&#x27;m always tempted to put more</li>
            <li>instead of making more outlandish claims that aren&#x27;t fact based.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>instead of making more outlandish claims that aren&#x27;t fact based.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Which I think is ok, because some people were complaining about it.</li>
            <li>Many drugstore beauty products perform better than pricey department store or dermatology website preparations.</li>
            <li>The skin around my eyes looks and feels better after two weeks use.</li>
            <li>I love this and the way it smells</li>
            <li>so many eye creams on the market</li>
            <li>Most of us awake with puffiness.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t help anything truthfully.</li>
            <li>and I have to say I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>It makes my eyes brighter and softer and it is not greasy, which I love.</li>
            <li>I really do love this eye cream.  </li>
            <li>As with all eye creams, this works best when it&#x27;s applied correctly - massaging it into the skin from the inner eye out towards the cheek bone to help get rid of accumulated fluids.  </li>
            <li>All I can say is that the many 5 star reviews this product has is a scam.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the consistency and texture.  </li>
            <li>i love this stuff  </li>
            <li>love the grapefruit face wash.</li>
            <li>must buy for ladies i get so many compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li>I do love the smell and feel of this product though, and I will enjoy using it until it&#x27;s gone!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had such personable service on Amazon, very impressive.</li>
            <li>I tried taking the top off to shake it out</li>
            <li>This product worked better than I anticipated.  </li>
            <li>have been satisfied with all the skintospirit products I have tried.</li>
            <li>fantastic cream!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really in love with this!&lt;br /&gt;Etsy</li>
            <li>importantly it works!</li>
            <li>It was an ok moisturizer for my eyes</li>
            <li>, it is an ok product</li>
            <li>I really love the eye whip.</li>
            <li>My under-eye area just feels so much better now</li>
            <li>I love this eye cream.  </li>
            <li>I finally found the perfect eye cream!</li>
            <li>I have tried sooo many eye creams...</li>
            <li>It smells great and is very moisturizing around the eye.</li>
            <li>Also, I had to take the top off and stick my pinky in to get the lotion since the pump never worked.</li>
            <li>This is such a wonderful product!  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried anything better than this eye</li>

            <li>My skin hasn&#x27;t had any reaction to it and it looks so much better than before.</li>
            <li>Love the stuff.</li>
            <li>I think with continued use they may just get better and better.  </li>
            <li>You also get an enormous amount of product from this seller for the price, I was impressed.  </li>
            <li>Also had a good experience with the seller, she is supper nice and really takes pride in her product.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice smelling and soothing eye whip that has worked very well for me.</li>

            <li>This eye cream is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m eager to see if the long term effect is as wonderful...</li>
            <li>I think that for &#x27;that kind of puffiness&#x27;, it works great and actually other &#x27;tightening creams&#x27; would not work for this kind of problem.  </li>
            <li>Does nothing at all for my under eye puffiness but the ingredients are the best and it has reduced the dry crinkly look and crows feet around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>It smells amazing and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>This eye whip smells amazing when you put it on, like a vanilla cappuccino (it goes away quickly,</li>
            <li>However, the scent is great and I will use it until it is used up mainly because I enjoy the scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells very sweet, like mocha.</li>
            <li>To me, it smells like coffee ice cream that&#x27;s been baking in the sun all day: very sweet, cloying, pungent.</li>
            <li>Try it, you&#x27;ll be surprised with the results and happy you did.</li>
            <li>Great customer service, thus far.</li>
            <li>The most important feature of this product is that the ingredients are organic and contain nothing &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>everything kathi makes is great have sensitive eyes does not irritate</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural and smells great too.</li>
            <li>All natural ingredients- great price-</li>
            <li>I loved this so much</li>
            <li>Thanks for the good work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that is all natural, smells great and my under eye area is so smooth and lighter and lasts forever.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this stuff, in fact, that I bumped my original review from 4 to 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this stuff, in fact, that I bumped my original review from 4 to 5 stars.</li>
            <li>No way in hell this cream is rated higher than industry-leading creams made my estee lauder, olay, dr. brandt and so forth (many of those products top off at just 4 stars and they do a MUCH BETTER job....</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s incredible!</li>
            <li>Its true, it DOES smell like a mocha latte!</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like the smell of coffee, you might not like this cream, but the smell dissipates very quickly.</li>
            <li>The coffee smell was strong but that is all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is WAY to strong for my tastes.</li>
            <li>And Kathi is so nice and so willing to help you.  </li>
            <li>This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used to help with dark circles and bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li>Fantastic sweet lady to work with!</li>
            <li>it just doesn&#x27;t help with the puffiness and fine lines around the eyes.</li>
            <li>discoloration and fine lines have NOT improved with continuous use.</li>
            <li>Love that the product is organic and full of fantastic ingredients.</li>
            <li>and I just noticed fine lines under my eyes, swollen and purple areas.....</li>
            <li>/&gt;****Update: after just a couple of weeks of using it, I see visible results on my fine lines.</li>
            <li>This product is SO WORTHY of all the 5 stars it has received!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve grown to enjoy it, but I could see it being a bit strong for some people</li>
            <li>I have been super pleased with this eye care product.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, texture and how quickly it absorbs.</li>
            <li>This product has helped me with this tremendously!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for anyone looking for a good quality, effective eye cream without spending too much $.</li>
            <li>I read the positive reviews on how effective it is,  </li>
            <li>My wife noticed a huge difference after a week.</li>
            <li>I use emu oil on top of my face products, it helps push them in and emu oil is the closest oil to our own natural oil.</li>
            <li>that is amazing since I haven&#x27;t  had much sleep</li>
            <li>Fortunately I found Skin2Spirit Caffeine Eye Whip.</li>
            <li>I do like how light and smooth</li>
            <li>Whatever &amp;#34;testing&amp;#34; the makers have done on this product is a probable hoax as I did my research and did not find any hint of confirmed testing for this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s great about this product is that it is homemade by an actual person which is comforting.</li>
            <li>This seemed to fit the bill.</li>
            <li>The texture is, creamy and smooth .</li>
            <li>It absorbs fast and it lays nice under makeup .</li>
            <li>If your looking for a miracle, there is no such thing, but if your looking for a great eye cream, this ranks with some of the tops.</li>
            <li>Despite the smell, I have been trying to use it and haven&#x27;t seen any results that make me think this is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>smells divine - just makes me wake up in the morning and feels sooo smooth</li>
            <li>The smell is light and to me is like coffee ice</li>
            <li>This cream surpasses all of them--makes your skin look and feel fabulous . . .</li>
            <li>This is a great product, not just for your eyes, but for your entire face.  </li>
            <li>she promptly answered all of my emails and I could tell that she truly cares about customer satisfaction AND about putting out a fabulous product.</li>
            <li>Its not greasy or heavy, it&#x27;s just perfect.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and wakes my eyes up in the morning.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and this all natural organic formula works wonderfully for me!  </li>
            <li>I was surprised how much I loved that coffee</li>
            <li>but this one is far superior for me.  </li>
            <li>Buying more right now.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The skin around my eyes looks very fresh and soft.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The coffee smell is quite strong but disappears quite quickly.</li>
            <li>I have suffered from dark, swollen bags under my eyes for most of my life no matter how great my night&#x27;s sleep was.</li>
            <li>Let me start off by saying I loved the packaging and the smell and after reading SO MANY positive reviews about an all natural eye cream that works</li>
            <li>I wanted to add a bit more detail about this product: I LOVE the new packaging.</li>
            <li>It was love at first smell.  </li>
            <li>And it is not a small .5 ounce bottle like most others are!  </li>
            <li>It stays moist a long time on the skin, which is a great thing.</li>
            <li>Some of the ingredients are: aloe, coconut oil, hyaluronic acid, green tea, cucumber, acai, blueberry, noni, goji, mangosteen, and many more good things.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that the wrinkles around my eyes have been significantly reduced.</li>
            <li>I was excited to receive this products, but it does not reduce eye puffiness.  </li>
            <li>Buy more than one and keep the extra in the refrigerator (plus, the cooling sensation is awesome and instantly deflates puffy eyes!).  </li>
            <li>When I pack my bags for trips, this is the first think I pack to make sure it comes with me.</li>
            <li>give this product a shot its worth it!</li>
            <li>This is an edited review, my original review is below.</li>
            <li>I also received a small sample of the face whip which I think I will have to order...smells delicious.</li>
            <li>I am not fond of the coffee smell, so she sent me an entire new bottle of the unscented WHICH I LOVE!!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that I&#x27;ll love it, as I do all the other Skin2Spirit products that I use, like the Coconut Rose Face Whip (moisturizer), Organic Antioxidant Hand &amp; Body Lotion, and Shea Body Mousse.</li>
            <li>Sometimes eyes look puffy because of lax skin - which many times can only be repaired with surgery or some kind of &#x27;filler&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>It is a clean smell.  </li>
            <li>like a film or crusty from it drying, where you feel like you need to clean around your eyes - none of that.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>I do not have many wrinkles yet because I am young, but I do notice more elasticity in my skin.</li>
            <li>The bottle type is very pretty easy to use, shipment was quick.</li>
            <li>There are so many positive reviews so it must be working for someone.</li>
            <li>Well Dr. Oz is right to go with caffeine in your eye cream, its true!</li>
            <li>Just a very light amount, too much and you won&#x27;t rub it in well.</li>
            <li>i just turned 60 and want to take special care of my eye area.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never tried anything that softens and moisturizes the skin immediately with no greasy residue AND dramatically deflates my undereye bags right away!</li>
            <li>I was super excited.....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product and I highly recommend it for puffy, swollen, and sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>It reduces fine lines and the morning puffiness right away and isn&#x27;t greasy</li>
            <li>I have to admit that sometimes it makes the skin under my eyes bright red</li>
            <li>Now one may say that&#x27;s great, however it really is not.</li>
            <li>This product made no difference on my eyes and none of the claims made in the description were true.</li>
            <li>Additionally, I have really grown to love this stuff over time.</li>
            <li>Additionally, I have really grown to love this stuff over time.</li>
            <li>My eyes feel smooth, rejuvenated, and fresh</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m only through about 2/3s of the bottle, so that&#x27;s good too.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product and it really works...</li>
            <li>And what she really means is \\&quot;pay for more of my products\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And what she really means is \\&quot;pay for more of my products\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t over poweringly sweet or coffee scented, I was a tad worried after reading reviews that some weirdo would mistake my face for a snack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seriously is is good enough smelling to eat out of the bottle!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this eye cream now for a couple months, and I really have enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s creamy and smells good enough to eat.  </li>
            <li>The consistency is just right, creamy but not greasy, with a light and yummy scent.  </li>
            <li>but when something is as effective as this, *and it performs well, and it is more natural and simple, what&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li>It sounds straightforward, but it is not so easy to do in real life.</li>
            <li>I reached out with a question and she was so quick to respond and even offered to customize a product for me.  </li>
            <li>Neither of us noticed any off-putting smell and it absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>Has quickly taken the bags and puffiness out from under my eyes.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, my makeup doesn&#x27;t smear &amp; my eyes don&#x27;t sting ..</li>
            <li>After one night of using this product, I noticed a tremendous difference.</li>
            <li>The price is outstanding for an organic product with high quality ingredients.  </li>
            <li>It has the lovely aroma of coffee which I LOVE, I am usually sensitive to anything with scents especially around my eye area but this eye cream doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes, I just have to make sure not to over do it which is hard because it smells so wonderful</li>
            <li>It has a mild coffee aroma to it, but it&#x27;s not unpleasant.  </li>
            <li>Overall this is a good, rejuvenating eye cream, and the price is definitely right for the amount of product</li>
            <li>For the first week I added it in my routine at night by putting a light layer under my eyes.</li>
            <li>but it stated in the description on amazon that it was great for dark</li>
            <li>I will buy this product again even if the dark circles don&#x27;t go away because I think it is a great eye moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Although I believe it is a good value and contains many natural organic ingredients, the coffee scent is overpowering to me, especially at bedtime.</li>
            <li>I was searching for something more natural and straightforward, ingredients I know of and can pronounce.</li>
            <li>It also is great for the dark circles.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very reasonably priced to boot!</li>
            <li>Kathi has tons of other awesome ingredients in this eye whip too which are all natural.</li>
            <li>It has also greatly reduced my dark circles.</li>
            <li>This is my new eye whip forever, I&#x27;m even in the process of buying 2 more bottles.</li>
            <li>I have very light sensitive skin and saw results quickly.</li>
            <li>The smell is distinct (It smells like a mild mocha coffee)however it is not obnoxious.</li>
            <li>and I found it just OK, but my husband is using it as his first eye cream and really likes it.  </li>
            <li>This product is the FIRST!  </li>
            <li>I also love that the ingredients are all natural and organic... and the price point is affordable!  </li>
            <li>It smells just like a salted caramel hot chocolate from Starbucks!</li>
            <li>First let me say that I was so excited at the thought of an organic eye cream....</li>
            <li>but it definitely is the smoothest, most moisturizing eye cream I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
            <li>Not only did I get the new bottle type (which works great)</li>
            <li>So far, it has not bothered my contact lens, which is very important to me.</li>
            <li>If it works and makes my eyes less puffy in the morning I will order more!!</li>
            <li>Now I applaud them for the clever top that makes it so easy and no waste!</li>
            <li>Smells great and smooths out the little lines around the eyes.</li>
            <li>and I actually started noticing the fine lines looked better and my skin looked smoother.</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic, gentle on my skin &amp;</li>
            <li>I adore the coffee smell, how easily absorbed and non-greasy</li>
            <li>So far I really love this eye cream.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen success with my Olay eye cream</li>
            <li>Granted, I only messaged to ask some questions, but Kathi replied promptly, kindly, honestly, and with the information</li>
            <li>They were ok but really didn&#x27;t do much and were quite pricey.</li>
            <li>This Eye Whip is made fresh and shipped to your door.</li>
            <li>I love the all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews, but this product MUST have one!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It smells heavenly...like a sweet mix of coffee and hot chocolate.  </li>
            <li>I just started using this product, but so far I love it.  </li>
            <li>It does have a strong smell of coffee or a latte which bothered me at first because I don&#x27;t really like coffee.  </li>
            <li>I ordered several other products that I am just as pleased with!!!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll check back in a month, SO EXCITED :)</li>
            <li>The original one I gave to my mom, who really enjoys the smell, and she is now hooked on this product as well.</li>
            <li>Yeah, right.</li>
            <li>Yeah, right.</li>
            <li>My eye area still felt smooth and moisturized 1 whole day after i used it for the first time.</li>
            <li>The smell does seem to be different than my first batch though, but it&#x27;s still nice.</li>
            <li>and when I wear it during the day it is fine under my normal under eye concealer</li>
            <li>I got the new bottle and the pump is working fine.</li>
            <li>SO - I have used many different eye creams since then - this one is my favorite, by far.</li>
            <li>as a 53 year old I am on the continual search for eye creams to combat PUFFINESS and DARK CIRCLES and this is my new best friend!!!!</li>
            <li>and it is very hydrating and leaves my skin looking very nice with less puffiness and some reduction in lines/wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It certainly did not work for me!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Skin2Spirit Eye Whip comes in a pump that pumps out too much; I try to do a half pump and am occasionally successful in getting out the right amount.</li>
            <li>I personally love the coffee smell, which I noticed on my second purchase is less potent of a smell, but I still love it anyway.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and has a mild tasty dessert-like odor.  </li>
            <li>it stated all natural, it should be a good product overall.</li>
            <li>It came super fast and packaged well.&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li>Ran out quickly, but I probably used too much.</li>
            <li>There is a well known organic national brand that offers a similiar caffeine eye cream for more than twice as much.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use this first because it actually works - and secondly because it&#x27;s a great price.  </li>
            <li>far after two months, my fine lines haven&#x27;t budged a bit</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!!</li>
            <li>but... i&#x27;m sure it does anything to my dark circle and fine lines or not...</li>
            <li>I love this eye whip very much, in fact this was my second time ordering on etsy.com.</li>
            <li>and I have never noticed much of a difference with any of them!  </li>
            <li>Once I am out I will definitely repurchase :)</li>
            <li>I use it before going to bed and first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li>I was thinking it was just in my head until two people this week told me how pretty my skin looked and</li>
            <li>I love this product I saw instant results.</li>
            <li>Thank you again Kathi, and I will be back to buy some more.</li>
            <li>The bottle has a pump (which I read is designed to make sure you get every last drop).</li>
            <li>The smell - first thing you notice.</li>
            <li>Later in the bottle, the smell has eased up and I&#x27;m getting more of a matte look.</li>
            <li>I wish Kat would just tout the indisputable positives of the product: cruelty-free, vegan, entirely natural, paraben free, etc.</li>
            <li>I wish Kat would just tout the indisputable positives of the product: cruelty-free, vegan, entirely natural, paraben free, etc.</li>
            <li>so I am glad I found it and definitely recommend it to others!</li>
            <li>The first thing you notice about the whip is the smell.</li>
            <li>Oh and the smell is so enjoyable, edging on addictive.</li>
            <li>, it is difficult to find the one that works best for you.</li>
            <li>I have finished my first bottle of this.  </li>
            <li>I definitely get a better result with this cream than with others.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I also love that it has so many organic/wild-crafted superfoods and green tea!</li>
            <li>I tried so many different things (even Preparation-H!)</li>
            <li>Kathi sells this on Etsy too in case you are interested.</li>
            <li>Will definitely continue using it. :)</li>
            <li>first...</li>
            <li>After comparing the ingredients, I noticed the first bottle listed cinnamon.</li>
            <li>Plus, the skin around my eyes feels so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>but this is the first product that compelled me to write a review.</li>
            <li>I was looking for an eye cream to alleviate my puffy &amp;#34;morning eyes&amp;#34;- and this product really delivers!</li>
            <li>I would absolutely repurchase and I  recommend that you give this product a try!</li>
            <li>Only used it twice, so haven&#x27;t seen much of puffy eye relief yet, but hopefully it will do its job, but the cream is so nice and goes on very smoothly, I really like it.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing and it doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out!</li>
            <li>I am sold, and that&#x27;s really saying something!</li>
            <li>It is decent moisturizer and the ingredients are good but it did nothing for puffiness or dark circles.  </li>
            <li>AMAZING for a fraction of the other eye promise keepers out there.....</li>
            <li>I love the concept of the bottle - it really helps you use every last</li>
            <li>The natural and organic caffeine whip is not only effective at keeping crows feet at bay, it also does not irritate my skin or eyes.</li>
            <li>Although I was allergic to an Ingredient, the seller Kathi was very understanding and helped me by sending me the same cream without the ingredient that was causing the reaction and it worked better than ever.</li>
            <li>And I bought this around Thanksgiving, so I probably owed a positive review a lot longer ago than this.  </li>
            <li>Cool and refreshed, alive.  </li>
            <li>I really love this eye cream because it&#x27;s just rich enough that the outside of my eye areas stays hydrated for hours not just absorbs in seconds</li>
            <li>For me it took a few days of twice-a-day applications to notice any difference, but after about a week the puffiness around my eyes had subsided greatly, and generally the skin in that area began to look a lot softer and brighter.</li>
            <li>I get the less effective</li>
            <li>and I still use them; however eye creams have been less effective over the years, I guess because of my age.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling super soft.</li>
            <li>Actually, I have found the scent very mild.</li>
            <li>This is my second time to purchase this product from Amazon; and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an eye cream that actually works and is a really good price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice not to have to dip your finger in the jar, but simple push the top and the whip is despensed in a small amount..perfect.</li>
            <li>Searching eye creams to treat fine lines on Amazon, I came across this product and I was carried away by its apparent high rating by its users.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, I began using eye creams when I was 21, just as a preventative for wrinkles (I have an older mother - she warned me of being preemptive!).</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin around my eyes, and so far, it&#x27;s been absolutely fine.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this whip for a short period and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>They will be my proof whether or not this really works.</li>
            <li>It smells like coffee, and I don&#x27;t drink nor do I really like coffee, but I let that go because my decision should be based on how efficient the product is, and here are my conclusions:&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I woke in the morning I touched under my eyes and the cream was still present as if it just stays on the surface of your skin; no matter how I rubbed it in the night before or the light layer I put on.</li>
            <li>was really showing.  </li>
            <li>It really helps.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making a prefect an affordable eye cream.</li>
            <li>but this doesn&#x27;t really bother them.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t drink much coffee</li>
            <li>so when I take it off, I really need it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much puffiness</li>
            <li>eye whip reeks so much</li>
            <li>I took some pictures before using the product, and you can tell how much my skin changed.</li>
            <li>i really like this product.  </li>
            <li>The eye whip is very soothing.  </li>
            <li>It really does help to lighten up the eyes.</li>
            <li>Who wants to smell like that in the face......</li>
            <li>I do not see much improvement either.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to using this product.</li>
            <li>so I would really like to diminish the aging effects</li>
            <li>The price is so reasonable even compared with drug store eye creams.  </li>
            <li>I really like this eye cream</li>
            <li>This whip did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li>Pumps out too much</li>
            <li>From this cream I can really see the result.</li>
            <li>but nothing worked very well or consistently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This cream is very moisturizing</li>
            <li>she also shipped it so fast</li>
            <li>Did research and Dr. Oz says to go with Caffeine eye creams because they really do work.</li>
            <li>They wanted to take care of me and offered to send me another bottle to try which smells much nicer.  </li>
            <li>I bought this about 2 months ago and wanted to wait to see how it really worked before I reviewed it.</li>
            <li>The eye cream has helped my puffiness, however there isn&#x27;t anything that will help if you have a diet with too much sodium.</li>
            <li>It is very fishy.  </li>
            <li>it really hydates my eyes...</li>
            <li>This eye cream is very moisturizing without being greasy.</li>
            <li>I feel like it really hydrates my under eye area and does not irritate my eyes or skin.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product, the price and the service unbeatable!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very moisturizing, and it definately shrinks the undereye puffiness.</li>
            <li>I really like this and would like to keep purchasing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very</li>
            <li>This makes them look much lighter.</li>
            <li>This cream is as moisturizing as the more expensive kind, and the caffeine seems to reduce the puffiness around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve really enjoyed this eye cream and have purchased several times.</li>
            <li>It smells great, actually works to anti-puff eyes, and when I&#x27;ve used it on other parts of my face incidentally it hasn&#x27;t given me a single pimple which is very rare.</li>
            <li>This will be my first time ordering the new Caffeine Eye Whip.  </li>
            <li>This specific product smells so yummy and has reduced puffiness significantly under my eyes.</li>
            <li>much more coffee then vanilla that other customers reported) and absorbency.  </li>
            <li>I had kept the original lotion as I thought I would be sending it back.</li>
            <li>and if I am not careful to keep this cream a safe distance from my actual eye stinging and watering will happen until I wash my face.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for the past month, not daily because I forget, but it smells great ( mocha chocolate),</li>
            <li>Also, when I dry my hair with a hair dryer, the scent becomes strong again--heat activated--to my dismay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just a little older and need a bit more help ;)</li>
            <li>I was searching for a new eye cream, and purchased this after reading the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I also send a sample to a high maintenance friend whose been using it without knowledge of what it was and really likes it to.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was super fast, it took only 3 days.</li>
            <li>It is soothing and hydrating and keeps my under eye area smooth all day long.  </li>
            <li>so i think it&#x27;s not enough time to see the full</li>
            <li>, so I can warn others that it seems strange that there are so many positive reviews, because I would definitely like to see some before and after photos from these reviewers with a five star rating as proof.</li>
            <li>For less than $20 per bottle, that is a fantastic deal!</li>
            <li>For less than $20 per bottle, that is a fantastic deal!</li>
            <li>I am half-way through my second bottle of this eye-cream, and came back to order more.  </li>
            <li>Clever packaging, also.</li>
            <li>The older</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying this product.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this eye whip.</li>
            <li>Finally, as mentioned by some other reviewers, this product has a VERY strong coffee smell, which doesn&#x27;t dissipate much over time.</li>
            <li>&quot; If you love coffee, that&#x27;s an added little bonus.</li>
            <li>I also feel like in the three weeks I&#x27;ve been using it, my under eyes do look a little firmer and just more awake.</li>
            <li>I wanted to lick it off my own eye balls, so luscious is the aroma, like a little chocolate frappe whip!!</li>
            <li>I am in my early 30s, and don&#x27;t really have any lines or wrinkles</li>
            <li>This eye cream really works well to reduce the puffiness and moisturize the sensitive skin around the eyes.</li>
            <li>, happily, the last few days I have noticed that the puffiness is diminishing and the skin around my eyes seem much younger.</li>
            <li>Still testing it out but thus far, really like this product.</li>
            <li>This smells great, but unfortunately, that&#x27;s about it.  </li>
            <li>After more than a week, my skin under the eyes looked exactly the same each night and no difference in appearance of dark circles or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is much better than many of my other more expensive products!  </li>
            <li>The skin around my eyes has some wrinkles, the normal amount i think; im 24 years</li>
            <li>Such a rare find!&lt;br /&gt;Miriam&lt;br /&gt;Health freak and blogger at [...]</li>
            <li>I need a few more days to see any results.</li>
            <li>I have been using this cream for a few years now, and my undereye and crows feet areas have never looked better.  </li>
            <li>I just think it pumps out too much cream each time ( for an eye cream) and the vanilla/coffee smell is a little strong for my taste.</li>
            <li>Even though I am not, I finally look a little more well-rested!</li>
            <li>I have had noticeable results with the fine lines around my eyes with this product, without the sting of chemicals that you get from other products.</li>
            <li>Once in my right eye and three times in my left eye.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice because I only use a tiny dollop of cream for both eyes, so I think the can will go a long way.</li>
            <li>I have a new baby and a toddler at home and the lack of sleep</li>
            <li>I ordered Kathi, the maker, contacted me to say the shipment might be delayed because she was waiting for the new bottles for packaging to come in.</li>
            <li>Compare to the other product I am or was using, this cost less and quality is good, save me ton of money to improve my skin.</li>
            <li>After being washed off I noticed no change in dark circles or fine lines.</li>
            <li>it felt kind of burn-y around my eyes; the sensation went away after a few days, but it was off-putting initially.</li>
            <li>This product is worth a try especially because of the price and how soft the skin around your eyes will feel.</li>
            <li>I expected more from a product that set me back $20.</li>
            <li>Feels great on skin surrounding eyes especially when skin is tired at day&#x27;s end and morning start.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The reason I gave a 4 not 5 star rating is that I have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>This is my second order after finishing my first.</li>
            <li>Using this stuff daily I JUST ran out of my first bottle nine months to the day after I bought it.</li>
            <li>Using this stuff daily I JUST ran out of my first bottle nine months to the day after I bought it.</li>
            <li>but I have noticed a slight improvement with my fine lines</li>
            <li>I have tried more expensive creams and they have not been any better than this product and some left my eyes stinging.</li>
            <li>Many eye creams I&#x27;ve used in the past sting or burn or irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li>I FINALLY found something that really works!</li>
            <li>The other thing that is not advertised on here but should be is that she makes the eye whip FRESH!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m updating my original review because the company actually contacted me about their product after my initial posting.  </li>
            <li>First off, this product smells like French toast.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m always worried about a reaction with any new products, but this is an all natural product that when you put it on, you can even smell the caffeine.</li>
            <li>The skin around my eyes just feels fantastic and less puffy too.</li>
            <li>The first cream that actually helps to deflate my 40 year old puffy eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found that after using it every day, my dark circles were definitely lightening and when I use it in the mornings I feel more awake just from the smell.</li>
            <li>but if your sensitive order her sensitive version!</li>
            <li>so I certainly gave it enough time.</li>
            <li>It is a huge disappointment with more money and efforts in vain.</li>
            <li>I was so surprised to experience the immediate benefits.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m starting to see real results.</li>
            <li>I purchased this along with the acne face wash, and you can read my review for that, as far as this product it didn&#x27;t do anything that it claims.</li>
            <li>After three weeks I&#x27;ve also noticed some reduction in under-eye darkness, too, though it hasn&#x27;t gotten rid of it completely</li>
            <li>(I wasn&#x27;t really expecting it to -- only concealer can do that).</li>
            <li>It left a really greasy feeling even with a lil amount.</li>
            <li>I am a 37 year old woman</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>I really like the caffeine effect of this and has actually made the puffiness under my eyes virtually disappear in a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>I like natural products where you don&#x27;t have to worry about what is in it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not that young</li>
            <li>My eyes are sensitive and I have not had any problem putting this all around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I am getting ready to order my 2nd bottle because it does lessen the darkness and with in 10 seconds</li>
            <li>I came across this eye cream while doing searching on amazon for natural eye creams</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does however moisturize the delicate eye area well without having been tested on the eyes of innocent rabbits, cats, or dogs.</li>
            <li>(None so far.)</li>
            <li>I have acne prone and gluten sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it a week now and feel I&#x27;ll be purchasing again when it&#x27;s near the end.</li>
            <li>I am so grateful I found the cure to my problem and it is an all natural, organic product.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t beat this price for such a high quality caffeine eye cream!</li>
            <li>am in my early 30&#x27;s, never even considered eye creams, but I woke up one morning</li>
            <li>I have an extremely sensitive skin, I don&#x27;t get along with a lot of the face creams out there, but my skin loves it, without signs of irritation or burning sensation.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>department stores, drug stores, beauty store, and natural health stores....</li>
            <li>I have now thrown the old bottle away, but would buy this newer improved lotion again.</li>
            <li>but it goes on like a soft kiss.</li>
            <li>This has helped considerably.  </li>
            <li>a little tingle (not sure why, but it was fine) and it absorbed fast.</li>
            <li>I think the price is a bargain compared to other creams and personally, it&#x27;s the only one that worked for me - and I&#x27;ve tried many eye creams over my life.  </li>
            <li>It sinks right into the skin.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s still some darkness under my eyes, but overall it has definitely become less prominent.</li>
            <li>Hands down, this product is just as good as if not better!  </li>
            <li>I was very much excited to receive this product to finally get rid of dark circles and under eye puffiness but neither was solved.</li>
            <li>I received my new bottle last week</li>
            <li>I have noticed some difference in the wrinkles around my eye, and reduced puffiness, but nothing major.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a lot of reviews were not verified purchases and some only had multiple 5 star reviews for this particular seller.  </li>
            <li>I can notice some slight improvements just in the first few hours of my original skin tone coming back under my eyes.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to really notice any difference.</li>
            <li>Being made of natural ingredients means a &#x27;skin reaction&#x27; issue is almost nonexistent - especially if you get the one without fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I use it at night time and during the day time and it sinks in very well</li>
            <li>The smell is strong and unpleasant, cloyingly sweet like coffee syrup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like many of the previous reviewers, I have tried numerous eye creams--some of them 3 times more expensive, and this one is a keeper!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a male user and I highly recommend this product for male and female customers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve notice the puffiness under my eyes gone down a little, but I&#x27;m hopeful it&#x27;ll improve more because I&#x27;ve only used it for three weeks now.  </li>
            <li>I really like the smell of the cream,  like coffee and other stuff.</li>
            <li>I thought I would give it a few more weeks because I saw in one review where the owner said it could take some people a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>The smell is not bad if you like coffee and a little of the product goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I suddenly developed them three months ago due to a new baby...</li>
            <li>Not a single thing changed on my face.</li>
            <li>dont feel dry during the day time after i used it in the morning, even though i live in the desert area.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, dry eyes for which I use prescription eye drops.</li>
            <li>When I first started using it my eyelid would itch a little</li>
            <li>Also, the cream&#x27;s a bit greasy and takes a LOT of rubbing to work into my skin, even just a dollop: after the first week I stopped using it in the morning because it left my skin shiny for half of the day.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a big problem with the fragrance, I just tend to avoid them in general.  </li>
            <li>The first few times I applied the cream</li>
            <li>Well I started using it today and noticed a difference within the first few hours.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen a big difference in my dark circles in the couple of weeks I&#x27;ve been using it, but I haven&#x27;t found any product that has made a real difference.  </li>
            <li>I just received the new bottle, which Kathi replaced for me at no cost, because my first one was not good.  </li>
            <li>The puffiness has decreased greatly, fine lines seem unchanged though.</li>
            <li>I feel like my fine lines are actually worsening with use of this product, or else the oily sheen makes them look worse.</li>

            <li> We love this company and buy their deodorant too!</li>
            <li> Try it, you&#x27;ll love it!...</li>
            <li> what more could you ask for!</li>
            <li> I love the smell - chocolately coffee - it&#x27;s yummy!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s like magic!</li>
            <li> My morning puffiness is gone in about 20 mins and the moisture is perfect to apply makeup: not greasy and not dry, so makeup stays on and does its job.&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy to find</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing and goes on nicely.</li>
            <li> But the results were too amazing to let the coffee smell deter me from using it.  </li>
            <li> This company is amazing.</li>
            <li> The whip goes on smoothly and feels great and helps with the allergy swelling that I get around the eyes.</li>
            <li> Amazing for your eyes</li>
            <li> But nice result.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve been able to get good sleep, nutrition, and exercise</li>

            <li> Honest reviews can improve products because it gives companies feedback, without having to pay focus groups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worked in skin studies and NO company can honestly make this claim.</li>
            <li> The whip is still nice to the touch</li>
            <li> I liked the cream</li>
            <li> My skin feels nice.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs nicely, and I can notice a difference in puffiness and darkness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> So I wanted to leave this honest review.  </li>
            <li> product itself is nice and delivers moisture and flexibility to the eye area.</li>
            <li> Be honest..</li>
            <li> but I got this eye cream and the skin around the eyes feels so nice and &amp;#34;velvety&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The best part is that is all natural!!</li>
            <li> First, let me thank Kathi for her incredible service.  </li>
            <li> When I received it at work I was so happy I couldn&#x27;t believe it came so quick.</li>
            <li> It feels wonderful and does tighten up those 1st morning bags that sometimes come about by either allergies, no sleep or over indulging...:) It did smell like coffee but not too much</li>
            <li> Thanks to Kathi for her superb customer service and fantastic caffeine eye whip!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very very strong.</li>
            <li> The coffee scent is very strong....</li>
            <li> It smells delightful, and I mean DELIGHTFUL!</li>
            <li> I dont know how to tell if it is effective or not for my eyes, but it is very smooth and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It has a strong but pleasant coffee scent, which is ok if you are a coffee lover, and don&#x27;t mind the scent.</li>
            <li> I love skin care products that smell sweet and edible and this one is at the very top #1 spot on my list!</li>
            <li> (the good news there is that there&#x27;s an unscented version available from the seller&#x27;s store, which is cool).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All natural, inexpensive, great customer service, and IT WORKS!</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s even more amazing is the customer service.</li>
            <li> Perfect for sensitive skin and all skin types.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m very impressed with the results so far.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing as well and has a lovely consistency.</li>
            <li> Has worked awesome so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of organic eye creams and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I love the smell (it kind of smells like a Starbucks).</li>
            <li> It has an interesting smell, kind of like a mocha frappaccino:)</li>
            <li> More importantly, it is organic and made of ingredients that are good for you and not \\&quot;toxic\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I love the container pump, I love the heavenly coffee/vanilla smell, and I loved the smooth velvety feel.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need her to, but I thought it was great that she was willing to do that for her customers.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if the rich coffee smell would bother me, but I got used to it (plus it smells good).</li>
            <li> I looked at all the reviews with good rates,and decided to buy two with no trial  (the price is not bad ),but it did not work  for me.</li>
            <li> The consistency is gel-like and very smooth.</li>
            <li> feels very smooth,</li>
            <li> I like this better than some over the counter eye cream, including Olay Regenerist or Laureal.</li>
            <li> Interesting caffeine ingredient seems working on my under eyes after 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> glad I purchased it though</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> should also add that Kathi is as fabulous as her products!  </li>
            <li> I would give it 10 stars if I could! :)</li>
            <li> I bought this on the seller&#x27;s Etsy shop and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Does help a bit with debugging and feels/smells lovely.</li>
            <li> Love the all-natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> so I ordered 3 more.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance and my eyes look better than before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to keep putting cucumbers on my eyes but will probably buy this again for its outstanding moisturizing properties.</li>
            <li> I love Olay and Aveeno products</li>
            <li> &#x3D;) ....</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> have now been using this eye cream for about two months, and I have to say, I&#x27;ve grown to like it more and more.</li>
            <li> I use it more then twice a day.  </li>
            <li> Smells so good,feels good and worth the money.</li>
            <li> YOU CANNOT FIND A BETTER EYE CREAM</li>
            <li> Buy it, you will love it.</li>
            <li> is what I love about this product:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> wait to give this as a gift :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been bothered by under eye puffiness for many years</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried more than a dozen of them</li>
            <li> Most eye creams I can&#x27;t use during the day because my makeup will smudge but not with this one.&lt;br /&gt;There is a smell resembling coffee but it fades in a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> Love this product and the way it smells.  </li>
            <li> Looking forward to trying to more of her organic products.</li>
            <li> I DO know that it helps my eyes feel more awake and moisturized while I&#x27;m wearing it, and works well under makeup.</li>
            <li> I love the eye whip.</li>
            <li> and I am so glad I found this one.  </li>
            <li> and it so creamy that I&#x27;m always tempted to put more</li>
            <li> instead of making more outlandish claims that aren&#x27;t fact based.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> instead of making more outlandish claims that aren&#x27;t fact based.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Which I think is ok, because some people were complaining about it.</li>
            <li> Many drugstore beauty products perform better than pricey department store or dermatology website preparations.</li>
            <li> The skin around my eyes looks and feels better after two weeks use.</li>
            <li> I love this and the way it smells</li>
            <li> so many eye creams on the market</li>
            <li> Most of us awake with puffiness.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t help anything truthfully.</li>
            <li> and I have to say I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> It makes my eyes brighter and softer and it is not greasy, which I love.</li>
            <li> I really do love this eye cream.  </li>
            <li> As with all eye creams, this works best when it&#x27;s applied correctly - massaging it into the skin from the inner eye out towards the cheek bone to help get rid of accumulated fluids.  </li>
            <li> All I can say is that the many 5 star reviews this product has is a scam.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the consistency and texture.  </li>
            <li> i love this stuff  </li>
            <li> love the grapefruit face wash.</li>
            <li> must buy for ladies i get so many compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li> I do love the smell and feel of this product though, and I will enjoy using it until it&#x27;s gone!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had such personable service on Amazon, very impressive.</li>
            <li> I tried taking the top off to shake it out</li>
            <li> This product worked better than I anticipated.  </li>
            <li> have been satisfied with all the skintospirit products I have tried.</li>
            <li> fantastic cream!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really in love with this!&lt;br /&gt;Etsy</li>
            <li> importantly it works!</li>
            <li> It was an ok moisturizer for my eyes</li>
            <li> , it is an ok product</li>
            <li> I really love the eye whip.</li>
            <li> My under-eye area just feels so much better now</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream.  </li>
            <li> I finally found the perfect eye cream!</li>
            <li> I have tried sooo many eye creams...</li>
            <li> It smells great and is very moisturizing around the eye.</li>
            <li> Also, I had to take the top off and stick my pinky in to get the lotion since the pump never worked.</li>
            <li> This is such a wonderful product!  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried anything better than this eye</li>
            <li> just love the smell of it!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered many things from Amazon-</li>
            <li> I use it all over my face sometimes because I just love the smell.</li>
            <li> My skin hasn&#x27;t had any reaction to it and it looks so much better than before.</li>
            <li> Love the stuff.</li>
            <li> I think with continued use they may just get better and better.  </li>
            <li> You also get an enormous amount of product from this seller for the price, I was impressed.  </li>
            <li> Also had a good experience with the seller, she is supper nice and really takes pride in her product.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice smelling and soothing eye whip that has worked very well for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was very excited to receive this product with all the rave reviews.  </li>
            <li> This eye cream is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m eager to see if the long term effect is as wonderful...</li>
            <li> I think that for &#x27;that kind of puffiness&#x27;, it works great and actually other &#x27;tightening creams&#x27; would not work for this kind of problem.  </li>
            <li> Does nothing at all for my under eye puffiness but the ingredients are the best and it has reduced the dry crinkly look and crows feet around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> It smells amazing and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> This eye whip smells amazing when you put it on, like a vanilla cappuccino (it goes away quickly,</li>
            <li> However, the scent is great and I will use it until it is used up mainly because I enjoy the scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells very sweet, like mocha.</li>
            <li> To me, it smells like coffee ice cream that&#x27;s been baking in the sun all day: very sweet, cloying, pungent.</li>
            <li> Try it, you&#x27;ll be surprised with the results and happy you did.</li>
            <li> Great customer service, thus far.</li>
            <li> The most important feature of this product is that the ingredients are organic and contain nothing &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> everything kathi makes is great have sensitive eyes does not irritate</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural and smells great too.</li>
            <li> All natural ingredients- great price-</li>
            <li> I loved this so much</li>
            <li> Thanks for the good work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that is all natural, smells great and my under eye area is so smooth and lighter and lasts forever.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this stuff, in fact, that I bumped my original review from 4 to 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this stuff, in fact, that I bumped my original review from 4 to 5 stars.</li>
            <li> No way in hell this cream is rated higher than industry-leading creams made my estee lauder, olay, dr. brandt and so forth (many of those products top off at just 4 stars and they do a MUCH BETTER job....</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s incredible!</li>
            <li> Its true, it DOES smell like a mocha latte!</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like the smell of coffee, you might not like this cream, but the smell dissipates very quickly.</li>
            <li> The coffee smell was strong but that is all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is WAY to strong for my tastes.</li>
            <li> And Kathi is so nice and so willing to help you.  </li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used to help with dark circles and bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Fantastic sweet lady to work with!</li>
            <li> it just doesn&#x27;t help with the puffiness and fine lines around the eyes.</li>
            <li> discoloration and fine lines have NOT improved with continuous use.</li>
            <li> Love that the product is organic and full of fantastic ingredients.</li>
            <li> and I just noticed fine lines under my eyes, swollen and purple areas.....</li>
            <li> /&gt;****Update: after just a couple of weeks of using it, I see visible results on my fine lines.</li>
            <li> This product is SO WORTHY of all the 5 stars it has received!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve grown to enjoy it, but I could see it being a bit strong for some people</li>
            <li> I have been super pleased with this eye care product.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, texture and how quickly it absorbs.</li>
            <li> This product has helped me with this tremendously!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for anyone looking for a good quality, effective eye cream without spending too much $.</li>
            <li> I read the positive reviews on how effective it is,  </li>
            <li> My wife noticed a huge difference after a week.</li>
            <li> I use emu oil on top of my face products, it helps push them in and emu oil is the closest oil to our own natural oil.</li>
            <li> that is amazing since I haven&#x27;t  had much sleep</li>
            <li> Fortunately I found Skin2Spirit Caffeine Eye Whip.</li>
            <li> I do like how light and smooth</li>
            <li> Whatever &amp;#34;testing&amp;#34; the makers have done on this product is a probable hoax as I did my research and did not find any hint of confirmed testing for this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s great about this product is that it is homemade by an actual person which is comforting.</li>
            <li> This seemed to fit the bill.</li>
            <li> The texture is, creamy and smooth .</li>
            <li> It absorbs fast and it lays nice under makeup .</li>
            <li> If your looking for a miracle, there is no such thing, but if your looking for a great eye cream, this ranks with some of the tops.</li>
            <li> Despite the smell, I have been trying to use it and haven&#x27;t seen any results that make me think this is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> smells divine - just makes me wake up in the morning and feels sooo smooth</li>
            <li> The smell is light and to me is like coffee ice</li>
            <li> This cream surpasses all of them--makes your skin look and feel fabulous . . .</li>
            <li> This is a great product, not just for your eyes, but for your entire face.  </li>
            <li> she promptly answered all of my emails and I could tell that she truly cares about customer satisfaction AND about putting out a fabulous product.</li>
            <li> Its not greasy or heavy, it&#x27;s just perfect.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and wakes my eyes up in the morning.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and this all natural organic formula works wonderfully for me!  </li>
            <li> I was surprised how much I loved that coffee</li>
            <li> but this one is far superior for me.  </li>
            <li> Buying more right now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The skin around my eyes looks very fresh and soft.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The coffee smell is quite strong but disappears quite quickly.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from dark, swollen bags under my eyes for most of my life no matter how great my night&#x27;s sleep was.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying I loved the packaging and the smell and after reading SO MANY positive reviews about an all natural eye cream that works</li>
            <li> I wanted to add a bit more detail about this product: I LOVE the new packaging.</li>
            <li> It was love at first smell.  </li>
            <li> And it is not a small .5 ounce bottle like most others are!  </li>
            <li> It stays moist a long time on the skin, which is a great thing.</li>
            <li> Some of the ingredients are: aloe, coconut oil, hyaluronic acid, green tea, cucumber, acai, blueberry, noni, goji, mangosteen, and many more good things.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that the wrinkles around my eyes have been significantly reduced.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this products, but it does not reduce eye puffiness.  </li>
            <li> Buy more than one and keep the extra in the refrigerator (plus, the cooling sensation is awesome and instantly deflates puffy eyes!).  </li>
            <li> When I pack my bags for trips, this is the first think I pack to make sure it comes with me.</li>
            <li> give this product a shot its worth it!</li>
            <li> This is an edited review, my original review is below.</li>
            <li> I also received a small sample of the face whip which I think I will have to order...smells delicious.</li>
            <li> I am not fond of the coffee smell, so she sent me an entire new bottle of the unscented WHICH I LOVE!!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that I&#x27;ll love it, as I do all the other Skin2Spirit products that I use, like the Coconut Rose Face Whip (moisturizer), Organic Antioxidant Hand &amp; Body Lotion, and Shea Body Mousse.</li>
            <li> Sometimes eyes look puffy because of lax skin - which many times can only be repaired with surgery or some kind of &#x27;filler&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> It is a clean smell.  </li>
            <li> like a film or crusty from it drying, where you feel like you need to clean around your eyes - none of that.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> I do not have many wrinkles yet because I am young, but I do notice more elasticity in my skin.</li>
            <li> The bottle type is very pretty easy to use, shipment was quick.</li>
            <li> There are so many positive reviews so it must be working for someone.</li>
            <li> Well Dr. Oz is right to go with caffeine in your eye cream, its true!</li>
            <li> Just a very light amount, too much and you won&#x27;t rub it in well.</li>
            <li> i just turned 60 and want to take special care of my eye area.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried anything that softens and moisturizes the skin immediately with no greasy residue AND dramatically deflates my undereye bags right away!</li>
            <li> I was super excited.....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product and I highly recommend it for puffy, swollen, and sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> It reduces fine lines and the morning puffiness right away and isn&#x27;t greasy</li>
            <li> I have to admit that sometimes it makes the skin under my eyes bright red</li>
            <li> Now one may say that&#x27;s great, however it really is not.</li>
            <li> This product made no difference on my eyes and none of the claims made in the description were true.</li>
            <li> Additionally, I have really grown to love this stuff over time.</li>
            <li> Additionally, I have really grown to love this stuff over time.</li>
            <li> My eyes feel smooth, rejuvenated, and fresh</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m only through about 2/3s of the bottle, so that&#x27;s good too.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product and it really works...</li>
            <li> And what she really means is \\&quot;pay for more of my products\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And what she really means is \\&quot;pay for more of my products\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t over poweringly sweet or coffee scented, I was a tad worried after reading reviews that some weirdo would mistake my face for a snack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seriously is is good enough smelling to eat out of the bottle!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this eye cream now for a couple months, and I really have enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s creamy and smells good enough to eat.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is just right, creamy but not greasy, with a light and yummy scent.  </li>
            <li> but when something is as effective as this, *and it performs well, and it is more natural and simple, what&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> It sounds straightforward, but it is not so easy to do in real life.</li>
            <li> I reached out with a question and she was so quick to respond and even offered to customize a product for me.  </li>
            <li> Neither of us noticed any off-putting smell and it absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> Has quickly taken the bags and puffiness out from under my eyes.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly, my makeup doesn&#x27;t smear &amp; my eyes don&#x27;t sting ..</li>
            <li> After one night of using this product, I noticed a tremendous difference.</li>
            <li> The price is outstanding for an organic product with high quality ingredients.  </li>
            <li> It has the lovely aroma of coffee which I LOVE, I am usually sensitive to anything with scents especially around my eye area but this eye cream doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes, I just have to make sure not to over do it which is hard because it smells so wonderful</li>
            <li> It has a mild coffee aroma to it, but it&#x27;s not unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> Overall this is a good, rejuvenating eye cream, and the price is definitely right for the amount of product</li>
            <li> For the first week I added it in my routine at night by putting a light layer under my eyes.</li>
            <li> but it stated in the description on amazon that it was great for dark</li>
            <li> I will buy this product again even if the dark circles don&#x27;t go away because I think it is a great eye moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Although I believe it is a good value and contains many natural organic ingredients, the coffee scent is overpowering to me, especially at bedtime.</li>
            <li> I was searching for something more natural and straightforward, ingredients I know of and can pronounce.</li>
            <li> It also is great for the dark circles.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very reasonably priced to boot!</li>
            <li> Kathi has tons of other awesome ingredients in this eye whip too which are all natural.</li>
            <li> It has also greatly reduced my dark circles.</li>
            <li> This is my new eye whip forever, I&#x27;m even in the process of buying 2 more bottles.</li>
            <li> I have very light sensitive skin and saw results quickly.</li>
            <li> The smell is distinct (It smells like a mild mocha coffee)however it is not obnoxious.</li>
            <li> and I found it just OK, but my husband is using it as his first eye cream and really likes it.  </li>
            <li> This product is the FIRST!  </li>
            <li> I also love that the ingredients are all natural and organic... and the price point is affordable!  </li>
            <li> It smells just like a salted caramel hot chocolate from Starbucks!</li>
            <li> First let me say that I was so excited at the thought of an organic eye cream....</li>
            <li> but it definitely is the smoothest, most moisturizing eye cream I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
            <li> Not only did I get the new bottle type (which works great)</li>
            <li> So far, it has not bothered my contact lens, which is very important to me.</li>
            <li> If it works and makes my eyes less puffy in the morning I will order more!!</li>
            <li> Now I applaud them for the clever top that makes it so easy and no waste!</li>
            <li> Smells great and smooths out the little lines around the eyes.</li>
            <li> and I actually started noticing the fine lines looked better and my skin looked smoother.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic, gentle on my skin &amp;</li>
            <li> I adore the coffee smell, how easily absorbed and non-greasy</li>
            <li> So far I really love this eye cream.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen success with my Olay eye cream</li>
            <li> Granted, I only messaged to ask some questions, but Kathi replied promptly, kindly, honestly, and with the information</li>
            <li> They were ok but really didn&#x27;t do much and were quite pricey.</li>
            <li> This Eye Whip is made fresh and shipped to your door.</li>
            <li> I love the all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but this product MUST have one!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It smells heavenly...like a sweet mix of coffee and hot chocolate.  </li>
            <li> I just started using this product, but so far I love it.  </li>
            <li> It does have a strong smell of coffee or a latte which bothered me at first because I don&#x27;t really like coffee.  </li>
            <li> I ordered several other products that I am just as pleased with!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll check back in a month, SO EXCITED :)</li>
            <li> The original one I gave to my mom, who really enjoys the smell, and she is now hooked on this product as well.</li>
            <li> Yeah, right.</li>
            <li> Yeah, right.</li>
            <li> My eye area still felt smooth and moisturized 1 whole day after i used it for the first time.</li>
            <li> The smell does seem to be different than my first batch though, but it&#x27;s still nice.</li>
            <li> and when I wear it during the day it is fine under my normal under eye concealer</li>
            <li> I got the new bottle and the pump is working fine.</li>
            <li> SO - I have used many different eye creams since then - this one is my favorite, by far.</li>
            <li> as a 53 year old I am on the continual search for eye creams to combat PUFFINESS and DARK CIRCLES and this is my new best friend!!!!</li>
            <li> and it is very hydrating and leaves my skin looking very nice with less puffiness and some reduction in lines/wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It certainly did not work for me!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Skin2Spirit Eye Whip comes in a pump that pumps out too much; I try to do a half pump and am occasionally successful in getting out the right amount.</li>
            <li> I personally love the coffee smell, which I noticed on my second purchase is less potent of a smell, but I still love it anyway.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and has a mild tasty dessert-like odor.  </li>
            <li> it stated all natural, it should be a good product overall.</li>
            <li> It came super fast and packaged well.&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li> Ran out quickly, but I probably used too much.</li>
            <li> There is a well known organic national brand that offers a similiar caffeine eye cream for more than twice as much.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use this first because it actually works - and secondly because it&#x27;s a great price.  </li>
            <li> far after two months, my fine lines haven&#x27;t budged a bit</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!!</li>
            <li> but... i&#x27;m sure it does anything to my dark circle and fine lines or not...</li>
            <li> I love this eye whip very much, in fact this was my second time ordering on etsy.com.</li>
            <li> and I have never noticed much of a difference with any of them!  </li>
            <li> Once I am out I will definitely repurchase :)</li>
            <li> I use it before going to bed and first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li> I was thinking it was just in my head until two people this week told me how pretty my skin looked and</li>
            <li> I love this product I saw instant results.</li>
            <li> Thank you again Kathi, and I will be back to buy some more.</li>
            <li> The bottle has a pump (which I read is designed to make sure you get every last drop).</li>
            <li> The smell - first thing you notice.</li>
            <li> Later in the bottle, the smell has eased up and I&#x27;m getting more of a matte look.</li>
            <li> I wish Kat would just tout the indisputable positives of the product: cruelty-free, vegan, entirely natural, paraben free, etc.</li>
            <li> I wish Kat would just tout the indisputable positives of the product: cruelty-free, vegan, entirely natural, paraben free, etc.</li>
            <li> so I am glad I found it and definitely recommend it to others!</li>
            <li> The first thing you notice about the whip is the smell.</li>
            <li> Oh and the smell is so enjoyable, edging on addictive.</li>
            <li> , it is difficult to find the one that works best for you.</li>
            <li> I have finished my first bottle of this.  </li>
            <li> I definitely get a better result with this cream than with others.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I also love that it has so many organic/wild-crafted superfoods and green tea!</li>
            <li> I tried so many different things (even Preparation-H!)</li>
            <li> Kathi sells this on Etsy too in case you are interested.</li>
            <li> Will definitely continue using it. :)</li>
            <li> first...</li>
            <li> After comparing the ingredients, I noticed the first bottle listed cinnamon.</li>
            <li> Plus, the skin around my eyes feels so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> but this is the first product that compelled me to write a review.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an eye cream to alleviate my puffy &amp;#34;morning eyes&amp;#34;- and this product really delivers!</li>
            <li> I would absolutely repurchase and I  recommend that you give this product a try!</li>
            <li> Only used it twice, so haven&#x27;t seen much of puffy eye relief yet, but hopefully it will do its job, but the cream is so nice and goes on very smoothly, I really like it.</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing and it doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out!</li>
            <li> I am sold, and that&#x27;s really saying something!</li>
            <li> It is decent moisturizer and the ingredients are good but it did nothing for puffiness or dark circles.  </li>
            <li> AMAZING for a fraction of the other eye promise keepers out there.....</li>
            <li> I love the concept of the bottle - it really helps you use every last</li>
            <li> The natural and organic caffeine whip is not only effective at keeping crows feet at bay, it also does not irritate my skin or eyes.</li>
            <li> Although I was allergic to an Ingredient, the seller Kathi was very understanding and helped me by sending me the same cream without the ingredient that was causing the reaction and it worked better than ever.</li>
            <li> And I bought this around Thanksgiving, so I probably owed a positive review a lot longer ago than this.  </li>
            <li> Cool and refreshed, alive.  </li>
            <li> I really love this eye cream because it&#x27;s just rich enough that the outside of my eye areas stays hydrated for hours not just absorbs in seconds</li>
            <li> For me it took a few days of twice-a-day applications to notice any difference, but after about a week the puffiness around my eyes had subsided greatly, and generally the skin in that area began to look a lot softer and brighter.</li>
            <li> I get the less effective</li>
            <li> and I still use them; however eye creams have been less effective over the years, I guess because of my age.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling super soft.</li>
            <li> Actually, I have found the scent very mild.</li>
            <li> This is my second time to purchase this product from Amazon; and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an eye cream that actually works and is a really good price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nice not to have to dip your finger in the jar, but simple push the top and the whip is despensed in a small amount..perfect.</li>
            <li> Searching eye creams to treat fine lines on Amazon, I came across this product and I was carried away by its apparent high rating by its users.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, I began using eye creams when I was 21, just as a preventative for wrinkles (I have an older mother - she warned me of being preemptive!).</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin around my eyes, and so far, it&#x27;s been absolutely fine.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this whip for a short period and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> They will be my proof whether or not this really works.</li>
            <li> It smells like coffee, and I don&#x27;t drink nor do I really like coffee, but I let that go because my decision should be based on how efficient the product is, and here are my conclusions:&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I woke in the morning I touched under my eyes and the cream was still present as if it just stays on the surface of your skin; no matter how I rubbed it in the night before or the light layer I put on.</li>
            <li> was really showing.  </li>
            <li> It really helps.</li>
            <li> Thanks for making a prefect an affordable eye cream.</li>
            <li> but this doesn&#x27;t really bother them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t drink much coffee</li>
            <li> so when I take it off, I really need it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much puffiness</li>
            <li> eye whip reeks so much</li>
            <li> I took some pictures before using the product, and you can tell how much my skin changed.</li>
            <li> i really like this product.  </li>
            <li> The eye whip is very soothing.  </li>
            <li> It really does help to lighten up the eyes.</li>
            <li> Who wants to smell like that in the face......</li>
            <li> I do not see much improvement either.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to using this product.</li>
            <li> so I would really like to diminish the aging effects</li>
            <li> The price is so reasonable even compared with drug store eye creams.  </li>
            <li> I really like this eye cream</li>
            <li> This whip did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li> Pumps out too much</li>
            <li> From this cream I can really see the result.</li>
            <li> but nothing worked very well or consistently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This cream is very moisturizing</li>
            <li> she also shipped it so fast</li>
            <li> Did research and Dr. Oz says to go with Caffeine eye creams because they really do work.</li>
            <li> They wanted to take care of me and offered to send me another bottle to try which smells much nicer.  </li>
            <li> I bought this about 2 months ago and wanted to wait to see how it really worked before I reviewed it.</li>
            <li> The eye cream has helped my puffiness, however there isn&#x27;t anything that will help if you have a diet with too much sodium.</li>
            <li> It is very fishy.  </li>
            <li> it really hydates my eyes...</li>
            <li> This eye cream is very moisturizing without being greasy.</li>
            <li> I feel like it really hydrates my under eye area and does not irritate my eyes or skin.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product, the price and the service unbeatable!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very moisturizing, and it definately shrinks the undereye puffiness.</li>
            <li> I really like this and would like to keep purchasing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very</li>
            <li> This makes them look much lighter.</li>
            <li> This cream is as moisturizing as the more expensive kind, and the caffeine seems to reduce the puffiness around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve really enjoyed this eye cream and have purchased several times.</li>
            <li> It smells great, actually works to anti-puff eyes, and when I&#x27;ve used it on other parts of my face incidentally it hasn&#x27;t given me a single pimple which is very rare.</li>
            <li> This will be my first time ordering the new Caffeine Eye Whip.  </li>
            <li> This specific product smells so yummy and has reduced puffiness significantly under my eyes.</li>
            <li> much more coffee then vanilla that other customers reported) and absorbency.  </li>
            <li> I had kept the original lotion as I thought I would be sending it back.</li>
            <li> and if I am not careful to keep this cream a safe distance from my actual eye stinging and watering will happen until I wash my face.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for the past month, not daily because I forget, but it smells great ( mocha chocolate),</li>
            <li> Also, when I dry my hair with a hair dryer, the scent becomes strong again--heat activated--to my dismay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just a little older and need a bit more help ;)</li>
            <li> I was searching for a new eye cream, and purchased this after reading the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I also send a sample to a high maintenance friend whose been using it without knowledge of what it was and really likes it to.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was super fast, it took only 3 days.</li>
            <li> It is soothing and hydrating and keeps my under eye area smooth all day long.  </li>
            <li> so i think it&#x27;s not enough time to see the full</li>
            <li> , so I can warn others that it seems strange that there are so many positive reviews, because I would definitely like to see some before and after photos from these reviewers with a five star rating as proof.</li>
            <li> For less than $20 per bottle, that is a fantastic deal!</li>
            <li> For less than $20 per bottle, that is a fantastic deal!</li>
            <li> I am half-way through my second bottle of this eye-cream, and came back to order more.  </li>
            <li> Clever packaging, also.</li>
            <li> The older</li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying this product.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this eye whip.</li>
            <li> Finally, as mentioned by some other reviewers, this product has a VERY strong coffee smell, which doesn&#x27;t dissipate much over time.</li>
            <li> &quot; If you love coffee, that&#x27;s an added little bonus.</li>
            <li> I also feel like in the three weeks I&#x27;ve been using it, my under eyes do look a little firmer and just more awake.</li>
            <li> I wanted to lick it off my own eye balls, so luscious is the aroma, like a little chocolate frappe whip!!</li>
            <li> I am in my early 30s, and don&#x27;t really have any lines or wrinkles</li>
            <li> This eye cream really works well to reduce the puffiness and moisturize the sensitive skin around the eyes.</li>
            <li> , happily, the last few days I have noticed that the puffiness is diminishing and the skin around my eyes seem much younger.</li>
            <li> Still testing it out but thus far, really like this product.</li>
            <li> This smells great, but unfortunately, that&#x27;s about it.  </li>
            <li> After more than a week, my skin under the eyes looked exactly the same each night and no difference in appearance of dark circles or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is much better than many of my other more expensive products!  </li>
            <li> The skin around my eyes has some wrinkles, the normal amount i think; im 24 years</li>
            <li> Such a rare find!&lt;br /&gt;Miriam&lt;br /&gt;Health freak and blogger at [...]</li>
            <li> I need a few more days to see any results.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a few years now, and my undereye and crows feet areas have never looked better.  </li>
            <li> I just think it pumps out too much cream each time ( for an eye cream) and the vanilla/coffee smell is a little strong for my taste.</li>
            <li> Even though I am not, I finally look a little more well-rested!</li>
            <li> I have had noticeable results with the fine lines around my eyes with this product, without the sting of chemicals that you get from other products.</li>
            <li> Once in my right eye and three times in my left eye.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also nice because I only use a tiny dollop of cream for both eyes, so I think the can will go a long way.</li>
            <li> I have a new baby and a toddler at home and the lack of sleep</li>
            <li> I ordered Kathi, the maker, contacted me to say the shipment might be delayed because she was waiting for the new bottles for packaging to come in.</li>
            <li> Compare to the other product I am or was using, this cost less and quality is good, save me ton of money to improve my skin.</li>
            <li> After being washed off I noticed no change in dark circles or fine lines.</li>
            <li> it felt kind of burn-y around my eyes; the sensation went away after a few days, but it was off-putting initially.</li>
            <li> This product is worth a try especially because of the price and how soft the skin around your eyes will feel.</li>
            <li> I expected more from a product that set me back $20.</li>
            <li> Feels great on skin surrounding eyes especially when skin is tired at day&#x27;s end and morning start.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The reason I gave a 4 not 5 star rating is that I have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> This is my second order after finishing my first.</li>
            <li> Using this stuff daily I JUST ran out of my first bottle nine months to the day after I bought it.</li>
            <li> Using this stuff daily I JUST ran out of my first bottle nine months to the day after I bought it.</li>
            <li> but I have noticed a slight improvement with my fine lines</li>
            <li> I have tried more expensive creams and they have not been any better than this product and some left my eyes stinging.</li>
            <li> Many eye creams I&#x27;ve used in the past sting or burn or irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> I FINALLY found something that really works!</li>
            <li> The other thing that is not advertised on here but should be is that she makes the eye whip FRESH!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m updating my original review because the company actually contacted me about their product after my initial posting.  </li>
            <li> First off, this product smells like French toast.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m always worried about a reaction with any new products, but this is an all natural product that when you put it on, you can even smell the caffeine.</li>
            <li> The skin around my eyes just feels fantastic and less puffy too.</li>
            <li> The first cream that actually helps to deflate my 40 year old puffy eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found that after using it every day, my dark circles were definitely lightening and when I use it in the mornings I feel more awake just from the smell.</li>
            <li> but if your sensitive order her sensitive version!</li>
            <li> so I certainly gave it enough time.</li>
            <li> It is a huge disappointment with more money and efforts in vain.</li>
            <li> I was so surprised to experience the immediate benefits.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m starting to see real results.</li>
            <li> I purchased this along with the acne face wash, and you can read my review for that, as far as this product it didn&#x27;t do anything that it claims.</li>
            <li> After three weeks I&#x27;ve also noticed some reduction in under-eye darkness, too, though it hasn&#x27;t gotten rid of it completely</li>
            <li> (I wasn&#x27;t really expecting it to -- only concealer can do that).</li>
            <li> It left a really greasy feeling even with a lil amount.</li>
            <li> I am a 37 year old woman</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> I really like the caffeine effect of this and has actually made the puffiness under my eyes virtually disappear in a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li> I like natural products where you don&#x27;t have to worry about what is in it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not that young</li>
            <li> My eyes are sensitive and I have not had any problem putting this all around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I am getting ready to order my 2nd bottle because it does lessen the darkness and with in 10 seconds</li>
            <li> I came across this eye cream while doing searching on amazon for natural eye creams</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does however moisturize the delicate eye area well without having been tested on the eyes of innocent rabbits, cats, or dogs.</li>
            <li> (None so far.)</li>
            <li> I have acne prone and gluten sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it a week now and feel I&#x27;ll be purchasing again when it&#x27;s near the end.</li>
            <li> I am so grateful I found the cure to my problem and it is an all natural, organic product.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat this price for such a high quality caffeine eye cream!</li>
            <li> am in my early 30&#x27;s, never even considered eye creams, but I woke up one morning</li>
            <li> I have an extremely sensitive skin, I don&#x27;t get along with a lot of the face creams out there, but my skin loves it, without signs of irritation or burning sensation.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> department stores, drug stores, beauty store, and natural health stores....</li>
            <li> I have now thrown the old bottle away, but would buy this newer improved lotion again.</li>
            <li> but it goes on like a soft kiss.</li>
            <li> This has helped considerably.  </li>
            <li> a little tingle (not sure why, but it was fine) and it absorbed fast.</li>
            <li> I think the price is a bargain compared to other creams and personally, it&#x27;s the only one that worked for me - and I&#x27;ve tried many eye creams over my life.  </li>
            <li> It sinks right into the skin.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s still some darkness under my eyes, but overall it has definitely become less prominent.</li>
            <li> Hands down, this product is just as good as if not better!  </li>
            <li> I was very much excited to receive this product to finally get rid of dark circles and under eye puffiness but neither was solved.</li>
            <li> I received my new bottle last week</li>
            <li> I have noticed some difference in the wrinkles around my eye, and reduced puffiness, but nothing major.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a lot of reviews were not verified purchases and some only had multiple 5 star reviews for this particular seller.  </li>
            <li> I can notice some slight improvements just in the first few hours of my original skin tone coming back under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to really notice any difference.</li>
            <li> Being made of natural ingredients means a &#x27;skin reaction&#x27; issue is almost nonexistent - especially if you get the one without fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I use it at night time and during the day time and it sinks in very well</li>
            <li> The smell is strong and unpleasant, cloyingly sweet like coffee syrup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like many of the previous reviewers, I have tried numerous eye creams--some of them 3 times more expensive, and this one is a keeper!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male user and I highly recommend this product for male and female customers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve notice the puffiness under my eyes gone down a little, but I&#x27;m hopeful it&#x27;ll improve more because I&#x27;ve only used it for three weeks now.  </li>
            <li> I really like the smell of the cream,  like coffee and other stuff.</li>
            <li> I thought I would give it a few more weeks because I saw in one review where the owner said it could take some people a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> The smell is not bad if you like coffee and a little of the product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I suddenly developed them three months ago due to a new baby...</li>
            <li> Not a single thing changed on my face.</li>
            <li> dont feel dry during the day time after i used it in the morning, even though i live in the desert area.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, dry eyes for which I use prescription eye drops.</li>
            <li> When I first started using it my eyelid would itch a little</li>
            <li> Also, the cream&#x27;s a bit greasy and takes a LOT of rubbing to work into my skin, even just a dollop: after the first week I stopped using it in the morning because it left my skin shiny for half of the day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a big problem with the fragrance, I just tend to avoid them in general.  </li>
            <li> The first few times I applied the cream</li>
            <li> Well I started using it today and noticed a difference within the first few hours.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a big difference in my dark circles in the couple of weeks I&#x27;ve been using it, but I haven&#x27;t found any product that has made a real difference.  </li>
            <li> I just received the new bottle, which Kathi replaced for me at no cost, because my first one was not good.  </li>
            <li> The puffiness has decreased greatly, fine lines seem unchanged though.</li>
            <li> I feel like my fine lines are actually worsening with use of this product, or else the oily sheen makes them look worse.</li>
            <li> Daily use has made the skin around my eyes MUCH brighter and softer, and I have virtually no dark circles anymore despite hardly ever getting enough sleep.</li>
            <li> Daily use has made the skin around my eyes MUCH brighter and softer, and I have virtually no dark circles anymore despite hardly ever getting enough sleep.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a bad smell but pretty strong.</li>
            <li> They were dark, sagging eyelids and brow, new lines under the eye.</li>
            <li> This was particularly problematic, as I used it both in the morning and evening, and at night, I actually had trouble sleeping because the coffee smell had a stimulative effect.</li>
            <li> A little really does go a long way</li>
            <li> The whip is a very creamy consistency and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Even if your dark circles aren&#x27;t so bad, the whip makes the skin around your eyes feel great.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be buying it again, but feel like I should hand out another star simply because this product lasts such A LONG TIME.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: New bottle which was sent was not full all the way which has resulted in me not getting the product out of the bottle for use.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see dramatic results, but it does make my eyes feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li> but because I have serious dark circles and fine lines.</li>
            <li> I will start by saying that I am 25 years old, I do not have puffiness, nor do I have dark circles.</li>
            <li> My eyes are soft and the dark circles are gone.</li>
            <li> No results just yet but have not been using it long enough.</li>
            <li> The puffiness under my eyes is down considerably.  </li>
            <li> Only con is that it does take a little bit of time for it to completely absorb into skin.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t get those tiny \\&quot;lines\\&quot; from dry skin.</li>
            <li> I am a white athletic female who have just turned 30 and have been suffering dark circles and puffiness for 2 years now (no medical reasons).</li>
            <li> I work late nights and this visibly diminishes puffiness, I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a big problem with puffy eyes, but dark circles definitely.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend to anyone your money should be spent on another product or just using regular night cream or retinol moisturizer.</li>
            <li> though according to the bottle that hasn&#x27;t been long enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I have to be incredibly careful about what I put on my face, especially my eye area.  </li>
            <li> knows how long.</li>
            <li> this bottle lasts a long time...</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t give a long term report...</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell long term benefits</li>
            <li> I have ultra sensitive, pale skin</li>
            <li> seriously don&#x27;t understand how this product has such high reviews</li>
            <li> For those of you who it didn&#x27;t work for, I didn&#x27;t take this to be a strict &#x27;eye firming cream&#x27; (which I think is different); it gets rid of puffiness due to liquid being held under your eyes causing puffiness</li>
            <li> This bottle will also go a VERY long way.</li>
            <li> This stuff never irritates my eyes and provides immediate relief to my dry</li>
            <li> Before I started using this, my under-eye area was always dry and irritated.</li>
            <li> I have not been using it long enough to evaluate reduction of dark circles.  </li>
            <li> My big concern was dark circles...</li>
            <li> and dark circles suddenly disappear!</li>
            <li> No burning or itchy if gets in her eyes which has been a problem for her in the past, makes sense with it&#x27;s all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> The moment I received this item, I put it on to see if the dark circles and puffiness would decrease and it definitely did!</li>
            <li> I tried multiple times, but could never get a small enough quantity.</li>
            <li> I tried it last night and noticed a slight dif</li>
            <li> I did not particularly like the smell</li>
            <li> I have big, black bags under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for nearly 3 months now, and although it&#x27;s so hard to tell with these types of things, I think it may be working to fade my dark circles a tiny bit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also read these long passages she&#x27;s written, commenting on other people&#x27;s reviews.</li>

            <li> Of course caffeine in cold green tea bags works wonders for your eye bags and dark circles, so I expect this to also do nice things for my eyes.</li>
            <li> I am 54 years old, and while I already had wrinkles around my eyes before using this product, I believe that they are less pronounced now after a few months use.</li>
            <li> my eyes tend to get a little puffy in the mornings or if i don&#x27;t get enough sleep</li>
            <li> I still have a little puffiness especially around one eye</li>
            <li> and after a few weeks,  I can say they have definitely faded.  </li>
            <li> It is harder to see results no matter what products I use.</li>
            <li> last few years</li>
            <li> and I have had dark circles for as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> and I feel I&#x27;ve wasted enough time on this product.</li>
            <li> My usage averages twice a day, using a partial (mini) pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no science backing up this claim.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no science backing up this claim.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I got it three days before I expected it</li>
            <li> I was so exited to try something natural on my eye area,without any harsh chemicals,but this eye whip caused redness, irritation on my eyelids and under eye area in a few minutes after applying it.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve been using this product for close to a month religiously and not even a slight improvement in my dark circles .</li>
            <li> /&gt;Remember how I said a little of this stuff goes a long way?</li>
            <li> how I said a little of this stuff goes a long way?</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and this is VALUE.  </li>
            <li> so a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It just didn&#x27;t work for me, whereas other products have.  </li>
            <li> this product is, and hope to be a lifelong eye whip customer!</li>
            <li> I was going to leave a three star review, but after reading some other reviews, I sensed there might be fishiness in some of the five-star reviews, so I figured I should balance it out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this religiously for the past couple of years.  </li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m assuming this is due to the caffeine.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried eye creams with the peptide that is supposed to reduce puffiness and other eye creams that contain caffeine</li>
            <li> other thing:</li>
            <li> Keep in mind, these comments come long after I&#x27;ve applied it, after it&#x27;s dried.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another thing I don&#x27;t like about the product is that after I purchased it, I received an email from the owner, Kat, asking me (in other words) to give it 5 stars OR contact her to fix whatever problem I have with the eye whip.</li>

            <li> A bit skeptical at first</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a plus to support a small American business</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read in other post though that there is a way to get an unscented version.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m allergic to something in the cream :(</li>
            <li> I always appreciate Organic, but home made and supports a small independent business</li>
            <li> I like the texture and the smell but other than that, Ive been using this for 2 months now before bed</li>
            <li> and I wouldn&#x27;t use any other product.</li>
            <li> and I have used other eye creams before</li>
            <li> Careful when ordering!</li>
            <li> not go too well with any other products or perfume...</li>
            <li> The skin around my eyes has never been softer, and if I forget to put the cream on at night, I definitely notice it the next day because my eyes look a lot puffier and tired.</li>
            <li> I felt self conscious and looked tired most of the time :-(.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only that, during allergy season, I had some pretty bad irritation and this soothed my eye area</li>
            <li> They both have extremely dark circles under their eyes.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have genetic dark circles</li>
            <li> Gets rid of all of the puffiness, and the dark circles.  </li>
            <li> I guess the only thing to get rid of these suckers is plastic</li>
            <li> I bought this eye cream for dark circles.</li>
            <li> and already I saw the dark circles lighten.</li>
            <li> My dark circles haven&#x27;t lightened one iota.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My dark circles haven&#x27;t lightened one iota.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for six months and have not seen any improvement in the dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> it has brightened my dark circles and the coffee and cream scent</li>
            <li> I have hereditary dark circles so...</li>
            <li> I have had dark circles under my eyes since having my daughter at age 35 and being sleep deprived.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting a miracle, but have seen noticeable improvement in moisture and dark circles.</li>
            <li> I have never had sensitive skin, broken out in a rash or anything like that.</li>
            <li> This cream had brought down my puffiness a lot and my circles aren&#x27;t nearly as dark as they were before.</li>
            <li> I mean INSTANTLY.</li>
            <li> I always had trouble with other products but it always sting my eyes.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product comes in an overly-large container, that makes it difficult to dispense an amount appropriate for use in the eye area.</li>
            <li> It asks you to use a half of pump every time you apply.</li>
            <li> It has worked wonders for the puffiness around my eyes, but I have seen little difference with the dark circles, maybe it takes longer use to see results.</li>
            <li> It works well with my dark circle under my eyes, it takes a few weeks to see the result.  </li>
            <li> up!Only used this a few days and already see some lightening in my dark circles.</li>
            <li> It just sinks into the skin, no greasiness and no exotic smells.  </li>
            <li> It does not give you that tight eye feeling like some eye creams do.  </li>
            <li> It might take a little longer because of my age.</li>
            <li> I have become a little jaded with skin care products.</li>
            <li> I have also started spreading a little cream on my forehead, which I think has improved the skin there, too.</li>
            <li> I have also started spreading a little cream on my forehead, which I think has improved the skin there, too.</li>
            <li> I have hereditary dark circles and this cream has lightened them!  </li>
            <li> If you will be using eye make up start out with just a little bit of the cream so you can see how it will interact with the make up&#x27;s staying</li>
            <li> Also I have very dark circles and nothing has ever helped before.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist did tell me I have a little bit of fat under my eyes that was causing the darkness that could be operated on, but it wasn&#x27;t worth it because it wasn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> The caffeine helped instantly relieve my tired eyes.</li>
            <li> The puffiness just started a few years ago and I can&#x27;t stand it.</li>
            <li> It took quite a few days for me to order</li>
            <li> Well it took a few days  of use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been having trouble sleeping and as a result was experiencing some puffiness and darkness around my eyes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I have a few criticisms too.</li>
            <li> I might try the unscented next time unless I get addicted to the coffee scent.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this cream.</li>
            <li> and it dissipates within a few minutes.</li>
            <li> and I have been using it for a few weeks now.  </li>
            <li> cannot recommend this product as it stands, and I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money buying the unscented version either.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few months</li>
            <li> Directions say to apply twice a day and give it a few weeks to work.</li>
            <li> I will be adding updates on how this is working, in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Bought this product because my eyes had a tired look and were starting to get puffy underneath.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months now</li>
            <li> I fear putting products on my face that may cause a breakout from harsh chemicals, comedogenic ingredients or even gluten.</li>
            <li> everyday, twice a day as the instruction and all the helpful reviews from the amazon customers.</li>
            <li> Wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Will write a follow up review in a few months.</li>
            <li> I had no more bags or dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I looked again at all the reviews because I was wondering if I was missing something.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Skin2Spirit&#x27;s Cucumber/Green Tea Eye Whip for a few years.  </li>
            <li> Results in reducing the lines begins working within a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update after I&#x27;ve used for a few weeks with results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June 24, 2013&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s been a few weeks now</li>
            <li> Within a few minutes all puffiness under my eyes is gone.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait a few weeks before giving my review to see if this helps.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several expensive eye treatments for dark circles and puffiness.</li>
            <li> but that usually goes away within a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Seems like dark circles,wrinkles and signs of aging are slowly desapearing.</li>
            <li> My bags were down by at least 65%.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed a serious diminishing of my dark circles.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to try this product for a few weeks before writing a review!  </li>
            <li> Rises above in a market of useless products.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure how well it would work just using it once a day.</li>
            <li> The first months of usage were terribly stinky, and left my skin so shiny with oil.</li>
            <li> But of course, I am not sure that I wanted any surgery and</li>
            <li> I was not pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I am not sure about all the glowing reviews....</li>
            <li> No irritation or rashes which has been a problem for me in the past.</li>
            <li> Not sure how it works</li>
            <li> and they keep getting less noticeable!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried tons of them for my dark circles and tired eyes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have bad dark circles but constantly search for hydration in an eye cream without a greasy feel.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to tell on that point.</li>
            <li> I can hardly stand to use it.</li>
            <li> and it is hard to tell the difference.  </li>
            <li> and I have been using this for at least 3 months now.  </li>
            <li> Mornings are not kind to the eyes.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product even though I read some of the negative reviews</li>
            <li> In all fairness this is a common problem for me with eye creams.  </li>
            <li> It has the consistency of a thick cream.</li>
            <li> cannot recommend this product as it stands, and I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money buying the unscented version either.hem look worse.</li>
            <li> The one issue with this product is the pump, but just being mindful while using and going slowly works.</li>
            <li> The whip is thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> but the cream was too thick.  </li>
            <li> I thought this was going to be the solution based on other reviews, but sadly, I&#x27;ll be moving on.</li>
            <li> have been without an eye cream, mainly because I hate drugstore brands.</li>
            <li> Seriously, give this stuff a try</li>
            <li> Seriously, give this stuff a try</li>
            <li> I put it on 3 or 4 times a day, seriously, just to smell it.</li>
            <li> Such a bad decision....</li>
            <li> but at least they are not getting worse...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a problem at night, but in the morning, it makes it very hard to apply eye makeup afterwards.</li>
            <li> Not only did it not help with puffiness and dark circles, it smells awful!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to start off by saying I was very naive when I was shopping for an eye cream.</li>
            <li> The moment I put it on my eyes, I felt a tingling and within 24 hours, the puffiness certainly decreased.  </li>
            <li> Poorly constructed bottle.</li>
            <li> It cost 1000 but after 5 months I still have no hollowness and tired eyes.  </li>
            <li> Instantly it decreased my puffines.</li>
            <li> I use it whenever I look tired.</li>
            <li> It perks my tired eyes up every morning.</li>
            <li> No matter how awake I felt my eyes always felt tired all day.</li>
            <li> It creates a sort of thin barrier around skin that seems to lock in the nutrients</li>
            <li> It wakes me up every day with the subtle scent of coffee!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a very hard time finding eye products that will help the puffiness under my eyes and unfortunately, this hasn&#x27;t helped in that regard either.  </li>
            <li> Not sure I can see any effects yet, but at 53 my eyes are not that bad.</li>
            <li> but this cream was a waste. :(</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, as I had never heard of the brand.</li>
            <li> I bought the coffee eye whip to help with the frightening puffiness and under eye bags</li>
            <li> I am not easily impressed</li>
            <li> and I have bought a TON of expensive skincare products - and NOTHING ever from the drug stores.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it did not work at all for me.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t contain a bunch of complicated chemicals whose names we can&#x27;t pronounce.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all levels as expensive as $175.  </li>
            <li> it might work for somebody, but so sad that it does not work with me, and it does not hurt to give this product a try because of the price and the service.</li>
            <li> So, unfortunately, for me, this is one star item.</li>
            <li> disappointing.</li>
            <li> Instead, I found myself distraught when I forgot it on my work</li>
            <li> When I wrote it,stating my disappointment, the owner immediately contacted me and offered me a replacement.</li>
            <li> At this price you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> But its not like you are reeking of coffee or anything, just a very faint smell.</li>
            <li> I also am highly doubtful of these reviews judging from the quality of this mediocre product and how it worked.  </li>
            <li> Spout broke within a week of purchase, then the product was almost impossible to get out.</li>
            <li> Get a filler or if you are really bad off an under eye lift you won&#x27;t be wasting your time.</li>
            <li> smell isn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> Bottom line is you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> You will NOT be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Needles to say, my eyes looked awful afterwards.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like this better than some over the counter eye cream, including Olay Regenerist or Laureal. Interesting caffeine ingredient seems working on my under eyes after 2-3 weeks. I just think it pumps out too much cream each time ( for an eye cream) and the vanilla/coffee smell is a little strong for my taste. But nice result.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  Smells fantastic, gentle on my skin &amp; it works!!  I was so surprised to experience the immediate benefits.</li>
            <li> I have been using the eye wipe for about two weeks.  Although the darks circles are not gone, they are lighter. i have purchased  the eye whip for both my mother and sister.  I will be seeing them in two weeks.  They both have extremely dark circles under their eyes.  They will be my proof whether or not this really works.</li>
            <li> I am half-way through my second bottle of this eye-cream, and came back to order more.  I have sensitive skin, and this all natural organic formula works wonderfully for me!  The consistency is just right, creamy but not greasy, with a light and yummy scent.  Like many of the previous reviewers, I have tried numerous eye creams--some of them 3 times more expensive, and this one is a keeper!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, as I had never heard of the brand. But, I&#x27;m now a believer! The whip is ultra moisturizing. My eye area still felt smooth and moisturized 1 whole day after i used it for the first time. Also, the smell is intoxicating - love it! I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I bought the coffee eye whip to help with the frightening puffiness and under eye bags I have and I&#x27;m starting to see real results. This stuff smells amazing and goes on nicely. I am very happy and will continue to do business with this seller. Thanks so much!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this along with the acne face wash, and you can read my review for that, as far as this product it didn&#x27;t do anything that it claims. There were no directions on how to use this product so I just worked it into my night routine. For the first week I added it in my routine at night by putting a light layer under my eyes. It smells like coffee, and I don&#x27;t drink nor do I really like coffee, but I let that go because my decision should be based on how efficient the product is, and here are my conclusions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) When I woke in the morning I touched under my eyes and the cream was still present as if it just stays on the surface of your skin; no matter how I rubbed it in the night before or the light layer I put on. The coffee smell was strong but that is all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) After being washed off I noticed no change in dark circles or fine lines. I am in my early 30s, and don&#x27;t really have any lines or wrinkles but it stated in the description on amazon that it was great for dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) After more than a week, my skin under the eyes looked exactly the same each night and no difference in appearance of dark circles or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I purchased it though, so I can warn others that it seems strange that there are so many positive reviews, because I would definitely like to see some before and after photos from these reviewers with a five star rating as proof. I would not recommend to anyone your money should be spent on another product or just using regular night cream or retinol moisturizer. This product made no difference on my eyes and none of the claims made in the description were true.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this product for a few weeks before writing a review!  This product is SO WORTHY of all the 5 stars it has received!  It is as amazing as everyone says! The moment I put it on my eyes, I felt a tingling and within 24 hours, the puffiness certainly decreased.  I have a new baby and a toddler at home and the lack of sleep was really showing.  My big concern was dark circles... and after a few weeks,  I can say they have definitely faded.  Even though I am not, I finally look a little more well-rested! :)  I am a journalist and used to cover the beauty industry.  I have tested every brand from L&#x27;oreal to La Mer... and I have never noticed much of a difference with any of them!  This product is the FIRST!  I am totally hooked!  I am now going to purchase a face cream.&lt;br /&gt;I should also add that Kathi is as fabulous as her products!  I reached out with a question and she was so quick to respond and even offered to customize a product for me.  Where can you get that?  I also love that the ingredients are all natural and organic... and the price point is affordable!  I would give it 10 stars if I could! :)</li>
            <li> I am a Cosmo junkie. I will recommend, and buy again. Great quality and price.i wish there was a day version with SPF.</li>
            <li> I think I was duped. Let me start off by saying I loved the packaging and the smell and after reading SO MANY positive reviews about an all natural eye cream that works I was super excited..... I&#x27;ve been duped. I don&#x27;t have genetic dark circles I suddenly developed them three months ago due to a new baby..., I&#x27;ve been using this product for close to a month religiously and not even a slight improvement in my dark circles . my husband has returned from war about to months ago so I&#x27;ve been able to get good sleep, nutrition, and exercise so what happened it doesn&#x27;t work... disappointing. I guess the search continues anyone have suggestions?</li>
            <li> It just didn&#x27;t work for me, whereas other products have.  I also found that it made my eyes water, and if I accidentally rubbed them, it caused my eyes to burn.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best eye cream ever!!! The first cream that actually helps to deflate my 40 year old puffy eyes.&lt;br /&gt;This is my choice for eye cream in my daily facial care routine.</li>
            <li> I am 54 years old, and while I already had wrinkles around my eyes before using this product, I believe that they are less pronounced now after a few months use. The skin around my eyes just feels fantastic and less puffy too. I adore the coffee smell, how easily absorbed and non-greasy this product is, and hope to be a lifelong eye whip customer!</li>
            <li> I love this eye whip very much, in fact this was my second time ordering on etsy.com. Give it a try it&#x27;s awesome ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> I bought this on the seller&#x27;s Etsy shop and I absolutely love it. I love the container pump, I love the heavenly coffee/vanilla smell, and I loved the smooth velvety feel. The caffeine helped instantly relieve my tired eyes. Once I am out I will definitely repurchase :) The best part is that is all natural!!</li>
            <li> I am on my 2nd bottle of this after trying numerous eye creams from different brands. My biggest concern was puffy eyes especially in the morning. This eye cream really works well to reduce the puffiness and moisturize the sensitive skin around the eyes. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a good quality, effective eye cream without spending too much $.</li>
            <li> So far I really love this eye cream. Does help a bit with debugging and feels/smells lovely. I use it before going to bed and first thing in the morning. Love the all-natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I ordered one bottle of this product from skin2spirit on Etsy. I had read about it in a magazine and it sounded like what I wanted. That 1st bottle was wonderful so I ordered 3 more. Love the fragrance and my eyes look better than before. Clever packaging, also. Thank You!</li>
            <li> Used it for 4 weeks. No difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product about a month &amp; looks like it&#x27;s working.  It might take a little longer because of my age.</li>
            <li> This cream is as moisturizing as the more expensive kind, and the caffeine seems to reduce the puffiness around my eyes.  I like that it&#x27;s got all sorts of herbs in it that are nourishing to my skin.  It has a mild coffee aroma to it, but it&#x27;s not unpleasant.  I&#x27;ll be buying it again!</li>
            <li> Does nothing at all for my under eye puffiness but the ingredients are the best and it has reduced the dry crinkly look and crows feet around my eyes.  Very moisturizing and has a mild tasty dessert-like odor.  I&#x27;m going to keep putting cucumbers on my eyes but will probably buy this again for its outstanding moisturizing properties.</li>
            <li> I guess at my age (46) I have become a little jaded with skin care products. The older I get the less effective they seem to be. I love Olay and Aveeno products and I still use them; however eye creams have been less effective over the years, I guess because of my age. It is harder to see results no matter what products I use. I haven&#x27;t seen success with my Olay eye cream last few years so I have used my Aveeno night cream which does make the skin feel really nice and moist it just doesn&#x27;t help with the puffiness and fine lines around the eyes. The puffiness just started a few years ago and I can&#x27;t stand it. Nothing seems to work.&lt;br /&gt;Well, since my Averno night cream is on back order, (yes, I know I can buy it at the store but I like the convenience of buying online,) I started looking for something else to help with the puffiness problem. I clicked the 4 and above stars filter and saw skin2spirit caffeine eye whip and had to look at all the reviews. It took quite a few days for me to order but I finally decided to give it a try. Well it took a few days  of use and I actually started noticing the fine lines looked better and my skin looked smoother. The puffiness was still there and I figured that is just what it is and I will always have that problem. I thought I would give it a few more weeks because I saw in one review where the owner said it could take some people a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;Well, happily, the last few days I have noticed that the puffiness is diminishing and the skin around my eyes seem much younger. I was thinking it was just in my head until two people this week told me how pretty my skin looked and that is amazing since I haven&#x27;t  had much sleep and I&#x27;m under stress. So I have to say I am very pleased with this product and will look at purchasing the cleanser and face moisturizer as well.</li>
            <li> Poorly constructed bottle. Spout broke within a week of purchase, then the product was almost impossible to get out. Didn&#x27;t do anything for my eyes, even after continuous use for two months. Guess it&#x27;s just coffee scented lotion.</li>
            <li> I recently had eye surgery. Once in my right eye and three times in my left eye. Needles to say, my eyes looked awful afterwards. I was looking for a product to help restore the skin around my eyes. They were dark, sagging eyelids and brow, new lines under the eye. Fortunately I found Skin2Spirit Caffeine Eye Whip. I&#x27;ve only used this whip for a short period and the results are amazing. My wife noticed a huge difference after a week. The results are so good she is using the product too. I&#x27;m a male user and I highly recommend this product for male and female customers. Try it, you&#x27;ll be surprised with the results and happy you did.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a new eye cream, and purchased this after reading the positive reviews. Unfortunately, this product comes in an overly-large container, that makes it difficult to dispense an amount appropriate for use in the eye area. I tried multiple times, but could never get a small enough quantity. This was an inconvenience, and also felt wasteful. Also, even though I applied it away from my actual eyes, it still melted/ran into my eyes, which stung. Finally, as mentioned by some other reviewers, this product has a VERY strong coffee smell, which doesn&#x27;t dissipate much over time. This was particularly problematic, as I used it both in the morning and evening, and at night, I actually had trouble sleeping because the coffee smell had a stimulative effect.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and the scent is beautiful when it goes on and does not linger....so think aroma therapy for a minute and then just let it soak into your skin.  It is much better than many of my other more expensive products!  I will be buying again!</li>
            <li> I bought this two months ago and used it every day. It may last another two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;It smells very sweet, like mocha. I dont know how to tell if it is effective or not for my eyes, but it is very smooth and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;I dont feel dry during the day time after i used it in the morning, even though i live in the desert area.&lt;br /&gt;As it stated all natural, it should be a good product overall. I like it. I may reorder another one after one week.</li>
            <li> This is my second order after finishing my first. As I was out of product for a short time, I&#x27;ve switched to another before the order arrives. I can already tell a difference in terms of smoothness and the degree it does on moisturizing. The smell does seem to be different than my first batch though, but it&#x27;s still nice. I will definitely keep using this.</li>
            <li> Rises above in a market of useless products. One of only three out of probably 50 products that actually reduces swelling to a degree that is even noticeable.</li>
            <li> Gets rid of all of the puffiness, and the dark circles.  It takes some time to work, so don&#x27;t give up.  When I finish this bottle, I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I received this promptly and it came with specific instructions as it is hand made.  It feels nice and my skin likes it.  I haven&#x27;t seen a big difference in my dark circles in the couple of weeks I&#x27;ve been using it, but I haven&#x27;t found any product that has made a real difference.  It has an interesting smell, kind of like a mocha frappaccino:)</li>
            <li> as a 53 year old I am on the continual search for eye creams to combat PUFFINESS and DARK CIRCLES and this is my new best friend!!!! Srsly. folks...go run and snatch this up. I have horrid circles and puffnstuff underneath my eyes...I tried it last night and noticed a slight dif but after my shower this morning I used this and holymoly....AMAZING for a fraction of the other eye promise keepers out there..... &#x3D;) ....LOVE</li>
            <li> I looked at all the reviews with good rates,and decided to buy two with no trial  (the price is not bad ),but it did not work  for me. It was an moisturizer for my eyes but it does NOT help with the puffiness and eye bag. I also did not like the smell of cookies or vanilla.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel!  Great product for a great price!  Only been using it a week and can already tell a difference.</li>
            <li> I have been ordering this eye cream from this lady for two years now. Love it! Put it on morning and night. It really helps. It works best twice a day. Just a very light amount, too much and you won&#x27;t rub it in well. Fantastic sweet lady to work with!</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a good organic line of products...I found it.&lt;br /&gt;Gentle products that smell yummy.  I am going to try the moisturizer and&lt;br /&gt;body mousse next.</li>
            <li> It is decent moisturizer and the ingredients are good but it did nothing for puffiness or dark circles.  I guess the only thing to get rid of these suckers is plastic surgery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I ended up getting restalyne injections under my eyes.  It cost 1000 but after 5 months I still have no hollowness and tired eyes.  Tried everything and nothing worked from creams to exercises.  Get a filler or if you are really bad off an under eye lift you won&#x27;t be wasting your time.</li>
            <li> I love this product I saw instant results. I brought this product bc I read the positive reviews on how effective it is,  I&#x27;m so happy i took a chance an ordered this product. This is my new eye whip forever, I&#x27;m even in the process of buying 2 more bottles. The bottle type is very pretty easy to use, shipment was quick. When I received it at work I was so happy I couldn&#x27;t believe it came so quick. Thanks for making a prefect an affordable eye cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been having trouble sleeping and as a result was experiencing some puffiness and darkness around my eyes. I decided to give this \\&quot;Eye Whip\\&quot; a try because of its all-natural ingredients. For me it took a few days of twice-a-day applications to notice any difference, but after about a week the puffiness around my eyes had subsided greatly, and generally the skin in that area began to look a lot softer and brighter. After three weeks I&#x27;ve also noticed some reduction in under-eye darkness, too, though it hasn&#x27;t gotten rid of it completely (I wasn&#x27;t really expecting it to -- only concealer can do that). It&#x27;s also nice because I only use a tiny dollop of cream for both eyes, so I think the can will go a long way. So that&#x27;s all good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I have a few criticisms too. The first few times I applied the cream it felt kind of burn-y around my eyes; the sensation went away after a few days, but it was off-putting initially. Also, the cream&#x27;s a bit greasy and takes a LOT of rubbing to work into my skin, even just a dollop: after the first week I stopped using it in the morning because it left my skin shiny for half of the day. It also definitely has a distinctive coffee/mocha smell -- I&#x27;ve grown to enjoy it, but I could see it being a bit strong for some people (the good news there is that there&#x27;s an unscented version available from the seller&#x27;s store, which is cool).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final verdict: Overall this is a good, rejuvenating eye cream, and the price is definitely right for the amount of product you receive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE 1**&lt;br /&gt;I have now been using this eye cream for about two months, and I have to say, I&#x27;ve grown to like it more and more. The skin around my eyes has never been softer, and if I forget to put the cream on at night, I definitely notice it the next day because my eyes look a lot puffier and tired. There&#x27;s still some darkness under my eyes, but overall it has definitely become less prominent. Thumbs way up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE 2**&lt;br /&gt;Remember how I said a little of this stuff goes a long way? Using this stuff daily I JUST ran out of my first bottle nine months to the day after I bought it. For less than $20 per bottle, that is a fantastic deal! Additionally, I have really grown to love this stuff over time. Daily use has made the skin around my eyes MUCH brighter and softer, and I have virtually no dark circles anymore despite hardly ever getting enough sleep. I have also started spreading a little cream on my forehead, which I think has improved the skin there, too. I am so pleased with this stuff, in fact, that I bumped my original review from 4 to 5 stars. Seriously, give this stuff a try -- it&#x27;s a great investment!/&gt;Remember how I said a little of this stuff goes a long way?

            <li> Two problems. 1. It asks you to use a half of pump every time you apply. It sounds straightforward, but it is not so easy to do in real life. I could never get the same amount each time. 2. It left a really greasy feeling even with a lil amount. It&#x27;s not a problem at night, but in the morning, it makes it very hard to apply eye makeup afterwards. I don&#x27;t know how the person who answered Q&amp;a did it, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I cannot speak for the effectiveness, since it says that the product takes up to 30 days to show its work, and I didn&#x27;t use it for 30 days consecutively, especially because of problem #2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.s. I was going to leave a three star review, but after reading some other reviews, I sensed there might be fishiness in some of the five-star reviews, so I figured I should balance it out</li>
            <li> This product smells SO GOOD.  I have sensitive skin around my eyes, and so far, it&#x27;s been absolutely fine.  It leaves my skin feeling super soft.</li>
            <li> I am a 37 year old woman and I have been using this for at least 3 months now.  I have noticed some difference in the wrinkles around my eye, and reduced puffiness, but nothing major.  I do like how light and smooth it is when you apply the product.  When I first started using it my eyelid would itch a little and it also stung when it got in my eyes.  It no longer does.&lt;br /&gt; I will continue to use this for now.</li>
            <li> I will soon be 50 and I have had dark circles for as long as I can remember.  Even as a child, I had them.  And so does my Mom.  I rec&#x27;d a sample of the Eye Whip.  It was love at first smell.  I do not like coffee or the smell.  But this eye whip smells so good.  I use it more then twice a day.  And I can tell they are getting lighter.  I think I will always have them.  But this product is making them seem lighter.  And the smell.  I will be using this for the rest of my life.  And Kathi is so nice and so willing to help you.  I would tell anyone, yes go to Kathi&#x27;s site.&lt;br /&gt;And get you some of this eye whip.  Even if your dark circles aren&#x27;t so bad, the whip makes the skin around your eyes feel great.  Cool and refreshed, alive.  Thank you again Kathi, and I will be back to buy some more.</li>
            <li> It works well with my dark circle under my eyes, it takes a few weeks to see the result.  It is a good product for the price, will recommend people to buy it.</li>
            <li> Smells so good,feels good and worth the money. Seems like dark circles,wrinkles and signs of aging are slowly desapearing.Will recomend.</li>
            <li> I bought this and received it the next day. The smell is distinct (It smells like a mild mocha coffee)however it is not obnoxious. The consistency is gel-like and very smooth. The bottle has a pump (which I read is designed to make sure you get every last drop). A little really does go a long way so I only use 1/2 pump for BOTH eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using this product for 3 days and I swear to you not, I can see the results. Instantly it decreased my puffines. I mean INSTANTLY. However, the reason, I purchased this product was not for my \\&quot;bags\\&quot; but because I have serious dark circles and fine lines. I have not yet noticed a difference with the darkness around my eyes but I have noticed a slight improvement with my fine lines but again, it&#x27;s only been 3 days. I will post another review after 30 days and possibly pictures to show differences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The icing on the cake is that after my purchase, I received an email from the owner of this brand telling me thank you and giving helpful instructions and tips! WOW. This product has definitely become a staple in my regimen. All natural, inexpensive, great customer service, and IT WORKS!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this religiously for the past couple of years.  I really like the caffeine effect of this and has actually made the puffiness under my eyes virtually disappear in a couple of weeks.  I think the price is a bargain compared to other creams and personally, it&#x27;s the only one that worked for me - and I&#x27;ve tried many eye creams over my life.  Being made of natural ingredients means a &#x27;skin reaction&#x27; issue is almost nonexistent - especially if you get the one without fragrance.  I&#x27;ve also used them both.  I will continue to use this first because it actually works - and secondly because it&#x27;s a great price.  For those of you who it didn&#x27;t work for, I didn&#x27;t take this to be a strict &#x27;eye firming cream&#x27; (which I think is different); it gets rid of puffiness due to liquid being held under your eyes causing puffiness (product works by it&#x27;s caffeine content).  I think that for &#x27;that kind of puffiness&#x27;, it works great and actually other &#x27;tightening creams&#x27; would not work for this kind of problem.  Sometimes eyes look puffy because of lax skin - which many times can only be repaired with surgery or some kind of &#x27;filler&#x27;.  Sometimes a tightener will temporarily work - but it will never solve the problem.</li>
            <li> I bought this eye cream for dark circles. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see dramatic results, but it does make my eyes feel silky smooth. The coffee smell is quite strong but disappears quite quickly. The smell is not bad if you like coffee and a little of the product goes a long way. I will buy this product again even if the dark circles don&#x27;t go away because I think it is a great eye moisturizer. I have sensitive eyes but this doesn&#x27;t really bother them. I might try the unscented next time unless I get addicted to the coffee scent. I have tried more expensive creams and they have not been any better than this product and some left my eyes stinging. This product is worth a try especially because of the price and how soft the skin around your eyes will feel.</li>
            <li> I have been super pleased with this eye care product. It&#x27;s the end of September and I still have some. I use it every morning and evening. I love the smell, texture and how quickly it absorbs. I loved this so much I ordered several other products that I am just as pleased with!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am not easily impressed and I have bought a TON of expensive skincare products - and NOTHING ever from the drug stores.  It does have a strong smell of coffee or a latte which bothered me at first because I don&#x27;t really like coffee.  But the results were too amazing to let the coffee smell deter me from using it.  I even put it around my mouth and in between my eyebrows and my wrinkles are plumping out and they keep getting less noticeable!!  I don&#x27;t even notice the smell anymore.  It is a clean smell.  The seller is amazing too!  YOU CANNOT FIND A BETTER EYE CREAM AT A BETTER OR EVEN LOWER PRICE!!  And it is not a small .5 ounce bottle like most others are!  Buy it, you will love it.</li>
            <li> I will start by saying that I am 25 years old, I do not have puffiness, nor do I have dark circles. HOWEVER, I began using eye creams when I was 21, just as a preventative for wrinkles (I have an older mother - she warned me of being preemptive!). SO - I have used many different eye creams since then - this one is my favorite, by far. I waited until I had used it for over a month before I reviewed it, in case I didn&#x27;t like it in the long-run. Instead, I found myself distraught when I forgot it on my work trip!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what I love about this product:&lt;br /&gt;1. The smell - first thing you notice. I don&#x27;t drink much coffee and I do not like coffee flavored icecream/food, so I was surprised how much I loved that coffee scent.&lt;br /&gt;2. When I wake up there&#x27;s no \\&quot;residue\\&quot; like some eye creams leave.. like a film or crusty from it drying, where you feel like you need to clean around your eyes - none of that.&lt;br /&gt;3. My eyes feel smooth, rejuvenated, and fresh - I&#x27;m assuming this is due to the caffeine.&lt;br /&gt;4. I like natural products where you don&#x27;t have to worry about what is in it.&lt;br /&gt;5. I love the concept of the bottle - it really helps you use every last drop.&lt;br /&gt;6. 1 oz - carry-on approved!&lt;br /&gt;7. Great customer service, thus far. Granted, I only messaged to ask some questions, but Kathi replied promptly, kindly, honestly, and with the information I requested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait to give this as a gift :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been bothered by under eye puffiness for many years and I&#x27;ve used a lot of eye creams but this one does it for me.&lt;br /&gt;I realize that not everything works for everybody but if you haven&#x27;t tried it, please do.  It&#x27;s hydrating, creamy, and absorbs within a matter of minutes.  I saw a reduction of puffiness within 2 days and I&#x27;m not that young so this cream had some work to do!  It also seems to work rather well on the upper eyelid area.  It does smell like a wonderful cup of coffee and I know some don&#x27;t care for the fragrance but it does disappear after a bit.  I&#x27;ve tried eye creams with the peptide that is supposed to reduce puffiness and other eye creams that contain caffeine but this one is far superior for me.  Give it a try!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to start off by saying I was very naive when I was shopping for an eye cream. Searching eye creams to treat fine lines on Amazon, I came across this product and I was carried away by its apparent high rating by its users. Such a bad decision....&lt;br /&gt;This cream has done nothing except grease up my eye-area and cause irritation and discomfort after applying. Initially, I thought this pain was just part of the treatment; I used the product religiously over two months and I had even my friends try it often to see the results. Nothing. No change whatsoever. This is just a scented cream and not only did it not work for me (AND my buddies, just to let you guys know this isn&#x27;t a one-off case), but it also caused a lot of discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;The smell isn&#x27;t bad but it&#x27;s very very strong. I expected more from a product that set me back $20. Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this cream. Whatever &amp;#34;testing&amp;#34; the makers have done on this product is a probable hoax as I did my research and did not find any hint of confirmed testing for this product.&lt;br /&gt;I seriously don&#x27;t understand how this product has such high reviews but I suspect there have been a lot of false/unverified reviews. No way in hell this cream is rated higher than industry-leading creams made my estee lauder, olay, dr. brandt and so forth (many of those products top off at just 4 stars and they do a MUCH BETTER job....I&#x27;ve tried more than a dozen of them so far).&lt;br /&gt;So far after two months, my fine lines haven&#x27;t budged a bit and I feel I&#x27;ve wasted enough time on this product. Wish I had done some actual research before buying this.</li>
            <li> ...and already I saw the dark circles lighten. Like the seller wrote, it varies from person to person and can take up to 90 days to see results. I have very light sensitive skin and saw results quickly. A friend even commented how &amp;#34;well rested&amp;#34; I looked! It&#x27;s this cream!&lt;br /&gt;It soaks in fairly well. Most eye creams I can&#x27;t use during the day because my makeup will smudge but not with this one.&lt;br /&gt;There is a smell resembling coffee but it fades in a couple of hours. It isn&#x27;t a bad smell but pretty strong. If you&#x27;re opposed to it you could always just use the cream at night but I&#x27;m not sure how well it would work just using it once a day.</li>
            <li> This product smells good and that is about it.&lt;br /&gt;Has not helped my circles, puffiness, etc.  Goes&lt;br /&gt;on good that is it.  Would not recommend to&lt;br /&gt;my friends.</li>
            <li> Love this product and the way it smells.  It goes on very smooth and feels great!  The ingredients listed I don&#x27;t mind putting on my eyes.  My eyes are sensitive and I have not had any problem putting this all around my eyes.  Looking forward to trying to more of her organic products.</li>
            <li> I use this daily for hydration to my eyes. I wear a ton of eye makeup so when I take it off, I really need it. This stuff never irritates my eyes and provides immediate relief to my dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only that, during allergy season, I had some pretty bad irritation and this soothed my eye area almost instantly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: New bottle which was sent was not full all the way which has resulted in me not getting the product out of the bottle for use. Skin2Spirit please replace and I will change the review back to 5 stars.</li>
            <li> First there is no miracle cr&amp;egrave;me that will get rid of dark circles you would be crazy to believe by purchasing this you will magically be relieved of them. I am getting ready to order my 2nd bottle because it does lessen the darkness and with in 10 seconds I don&#x27;t look like I just woke up. It feels wonderful and does tighten up those 1st morning bags that sometimes come about by either allergies, no sleep or over indulging...:) It did smell like coffee but not too much and it dissipates within a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for nearly 3 months now, and although it&#x27;s so hard to tell with these types of things, I think it may be working to fade my dark circles a tiny bit. I don&#x27;t have much puffiness so it&#x27;s hard to tell on that point. I DO know that it helps my eyes feel more awake and moisturized while I&#x27;m wearing it, and works well under makeup. And the smell - oh my gosh, it is just so delicious. Like, I want to eat it. It smells like one of those 800-calorie Starbucks Mocha Frappuccinos or something. I put it on 3 or 4 times a day, seriously, just to smell it. And I&#x27;m only through about 2/3s of the bottle, so that&#x27;s good too. If I used twice a day as directed I might be able to get 6 months out of a bottle!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  Since I have been using it I have definelty noticed a difference.  I have hereditary dark circles and this cream has lightened them!  It smells amazing and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product and it really works...I work late nights and this visibly diminishes puffiness, I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love the eye whip. I always had trouble with other products but it always sting my eyes. This one is so wonderful. Smells great, hydrates, and soothes my eye areas. Please keep this product!!</li>
            <li> I just received my shipment of my caffeine eye whip and I love it!! i automatically put it on my eyes and saw my eye&lt;br /&gt;puffiness and dark circles suddenly disappear! this product truly is a miracle! but if your sensitive order her sensitive version!</li>
            <li> I came across this eye cream while doing searching on amazon for natural eye creams and I am so glad I found this one.  It has the lovely aroma of coffee which I LOVE, I am usually sensitive to anything with scents especially around my eye area but this eye cream doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes, I just have to make sure not to over do it which is hard because it smells so wonderful and it so creamy that I&#x27;m always tempted to put more then I need.  I use it at night time and during the day time and it sinks in very well and when I wear it during the day it is fine under my normal under eye concealer, I have not had any issues either am or pm and I have been using it for a few weeks now.  What&#x27;s great about this product is that it is homemade by an actual person which is comforting.</li>
            <li> UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I gave this product one extra star because it has lasted me for 6 months, and I think I still have a month left in the bottle. I won&#x27;t be buying it again, but feel like I should hand out another star simply because this product lasts such A LONG TIME. My usage averages twice a day, using a partial (mini) pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing: I believe my bottle wasn&#x27;t properly mixed or stirred or something. The first months of usage were terribly stinky, and left my skin so shiny with oil. Later in the bottle, the smell has eased up and I&#x27;m getting more of a matte look. Goodness knows what&#x27;s going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record, my lines haven&#x27;t improved and the darkness around my eyes is the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Skin2Spirit eye whip for a while now, as per the directions, waiting and waiting for improvement. Every time I apply it, I increasingly dislike it. The smell is strong and unpleasant, cloyingly sweet like coffee syrup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin2Spirit Eye Whip comes in a pump that pumps out too much; I try to do a half pump and am occasionally successful in getting out the right amount. It has the consistency of a thick cream. It feels like it absorbs, however, it leaves an oily sheen wherever you&#x27;ve applied it. I can see the line of where my eye whip ends and my facial lotion begins, as my facial lotion is oil-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This eye whip reeks so much my family has commented to me at different times why I &#x27;stink&#x27; like ice cream, or coffee, or candy. Keep in mind, these comments come long after I&#x27;ve applied it, after it&#x27;s dried. To me, it smells like coffee ice cream that&#x27;s been baking in the sun all day: very sweet, cloying, pungent. Also, when I dry my hair with a hair dryer, the scent becomes strong again--heat activated--to my dismay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My discoloration and fine lines have NOT improved with continuous use. I feel like my fine lines are actually worsening with use of this product, or else the oily sheen makes them look worse. My dark circles haven&#x27;t lightened one iota.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I don&#x27;t like about the product is that after I purchased it, I received an email from the owner, Kat, asking me (in other words) to give it 5 stars OR contact her to fix whatever problem I have with the eye whip. And what she really means is \\&quot;pay for more of my products\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also read these long passages she&#x27;s written, commenting on other people&#x27;s reviews. I find her involvement in reviews unprofessional, as it comes across as her wanting to control reviews. Honest reviews can improve products because it gives companies feedback, without having to pay focus groups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kat also claims this eye whip works on \\&quot;99 out of 100\\&quot; people. Yeah, right. There is absolutely no science backing up this claim. I&#x27;ve worked in skin studies and NO company can honestly make this claim. I wish Kat would just tout the indisputable positives of the product: cruelty-free, vegan, entirely natural, paraben free, etc. instead of making more outlandish claims that aren&#x27;t fact based.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend this product as it stands, and I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money buying the unscented version either.hem look worse.

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for around six weeks. What can I say? It&#x27;s terrific I was developing some under eye bags that bothered me a ton. I know that we ca not do anything against mother nature and time, but this whip helped me with my looks. After 4 weeks I started to notice some improvements and now I can see a big difference. I took some pictures before using the product, and you can tell how much my skin changed. I am also happy that is organic and handmade.  The smell is like a coffee milkshake, yummy! The shipping was super fast, it took only 3 days. I am looking forward to keep using this line of products. Thanks for the good work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;******EdiT****** I received my new bottle last week (11.28.13) and Kathi (the seller) have told me that she changed a bit the formula. The whip is still nice to the touch but the smell is weaker, not as stronger as used to be. Which I think is ok, because some people were complaining about it. In any case I am hooked with this product.</li>
            <li> i really like this product.  i just turned 60 and want to take special care of my eye area.  my eyes tend to get a little puffy in the mornings or if i don&#x27;t get enough sleep and this takes it away.</li>
            <li> This company is amazing. I only get my moisturizers and deodorant from them! This specific product smells so yummy and has reduced puffiness significantly under my eyes. I do not have many wrinkles yet because I am young, but I do notice more elasticity in my skin.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it did not work at all for me. Maybe it did for some. There are so many positive reviews so it must be working for someone.Bought in mid-November so I certainly gave it enough time.</li>
            <li> The eye whip is very soothing.  I like it&#x27;s creamy texture. It really does help to lighten up the eyes.</li>
            <li> Great scent and cooling sensation when applied. Still testing it out but thus far, really like this product. Feels great on skin surrounding eyes especially when skin is tired at day&#x27;s end and morning start. Would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I am returning this product. Although I believe it is a good value and contains many natural organic ingredients, the coffee scent is overpowering to me, especially at bedtime.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream a couple years now. Now I applaud them for the clever top that makes it so easy and no waste!</li>
            <li> Firstly, excellent shipping and customer service! It came super fast and packaged well.&lt;br /&gt;Next up, smell. It isn&#x27;t over poweringly sweet or coffee scented, I was a tad worried after reading reviews that some weirdo would mistake my face for a snack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been without an eye cream, mainly because I hate drugstore brands. I was searching for something more natural and straightforward, ingredients I know of and can pronounce. This seemed to fit the bill. So, last night before bed, I put some on and my eyes gave a big sigh of relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Felt a little tingle (not sure why, but it was fine) and it absorbed fast. I use emu oil on top of my face products, it helps push them in and emu oil is the closest oil to our own natural oil. I will update in a couple weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, a week later (1/10/14) and I&#x27;m happily impressed! The puffiness has decreased greatly, fine lines seem unchanged though. It has only been a week, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting vast changes. I&#x27;ll check back in a month, SO EXCITED :)</li>
            <li> Cannot stand the smell.  Who wants to smell like that in the face...... I do not see much improvement either.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is pretty good.  I like the constancy, smell (much more coffee then vanilla that other customers reported) and absorbency.  I haven&#x27;t seen a massive change in my under eyes, but will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> A bit skeptical at first but it does work.  I still have a little puffiness especially around one eye but it does reduce the puffiness.  It also is great for the dark circles.  At this price you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe all the claims made for creams, lotions, moisturizers. Price is no indication of how any product will work. Many drugstore beauty products perform better than pricey department store or dermatology website preparations. This is neither a pricey product nor a drugstore mass-produced cream.&lt;br /&gt;It does however moisturize the delicate eye area well without having been tested on the eyes of innocent rabbits, cats, or dogs. It doesn&#x27;t contain a bunch of complicated chemicals whose names we can&#x27;t pronounce. It smells like coffee, or should I say the candy called \\&quot;Coffee Nibs.\\&quot; If you love coffee, that&#x27;s an added little bonus. If you don&#x27;t like the smell of coffee, you might not like this cream, but the smell dissipates very quickly. I have very sensitive, dry eyes for which I use prescription eye drops. Many eye creams I&#x27;ve used in the past sting or burn or irritate my eyes. This cream does not burn or otherwise irritate. The skin around my eyes looks and feels better after two weeks use. The seller contacted me even before the product arrived to let me know how to use the pump should I have any problems with it. (None so far.) She urged me to contact her if the severe heat being experienced in the east affected the product in transit. (Product arrived in perfect condition.) So, try it if you want an eye cream that smells like a Starbucks Store and moisturizes your eye area, at the same time supporting a small female business owner.</li>
            <li> I love this and the way it smells</li>
            <li> I got this eye whip cream and immediately put some on. I wanted to lick it off my own eye balls, so luscious is the aroma, like a little chocolate frappe whip!! Seriously is is good enough smelling to eat out of the bottle!! Its only been a couple of weeks since I started using this, and I can&#x27;t yet tell a difference but it does warn you that it could take up to 6 weeks to see a difference. It stays moist a long time on the skin, which is a great thing. So far, it has not bothered my contact lens, which is very important to me. If it works and makes my eyes less puffy in the morning I will order more!!</li>
            <li> As many have said, the smell of this lotion is amazing! I have been using it for a few months and it is very hydrating and leaves my skin looking very nice with less puffiness and some reduction in lines/wrinkles. It also has not clogged my pores and is not oily. The one issue with this product is the pump, but just being mindful while using and going slowly works. Very nice product which I will be purchasing again. It&#x27;s also a plus to support a small American business so I am glad I found it and definitely recommend it to others!</li>
            <li> Has gotten rid of my crows feet. Smells great. Buying more right now. Ran out quickly, but I probably used too much.</li>
            <li> The smell is just wonderful, if you love coffee, that is. The whip is thick and creamy. Pat it on and keep patting until it soaks in. Directions say to apply twice a day and give it a few weeks to work. Of course caffeine in cold green tea bags works wonders for your eye bags and dark circles, so I expect this to also do nice things for my eyes. The most important feature of this product is that the ingredients are organic and contain nothing &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34;.  The ingredients list is impressive! Some of the ingredients are: aloe, coconut oil, hyaluronic acid, green tea, cucumber, acai, blueberry, noni, goji, mangosteen, and many more good things. There is nothing else on the market like this product, and the seller is very nice to deal with. I will be adding updates on how this is working, in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Bought this product because my eyes had a tired look and were starting to get puffy underneath. I have no wrinkles or crows feet issues but I do have some under eye circles. The first thing you notice about the whip is the smell. It has a strong but pleasant coffee scent, which is ok if you are a coffee lover, and don&#x27;t mind the scent. The scent doesn&#x27;t bother me but I can see why some people might be turn off by it. I&#x27;ve read in other post though that there is a way to get an unscented version. The whip is a very creamy consistency and a little goes a long way so use is sparely. It has worked wonders for the puffiness around my eyes, but I have seen little difference with the dark circles, maybe it takes longer use to see results. In all I am impressed with this product and would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s and I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months now and I can definitely tell the difference.  The puffiness under my eyes is down considerably.  I also noticed that the wrinkles around my eyes have been significantly reduced.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice smelling and soothing eye whip that has worked very well for me. The whip goes on smoothly and feels great and helps with the allergy swelling that I get around the eyes. I have very sensitive skin and I&#x27;m always worried about a reaction with any new products, but this is an all natural product that when you put it on, you can even smell the caffeine. It&#x27;s a great product and I highly recommend it for puffy, swollen, and sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> I really love this eye cream because it&#x27;s just rich enough that the outside of my eye areas stays hydrated for hours not just absorbs in seconds and it&#x27;s gone.  I&#x27;ve been using eye creams religiously since I was in my 2o&#x27;s and I&#x27;m 50 now.  I&#x27;ve used all levels as expensive as $175.  I don&#x27;t have bad dark circles but constantly search for hydration in an eye cream without a greasy feel.  This does that!  I also send a sample to a high maintenance friend whose been using it without knowledge of what it was and really likes it to.  No burning or itchy if gets in her eyes which has been a problem for her in the past, makes sense with it&#x27;s all natural ingredients. Great price is a bonus of the lovely eye cream.</li>
            <li> I love how this cream feels around my eyes! I read another review that said they did not like coffee, but loved the smell of this stuff and I am the same way. I do not like coffee or the smell of it, but this stuff smells dreamy. Not sure I can see any effects yet, but at 53 my eyes are not that bad. The scent &amp; feel make me happy, so that alone should improve the look of my eyes :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it and have already reordered.</li>
            <li> This smells great, but unfortunately, that&#x27;s about it.  I&#x27;ve been using this for six months and have not seen any improvement in the dark circles under my eyes.  I thought this was going to be the solution based on other reviews, but sadly, I&#x27;ll be moving on.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone and gluten sensitive skin. I fear putting products on my face that may cause a breakout from harsh chemicals, comedogenic ingredients or even gluten. The natural and organic caffeine whip is not only effective at keeping crows feet at bay, it also does not irritate my skin or eyes. Oh and the smell is so enjoyable, edging on addictive.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00B1IV2A2 Skin2Spirit Caffeine Eye Whip]]With so many eye creams on the market, it is difficult to find the one that works best for you. Mornings are not kind to the eyes.  Most of us awake with puffiness. The moment I opened the jar of S2S Caffeine Eye Whip, inhaled the delicious aroma, and I patted it around my eyes, I knew I had finally found the one for me.  I use it whenever I look tired. It perks my eyes up immediately and is not greasy.  I have recommended to friends and now let me recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to using this product. I have been using it for about a month and haven&#x27;t seen any changes--though according to the bottle that hasn&#x27;t been long enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the only thing that has happened is that after applying the cream, it often gets very red under my eyes. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m allergic to something in the cream :( but I have no idea how to tell which ingredient it is.</li>
            <li> Great product. Only con is that it does take a little bit of time for it to completely absorb into skin. Love that the product is organic and full of fantastic ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month so i think it&#x27;s not enough time to see the full results.&lt;br /&gt;But I really like the smell of the cream,  like coffee and other stuff. The skin around my eyes has some wrinkles, the normal amount i think; im 24 years so I would really like to diminish the aging effects, maybe the wrinkles have reduced, i would like to wait and see what happens.</li>
            <li> Great smell, but my eyes are still puffy.</li>
            <li> I have finished my first bottle of this.  And I bought this around Thanksgiving, so I probably owed a positive review a lot longer ago than this.  A little goes a long way, and this is VALUE.  I have had noticeable results with the fine lines around my eyes with this product, without the sting of chemicals that you get from other products. The fragrance is so wonderful, too.  The price is so reasonable even compared with drug store eye creams.  Thank you!  I am forever a customer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used eye products for 20 years and I found it just OK, but my husband is using it as his first eye cream and really likes it.  Neither of us noticed any off-putting smell and it absorbs quickly.  I&#x27;m just a little older and need a bit more help ;)</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this products, but it does not reduce eye puffiness.  However, the scent is great and I will use it until it is used up mainly because I enjoy the scent.</li>
            <li> i give 2 stars even it doesn&#x27;t help me anything at all. i have used this whip cream for my bags under eye area since september 16th 2013 everyday, twice a day as the instruction and all the helpful reviews from the amazon customers. it doesn&#x27;t help anything truthfully. it might work for somebody, but so sad that it does not work with me, and it does not hurt to give this product a try because of the price and the service. thank you.</li>
            <li> I really like this eye cream it has brightened my dark circles and the coffee and cream scent smells so good .its like a whipped desert for your eyes. I wish there was a face cream with coffee bean in it . The texture is, creamy and smooth . It absorbs fast and it lays nice under makeup .</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used to help with dark circles and bags under my eyes. This is my second time to purchase this product from Amazon; and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an eye cream that actually works and is a really good price.</li>
            <li> I bought this product even though I read some of the negative reviews and I have to say I&#x27;m glad I did. I&#x27;m now on my second bottle and I will continue to purchase this product. If your looking for a miracle, there is no such thing, but if your looking for a great eye cream, this ranks with some of the tops. I personally love the coffee smell, which I noticed on my second purchase is less potent of a smell, but I still love it anyway. It makes my eyes brighter and softer and it is not greasy, which I love. I highly recommend trying this product. If it&#x27;s not for you it&#x27;s not for you, but it seems to work well for a larger number of people then not and it&#x27;s very reasonably priced to boot!</li>
            <li> I really do love this eye cream.  I&#x27;ll look for the unscented version next time, just my preference.  I don&#x27;t have a big problem with the fragrance, I just tend to avoid them in general.  As with all eye creams, this works best when it&#x27;s applied correctly - massaging it into the skin from the inner eye out towards the cheek bone to help get rid of accumulated fluids.  I definitely get a better result with this cream than with others.  I always appreciate Organic, but home made and supports a small independent business is a bonus.</li>
            <li> If I could curse on amazon, I would be doing so while reviewing this product. All I can say is that the many 5 star reviews this product has is a scam. This whip did absolutely nothing for me. I used as directed and did so for over 6 months. Not a single thing changed on my face. Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have been using the caffeine eye whip for about a year.  I absolutely love the consistency and texture.  It is like whip cream for your eyes.  It is soothing and hydrating and keeps my under eye area smooth all day long.  It does not give you that tight eye feeling like some eye creams do.  Also, the smell is divine.  It wakes me up every day with the subtle scent of coffee!  The ingredients are top notch and the customer service is awesome!  The price is outstanding for an organic product with high quality ingredients.  I ran out recently and did not like the way my eyes looked or felt without it!</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast shipping! Thank you! A+</li>
            <li> The smell is WAY to strong for my tastes. I can hardly stand to use it. Despite the smell, I have been trying to use it and haven&#x27;t seen any results that make me think this is a fantastic product. So, unfortunately, for me, this is one star item. I&#x27;ve purchased another eye cream to replace it and it will be thrown away.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff  ordered it on etsy. everything kathi makes is great have sensitive eyes does not irritate smells good also. the carrot face cream is great also. love the grapefruit face wash. must buy for ladies i get so many compliments on my skin. thank you kathi! etsy</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  Smells great, creamy, moisturizing, and not greasy at all. I also love that it has so many organic/wild-crafted superfoods and green tea! Such a rare find!&lt;br /&gt;Miriam&lt;br /&gt;Health freak and blogger at [...]</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to really notice any difference. It smells really good and has caffeine in it which was what I was looking for. Pumps out too much so I put it in a contact lense holder case.</li>
            <li> I purchased Skin2Spirit Caffeine Eye Whip from the Etsy store.  It arrived almost immediately and was well packaged.  I have ultra sensitive, pale skin so I have to be incredibly careful about what I put on my face, especially my eye area.  This cream has been great and has a nice lifting effect on my morning face. I have been using it for over two month nows and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The cream is Ok. I like the texture and the smell but other than that, Ive been using this for 2 months now before bed and I will discontinue using because I never saw any differences under my eyes at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a very hard time finding eye products that will help the puffiness under my eyes and unfortunately, this hasn&#x27;t helped in that regard either.  I do love the smell and feel of this product though, and I will enjoy using it until it&#x27;s gone!  Then I&#x27;ll continue on my hunt.</li>
            <li> I liked the cream but it does not have a pump. I could not use it all. Wasted my money.</li>
            <li> A combination of chocolate &amp; coffee--it absorbs very nicely (I apply it immediately after showering-it absorbs by the time I apply my body lotion),  I have hereditary dark circles so...it&#x27;s not a miracle cure but it does sooth the eyes and decrease puffiness.  As a bonus--my goodness does this stuff smell good.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it a week now and feel I&#x27;ll be purchasing again when it&#x27;s near the end.</li>
            <li> I like this eye cream a lot. I have never believe in advertisement, only in result and ingredients. From this cream I can really see the result.</li>
            <li> This is a really great product and the best part is it works!!! My eyes are soft and the dark circles are gone. I also purchased this product formy mom and without me saying anything to her, she told me that the &amp;#34;bags&amp;#34; under her eyes are gone. Bottom line is you won&#x27;t be disappointed. Also had a good experience with the seller, she is supper nice and really takes pride in her product. It&#x27;s all natural and smells great too. You will NOT be disappointed. Will write a follow up review in a few months.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from dark, swollen bags under my eyes for most of my life no matter how great my night&#x27;s sleep was.I felt self conscious and looked tired most of the time :-(. I tried so many different things (even Preparation-H!) but nothing worked very well or consistently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I FINALLY found something that really works! I have to admit that sometimes it makes the skin under my eyes bright red but that usually goes away within a few minutes. Other than that, it&#x27;s incredible! I am so grateful I found the cure to my problem and it is an all natural, organic product. My only fear is that I may run out too soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the owner Kathi is great. She reached out to me once I placed my order to thank me and ask how I found the product. I&#x27;ve never had such personable service on Amazon, very impressive.</li>
            <li> The bottle of cream that i was sent had no tube leading from the pump to the eye cream, so it couldn&#x27;t dispense!  I tried taking the top off to shake it out but the cream was too thick.  So i can&#x27;t say if this stuff works or not.  It certainly did not work for me!</li>
            <li> This product worked better than I anticipated.  I even got a complement at a wedding I just attended about how wonderful my skin was looking........the reason being..I had no more bags or dark circles under my eyes. Great stuff.  Will definitely be reordering!</li>
            <li> This eye cream is amazing!!! Has quickly taken the bags and puffiness out from under my eyes. What&#x27;s even more amazing is the customer service. If there&#x27;s any issue at all, she solves it immediately. I am not fond of the coffee smell, so she sent me an entire new bottle of the unscented WHICH I LOVE!!!  The original one I gave to my mom, who really enjoys the smell, and she is now hooked on this product as well. We love this company and buy their deodorant too!</li>
            <li> Smells great...wake up coffee..a fav of mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feels wonderful and fresh on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been satisfied with all the skintospirit products I have tried.</li>
            <li> This is a great cream smells so good and effective! Although I was allergic to an Ingredient, the seller Kathi was very understanding and helped me by sending me the same cream without the ingredient that was causing the reaction and it worked better than ever. Would definitely recommend buying this cream, you won&#x27;t regret it</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat this price for such a high quality caffeine eye cream! It smells delightful, and I mean DELIGHTFUL! Comes in a very nice glass bottle with a pump. I have been using it for about a year now and I wouldn&#x27;t use any other product. Perfect for sensitive skin and all skin types.</li>
            <li> fantastic cream! smells divine - just makes me wake up in the morning and feels sooo smooth - I&#x27;m really in love with this!&lt;br /&gt;Etsy - lalaloquita</li>
            <li> There is a well known organic national brand that offers a similiar caffeine eye cream for more than twice as much.  I&#x27;ve used them both and it is hard to tell the difference.  This one smells really good.  The reason I gave a 4 not 5 star rating is that I have very sensitive eyes and if I am not careful to keep this cream a safe distance from my actual eye stinging and watering will happen until I wash my face.  In all fairness this is a common problem for me with eye creams.  This cream is very moisturizing so a little goes a long way.  If you will be using eye make up start out with just a little bit of the cream so you can see how it will interact with the make up&#x27;s staying power.&lt;br /&gt;By Etsy-Pat V</li>
            <li> This eye cream is wonderful. The texture is creamy, moisturizing and feels like a luxury cream.  It sinks right into the skin. The smell is light and to me is like coffee ice cream.&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly it works! My morning puffiness is gone in about 20 mins and the moisture is perfect to apply makeup: not greasy and not dry, so makeup stays on and does its job.&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy to find this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I ordered Kathi, the maker, contacted me to say the shipment might be delayed because she was waiting for the new bottles for packaging to come in. Not only did I get the new bottle type (which works great) she also shipped it so fast I got it three days before I expected it so there was no delay at all. Great product, service, and communication. Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> Thanks to Kathi for her superb customer service and fantastic caffeine eye whip! I have had dark circles under my eyes since having my daughter at age 35 and being sleep deprived. LOL. My dermatologist did tell me I have a little bit of fat under my eyes that was causing the darkness that could be operated on, but it wasn&#x27;t worth it because it wasn&#x27;t bad. Well to me it was! But of course, I am not sure that I wanted any surgery and doubt I could afford it if I even wanted to. Searched on amazon and found Kathi&#x27;s Caffeine Eye whip. Did research and Dr. Oz says to go with Caffeine eye creams because they really do work. Wish I knew this months/years ago as I have been toying around with different eye creams anytime I got a facial. They were ok but really didn&#x27;t do much and were quite pricey. Well Dr. Oz is right to go with caffeine in your eye cream, its true! Kathi has tons of other awesome ingredients in this eye whip too which are all natural. The other thing that is not advertised on here but should be is that she makes the eye whip FRESH! I do believe that makes a difference than the eye creams I have been buying that were probably sitting on the shelves for God knows how long. This Eye Whip is made fresh and shipped to your door. I think this is what made the difference for me. Well I started using it today and noticed a difference within the first few hours. Its true, it DOES smell like a mocha latte! But its not like you are reeking of coffee or anything, just a very faint smell. It woke up my eyes and felt terrific on my skin. I can notice some slight improvements just in the first few hours of my original skin tone coming back under my eyes. I am turning 40 this year and am trying to improve my look and I think I found one of the products to help me do it, Caffeine Eye Whip! Kathi sells this on Etsy too in case you are interested. Thank you Kathi!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m updating my original review because the company actually contacted me about their product after my initial posting.  They wanted to take care of me and offered to send me another bottle to try which smells much nicer.  I am using the product again.  My skin feels nice.  I must say the customer service is excellent.  No results just yet but have not been using it long enough.</li>
            <li> This cream had brought down my puffiness a lot and my circles aren&#x27;t nearly as dark as they were before. The coffee smell is just too over powering.</li>
            <li> I bought this about 2 months ago and wanted to wait to see how it really worked before I reviewed it. I don&#x27;t have a big problem with puffy eyes, but dark circles definitely. I found that after using it every day, my dark circles were definitely lightening and when I use it in the mornings I feel more awake just from the smell. It smells great and I don&#x27;t even like coffee! Will definitely continue using it. :)</li>
            <li> Kathi is great to deal with, and she makes the products herself. She even said she could reformulate it for me if I was allergic to any of the ingredients. I didn&#x27;t need her to, but I thought it was great that she was willing to do that for her customers. This eye whip smells amazing when you put it on, like a vanilla cappuccino (it goes away quickly, so you don&#x27;t smell it all day). It absorbs nicely, and I can notice a difference in puffiness and darkness under my eyes. Now that the weather is warmer, I think I will try putting it in the fridge. It will be like an iced cappuccino for my eyes!</li>
            <li> For the buyers that do not like the smell, if you contact the company they will make the cream unscented. Actually, I have found the scent very mild. The eye cream has helped my puffiness, however there isn&#x27;t anything that will help if you have a diet with too much sodium. Try a product called No Salt and this Caffeine Cream it works great.</li>
            <li> I was not pleased with the product. Not only did it not help with puffiness and dark circles, it smells awful! I would not even use as a hand cream. Product didn&#x27;t absorb on my skin and I have used other eye creams before and they work immediately. I have given this product ample enough time to see if it works and it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It does not work....some reviews look too good to be true!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very excited to receive this product with all the rave reviews.  But it did not work at all.  It was an ok moisturizer for my eyes but it does NOT help with puffiness.  I also did not like the smell of cookies or vanilla.  I looked again at all the reviews because I was wondering if I was missing something.  I noticed a lot of reviews were not verified purchases and some only had multiple 5 star reviews for this particular seller.  It is very fishy.  So I wanted to leave this honest review.  I did not particularly like the smell, it is an ok product but I would not buy again!  I also am highly doubtful of these reviews judging from the quality of this mediocre product and how it worked.  Careful when ordering!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product. I was not expecting a miracle, but have seen noticeable improvement in moisture and dark circles. I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Smells good and is not sticky. I need a few more days to see any results. But I was told I smelled delicious so that was very nice!</li>
            <li> I was so exited to try something natural on my eye area,without any harsh chemicals,but this eye whip caused redness, irritation on my eyelids and under eye area in a few minutes after applying it.That&#x27;s horrible.I&#x27;m scared to use it again. 20 dollars to the drain.....</li>
            <li> I love that is all natural, smells great and my under eye area is so smooth and lighter and lasts forever.</li>
            <li> I was very much excited to receive this product to finally get rid of dark circles and under eye puffiness but neither was solved. I am a white athletic female who have just turned 30 and have been suffering dark circles and puffiness for 2 years now (no medical reasons). I have been using this cream since Aug 22; though I have followed all the instructions, as advised on the bottle, I have not seen any changes till the moment of writing this review. It is a huge disappointment with more money and efforts in vain. Please be carefull and save your money for something that would truly solve your eye problems. ***DO NOT BUY***</li>
            <li> The coffee scent is very strong....&lt;br /&gt;Does not go too well with any other products or perfume...&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is nice and delivers moisture and flexibility to the eye area.</li>
            <li> first... it&#x27;s a great value comparing with others on the market... second... it really hydates my eyes... but... i&#x27;m sure it does anything to my dark circle and fine lines or not... can&#x27;t tell... but at least they are not getting worse... this bottle lasts a long time... i&#x27;ve been using it every morning... i will definitly buy it again</li>
            <li> This eye cream is very moisturizing without being greasy. I feel like it really hydrates my under eye area and does not irritate my eyes or skin. I also feel like in the three weeks I&#x27;ve been using it, my under eyes do look a little firmer and just more awake.</li>
            <li> First off, this product smells like French toast. During the initial application I could not figure out what the smell was only to later realize it was the cream. Now one may say that&#x27;s great, however it really is not. Also, I broke out in hives from using it and had to stop after giving it a second try.</li>
            <li> I really love the eye whip. Smells great and smooths out the little lines around the eyes. I recommend this product and will re order.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this eye cream now for a couple months, and I really have enjoyed it. You can&#x27;t beat the ingredients! It&#x27;s smells like delicious coffee and makes me happy every time I use it. Before I started using this, my under-eye area was always dry and irritated. This never makes my eyes water or bothers them in any way. I use it both morning and night and it works great under concealer. This bottle will also go a VERY long way. I use the tiniest amount of this stuff each time. My under-eye area just feels so much better now and I don&#x27;t get those tiny \\&quot;lines\\&quot; from dry skin. The customer service is also just great. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream.  It&#x27;s creamy and smells good enough to eat.  It perks my tired eyes up every morning.</li>
            <li> Best eye cream/whip ever!!!!!  I have been using this cream for a few years now, and my undereye and crows feet areas have never looked better.  I am in my mid-50s and have tried just about every organic/natural product on the market.  This cream surpasses all of them--makes your skin look and feel fabulous . . . without breaking the bank!  Buy more than one and keep the extra in the refrigerator (plus, the cooling sensation is awesome and instantly deflates puffy eyes!).  Try it, you&#x27;ll love it!...</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing!  Great scent!! Amazing for your eyes (but i use it as face cream sometimes too- just too good to pass up) All natural ingredients- great price- what more could you ask for!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how it is as it was a requested gift from my daughter, but she was delighted to receive it. sk</li>
            <li> I finally found the perfect eye cream! I&#x27;ve tried tons of them for my dark circles and tired eyes.No matter how awake I felt my eyes always felt tired all day.This wakes my eyes up!Only used this a few days and already see some lightening in my dark circles.Never had a eye cream actually do that.Very happy and will be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> I have tried several expensive eye treatments for dark circles and puffiness. I could tell no difference in before and after appearance.  I began reading/researching what makes a good eye treatment.  Every article named caffeine as a must have ingredient. I looked at the ingredients of the I creams I had and only one had caffeine and it made my eyes peel!&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give this a try.  I love the all natural ingredients.  It is not too greasy.  I have noticed an immediate reduction in my puffy eyes. I have not been using it long enough to evaluate reduction of dark circles.  Some people that have reviewed this product have mentioned a coffee scent but I have noticed no scent at all.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this eye whip.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but this product MUST have one!&lt;br /&gt;I am in my early 30&#x27;s, never even considered eye creams, but I woke up one morning and I just noticed fine lines under my eyes, swollen and purple areas.....yuk!&lt;br /&gt;I started to look for products and I came across this one. The reviews were excellent, so I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for the past month, not daily because I forget, but it smells great ( mocha chocolate), feels very smooth, no oily residue, skins absorbs it immediately and the skin under my eyes looks great. I have an extremely sensitive skin, I don&#x27;t get along with a lot of the face creams out there, but my skin loves it, without signs of irritation or burning sensation.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product, the price and the service unbeatable!</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this off of her etsy site and i&#x27;m very impressed with the results so far. I ordered the airless jar caffeine eye whip. It&#x27;s so nice not to have to dip your finger in the jar, but simple push the top and the whip is despensed in a small amount..perfect. This smells amazing as well and has a lovely consistency.</li>
            <li> On top of being an awesome organic product with nothing harmful in it, this stuff smells AMAZING! It&#x27;s extra creamy and blends in so well, I use it over my entire face, not just under my eyes. It&#x27;s an excellent moisturizer on top of its caffeine abilities to help with under eye blemishes and promote circulation. It smells just like a salted caramel hot chocolate from Starbucks! It smells as if you could actually eat it. I love skin care products that smell sweet and edible and this one is at the very top #1 spot on my list! When I pack my bags for trips, this is the first think I pack to make sure it comes with me.</li>
            <li> I have been using Skin2Spirit&#x27;s Cucumber/Green Tea Eye Whip for a few years.  It reduces fine lines and the morning puffiness right away and isn&#x27;t greasy - woo whoo!  This will be my first time ordering the new Caffeine Eye Whip.  I&#x27;m sure that I&#x27;ll love it, as I do all the other Skin2Spirit products that I use, like the Coconut Rose Face Whip (moisturizer), Organic Antioxidant Hand &amp; Body Lotion, and Shea Body Mousse.</li>
            <li> I have an autoimmune condition that causes puffy and darkened eyes. This product has helped me with this tremendously! I ordered one for my mother and my mother-in-law! give this product a shot its worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 months bc my eyes sometimes retain water under them (I guess that&#x27;s under eye bags). Has worked awesome so far. It creates a sort of thin barrier around skin that seems to lock in the nutrients</li>
            <li> The pump was defected</li>
            <li> This is a great product, not just for your eyes, but for your entire face.  Results in reducing the lines begins working within a few minutes.  I recommend using a moisturizer following application.</li>
            <li> I have tried sooo many eye creams...department stores, drug stores, beauty store, and natural health stores....I&#x27;ve never tried anything that softens and moisturizes the skin immediately with no greasy residue AND dramatically deflates my undereye bags right away! Awesome stuff...try it and you&#x27;ll be hooked!</li>
            <li> This is an edited review, my original review is below. When I wrote it,stating my disappointment, the owner immediately contacted me and offered me a replacement. I got the new bottle and the pump is working fine. Also, my skin is no longer reacting to the lotion. It smells great and is very moisturizing around the eye. I had kept the original lotion as I thought I would be sending it back. After comparing the ingredients, I noticed the first bottle listed cinnamon. That was the only difference I found, so I am assuming that is the ingredient my skin didn&#x27;t like. I have now thrown the old bottle away, but would buy this newer improved lotion again. I feel the customer service was excellent and the owner went out of her way to make sure I was pleased with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review:  First let me say that I was so excited at the thought of an organic eye cream....I have never had sensitive skin, broken out in a rash or anything like that. I used this cream and my eyes swelled up like I had been stung by a bee. I thought maybe my face just didnt like it so I tried it on my neck.Bam, same thing, red blotches! Also, I had to take the top off and stick my pinky in to get the lotion since the pump never worked. I am not sure about all the glowing reviews....maybe it&#x27;s just me but this cream was a waste. :(</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t give a long term report...but it goes on like a soft kiss. I&#x27;m eager to see if the long term effect is as wonderful...</li>
            <li> This is such a wonderful product!  It smells heavenly...like a sweet mix of coffee and hot chocolate.  I have noticed a serious diminishing of my dark circles.  Plus, the skin around my eyes feels so soft and smooth. I have tried many expensive eye cream products.  Hands down, this product is just as good as if not better!  More importantly, it is organic and made of ingredients that are good for you and not \\&quot;toxic\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Be honest..I haven&#x27;t tried anything better than this eye cream!&lt;br /&gt;The skin around my eyes looks very fresh and soft.&lt;br /&gt;I just love the smell of it!!!&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend to buy it..no doubt!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered many things from Amazon- but this is the first product that compelled me to write a review. I was looking for an eye cream to alleviate my puffy &amp;#34;morning eyes&amp;#34;- and this product really delivers! It smells wonderful, it&#x27;s very moisturizing, and it definately shrinks the undereye puffiness. It has also greatly reduced my dark circles. The maker of this product (Kathi) is a wonderful person- she promptly answered all of my emails and I could tell that she truly cares about customer satisfaction AND about putting out a fabulous product. I would absolutely repurchase and I  recommend that you give this product a try!</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell long term benefits but I got this eye cream and the skin around the eyes feels so nice and &amp;#34;velvety&amp;#34;. Its not greasy or heavy, it&#x27;s just perfect. I even spread some over my face. I also received a small sample of the face whip which I think I will have to order...smells delicious. I am hoping I will see some improvements in my skin bc I really like this and would like to keep purchasing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****Update: after just a couple of weeks of using it, I see visible results on my fine lines. Very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****03\16\2015 Update: Been using this for months now and will continue to use it. I recommend trying it once, you will not regret it.Also the vendor is a pleasure to work with.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this eye cream!!  It absorbs quickly, my makeup doesn&#x27;t smear &amp; my eyes don&#x27;t sting .. Even at the end of the day.  I&#x27;ve notice the puffiness under my eyes gone down a little, but I&#x27;m hopeful it&#x27;ll improve more because I&#x27;ve only used it for three weeks now.  The best part.. It&#x27;s organic!!</li>
            <li> First, let me thank Kathi for her incredible service.  I just received the new bottle, which Kathi replaced for me at no cost, because my first one was not good.  Now I understand all the raving reviews about the product.  Only used it twice, so haven&#x27;t seen much of puffy eye relief yet, but hopefully it will do its job, but the cream is so nice and goes on very smoothly, I really like it. Thank you Kathi</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of organic eye creams and this is by far the best. I love the smell (it kind of smells like a Starbucks). No irritation or rashes which has been a problem for me in the past. The bags under my eyes are gone when I put this on. I&#x27;m going to try her moisturizers next.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started using this but it definitely is the smoothest, most moisturizing eye cream I&#x27;ve ever tried! I love the smell - chocolately coffee - it&#x27;s yummy! I&#x27;ll update after I&#x27;ve used for a few weeks with results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June 24, 2013&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a few weeks now and I&#x27;m still loving it! I use it all over my face sometimes because I just love the smell. It is very moisturizing and it doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to break out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a couple of weeks and I&#x27;ve seen a big difference. Great product and I will be purchasing it again</li>
            <li> The moment I received this item, I put it on to see if the dark circles and puffiness would decrease and it definitely did! I wasn&#x27;t sure if the rich coffee smell would bother me, but I got used to it (plus it smells good). My skin hasn&#x27;t had any reaction to it and it looks so much better than before. Great product!</li>
            <li> I wanted to add a bit more detail about this product: I LOVE the new packaging. The simplicity of the touch/press top is great. It makes it easier to conserve product. So far, I&#x27;ve really enjoyed this eye cream and have purchased several times. I was never a &amp;#34;natural products only&amp;#34; girl, but when something is as effective as this, *and it performs well, and it is more natural and simple, what&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> It is a very product, and I have been consuming for few years. It helps me a lot to protect the skin. Compare to the other product I am or was using, this cost less and quality is good, save me ton of money to improve my skin.</li>
            <li> It smells great, actually works to anti-puff eyes, and when I&#x27;ve used it on other parts of my face incidentally it hasn&#x27;t given me a single pimple which is very rare. Love the stuff.</li>
            <li> Transforms my eyes! Within a few minutes all puffiness under my eyes is gone. Also I have very dark circles and nothing has ever helped before. This makes them look much lighter. Not sure how it works but it&#x27;s like magic! This will be a permanent addition to my skin care!</li>
            <li> I just started using this product, but so far I love it.  It goes on smoothly and wakes my eyes up in the morning.</li>
            <li> I am 50, and I have been through the products for the bags under my eyes.  I was told basically that surgery to remove the fat pockets would be my only hope. Not so. After one night of using this product, I noticed a tremendous difference. My bags were down by at least 65%.  I am sold, and that&#x27;s really saying something!</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait a few weeks before giving my review to see if this helps.  I have big, black bags under my eyes.  This has helped considerably.  They are not gone, but they are reduced and some of the blackness is now gone. I think with continued use they may just get better and better.  You also get an enormous amount of product from this seller for the price, I was impressed.  I use this morning and night, even under my makeup.  It just sinks into the skin, no greasiness and no exotic smells.  Very nice stuff, will reorder when I run out.</li>
