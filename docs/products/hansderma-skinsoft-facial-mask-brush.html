            <li>This brush is so soft, the mask goes on so smooth, I love it!!!!</li>
            <li>Love this brush for applying masks.  </li>
            <li>I just wish the bristles had a bit more of a spread.</li>
            <li>This brush is okay, though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Assuming you cleanse the brush thoroughly after every use, it is much more hygienic.</li>
            <li>Very nice brush, has a soft feel.</li>
            <li>They apply the product evenly and are easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Great for putting on facial masks.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, this brush solves both of these</li>
            <li>brush itself is comfortable to hold and the bristles are softer (and flexible) than I had ever imagined.</li>
            <li>This makes the facial go on smoother and more even, and makes the whole experience more relaxing because clean-up is SO much easier.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes come clean easily, and it is best to clean before the product dries onto it.</li>
            <li>This brush will save you from wasting your product because the product  applies on face smoothly with right amount of product.</li>
            <li>well made and very pretty.</li>
            <li>The brush is soft and easily to wash..Good product!</li>
            <li>My new favorite brush ♥️</li>
            <li>This brush is exactly what I was hoping for!</li>
            <li>This brush makes it so much easier and it is very soft and it feels nice.</li>
            <li>Very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used my brushes several times since ordering to apply face masks on my clients and love them.</li>
            <li>Even more so, it’s just not easy getting a smooth, even application.</li>
            <li>Ships fast, the product looks exactly as on the picture.</li>
            <li>Smoothes out masks very well.</li>
            <li>I use it for applying oils in my scalp and to apply masks in my face and works very well.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast too.</li>
            <li>Cleaning it is fairly easy and the quality of it assures you a long life.</li>
            <li>Got brush to use for face peels--perfect and high quality.</li>
            <li>It dries stiff, but a quick rinse under water easily prepares it for the next use.</li>
            <li>With your fingers, it’s not very sanitary unless you wash your hands prior to use, but that isn’t the most convenient.</li>
            <li>Other than that I think it&#x27;s very useful for putting on my masks.</li>
            <li>The bristles are strong enough to apply a heavy masque, but still have lots of flex and are very soft.</li>
            <li>The brush is soft but rigid enough to apply a facial mask on!</li>

            <li> I like it..The brush is soft and easily to wash..Good product!</li>
            <li> It is amazing! I like to make my own masks from home products and always was struggling with putting masks on my face with hands. This brush makes it so much easier and it is very soft and it feels nice. Ships fast, the product looks exactly as on the picture.</li>

            <li> Love this brush for applying masks.  The size is great too.. can use on face and the body!</li>
            <li> This brush is exactly what I was hoping for! I like to use clay masques, but I really hate applying them. The clay would stick to my fingers, making the masque go on clumpy and uneven. AND I&#x27;d have to scrub it out from under my finger nails multiple times to actually get all of it off.&lt;br /&gt;Enter: this brush. It is large enough to get your face covered quickly, but small enough to work around delicate areas of the face. The bristles are strong enough to apply a heavy masque, but still have lots of flex and are very soft. This makes the facial go on smoother and more even, and makes the whole experience more relaxing because clean-up is SO much easier.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes come clean easily, and it is best to clean before the product dries onto it. Using soap and warm water, move WITH (not against) the bristles over your hand or a solid surface, like the bottom of your sink. I like to wrap a ponytail holder around the towel bar so that I can dry it, along with all my makeup brushes, with the bristles pointing down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used my brushes several times since ordering to apply face masks on my clients and love them. They apply the product evenly and are easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This brush does the job, but it&#x27;s nothing fancy. I just wish the bristles had a bit more of a spread. This brush is okay, though.</li>
            <li> this brush works miracles ! very smooth on the skin and works well</li>
            <li> The bristles are so soft and are perfect for applying face masks!</li>

            <li> My new favorite brush ♥️</li>
            <li> Great for putting on facial masks.</li>
            <li> Great Mask Brush! I use it every day applying the leftover of my morning smoothie.</li>
            <li> I just wish the bristles weren&#x27;t so stiff. Other than that I think it&#x27;s very useful for putting on my masks.</li>
            <li> Great for applying clay masks. Love it!</li>
            <li> Very nice brush, has a soft feel. I use it for applying oils in my scalp and to apply masks in my face and works very well. Delivery was fast too.</li>
            <li> This item is manufactured well.  Bristles extend all the way to the metal so I have never scraped my face, and there are enough bristles to spread product evenly over my face yet not so much that product is wasted.  Further, the bristles are firmly attached - none have fallen out nor flared out of place.  The handle is firmly attached and the entire brush feels sturdy while being used.  I use this brush to apply a variety of facial products including creams, exfoliates, and serums.</li>
            <li> Perfect brush for mud mask, easy to clean with hand soap. This brush will save you from wasting your product because the product  applies on face smoothly with right amount of product.</li>
            <li> Before I begin this review, I just want to note that I have only used for for applying masks and therefore cannot comment on its effectiveness regarding makeup application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using different masks (homemade) for years, and recently commercial ones too. They ranged from egg whites to dead sea masks. Anything and everything I have used it for has dramatically changed how I use them. With your fingers, it’s not very sanitary unless you wash your hands prior to use, but that isn’t the most convenient. Even more so, it’s just not easy getting a smooth, even application. Fortunately, this brush solves both of these problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Assuming you cleanse the brush thoroughly after every use, it is much more hygienic. Not only that, it gives you precision. With the brush, it is both easier to get a uniform application and cover precisely only where you intend it to. A fair comparison would be drawing a painting. With your fingers, sometimes you just miss and color the wrong spot. On the other hand a brush allows you to be as articulate as you’d like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush itself is comfortable to hold and the bristles are softer (and flexible) than I had ever imagined. Cleaning it is fairly easy and the quality of it assures you a long life. It dries stiff, but a quick rinse under water easily prepares it for the next use. Just don’t forget to dry excess water from it, as it may interfere with your mask, depending on the kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only regret is that I had bought their cheapest model and may be missing out. I will definitely be considering trying their higher-end models in the future.</li>
            <li> Got brush to use for face peels--perfect and high quality.</li>
            <li> Great brush for applying masks (the reason I purchased) the hairs have not come off and does the job well!</li>
            <li> Very soft and smooth.  glides the product on.  well made and very pretty.</li>
