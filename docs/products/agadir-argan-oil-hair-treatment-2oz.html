            <li>Great product!!!!!</li>
            <li>This makes my hair uber shiny and healthy looking!!!</li>
            <li>Love the scent!!!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff !!!</li>
            <li>A drop or two is all you need, gives incredible shine.</li>
            <li>It smells great also.</li>
            <li>Helps with fly aways and smells so good.</li>
            <li>This product was recommended by my hairdresser and I loved it.</li>
            <li>and it smells good</li>
            <li>Smells great, and the price was fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>I am 100% satisfied with this purchase. :)</li>
            <li>It is amazing and well worth the money.</li>
            <li>The shipping was very quick.</li>
            <li>This oil gives my hair a great shine (especially after blow drying) and leaves a light, bouncy finish.</li>
            <li>Always quick and on time</li>
            <li>This product probably works better for people with normal skin.</li>
            <li>For the price and the amount of oil in this jar I expected it to be 10x more concentrated!</li>
            <li>It really helps your hair to regain its soft smooth texture.</li>
            <li>i did like it because it made my hair softer ,but after a day i feel my hair looks dry and need more to add.</li>
            <li>I have had more success with Black Castor Oil which added growth to my temples and alleviated my extremely dry skin within a week.</li>
            <li>Its light on the hair (afro american, relaxed).  </li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon and the seller.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t seen much results.</li>
            <li>Just tried this in the 2oz bottle and it really shines the hair.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair moisturized very well.</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle, between the first and this one I tried several different products and none worked as good as this.  </li>
            <li>Other products are blended with more ingredients and make my hair appear oily.</li>
            <li>The smell was a little strong for me as I don&#x27;t wear perfume but exotic, all the same.</li>
            <li>It will probably last forever as it takes very little to get a good result.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m African American and have a vey soft texture</li>
            <li>You just put a pea size amount in your hand and run it through fresh washed damp hair then add a little to dry if you have any frizz.</li>

            <li> I like the  idea of not keeping the oil for a long period of time.  </li>
            <li> This product is almost a necessity for seniors with dry hair.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Since a very little oil is needed for an application,  it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I put it on my hair after I shampoo for shine and to keep the frizz down.  </li>
            <li> a little dab will do you.</li>

            <li> Awesome !! I use it for my daughter before swimming which works like conditioner after the class and it smells good</li>
            <li> Works well with my hair!! Love the scent!!! A little goes a long way. On my third bottle. Discovered at the salon</li>
            <li> For the price and the amount of oil in this jar I expected it to be 10x more concentrated! I have used it as directed and I haven&#x27;t seen much results. I have had more success with Black Castor Oil which added growth to my temples and alleviated my extremely dry skin within a week. This product probably works better for people with normal skin.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve used on my hair to date! I&#x27;m African American and have a vey soft texture&lt;br /&gt;grade of hair. This oil gives my hair a great shine (especially after blow drying) and leaves a light, bouncy finish. It smells great also. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff !!!</li>
            <li> Just tried this in the 2oz bottle and it really shines the hair. Warning though..a little dab will do you. You just put a pea size amount in your hand and run it through fresh washed damp hair then add a little to dry if you have any frizz.</li>
            <li> Great product!!!!! Keeps my hair moisturized very well. Since a very little oil is needed for an application,  it lasts a long time. It&#x27;s a bit pricy,  but does what it promises. Enough said!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! It really helps your hair to regain its soft smooth texture. Helps with fly aways and smells so good. The shipping was very quick. I am 100% satisfied with this purchase. :)</li>
