            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>great too.</li>
            <li>But this has been a great product for me.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells amazing!</li>
            <li>But some are better than others at addressing the smell, and this is one of the best at it.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant but doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>I mix it with Thermal care tanning and works good together.</li>
            <li>Also works as a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I would use this lotion if it wasn&#x27;t a self tanner because it is super moisturizing and smells magnificent!  </li>
            <li>Nice to have something to use if I don&#x27;t want to wear pantyhose and still want my legs to look good.</li>
            <li>Nice to be tan in the winter and spring.</li>
            <li>Really nice product.  </li>
            <li>nice bronze look no streaking either.</li>
            <li>I really loved this product since I don&#x27;t tan that easy on my legs</li>
            <li>My skin is so flippin soft its awesome.</li>
            <li>This self tanning formula is very good for my fair british skin.</li>
            <li>This product works very nicely when used consistently.  </li>
            <li>Smells much better than most self tanners that I have used.&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li>Been using this for years now and love it.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It looks better if you can do thinner coats and build it up.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products and thought I found the perfect one until I took a chance on Australian Gold.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the way it spreads on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Love Love Love.  </li>
            <li>, however I need to cover my &amp;#34;tan lines&amp;#34; if I wear a strapless top.</li>
            <li>Australian Gold blends so well that my tan is even and flawless!</li>
            <li>Ulta stopped carrying, so I was glad to see it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>and when I do it&#x27;s more of a poop brown color.</li>
            <li>It gave me a really nice and natural glowy color and smelled great.</li>
            <li>I will stop looking for anything better.</li>
            <li>Will be buying more.</li>
            <li>It only took 3 applications within a couple hour, to get the perfect color.</li>
            <li>I apply it at night and the smell is pretty good, like perfume.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, blends well, and gives me a believable tan.</li>
            <li>I read good reviews on here about this product, but I was very unimpressed.</li>
            <li>Very nice smell and natural looking</li>
            <li>My olive complexion tans easily</li>
            <li>Putting it on in the morning is fine though -</li>
            <li>This lotion smells so wonderful and gets me very dark.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s oil free</li>
            <li>Why punish your skin with damaging rays when you can slather yourself in this great smelling lotion and get the same effect?  </li>
            <li>Seems like a good product so far.</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely, dries quickly and the color looks most natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fair skinned girl with Scottish and Irish roots.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant fragrance at first, but the longer you leave it on the more the usual \\&quot;self-tanner\\&quot; odor</li>
            <li>It worked how I expected and it was a good price.</li>
            <li>So much better than available brands at local retailers.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth every penny</li>
            <li>So, I have been looking for a self-tanner with natural looking results and without the stench of most self-tanners.  </li>
            <li>at night, let dry and in the morning you have really nice color.  </li>
            <li>It still has a strong odor; although more bearable than the typical smell.</li>
            <li>Not fake looking at all.  </li>
            <li>Only a small amount needs to be applied which makes this product a great value!</li>
            <li>It worked well but left an orange color in places when applied, I switched to using Jergens self tanner seems to leave a more tan look versus the orange color that some self tanners can leave on your skin when applied.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the smell is noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much, much safer than the sun or tanning beds!</li>
            <li>This product has nice natural glowing tan(as long as you apply evenly).</li>
            <li>Not really dark, but Im fair skinned and dont need to be too dark.</li>
            <li>i am fair skinned and could hardly notice a difference with this product</li>
            <li>This works very well - give you a medium glow...that lasts.</li>
            <li>It is gentle on your face too.</li>
            <li>It has a very perfumey smell, not offensive at all.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t always have time to spend in the sun and am worried about health risks of too much tanning bed time.  </li>
            <li>reasonably well</li>
            <li>A good natural looking tan without stepping foot outside too - just not as dark as quick.</li>
            <li>Better than the other brands iv&#x27;e used:</li>
            <li>I got decent color from this self tanner, but the smell will keep me from buying it again.</li>
            <li>Color does transfer a bit to clothing, so make sure it is dry and maybe don&#x27;t wear white after applying.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and would highly recommend it to anyone that cannot stand the usual smell of sunless</li>
            <li>Very natural color and the lotion-like consistency doesn&#x27;t streak when applied evening and rubbed in thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>This came highly recommended by a friend, and I thought she was tanned naturally.</li>
            <li>This self tanner does not streak and the color is so natural!</li>
            <li>Natural looking tan.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice fragrance and it doesn&#x27;t have that bad self-tanner odor that many other brands have.</li>
            <li>I far prerfer alternatives in the same price category (Hawaiin Tropic Island Radiance, L&#x27;Oreal tanning wipes, Neutrogena Build-a-tan).</li>

            <li> I far prerfer alternatives in the same price category (Hawaiin Tropic Island Radiance, L&#x27;Oreal tanning wipes, Neutrogena Build-a-tan).</li>
            <li> One thing I have learned is that a person&#x27;s chemistry affects the development, some people don&#x27;t get the same results, the smell is different, and it doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> Only tested it a little so far</li>
            <li> The texture is also quite strange, reminded me of polenta.  </li>
            <li> As long as the price doesn&#x27;t go up, this well be my go-to lotion.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a long time.  </li>
            <li> and it looks like I am naturally tanned from spending a few days at the beach.</li>
            <li> As long as you rub it in</li>
            <li> I like other Australian Gold products.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s say you do your shoulder then wash hands with soap, dry hands then apply to your forearm and so on.</li>
            <li> spent on it!</li>
            <li> Use it every other day.  </li>
            <li> This did not make me orange or streaky at all like a couple of other tanners I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviews say, it doesn&#x27;t smell like the average self tanners.  </li>
            <li> they all have a smell to them by virtue of the main ingredient which helps you tan, so it&#x27;s tough to get past that.</li>
            <li> I have used many different sunless tanners and they all leave a nasty smell on your skin while you are using them and after you rinse them off.</li>
            <li> Its a little smelly, but not like the others out there.</li>
            <li> This stuff has great smell for several hours but even at its worst smell its not that bad.</li>
            <li> Once I did my whole body then washed my hands then my hands were badly tanned.</li>
            <li> fake bake, coppertone, neutrogena, ban de sole.</li>
            <li> I had bad luck with the old stuff.</li>
            <li> This one was very hard to rub in, seemed almost oily...</li>
            <li> was a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t appear to make me any tanner, so I basically smelled bad with no outcome.  </li>
            <li> The smell is not as bad as a lot of self-tanners</li>
            <li> Really disappointed</li>
            <li> This is probably the worst smellng tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m normally a big fan of Austrailian Gold products, but not this.  This is probably the worst smellng tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.  It also didn&#x27;t appear to make me any tanner, so I basically smelled bad with no outcome.  My husband also hates the smell if I wear it to bed.  The texture is also quite strange, reminded me of polenta.  I far prerfer alternatives in the same price category (Hawaiin Tropic Island Radiance, L&#x27;Oreal tanning wipes, Neutrogena Build-a-tan).</li>
            <li> This works very well - give you a medium glow...that lasts.</li>
            <li> Very nice smell and natural looking</li>
            <li> This lotion smells so wonderful and gets me very dark. I use it on my face at night as well. As long as the price doesn&#x27;t go up, this well be my go-to lotion.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Natural looking tan.  Like the other reviews say, it doesn&#x27;t smell like the average self tanners.  It still has a strong odor; although more bearable than the typical smell.</li>
            <li> very good product, recommended</li>
            <li> It worked how I expected and it was a good price. Nice to be tan in the winter and spring.</li>
            <li> Really nice product.  Does what it says if you follow instructions.  Smells much better than most self tanners that I have used.&lt;br /&gt;Use at night, let dry and in the morning you have really nice color.  Not fake looking at all.  Do use gloves to apply!!</li>
            <li> Good product. But it takes awhile to show up.  I found no &amp;#34;orange&amp;#34; color, which is great! It is gentle on your face too.</li>
            <li> The formula has changed and not as good as it had been for years!  Unsatisfactory &amp; won&#x27;t order it again or the spray that I wanted to get!</li>
            <li> I have used this for a long time.  Its a little smelly, but not like the others out there. It lasts about 4 days on me.  Not really dark, but Im fair skinned and dont need to be too dark.</li>
            <li> So much better than available brands at local retailers.  This self tanner does not streak and the color is so natural!</li>
            <li> Been using this for years now and love it.  It has a nice fragrance and it doesn&#x27;t have that bad self-tanner odor that many other brands have.</li>
            <li> This self tanning formula is very good for my fair british skin. Love it. It looks better if you can do thinner coats and build it up. Nice to have something to use if I don&#x27;t want to wear pantyhose and still want my legs to look good.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products and thought I found the perfect one until I took a chance on Australian Gold. I think this is the best one!! It goes on nicely, dries quickly and the color looks most natural.</li>
            <li> This product works very nicely when used consistently.  I love the smell and the way it spreads on the skin.  Definitely worth every penny spent on it!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing! however, I put two coats on last night and sat with it on for a while before going to bed. I woke up this morning and my face was still completely white - no tan. I have been using self tanners for years! I have used foams, gels, creams. All of them have produced results, except for this one. Really disappointed</li>
            <li> Works great. I mix it with Thermal care tanning and works good together. nice bronze look no streaking either.</li>
            <li> I have used many different sunless tanners and they all leave a nasty smell on your skin while you are using them and after you rinse them off. But this one smells awesome. It has a very perfumey smell, not offensive at all. I love this stuff and would highly recommend it to anyone that cannot stand the usual smell of sunless tanners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tans great too. Better than the other brands iv&#x27;e used: fake bake, coppertone, neutrogena, ban de sole.</li>
            <li> I read good reviews on here about this product, but I was very unimpressed. I have used almost every sunless tanner on the market. This one was very hard to rub in, seemed almost oily...I had to rub in circles for a loooong time to get the &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; off. After all of that, it produced no color. I&#x27;ll stick with the others that I know work. Bummer...I like other Australian Gold products.</li>
            <li> I would use this lotion if it wasn&#x27;t a self tanner because it is super moisturizing and smells magnificent!  Love Love Love.  Use it every other day.  Plus it&#x27;s oil free so you can use it on your face.  I have a subscription and just keep &#x27;em coming.</li>
            <li> i am fair skinned and could hardly notice a difference with this product</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t always have time to spend in the sun and am worried about health risks of too much tanning bed time.  So, I have been looking for a self-tanner with natural looking results and without the stench of most self-tanners.  I am already a fan and user of Australian Gold products so I thought I would try this self-tanner.  Color results and coverage was excellent.  Very natural color and the lotion-like consistency doesn&#x27;t streak when applied evening and rubbed in thoroughly.  Color does transfer a bit to clothing, so make sure it is dry and maybe don&#x27;t wear white after applying. It has a pleasant fragrance at first, but the longer you leave it on the more the usual \\&quot;self-tanner\\&quot; odor comes leeches out -which was a disappointment.  But, it definitely isn&#x27;t as pungent as some of the products on the market.</li>
            <li> My olive complexion tans easily, however I need to cover my &amp;#34;tan lines&amp;#34; if I wear a strapless top. Australian Gold blends so well that my tan is even and flawless! The scent is pleasant but doesn&#x27;t linger. Only a small amount needs to be applied which makes this product a great value!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fair skinned girl with Scottish and Irish roots. Never tan, only burn, and have a family history of skin cancer. I&#x27;ve tried dozens of tanning products over the years. started self tanning in the 90&#x27;s. they all have a smell to them by virtue of the main ingredient which helps you tan, so it&#x27;s tough to get past that. But some are better than others at addressing the smell, and this is one of the best at it. I apply it at night and the smell is pretty good, like perfume. By the time it starts to develop, I&#x27;m asleep. When I wake up, I rinse off in the shower with a scented moisturizing soap. I haven&#x27;t had to deal with the tanning smell with this tanner.  It goes on smooth, blends well, and gives me a believable tan. I get lots of compliments. One thing I have learned is that a person&#x27;s chemistry affects the development, some people don&#x27;t get the same results, the smell is different, and it doesn&#x27;t last as long. Sometimes you just have to experiment. But this has been a great product for me. Ulta stopped carrying, so I was glad to see it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Why punish your skin with damaging rays when you can slather yourself in this great smelling lotion and get the same effect?  Even 1- or 15 mins in the sun with this lotion on and it looks like I am naturally tanned from spending a few days at the beach. A good natural looking tan without stepping foot outside too - just not as dark as quick.</li>
            <li> This did not make me orange or streaky at all like a couple of other tanners I&#x27;ve used. I really loved this product since I don&#x27;t tan that easy on my legs and when I do it&#x27;s more of a poop brown color. It gave me a really nice and natural glowy color and smelled great. I will stop looking for anything better.</li>
            <li> Only tested it a little so far but now the weather is tarting to break will begin to gradually use it. Seems like a good product so far.</li>
            <li> I was cautious getting a self tanner as I had gotten some 8 years ago. I had bad luck with the old stuff. I had stained hands and unevenness(which was my lack of application skill). This stuff has great smell for several hours but even at its worst smell its not that bad. One thing I&#x27;ve learned is to wash your hands every time you apply, like every time you do a part of your body. Let&#x27;s say you do your shoulder then wash hands with soap, dry hands then apply to your forearm and so on. Once I did my whole body then washed my hands then my hands were badly tanned. Also I apply then wait 4 hours then take a shower. This product has nice natural glowing tan(as long as you apply evenly). Also works as a good moisturizer. My skin is so flippin soft its awesome. Will be buying more.</li>
            <li> No Tan Smell!  Has a powdery floral scent with instant color. It only took 3 applications within a couple hour, to get the perfect color.</li>
            <li> It worked well but left an orange color in places when applied, I switched to using Jergens self tanner seems to leave a more tan look versus the orange color that some self tanners can leave on your skin when applied.</li>
            <li> I got decent color from this self tanner, but the smell will keep me from buying it again.</li>
            <li> This came highly recommended by a friend, and I thought she was tanned naturally. As long as you rub it in reasonably well it doesn&#x27;t leave orange blotches or streaks. The smell is not as bad as a lot of self-tanners but I don&#x27;t like to smell anything on my skin when I got to bed, so I can&#x27;t put it on before bed. Putting it on in the morning is fine though - I don&#x27;t think the smell is noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much, much safer than the sun or tanning beds!</li>
