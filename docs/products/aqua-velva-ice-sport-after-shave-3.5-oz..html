            <li>Clean scent, smells great.</li>

            <li>Briskly refreshing scent and on the skin.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind it, but more than one girl has commented on it.</li>
            <li>Aqua Velva Ice Sport after shave lotion is my favorite, so much&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used this for years and love it..</li>
            <li>/&gt;1) I would expect a better quality bottle</li>
            <li>Why spend more?</li>
            <li>Best 6 bucks I&#x27;ve spent on aftershave.</li>
            <li>It has a nice fresh scent, shipping was quick!</li>
            <li>Smells better than the original Aqua Velva.</li>
            <li>I said to myself that this is just another rip off name for Aqua Velva, which to me is much to strong in its destinctive scent and sort of \\&quot;dates\\</li>
            <li>The one drawback is that it smells cheap as well -</li>
            <li>Thanks to the provider, all is ok.</li>
            <li>+ botles of designer aftershave,and in my opinion,smells more masculine.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t aware of this product until my brother told me about it.</li>
            <li>I ordered enough of the 3.5 oz plastic bottles to last many, many years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li>This was when men just used an aftershave to cool the scrathes that occurred when using those old \\&quot;safety razors\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Not only do I use it as an after-shave, but I add it  liberally to fragrance-free hand creams (for dry skin   winter use) to make their application smell as good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried half a dozen different after-shave lotions, all of them more expensive and more specifically formulated for \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot;, but this one works the best at reducing irritation and breakouts.  </li>
            <li>It was better than I had expected.</li>
            <li>Seems to be a good aftershave for wet shaving with a DE razor and traditional soaps.</li>
            <li>It is not over-powering like many other after shave</li>
            <li>Icy feel, manly light fragrance.</li>
            <li>Then came this revelation of men&#x27;s scented products which women seemed to like and a new industry was born.</li>
            <li>Many years ago, I used \\&quot;Aqua Velva\\&quot; as just an ordinary aftershave lotion.</li>
            <li>Smells sharp and clean.</li>
            <li>It was either Aqua Velva or Old Spice.</li>
            <li>I used to have a bottle of Cool Water cologne and this is a dead ringer for that scent at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>Great product fast service, used it for several years unable to find this locally, so I am forced to order on line</li>
            <li>I used to use this aftershave back when I first started shaving(18).A few years later,the stores stopped carrying it.</li>

            <li> It was better than I had expected. I wasn&#x27;t aware of this product until my brother told me about it.</li>

            <li> Many years ago, I used \\&quot;Aqua Velva\\&quot; as just an ordinary aftershave lotion. This was when men just used an aftershave to cool the scrathes that occurred when using those old \\&quot;safety razors\\&quot;. It was either Aqua Velva or Old Spice. The choices were very limited and guys just didn&#x27;t care anyway. Then came this revelation of men&#x27;s scented products which women seemed to like and a new industry was born. A couple of years ago I was in a CVS, Rite Aide or wherever when I saw this little plastic bottle called \\&quot;Ice Sport\\&quot;. I said to myself that this is just another rip off name for Aqua Velva, which to me is much to strong in its destinctive scent and sort of \\&quot;dates\\&quot; a guy. I tried the Ice Sport and it was an awakening. It is this refreshing after shave feeling I look foward to in the AM before work. Then suddenly in the last year, this product disappeared from shelves everywhere. When I Googled the product a few days ago (7/27/2011), I found that Amazon.com still had some in stock. I ordered enough of the 3.5 oz plastic bottles to last many, many years. So that is my story and how much I love the remarkabley cooling and refreshing way to make my face feel great after a shave.... Stan</li>
            <li> Found a bottle of this today in a local B&amp;M store. I used to have a bottle of Cool Water cologne and this is a dead ringer for that scent at a fraction of the cost. Seems to be a good aftershave for wet shaving with a DE razor and traditional soaps. Goes well with Van Der Hagen luxury scented soap. I&#x27;ll be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> I am \\&quot;hooked\\&quot; on the fragrance of Aqua Velva Ice Sport;  somehow it&#x27;s different from other Aqua Velva products.  Not only do I use it as an after-shave, but I add it  liberally to fragrance-free hand creams (for dry skin   winter use) to make their application smell as good.  No matter what brand of hand cream I use, Ice Sport  added makes them all have the same \\&quot;superb\\&quot; fragrance.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find this after shave at stores, I had to get it from Amazon. I like the scent not strong like other after shave</li>
            <li> Briskly refreshing scent and on the skin.  Used this product a few years ago and have looked for it ever since.</li>
            <li> Great product fast service, used it for several years unable to find this locally, so I am forced to order on line</li>
            <li> I have been using this after save for a good many years and I have recommend it to some of my friends and they also like it.</li>
            <li> I used to use some random after shave since I started shaving, but once I was looking to get one, and while doing grocery shopping, I somehow found this, and that grocery store was local to my city. I moved So I am ordering it online. I am writing this review even before I&#x27;m getting the product. Because I know that it&#x27;s amazing product, smell really nice. and does its work nicely.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great! It has a nice fresh scent, shipping was quick! arrived in a few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and now it seems to be unavailable in  stores. Great aftershave, smells great and feels good on your face.</li>
            <li> Coolness personified. Icy feel, manly light fragrance.</li>
            <li> The product is in perfect conditions. Thanks to the provider, all is ok. I recommend and i save to my favorites.</li>
            <li> I have been using this after-shave for years.  I have the type of skin that is prone to breakouts, especially after shaving (so I&#x27;m picky about my razor, shaving cream and after-shave).  I&#x27;ve tried half a dozen different after-shave lotions, all of them more expensive and more specifically formulated for \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot;, but this one works the best at reducing irritation and breakouts.  The one drawback is that it smells cheap as well - I don&#x27;t mind it, but more than one girl has commented on it.</li>
            <li> Aqua Velva Ice Sport after shave lotion is my favorite, so much&lt;br /&gt;so I do not use any other lotion. It has a very nice and subtle&lt;br /&gt;aroma. It is not over-powering like many other after shave products.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for years, and have hundreds of comments on&lt;br /&gt;how nicely it smells. It also does not seem to irritate your skin&lt;br /&gt;when used just after a close shave. Do not think you will be&lt;br /&gt;disappointed purchasing this nicely priced item from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great product after shaving.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and love it..it is not overpowering and easier to buy online than to try to find it in stores..</li>
            <li> This comes in plastic bottle. Smells great but nothing out of the box. It feels like a fragrance I have had before. I would rate this product not more than 3 stars because of two reasons -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I would expect a better quality bottle&lt;br /&gt;2) I would expect a fragrance which doesn&#x27;t see, something like I have used before.</li>
            <li> Why spend more? This is a refreshing aftershave that smells great.</li>
            <li> My father loves this. Smells sharp and clean. Very nice.</li>
            <li> For mass market &amp;#34;cheap stuff&amp;#34; a surprise. Nice scent. It does NOT smell like an Aqua velva &amp;#34;knock-off&amp;#34; or Aqua Velva Jr.  It has it&#x27;s own scent and it has a pesistance I didn&#x27;t expect from low-end after shave. It hangs around a while which is a good thing</li>
            <li> IIts a great product love da smell my husband loves it too so im very satisfied wit my item. A++++++++++</li>
            <li> Best 6 bucks I&#x27;ve spent on aftershave. Clean scent, smells great. Don&#x27;t miss out on this. 5 stars!!! Smells better than the original Aqua Velva.</li>
