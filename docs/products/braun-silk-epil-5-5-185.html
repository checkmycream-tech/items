            <li>I do find that epilators work best for me if I shave a couple of times in between epilations.  </li>

            <li>job.&lt;br /&gt;She told me something about the rotation being great.</li>
            <li>I checked amazon.com and saw a Philips that had great reviews and was cheaper.</li>

            <li>Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>The Braun website has some great tips for using an epilator.</li>

            <li>Great torture device.</li>

            <li>So if you get this... be brave.</li>
            <li>The epli function works great.</li>
            <li>Everything about it is great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with this.</li>
            <li>I am happy with almost everything about this epilator.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>I had it for 8 years and it worked great.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s happy with this product.</li>
            <li>It is as claimed and does a great job.</li>
            <li>I had the silk-epil 5, and it was great.</li>
            <li>and the epilator did a great job.</li>
            <li>but this works great.</li>
            <li>Braun Epilator works great in hair removal.</li>
            <li>Great value for the money</li>
            <li>It works great for me</li>
            <li>happy with</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a month now and my legs feel great.  </li>
            <li>The ergonomics are great</li>
            <li>Here I use the very effective shaver that came with the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Works amazing!</li>
            <li>Amazing product!</li>
            <li>This works amazing!</li>
            <li>I use this often and its amazing!</li>
            <li>This makes it more fool-proof as you don&#x27;t have to get the angel perfect for it to work, the epilator takes care of that.  </li>
            <li>and I had no problem with it till it died after many years of doing a wonderful job.</li>
            <li>Good product at great price and all you need.</li>
            <li>She is very happy to have it too!! :)</li>
            <li>good price, lasts, and the trimmer attachment is great.</li>
            <li>product was a good surprise to her as she noticed it is very effective in removing the hair.</li>
            <li>So happy and very satisfied with product.</li>
            <li>very good and safe.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly good, but it still doesn&#x27;t catches everything.</li>
            <li>I had a good run with this one.   </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember when tweezing ever felt good...</li>
            <li>End result is wonderful and smooth....</li>
            <li>She loved it..</li>
            <li>It is so good.</li>
            <li>Heard good things about this product so decided to purchase this.</li>
            <li>Works good.</li>
            <li>The epilator is good as well</li>
            <li>I got this as a gift for my mom and she loved it...</li>
            <li>a good twenty years ago; maybe it gets easier as time goes by.</li>
            <li>good quality and service</li>
            <li>she loved it....</li>
            <li>guess pain is good.</li>
            <li>So, I tried it on under arm hair, and it did not do as a good as a job using a womens razor.</li>
            <li>This is a good product.</li>
            <li>It is a good epilator.</li>
            <li>Now I just have to wait and see if it&#x27;ll still work as good as it does a year from now.</li>
            <li>Everything was alright, good timing and good conditions...</li>
            <li>I loved to trimmer attachments.</li>
            <li>I personally loved it.</li>
            <li>My wife loved this one.</li>
            <li>and I know a lot of people who epilate and are a good support system as they say it gets easier with each time.</li>
            <li>I used it and its really good....</li>
            <li>its good to get it.......</li>
            <li>Good epilator.</li>
            <li>Good product and trust mark.</li>
            <li>so I knew what to expect comfort wise.</li>
            <li>good buy,  recommended  to buy.  </li>
            <li>Anyways, I figured today was a good day to put this epilator to use.</li>
            <li>I loved it.</li>
            <li>it is so good ,i like it</li>
            <li>I have been using the shaver part of it and that was a good deal.</li>
            <li>and it Works really good as i thought.</li>
            <li>still a good thing to include</li>
            <li>Anyway, I am using the tweezer head after using wax strips, for finalization, and it showed up a good plan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good product for the price.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;ll be just packed full of fuzz!!!  </li>
            <li>My wife is very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I use a body scrub from Tree Hut that does a great job and smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>So, all in all, I am happy with this product and glad I can stick with Braun epilators.  </li>
            <li>The accessories that come with this package are great- Love the concept of the gel pack for cooling and the pivoting head.&lt;br</li>
            <li>conclude, I am very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After reading many great reviews, I gave Emjoi eMagine Rechargeable</li>
            <li>This model is amazing too , a good upgrade.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be so very glad you did.</li>
            <li>The two speed settings are great and i love all the stuff it came with.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Its a good product , my wife liked it</li>
            <li>I love the light!!!</li>
            <li>This model really a great item with a nice price, I have purchased it for my wife who love it and noticed</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s for sure!</li>
            <li>Oh, boy, I love it!</li>
            <li>absolutely love my Silk Epil and would buy it again!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>My first epilator was an Epilady that I was so impressed with the results, that I purchased a Braun because it seemed as though it would have been an upgrade.</li>
            <li>luck epilating - sure is a heck of a lot cheaper than waxing and buying razors and shaving cream all the time!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It works so much better!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>I just love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good-not perfect.</li>
            <li>I love this item!  </li>
            <li>The packaging was great - easy to set up and get started.  </li>
            <li>Very good product and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The light is a very nice usable feature as it lets you see exactly what you are doing, and the head to trim is very nice and works great.</li>
            <li>Great product, the light makes it awsome..</li>
            <li>This epilator is amazing.</li>
            <li>However, this version is amazing</li>
            <li>Comfortable to hold, and the headlight is great bonus</li>
            <li>Keeping in mind that I bought my epilator primarily for bikini line, I am extremely happy with this product.</li>
            <li>It is really amazing.</li>
            <li>but when I tried the Braun silk epil 5, it was amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>kind of let things go</li>
            <li>and I liked the product.</li>
            <li>Having waxed my legs before I knew what the feeling of having the hair ripped out by the root would feel like, but epilating lacks the soothing factor of the warm wax.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li>This comes with an epilator and shaver head which is really handy for me since I like to do both.</li>
            <li>It shaves perfectly, and SO fast.</li>
            <li>If you want a fast shaver, this is the best one I would say in existence.</li>
            <li>It would be a nice one to buy for someone using an epilator for the 1st time.</li>
            <li>liked that it is used corded &amp; cordless, and hoped the dual opposed heads would get the job done faster.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wife liked it and she recommended also.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t feel any kind of pain.</li>
            <li>but as you keep using this machine your hair will get thinner (and it wont regrow as fast as when shaving which is the best part of this).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Wife liked it she</li>
            <li>but I returned because I dont liked, a friend told me that she bought yours on amazon, inmediatly I order one for me</li>
            <li>To be honest, it was the cost.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely use the cooling pad afterwards as well as a nice gel.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re supposed to dip the brush in alcohol each time (the rubbing kind, not the Pinot Grigio)</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re supposed to dip the brush in alcohol each time (the rubbing kind, not the Pinot Grigio)</li>
            <li>Braun Silk-epil 5280 is a nice product.  </li>
            <li>It helps to twist the head while running it under warm water.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>I used a Vine pick on this epilator thinking that it might come in handy for the removal of chest hairs, which I periodically like to remove.</li>
            <li>and she liked it,</li>
            <li>I can honestly say there was no pain on my legs.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shave perfect but it works when you are in a pinch and don&#x27;t want to use a real razor in the shower.</li>
            <li>In this case, happy wife &#x3D; happy life because she was able to report that the Silk-Epil 5280 is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Definitely a nice feature, though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a nice feel to it, and fits in the hand nicely.  </li>
            <li>Does the job nicely.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m thrilled that I did.  </li>
            <li>and I was good :)  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Shape of the unit fits nicely in the hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I Love it so much! :D</li>
            <li>Allin all a very good product worth it the cost :)</li>
            <li>this new model is just great!</li>
            <li>THe best part was that the new hair that grew were lighter and thinner than previously.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is good and easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I must add that Amazon is great in letting me return the product and refund me so quickly, so I could buy another one (not Braun).</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>The cord falls out very easily.  </li>
            <li>On to the specifics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LEGS \\&quot;Removes hair as fine as a grain of sand\\&quot; is probably overstating it, but it does as good a removal job on my lower legs as waxing did.</li>
            <li>Worked well, once I figured out what angle was most effective.  </li>
            <li>There are two speed options and a light which does a good job lighting up the area.  </li>
            <li>and wow... it really is awesome.</li>
            <li>but you honestly have to be able to handle pain.</li>
            <li>This model replaced my old epilator and does a superb job.  </li>
            <li>was good and free of defects.</li>
            <li>The packaging is nice as well :)</li>
            <li>Just to compare, I Always uses Satinelle from Phillips (for more than 10 years), and never had this kind of problem.</li>
            <li>It would sure be nice if it were.</li>
            <li>the epilator just couldnt grasp the hair strands - probably because its very fine.</li>
            <li>Excellent - really does the job quickly!</li>
            <li>The good news is, pain will subsides significantly after repeated uses.</li>
            <li>Wow it&#x27;s an amazing epilator with a brilliant design.</li>
            <li>It works better, faster, and more effective.</li>
            <li>The built-in light is awesome and very helpful</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this distributor :)!</li>
            <li>am really very pleased with this item, my legs are smooth and there are NO stubbles.</li>
            <li>The recommendation is to use the razor to trim longer hair to a length 2-5mm that is most suitable for epilating.  </li>
            <li>I researched a lot before picking one and this was a great one for first time users.</li>
            <li>Worked great for first use.</li>
            <li>You can also wash the top part of it very easy, which makes it time saving and more sanitary.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Tweezer accuracy: The 40 tweezers on this unit are very accurate at locating and plucking hairs.</li>
            <li>Once I figured that out, my epilation went very smoothly.  </li>
            <li>very comfortable to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works when is done very lightly.</li>
            <li>Mine clicked in very securely and hasn&#x27;t fallen out.</li>
            <li>It is VERY important to keep the skin</li>
            <li>It is VERY important to keep the skin</li>
            <li>Whereas those who have more experience with this TYPE of product seem to be pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>Luckily, this product seemed a good in-between and it doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, effective and so much better than shaving.</li>
            <li>In comparison to my previous epilator which was good, id say this one is EXCELLENT.</li>
            <li>I think you&#x27;ll be happy with your choice, and that it&#x27;ll last you for many, many years of happy hair removal! ; )</li>
            <li>: a good purchase for first timers!</li>
            <li>finer hair works better on slower speed.  </li>
            <li>For me, it works better on my arm pits than my legs.  </li>
            <li>It pulled most of the hairs from the root.</li>
            <li>but it is still better than shaving.</li>
            <li>I epilated two days in a row to make sure that I had gotten every hair.  </li>
            <li>for pain, it feels like a bug bite, nothing more.  </li>
            <li>Simply love it</li>
            <li>Only has 2 speeds, but works perfectly.</li>
            <li>sometimes it chews my skin, mostly at knees and elbows.</li>
            <li>You need to get used to how to effectively hold it and tilt to a more comfortable</li>
            <li>I have used an epilator for many years on my legs.  </li>
            <li>it won&#x27;t hurt more than it already has, and it might work</li>
            <li>Love Love This.</li>
            <li>love my armpits, there is no trace of hair now</li>
            <li>I like this better than waxing because you plug it in and use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Therefore, we would have to spend more time for shaving.</li>
            <li>It is a perfect product of Braun, if you are net looking for a cordless epilator.</li>
            <li>I love this one.  </li>
            <li>I think I will just stick with a razor :)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got the corded model, as I read the reviews on the cordless and the wet/dry models and how they were running out of power.</li>
            <li>and it never got me as smooth as the Silk Epil!</li>
            <li>It also is NOT water proof or able to use in water so if that&#x27;s a problem too, don&#x27;t get this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The epilator is an alternative to waxing if you want a more permanent solution (compared to shaving).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I could cover more ground with each row, but I did like that the head pivots</li>
            <li>They seem to pick up the hairs better and do a more thorough job without breaking hairs.  </li>
            <li>so I shave and then shave maybe one more time the week after</li>
            <li>I love Braun products and they always deliver</li>
            <li>I have suggested this product to many friends</li>
            <li>The rotating head also now pivots which better follows the contours of your body.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know why these aren&#x27;t more mainstream amongst Americans.</li>
            <li>only pet peeve is the button which would best be described as a dial.</li>
            <li>For me, this does a better job than the Emjoi</li>
            <li>There are too many parts that can be opened up and cleaned in this</li>
            <li>It works better than another more pricier brand.</li>
            <li>I LOVE  </li>
            <li>couldn&#x27;t be better.</li>
            <li>Worked perfect for the couple of times I actually used it.</li>
            <li>I know it will be replaced, and I know that I love Braun epilators.  </li>
            <li>but I swear, it gets better.</li>
            <li>i had to go over each section 2 or 3 times to make sure all the hair is gone.</li>
            <li>The Silk Epil is a fabulous alternative!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I got this razor from bzzagent for free because there is no way I would of paid money for this!</li>
            <li>ANYWAY I love this epilator.</li>
            <li>then it&#x27;s significantly better.</li>
            <li>Even better have a glass of wine before.</li>
            <li>It is ok.</li>
            <li>i thought that no shipping fee because item was more than 35 $.</li>
            <li>/&gt;By the time that broke, I had discovered Amazon shopping, and after reading many reviews, I bought a Panasonic ES2067W Ultra Epilator,</li>
            <li>I have to say I love it.  </li>
            <li>but now you need to make sure you do it.</li>
            <li>Make sure the cable &amp;#34;clicks&amp;#34; into the machine.</li>
            <li>I love the buzzer/shave attachments for grooming as well.</li>
            <li>Sure.</li>
            <li>I use it mostly on my leg but have also used it on my underarms.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to go a week without touch ups.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this product, yes it might pinch a little,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>The construction of this Braun is definitely more durable than the Epilady but in the end...</li>
            <li>love braun products.</li>
            <li>I am IN LOVE with this product.</li>
            <li>I put my foot on my thigh so that I could see my legs better</li>
            <li>Love the light torch...!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed you can get better products out there.  </li>
            <li>This epilator eliminates most of the leg hair in one swipe.</li>
            <li>So, I got my glass of favorite Pinot Grigio and got to work.  </li>
            <li>One more gulp of the Pinot Grigio</li>
            <li>You can get the Wet/Dry model 7181 for about $20 more than the cost of the 5280.  </li>
            <li>You can get the Wet/Dry model 7181 for about $20 more than the cost of the 5280.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I did.</li>
            <li>The epilator itself is really nice, the light helps alot.</li>
            <li>appreciate everyone&#x27;s reviews as it had made me more educated on the process and the product</li>
            <li>Please make sure you pull your skin apart as you move to get maximum results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It removes hair effectively and leaves your skin smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using epilators for many years now.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much better than shaving</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>You have to go over the spot more than once</li>
            <li>Read instruction for more.</li>
            <li>What a relief not having to shave more often.</li>
            <li>It helps you see so many hairs that you would otherwise miss.</li>
            <li>I am not spending any more time on hair removal now</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are better epilators out there, one&#x27;s that don&#x27;t make you scream in terror.</li>
            <li>more slowly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love my epilator</li>
            <li>A slinky cord would have made a lot more sense</li>
            <li>I love this epilator.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that this model is not waterproof and does not run off the cord, but for the price it was a great buy!</li>
            <li>I chose the Emjoi because I wasn&#x27;t sure if epilating was going to be my cup of tea and didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune to find out</li>
            <li>breakage: make sure you&#x27;re using the appropriate speed for the hair</li>
            <li>breakage: make sure you&#x27;re using the appropriate speed for the hair</li>
            <li>And it is better than shaving, the epilation lasts even more and (like I heard)</li>
            <li>Many years ago, I had an epi-lady.  </li>
            <li>Love that it came with the attachments and ice pack too.</li>
            <li>Love the Braun product line.</li>
            <li>When you consider the investment in time (going for the treatments) and finances required for waxing, electrolysis and laser hair removal treatments, epilation is the most efficient in both respects.  </li>
            <li>I can see more or fewer hairs depending on my perspective.</li>
            <li>But the downside of that is, it is using so many \\&quot;tweezers\\</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like cheap laser hair removal that takes months to be effective.</li>
            <li>I do wish I had bought a better quality epilator, though, as this one just doesn&#x27;t do the job well.</li>
            <li>It mostly breaks the hairs off at the root</li>
            <li>/&gt;First time epilating my underarms, I was able to get rid of atleast ninety five percent of the hair I had</li>
            <li>With Ice Glove is much better.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>but most people cant handle the pain.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using epilators for many, many years now, and Braun has been my go-to brand since my college years.</li>
            <li>Because of it I don&#x27;t think there is a better brand out there for epilators.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li>So much better than the one I bought 6 years ago.</li>
            <li>and it still works, make sure that you hear a click when plugging in the power cord to the epilator</li>
            <li>I have used Braun silk epils for more than 14 years</li>
            <li>I tested the trim function, and it worked ok.</li>
            <li>think the pain will get better with the use, so I will keep giving a try.</li>
            <li>The trimmer could be better.</li>
            <li>Sure beats waxing every 4 weeks.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>it gets most of the hairs if not all of them.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that if the hairs are over 3 or 4mm it hurts more for some reason (armpit area), so if they are I trim them with the trimmer and then epilate.</li>
            <li>I would like with batteries as that is what I was used to, but I guess its better this way, I was just not expecting it.</li>
            <li>The shaver seems okay</li>
            <li>Most of the hair on my body is where it belongs - on my head, and ummm...</li>
            <li>Have been in use for more than a year and there is no problem.</li>
            <li>and it seems to work just ok.</li>
            <li>though so maybe i just need more practice.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>but this is even better.</li>
            <li>I think you&#x27;ll be happy with your choice, and that it&#x27;ll last you for many, many years of happy hair removal! ; )that up with the application of a cotton ball soaked in rubbing alcohol, to clean and sterilize the tweezers on the heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Clean the epilator head before and after each use with warm water AND rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li>Overall this is just a great product that I&#x27;m super happy about.</li>
            <li>The LED light makes it very easy to spot any missed hairs.</li>
            <li>Still a pretty good product though.</li>
            <li>They include a cooling glove that is used right before you epilate and it makes the process much more enjoyable!</li>
            <li>So far, so good - never had a Braun before - I had THE original Epilalady forever, until it just started to fall apart - loved it</li>
            <li>Thank you so much ,, shipping amazing and the item amazing 😍</li>
            <li>It does a nice job quickly</li>
            <li>For best results, wash your skin with water, dry it, and even apply a prep containing alcohol or another astringent.</li>
            <li>And I used it at the \\&quot;recommend length\\&quot; - easy to do as a stay-at-home mom. :)&lt;</li>
            <li>break the bank and let someone wax you nice and quick.  </li>
            <li>I preferred the cap with the rollers as it was more comfortable and seemed to be more</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and to clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>To me it was well worth the 15 dollars more than the Emjoi I purchased a month before!</li>
            <li>, the light and the trimming head are useful, but if we&#x27;re honest I think the most worthwhile is the pivoting head feature.</li>
            <li>and when it did it was much more fine.  </li>
            <li>I did however pop the epi head off and attach Shaver head to make sure it did work fine.  </li>
            <li>skin was clean of hair!</li>
            <li>The light is nice, but I&#x27;ve found that it doesn&#x27;t magically make every hair super visible.</li>
            <li>Braun is very good, not too big and efficient.&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li>I LOVE the light on it.  </li>
            <li>And the light, oh the light!</li>
            <li>Also the light works--I&#x27;m seeing the missed hair better.  </li>
            <li>After careful comparison, the Braun seemed like the best choice for the price, based on the reviews</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it has the light, so you can see better.</li>
            <li>more comfortable and fewer hairs were missed.</li>
            <li>It is quicker, more efficient, and has the light to help you see finer hairs.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it has a light as well</li>
            <li>It is great leaving skin soft</li>
            <li>Make sure your hairs are grease free</li>
            <li>The light on the front is my favorite feature of this model.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a better option than shaving, though it doesn&#x27;t leave you all smooth.  </li>
            <li>Thought this is a great update to my old model.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it works very well and should you choose an epilator, this would be a good one.</li>
            <li>Over all, this product really does a good job.</li>
            <li>This model had good reviews and the price was reasonable.  </li>
            <li>, you don&#x27;t feel any pain and also it is so easy to clean!</li>
            <li>braun makes great products thanks a lot super</li>
            <li>The product is good, easy to handle and fast worker.</li>
            <li>The rollers and the light are a bonus over my old model, and the trimmer/shaver is great.  </li>
            <li>It can remove the hair on my feet easily.</li>
            <li>easy to attached.</li>
            <li>but now it&#x27;s easy to use and don&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to handle the epilator because of this.</li>
            <li>The circle power button doesn&#x27;t make it easy to turn on and off.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use - just plug into an outlet.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>The most soothing thing you can do post-epilating is to apply a good natural lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The most soothing thing you can do post-epilating is to apply a good natural lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works well and comes apart easily for cleaning.</li>
            <li>No pain at all, it made hair removal so easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use with my nondominant hand, too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use with my nondominant hand, too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used an older version of Braun slik epil for years and loved it.</li>
            <li>I used to have an older version of the Silk-epil that I loved.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and found that the first couple of times I used this product it broke more hair than it pulled.  </li>
            <li>I give it four stars because, with some tolerance for pain and a willingness to invest time, it can be pretty effective.</li>
            <li>this is a pretty nice product like any Braun product..</li>
            <li>I think that itchy bumps were  just the Panasonic one, as it tweezed in multi directions.&lt;br /&gt;Hands down, this Braun silk epil is the best I have ever tried and owned, as I summarized above.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m totally new to epilating, so I felt that this was a good product.</li>
            <li>But this is supposed to be a good epilator for new users</li>
            <li>Now my legs hair is too fine</li>
            <li>It worked fine</li>
            <li>Smooth finish and the rotating head makes it so easy.</li>
            <li>The device now has a comfortable ergonomic shape that fits easily into your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>
            <li>Any medium fine hairs don&#x27;t get picked up.</li>
            <li>Everiything was fine.</li>
            <li>i used the device to remove medium to fine hairs on my arms -</li>
            <li>i must say if you use the epilator it hurts depending on area for arm hairs is fine but legs, underarm is torture</li>
            <li>This was easy to use once I got over the horror of the sound.</li>
            <li>but I imagine they will be fine.  </li>
            <li>money).&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair</li>
            <li>However, waxing works fine in that situation.</li>
            <li>I had had it for years and it still worked fine.  </li>
            <li>epilator body is comfortable in the hand, and the buttons, and head release, are positioned where they are easy to reach while using the unit.</li>
            <li>Works great and is pretty much pain free.  </li>
            <li>The product was easy to use, easy to clean and something I would want to use again!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The world of epilators seems to revolve around two kinds of pricing - super cheap dinky units, and pricier units from top name brands.</li>
            <li>This is a good product however not as good as my previous one</li>
            <li>epilator is effective, easy to use, easy to clean and the cooling glove is very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;ve never hated anything in my life, I most certainly do now!</li>
            <li>works very good and soft, I really like it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- huge surface area for faster hair removal&lt;</li>
            <li>Its easy to clean and runs smoothly.</li>
            <li>body was silky smooth for 3 days straight, and then on the 4th day, I could kind of feel a difference.</li>
            <li>but I must say this is a huge improvement.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t seem as accurate with the &#x27;plucking&#x27;.</li>
            <li>The heads clean easily under water.  </li>
            <li>Great epilator; would give it 5 stars if only it was cordless.&lt;br /&gt;Still getting used to it, but results are great!(:&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still felt smooth.  </li>
            <li>It definitely hurt under the arms, but was great for everything else.</li>
            <li>Pulling hairs out of your body isn&#x27;t where you want to go cheap</li>
            <li>This comes with a cheap, drawstring bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got this one next and was a happy girl again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to wait two days and try it again to see if I can get completely smooth results.</li>
            <li>So I had a girl field-test this for me and give me her detailed opinion.  </li>
            <li>The pain is great, but if you&#x27;re starting out, it would be something you&#x27;d get used to (there&#x27;s no way around it -</li>
            <li>and I do use it to get a smooth bikini trim.</li>
            <li>I also get a light skin rash when I am in the sun which started around the time I got the Braun epilator</li>
            <li>I found that this pivoting cap was extremely comfortable to use and that the rollers helped guide the hair towards the tweezer-plates.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soooo smooth.</li>
            <li>I received this epilator free from Braun to test and review.</li>
            <li>the pivoting head helps get hairs on kneecaps and the light helps you see your progress.</li>
            <li>Skin is smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to cheap out and get a bag epilator and judge all others by that either.</li>
            <li>It works fantastic and I like the Additional accessories.</li>
            <li>I used the Braun Silk 5 Epilator in an attempt to have constantly smooth legs.</li>
            <li>Also its easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The built in light is hugely helpful.</li>
            <li>Some people say it can cut the hair, but I&#x27;ve looked at the hairs while cleaning (to make sure it was worth the pain, you know) and</li>
            <li>weeks of smooth skin is an overstatement.</li>
            <li>SMOOTH SKIN:&lt;br</li>
            <li>After using this epilator, my legs were SILKY SMOOTH.</li>
            <li>and when I did that my foot literally slide off my leg because of how silky smooth my leg was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it on my arm and legs and my skin is smooth and no grown in hair .</li>
            <li>The light allows me to catch the missed hairs.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and the pouch stows all parts together in one place.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing device that really gets the hair out.</li>
            <li>It uses a massging system so it is about as close to comfortable as an epilator</li>
            <li>Only porble is,that before you use hte epilator, you need to wipe your skin and effect will be great.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t get a baby smooth result.</li>
            <li>I was prepared for some discomfort, but in return I&#x27;d hoped for smooth skin.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but it may turn out to be more useful to me than the epilator head.</li>
            <li>It is so helpful for getting really smooth results.</li>
            <li>light:</li>
            <li>Fortunately for me I did not buy this unit to use as a shaver so this isn&#x27;t a deal breaker for me but is something to consider if you plan to use this attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find the efficiency cover easier to use as it&#x27;s smooth</li>
            <li>, it is easy to use and clean it.</li>
            <li>Oh, the light that comes in the machine</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have an issue with the pain as it was fairly light for me.</li>
            <li>This Braun is a rare exception because it is both affordable and a top quality brand name.</li>
            <li>The light on this model is quite helpful.  </li>
            <li>But when I saw this was available</li>
            <li>I read through a lot of reviews and decided to purchase this one because I didn&#x27;t want something too cheap but also didn&#x27;t want something too</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to clean -</li>
            <li>It is extrememly important that the epilator does not contact with water while it is plugged</li>
            <li>I prefer the one with a cord because it lasts a lot longer and still has the light on it.</li>
            <li>but the light is a nuisance which I cannot turn off.</li>
            <li>It does not leave your legs completely smooth because it does not always pull the hair from the root.</li>
            <li>I was prepared for the epilator to sound like a jet engine</li>
            <li>I also got pinched once or twice before I realized just how important keeping the skin taut was.</li>
            <li>that it has a light on it</li>
            <li>I used one without the a light before</li>
            <li>did a fantastic job.</li>
            <li>Overall, its a great product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a nice size, aesthetically pleasing; the built-in light really helps.</li>
            <li>For a young person, this would be a good fit.  </li>
            <li>Its been couple of months so far so good.</li>
            <li>Hair pull is also not as good as old one did</li>
            <li>just used this on my arms for the first time and it was so easy!</li>
            <li>, if you do it right before you go to bed, it&#x27;s much better.  </li>
            <li>She was able to understand and use it right away and just loves it.  </li>
            <li>The pain was so great, that she was not able to do more than a 3x6\\&quot; square on her leg!  </li>
            <li>the head that keeps chaining according it direction is very useful.</li>
            <li>Eventually, you need it very rarely.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s very worth it.</li>
            <li>After a week or two more on the lower setting, I hope to be brave enough to go up to the higher</li>
            <li>Wow the first I used this my eyes watered but it did a great job.  </li>
            <li>and i would recommend this one to anyone looking for a quick and easy hair removal.</li>
            <li>Braun wins hands down for the best!</li>
            <li>Maybe my expectation was set kind of high</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean - just remove the top, open, and run the head under warm water.</li>
            <li>it was working perfectly until I moved to USA and because of the voltage difference it didn&#x27;t work properly, so it was time for me to get a new one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with Braun&#x27;s epilators, and I feel that their changes to their epilators have only added to their offerings, and made them that much more appealing to anyone looking to have hairless skin for many, many days at a time (about five for me, on average).</li>

            <li>glides a lot more easily and doesn&#x27;t hurt quite as much.</li>
            <li>device itself is fairly straightforward to use: you attach either the epilating head and epilate to your heart&#x27;s content, or attach a shaving head to trim the hair if it&#x27;s too</li>
            <li>I was really excited to receive this epilator....</li>
            <li>Well worth the price I paid!</li>
            <li>Silk-Epil 5 now has 40 tweezer-plates on its rotating head, many more and more closely placed than earlier models.</li>
            <li>However, with the lower speed you will have to go over the area more times than with the higher speed.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t notice any significant hair breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t notice any significant hair breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cool light that lets you see hair</li>
            <li>I did read it&#x27;s better to get them waxed first</li>
            <li>so if you aren&#x27;t you might be ok with this, but I still would expect it to pull all hair the first time through...</li>
            <li>Shave really clean and super comfortable once you get used to epIlator</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, efficient and quick.</li>
            <li>My wife tell me it can clean the hair，but</li>
            <li>before i could get a clean look -</li>
            <li>It does a clean job.</li>
            <li>Is the silky smooth hair free skin worth the pain?</li>
            <li>Okay - I think my old one was better.  </li>
            <li>only thing that is not as good is that older models came with a nice zipper case.</li>
            <li>Since the Epil 5280 is recommended for those new to epilating, I thought this might be a good option for more sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li>This is the best epilator I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;twice as fast as my other epilators.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Really removes all hair, easy to use, easy to clean</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t have to if I didn&#x27;t want to be super silky smooth, and it&#x27;s just a quick shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While I was scared at first (it sat in the box under my sink for two weeks before I was brave enough to give it a go)</li>
            <li>I received aBraun Silk epil 5 epilator to try and overall, I am pretty happy with it.  </li>
            <li>The light is a fantastic addition and the pivoting head is so much better than my old one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a happy user of Braun, and am willing to encourage anyone that&#x27;s considering starting epilation to give this Braun epilator a try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a happy user of Braun, and am willing to encourage anyone that&#x27;s considering starting epilation to give this Braun epilator a try.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slightly more efficient and generally I don&#x27;t have to make many passes to get rid of stubborn hairs.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The maintained spots also weren&#x27;t as smooth as the freshly epilated patches.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I would use the trimmer/shaver as I didn&#x27;t on my old Braun, but this one is nice</li>
            <li>/&gt;*it does a really good job actually removing the hair with speed and efficiency&lt;</li>
            <li>Great piece of engineering, works very efficiently and well thought features like the light to brighten up skin areas, ergonomic handling, simple design, water proof when cleaning.</li>
            <li>me personally, is seems to be a good beginner epilator.  </li>
            <li>It is a good investment for someone who needs regular waxing.</li>
            <li>Good product overall~</li>
            <li>I compared several versions of this online at Amazon and settled on this model because the price was good</li>
            <li>one has the potential to be good, but it just doesn&#x27;t grab all the hair.  </li>
            <li>Really recommend this one :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Absolutely cool the included gel pad before you use the 5280, and use the pad afterward to sooth your skin and minimize an irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are going to do a quick shave after epilating, clean you razor before and after with rubbing alcohol, and spray yourself with witch hazel after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to say it really pulls most hair out even shortest one.</li>
            <li>This one works great, and is especially good at removing thin, short hairs.</li>
            <li>the head unit being full of plucked hairs (explained under cons).</li>
            <li>It had a trimmer you could add on which was cool.</li>
            <li>It was not painful at all</li>
            <li>The angular head and the light are really useful features.</li>
            <li>I am used to the pain and pinching feeling, so basically it&#x27;s painless for me which is not bad at all.</li>
            <li>The main disadvantage of the epilator is that it doesn&#x27;t leave a very clean line, so if that&#x27;s important to you, you&#x27;ll have to tweeze, or edge with some waxing.&lt;br</li>

            <li>I liked it at first because it left my skin very smooth</li>
            <li>First o all, the tweezers don&#x27;t remove the hair easily.</li>
            <li>For someone starting out, ie: a young girl with fair hair who wants to go this tweeze-hair route, this might be a good product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;*the little light is a great plus (I never realized I missed that feature so</li>
            <li>I ended up spending an hour every other day just trying to maintain from my ankles to my thighs and the results weren&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li>Other than that great product.</li>
            <li>I hurts like a B for the first few times, but it gets much better and 4he results are great.</li>
            <li>My first epilator, I used it several time till now and very happy so far.</li>
            <li>I used many, even cheaper and from less reputable companies, alternatives that were wayyy much better than this one.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair on my arms and what there is is pretty fine, so</li>
            <li>This product is quite convenient and quick.</li>
            <li>arrived quickly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lucky if it catches one hair.  </li>
            <li>for the performance, I feel like this epilator is able to get finer hairs than my older model.</li>
            <li>I can get away with epilating once a week, with a quick shave afterwards to get silky</li>
            <li>Particularly if you&#x27;re on a budget, I would give this epilator a try before going for more costly methods.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pulling so many hairs at once that it feels more like an overall numbing sensation rather than pain.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps the smaller, more egg shaped one would be better.</li>
            <li>The light is a very useful improvement and the tweezers make your job much faster.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe my hair is finer than most, but on the high setting it seems to break the hairs rather than pull them out.</li>
            <li>You epilate without any after Redness!smooth and truly Helpfull the guidance light ;-))</li>
            <li>This is my very first epilator and it is a breeze to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s my very first time epilating</li>
            <li>This is my very first epilator that I bought</li>
            <li>The two differnt epilation caps are fun to use as one of them massages the skin, which I found interestingly cool.</li>
            <li>easily used,  cleaned, quick to finish  even if you want to use on whole body</li>
            <li>It has a light, which ended up being much more useful than expected and my favorite part of the product.</li>
            <li>Although my skin has habituated to an epilator, this new model is more efficient.</li>
            <li>i am glad to listen and try out some new tactics.</li>
            <li>With the new epilators they have incorporated a better attachment system so the head engages with the motor all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My previous one was silk-epil 3 which worked great</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re still going strong, so if mine lasts as much</li>
            <li>I have been using Silk epil for many years but a very old model.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time hurt!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li>Your skin will swell, will feel hot and irritated, but it will be gone when you wake up!  </li>
            <li>Going over the same spot repeatedly doesn&#x27;t seem to get many more hairs out than you got on the first pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bottom line, it turned out that this new Braun purchase was a good choice to replace my old model.</li>
            <li>But this is the best personal care item I&#x27;ve purchased in a very long time.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how much I love this new one better than my old one.  </li>
            <li>Works very well for fine hair and almost painless.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The most important point to remember about epilating is that the more you do it, the less you need it.</li>
            <li>I have had laser hair removal, so a lot of my hair is colorless, and the light helps so much to catch that.</li>
            <li>Only time will tell if I&#x27;ll be brave enough to try it on my underarms.epilating didn&#x27;t get my legs completely smooth</li>
            <li>My mom said that she used to have an epilady,but had recently thrown it out because even though she said it work amazingly</li>
            <li>The light is very helpful.</li>
            <li>works as you would expect, the light is really helpful.</li>
            <li>Really like the dual speed and the light.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m satisfied, my underarms are smooth and I can&#x27;t see the hair below the skin</li>
            <li>She used to have an old Silk-epil 3, and she says that this one is much better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;100% worth the price.</li>
            <li>It hurts but the result makes it all worth it.</li>
            <li>I did not know if it happened because I had hair stuck in the motor and that terminated its success?</li>
            <li>The shaver head is a nice extra although I haven&#x27;t used it yet.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m happy with the overall result.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it wasn&#x27;t worth the time</li>
            <li>Nice upgraded model from what I used earlier which is the 300 series.</li>
            <li>As far as ease of use, it doesn&#x27;t get any better than this one.  </li>
            <li>I also noticed that a good many of the negative comments are that epilators hurt or that they caused ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Totally worth the $50</li>
            <li>The only nice thing is that you can take the head off and wash it, but I do not recommend it.</li>
            <li>I love this product and use it frequently.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>This is the best $50 I have spent recently.  </li>
            <li>Its totally worth it.</li>
            <li>but regardless is something nice to have at home as it comes with extra heads to change functionality</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t forget that even your own hair grows at different rates!</li>
            <li>are you should be golden.</li>
            <li>worth it if you but the effort in.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;it is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It will be a week or two before I can tell if there&#x27;s any more breakage (rather than removal from the root) than with my old unit</li>
            <li>but so far I love this thing.</li>
            <li>If you stretch you skin and epilate as per the instructions it will be a far better experience.</li>
            <li>Highly worth it, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experience far more razor bumps and ingrown hair from this epilator than I ever have with shaving or waxing.</li>
            <li>price is also economical....</li>
            <li>For the parts of my body that are more sensitive</li>
            <li>All the alternatives to shaving require some degree of pain tolerance, but this is one that allows you to go at your own pace, at your convenience in the comfort and privacy of your home - and at a much lesser price.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because it was recommended to me by a friend and it was definitely, definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I love it for my legs and hands very easy and less pain.</li>
            <li>Words cant explain how much this hurt epilating my legs the first time!!  </li>
            <li>I think the fact that it&#x27;s not a shock of pain (like in waxing), and that I can easily control where the epilator goes allows me to be a lot more comfortable with the feeling that epilating induces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose Braun as my brand of epilator because it was constantly coming up in reviews for the top epilator brands, and because they have been producing the product for a very long time.</li>
            <li>Now I bough her this new product and she is very happy to have reduced the time at half for the whole process.</li>
            <li>Wish I had bought this first, quick and efficient.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not hard, but not as easy as a pressure switch.</li>
            <li>That thing is so useful, not just because it makes it easier to use on curved parts of the body but because it&#x27;s SO MUCH EASIER TO CLEAN.  </li>
            <li>It is supposed to be better, but I don&#x27;t like it as much as the older series.</li>
            <li>Being able to epilate wet skin while actually in the shower adds a distinctive edge to successful epilation with a minimum of pain.</li>
            <li>Overall, a good product that I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>but the epilalator portion doesn&#x27;t stay and the release button is right where you hold the unit.</li>
            <li>HAIRS:&lt;br /&gt;I exfoliated right after I epilated</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Shaving head to get hair to the right length for epilation</li>
            <li>tried it for the first time last night and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>Very romantic.easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend to anybody who wants a clean job  in  no time .</li>
            <li>My last one had a sliding switch that I liked a lot better, but for the most part I haven&#x27;t had much trouble accidentally turning it off or anything like that.</li>
            <li>I am giving it 3 stars only because it does do a fairly good job on my fine, menopausal facial hair.</li>
            <li>This 5280, with its three attachments, will get those new to epilation through to becoming seasoned epilator users without undue pain, and with years of reliable</li>
            <li>Easy to clean but little bit noisy :)</li>
            <li>Like the previous model, it also has a nice light which helps you see</li>
            <li>Being a brand loyal person that I am, I was sure that I wanted Silk-epil only.</li>
            <li>Dragging the Epilady along my bare shin stung more than hurt.</li>
            <li>I like it, I had the old Braun epilator and like it too, but  this one is completely different and much more better.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t tell you that it&#x27;s not painful, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as I remember.  </li>
            <li>After epilating consistently for almost 2 years, I figured an upgrade would be worth it.</li>
            <li>Do as much as you are able to tolerate (when you&#x27;re first starting out - eventually you&#x27;ll be able to use it on your whole body and you won&#x27;t bat an eyelash), apply a soothing moisturizer, and go to sleep.  </li>
            <li>and OMG does that smart!</li>
            <li>and OMG does that smart!</li>
            <li>My next epilator was the Braun Silk-Epil Super Soft which was faster and more accurate and could be used on parts of the body</li>
            <li>Super fast, painless, and my skin is the smoothest it&#x27;s ever been.</li>
            <li>Only time will tell if I&#x27;ll be brave enough to try it on my underarms.</li>
            <li>As for the ingrown hairs, you will definitely get them if you don&#x27;t keep the epilator close to the skin (the roller cap is great for this) to pluck the hair, if you don&#x27;t exfoliate regularly, and don&#x27;t moisturize your skin.  </li>
            <li>Rollers\\&quot; that are supposed to \\&quot;stimulate the skin effectively for an extra gentle epilation.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to use.</li>
            <li>and she said that this item is almost identical to the one she previously owned, and loved.  </li>
            <li>As long as the head unit is kept clear the unit does a remarkable job of plucking even the thinnest, shortest hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>epilator head on this model is also superior to previous models.</li>
            <li>On my upper legs it is light years more convenient than waxing, particularly since I have (ahem)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d had good experiences with the brand with the previous epilator</li>
            <li>Nice epiletor , small, easy to handle, bu it which it was cordless</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t say this in the manual but the first thing I did was to soak my legs in warm water and thoroughly dry them.  </li>
            <li>I like the long, easy to use cord and also the light, but I find this model</li>
            <li>as it pains very much...</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Still very very painful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The new, much appreciated, difference she felt worth mentioning was the light on it.  </li>
            <li>The SmartLight is one of the best innovations Braun has come up with - that light reveals SO much more than one could previously see with these, especially around corners and in tighter spaces, that the epilator user is just about guaranteed to get every little hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This particular epilator is the first full sized one I have owned.  </li>
            <li>I am very surprised how much better this new one is.</li>
            <li>The cord is also long and will enable you to sit on a towel in sunlight coming from a window to see fine blonde hairs better than the epilator light will allow.</li>
            <li>Great leaves my arms really smooth better than a razor but too painful for my legs</li>
            <li>I often have to do 20 or more passes on the same spot.</li>
            <li>I love how epilators keep my hairs from growing back scratchy and itchy.  </li>
            <li>;).  </li>
            <li>The first times you use it, I have to admit it seems like a rip off.</li>
            <li>It is recommended that the first couple of months you epilate once a week.  </li>
            <li>Mine arrived today and the cord was the first thing I checked.</li>
            <li>/&gt;For first time users, if you are not used to pulling your hairs with a pair of tweezers, the process involves some amount of pain.</li>
            <li>Still, using an epilator for the first times requires some learning curve.</li>
            <li>(As a first time epilator, like me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love how it pulls the coarse hairs from the roots</li>
            <li>I plan on getting laser hair removal in the future, which I hope to be a better method of hair removal than this.</li>
            <li>First time to use a Braun</li>
            <li>I summed up the results above, but for more info, read on:&lt;br /&gt;Yes, this thing works.</li>
            <li>This was my first experience with an epilator, so I had no idea what to expect.  </li>
            <li>I would say that if you are used to the discomfort of waxing and interested in trying epilating, go for this one.  </li>
            <li>This is my third epilator over many years.  </li>
            <li>My only frustration is that I can use the efficiency cap but with this I found the cap with the rollers seemed to pick up the hairs better</li>
            <li>According the my wife, this device does not work without the cord, very dissapointing!</li>
            <li>She says it is supposed to hurt the first times....</li>
            <li>Overall satisfied for the deal price we paid, but we&#x27;re still learning with it</li>
            <li>My wife loves this so much!</li>
            <li>I actually like it better than the 7 for it can never run out of battery</li>
            <li>This is my first time using an epilator</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Either way, ~$10/year vs however much you&#x27;d spend on razors and shaving cream, I say it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>first was Epilady Coil Epilator in the 90s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s slow but done a great job</li>
            <li>First time user here.</li>
            <li>many models ago, a yellow one</li>
            <li>If ur a first time user, dont be foold by the icepack and what ever it promisrs-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually too cowardly to sit through the pain of actual epilating but this thing is wonderful.</li>
            <li>The first time I epilated, I&#x27;d waited about three weeks for my hair to grow.</li>
            <li>At first I used the massage head because I was worried about the pain, but I did not feel any pain</li>
            <li>I also was interested in the part where it says it will get the finest of hairs.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Braun!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m really glad I decided to give myself a present and upgrade my silkepil!</li>
            <li>I used the provided cooling pad with my first use and felt no pain.</li>
            <li>In addition, after the first couple of uses, the device did not work as well in terms of grasping the hair.</li>
            <li>I did both my legs in 10 minutes the first time</li>
            <li>so I have not yet had to trim the leg hair first with the Shaver/Trimmer head.  </li>
            <li>It works just great on mans thick hair...</li>
            <li>This is my first time using an epilator and decided to give this one a try.</li>
            <li>I tried this out first on my legs.</li>
            <li>Plan 3 hours for the first time from the exfoliation to gettting done with both legs.</li>
            <li>You can rinse it under tap water (unplug the AC adapter FIRST), or with the included brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First will be fainful, but than fain will almost disappear.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time.</li>
            <li>As for epilating itself: I was a first time epilator when I purchased this product.</li>
            <li>Someone on Amazon recommended getting a wax first and then using the epilator for maintenance.</li>
            <li>Do legs and arms first, and then underarms, and bikini area last.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping that over time I&#x27;ll get better at it, and I&#x27;ve heard that the hairs will start to come back</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace one of the first Silk Epil&#x27;s out there.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pinching: Make sure while epilating areas with skin that could potentially be pinched you&#x27;re pulling your skin taut to avoid this.</li>
            <li>This was my first with an epilator.  </li>
            <li>Not my first epilator</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with this epilator.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Aside from these design annoyances, the device functions pretty well, so my review is mixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used to have an epilady when it first came out, so I sort of know what to expect from this type of shaver.</li>
            <li>This is the first Epilator that I have bought and used.</li>
            <li>But it does do it&#x27;s job pretty well.</li>
            <li>, none of which were exactly comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find the I setting to be more tolerable, but it requires several passes to get all the hair in a given area.  </li>
            <li>My hair was grown in two weeks from a wax, way too much to do in one sitting without passing out!</li>
            <li>This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever owned and the first time I&#x27;ve ever tried it.</li>
            <li>That said, the way it epilates is totally tolerable and feels like it&#x27;s just scratching most of the time.</li>
            <li>This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>I should mention that my first try epilating my underarms</li>
            <li>I wouldnt blame the epilator as I know and willingly agreed to tolerate the pain.</li>
            <li>First I shower and exfoliated two days in a row.  </li>
            <li>but most of the hairs were pulled from the root and they have not grown back yet</li>
            <li>It hurts like a MOFO the first</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to back off of epilating more...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to back off of epilating more...</li>
            <li>I REALLY recommend you buy this product!</li>
            <li>This Braun Silk-Epil 5280 Epilator was my wife&#x27;s first epilator, and while the product works, she did not like the pain associated with the process and would rather shave.  </li>
            <li>Clever and quick machine.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a comparison as this is my first epilator.</li>
            <li>The low setting is slower but more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to go with waxing as the lesser of the two evils!!! :)</li>
            <li>The second time I epilated my armpits was much better.</li>
            <li>The longer the hair is the more you will feel each individual hair being pulled and then yanked out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The longer the hair is the more you will feel each individual hair being pulled and then yanked out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Way better than my last one</li>
            <li>Hurts at first (like being snapped with a rubber band), but that eases up after a minute or two, once your body&#x27;s endorphins kick in.</li>
            <li>I paid a fortune for 12 laser hair removal sessions for my underarms, and while it got rid of most of the hair I still have enough stragglers to need to do something else about them.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using an epilator</li>
            <li>if this because it was my first time or not</li>
            <li>good quality and after a few times using it, you get used to the pain.</li>
            <li>This last one, the 5280, is absolutely the best of all previous models!</li>
            <li>I had never heard of epilators (what cave do i live in right?!)</li>
            <li>I have to say that my old one works better than this new one.</li>
            <li>I did have to go over the same area more than once, but that may have been due to my own resistance at first.</li>
            <li>Cleaning your epilator is easy enough; since many in this line can now be rinsed under running water, that&#x27;s an option, but I still prefer to use the brush to remove any loose hairs, and follow that up with the application of a cotton ball soaked in rubbing alcohol, to clean and sterilize the tweezers on the heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Depending on your outlook it is either awesome to see the pile of pulled hairs as you clean out the unit or depressing because reminds a person of how hairy their body really is.</li>
            <li>I actually don&#x27;t grow hair in certain places now though :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;The three star rating is largely due to the fact that this product is effective.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good item I guess if you have high tolerance for pain, but definitely not worth 60$.</li>
            <li>True, epilators do take some getting used to, but you can work up to a full tolerance and you&#x27;ll not go back.</li>
            <li>Excellent results of minimal hair re-growth after a few uses.</li>
            <li>have to admit that the leap of faith it took to use the Epilady for the first time was pretty intense.</li>
            <li>The results are better than shaving and last much longer than shaving.</li>
            <li>left me as smooth as a fresh wax.  </li>
            <li>the old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good job Braun - compact, quiet, effective and well priced.</li>
            <li>: The instructions say to always use the protective head, but it is much more effective without it, just be careful around loose skin, it can get caught up in the tweezers.</li>
            <li>make sure the hair isn&#x27;t too long (it tugs repeatedly before maybe pulling out the hair)</li>
            <li>It pretty much gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways, I was essentially looking for something to replace my old one for around the same price point, and I was happy with what I found here.</li>
            <li>I was very nervous the first time</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used any other epilator, but I like this as much as one can like something that rips out your own hair.</li>
            <li>I thought, \\&quot;Surely they&#x27;ve come a long way in [x]</li>
            <li>As this is my first epilator, I don&#x27;t really have anything I can compare it to but in my opinion, it does the job</li>
            <li>First of all, for me the pain was intense..</li>
            <li>I would have bought her a 7 series model, but this one had a very good price, and cost only half the normal price.</li>
            <li>though it hurts a bit more, I think it is only because it is doing the job the older one was not.  </li>
            <li>The Braun Silk Epilator hurts, but you don&#x27;t have the intense heat that I&#x27;ve experienced with five different types of lasers, which I find more uncomfortable, though quick.  </li>
            <li>Warm water makes the hair shaft open up, causing the shaft to release the hair more easily, so epilating either in the shower, or just post-shower, is going to be the best choice for the least painful experience.</li>
            <li>The curved shape was nice when I was still learning the ins and outs of epilating as it&#x27;s less prone to pinching</li>
            <li>(make sure your skin is completely dry first!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li>(make sure your skin is completely dry first!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li>Also, the &#x27;circular on-off&#x27; switch is not as easy to use as the &#x27;slide style&#x27; switch on my earlier model.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a lazy pain free shaver for most of my life.</li>
            <li>But this one, set on low, makes it easy.</li>
            <li>The hairs will be so strong and deep</li>
            <li>It was no worse than other epilators, and more comfortable than the old Epilady products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As someone who lives in South Florida, having smooth legs, underarms and bikini line is important year round, and I am very excited to have found an alternative to shaving which lasts much longer than a traditional shave.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping I would be able to use it as my single, all-purpose method of hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>if you want an epilator, then Braun is certainly the brand you want (this model or another) -</li>
            <li>Since this epilator can be opened to a certain extent cleaning becomes easier, just time consuming.</li>
            <li>This silk epic 5 also came with a cooling pac, a sleeve to put the cooling pac in, a tiny brush to clean your machine, a trimmer clear thing to put on top of the shaver, and</li>
            <li>I have had epiladies for many years and only bought this new one because I had to.</li>
            <li>(I have tried both cold and warm waxing), and in the long term I think it will be more cost effective.</li>
            <li>These tweezer-plates can remove fine hairs as short as 0.5mm.</li>
            <li>I have REALLY fine Asian hair</li>
            <li>I personally have fine hair on my arms</li>
            <li>The main thing is that it hasn&#x27;t died on me yet like the first 2 I had.  </li>
            <li>The epilator works decently on the underarms, but doesn&#x27;t work at all on the legs!</li>
            <li>Even though it takes a several turns for a certain area to be completely smooth, but I believe it depwnds on the the hair growth as well.</li>
            <li>Learned the hard way .. but works good on legs ha</li>
            <li>The light makes it so much easier to see where to go next.</li>
            <li>While epilating didn&#x27;t get my legs completely smooth it worked well enough that shaving my legs went much faster</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for an epilator that is accurate, can be used for extended periods of time without having to worry about recharging/replacing batteries, and you don&#x27;t mind being plugged into an outlet, I would definitely recommend this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for an epilator that is accurate, can be used for extended periods of time without having to worry about recharging/replacing batteries, and you don&#x27;t mind being plugged into an outlet, I would definitely recommend this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall though, it&#x27;s great not having to shave my armpits everyday because of this.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Still, I really like this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a very hairy person and my arm hairs</li>
            <li>This will help your hairs grow much finer.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone wanting to get rid of hair, and having smooth legs for lasting time!</li>
            <li>The trimmer is also very efficient and allows this epilator to be a 2 in 1.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I really wish it could have lasted longer</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>Epilation hurts, no way around it, but so does waxing and Epilation is much cheaper.</li>
            <li>My legs have been coarse free hair for a week now.  </li>
            <li>more pain than expected</li>
            <li>I am a man who bought this on a whim because I didn&#x27;t like how much leg hair I had.</li>
            <li>My hair density is absolutely unchanged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>does really well the</li>
            <li>The cooling pad really helps.</li>
            <li>Either way, it really hurt.</li>
            <li>I absolutely promise that the discomfort lessens with use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Silk-Epil 5 has a tiny light on the bottom.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Worked better than I had expected.</li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>you are looking to try out epilating at a reasonable price, this us the epilator for you.</li>
            <li>It sounds... intense....</li>
            <li>better than expected.</li>
            <li>Haha  </li>
            <li>I can appreciated the cooling pack being included also.</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t really remember the model number)</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li>It removed the hair fast with minimum irritation.  </li>
            <li>but the expense has become too much.</li>
            <li>so I figured it was a reasonable gamble.</li>
            <li>The amount of discomfort is no worse than waxing</li>
            <li>The Braun 5-5280 epilator is so fast that you almost don&#x27;t feel any pain.</li>
            <li>The handles that attach to it really help ease the pain.</li>
            <li>It really helps to contour to my skin</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t use the cooling pad, which may have, likely, diminished the red spots.&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer suggested Advil 30 minutes in advance, and that sounds like a great idea, but was not necessary for me.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not too much of a hassle</li>
            <li>and it does the job very well.</li>
            <li>I think I might epilate on the 6th or 7th day because today (5th day), the regrown hairs are very sparse and are about a millimeter or shorter.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take out that much hair.</li>
            <li>Its fast and efficient and I like the fact that I don&#x27;t have to lather up with shaving cream.</li>
            <li>leg hair doesn&#x27;t grow all that fast</li>
            <li>is much softer/longer than shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Less</li>
            <li>they work really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And I am very picky.</li>
            <li>The frozen gel pack really helps reduce pain by numbing the skin a bit after using the epilator.</li>
            <li>otherwise you get a bunch of partial yanks which hurts the most.</li>
            <li>It really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cooling glove: I can&#x27;t list this as a pro or a con really as it did nothing for me.</li>
            <li>tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pain: epilating by its very nature causes discomfort but doesn&#x27;t have to be unbearable.</li>

            <li>tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pain: epilating by its very nature causes discomfort but doesn&#x27;t have to be unbearable.</li>
            <li>The pain is just too much to bear for me I gave up after one leg (the vibration does nothing).</li>
            <li>Plug is very loose,detaches by the simplest touch im gona have to tape it or something because its sooo looose</li>
            <li>This model works very well and</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
            <li>, I went straight for the pits.  </li>
            <li>Quite frankly, TOO much time.  </li>
            <li>when seated so you can&#x27;t really tell if it is plugged in or not&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great for armpits and bikini area, but if you have thin hair, do not use this on that area.</li>
            <li>I have very thin/fine hair on my legs and it does not pick it up.</li>
            <li>there, I am really hoping I would get used to the pain and feeling some day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am enjoying my experience with the epilator as it does what I had expected of it except that I thought it would be chargable.</li>
            <li>but not bothering too much</li>
            <li>Easier especially with the light.</li>
            <li>Very usefull and fast.</li>
            <li>You really have stretch before using this thing.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>I really thought that will be just a gadget</li>
            <li>but&#x27; it really does help</li>
            <li>To much work.</li>
            <li>I would highly reccommend this product!</li>
            <li>It works very well.  </li>
            <li>That was a work-horse of an epilator, and frankly, I expected more from Braun.</li>
            <li>Then , reading the reviews I realized I had to really push it, it does not click, but it stays on its place.</li>
            <li>This razor is great--shaves very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It takes much longer...</li>
            <li>I also like that it has two velocities, in the armpit its nicer to go with the slower one, and on the legs the fast one is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;One comment of something I didn&#x27;t expect (which maybe I didn&#x27;t read the description fully)</li>
            <li>Where you epilate, of course, affects how intense that sensation is.</li>
            <li>Where you epilate, of course, affects how intense that sensation is.</li>
            <li>Keeping up with hair removal is much, much easier when it doesn&#x27;t involve a production.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t really SEE it, but you can sorta kinda feel</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s because there wasn&#x27;t that much hair to GRAB</li>
            <li>and I would miss so much hair</li>
            <li>so I needed a replacement but wasn&#x27;t ready to spend $100</li>
            <li>real selling point though is the pivoting head.  </li>
            <li>but I tried it on gentle</li>
            <li>But I was younger then and far more trusting.</li>
            <li>Also, is really good for delicate skins that have allergies to creams for epilate.</li>
            <li>The old one had three rows of tweezer lines and the tweezers on this version are spread out more rather in the three solid lines across.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have worn out a couple of these of a different brand and so far I can say this one does work better.  </li>
            <li>Also make sure you&#x27;re gliding slowly and giving the epilator plenty of time to pluck all the hairs in a given area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Post-epilating: Use a good natural lotion to help soothe your skin and prevent/minimize red bumps.</li>

            <li>My upper lip is a bit more sensitive</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only experienced a few instances with this unit where it passed a hair more than once or twice without plucking it and the reason for this ended up being due to</li>
            <li>It does hurt when you first start epilating, as you are basically plucking numerous hairs at once, but my skin got used to it quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This seems to be a nicely made little device and if you have the time, patience and can endure some discomfort, you will get decent results.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time I epilated, I was amazed at how smooth my skin was; it was like I had never had a single hair on my body there before.</li>
            <li>Pulls hair quickly leaving bare skin.</li>
            <li>It barely misses hairs, unless you&#x27;re going quickly over the area.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned several epilators in the past, but this one by far is the most effective.  </li>
            <li>Many of the newer models of many brands are expensive and since I was trying this for the first time, I didn&#x27;t want to invest too much money.  </li>
            <li>My other epilator is cordless and can go into the shower which I have to admit I like better.  </li>
            <li>The shaver works so much better than any other one I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li>It worked better than expected!</li>
            <li>Braun model appealed to me because it is a corded model which meant I wouldn&#x27;t be messing with swapping out batteries all the time, the tweezer head is flat, and it has an LED light which makes it easier to spot missed hairs.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t find the flaws to be significant enough to warrant deducting any stars from my rating.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t find the flaws to be significant enough to warrant deducting any stars from my rating.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d suggest to spend more and get other ones, Braun SE 5280 Silk Epil 5 Epilator</li>
            <li>I went to epilate the second time for the hairs I didn&#x27;t pull out right the first time didn&#x27;t hurt as much.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, it does not shave the hair as clean as regular razor does.</li>
            <li>At first, most women will use an epilator every few weeks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not difficult to open the head unit and brush away the excess hairs but is still an annoyance that&#x27;s worth mentioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t expect it to be cordless, based on the reviews here, and I&#x27;m fine with the long cord.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line is that hair removal comes down to personal preference, and while this is a good product, if you&#x27;ll like it or not depends on what you want from your hair remover method.</li>
            <li>I actually recommended to my mom and she bought it right away!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use in sensitive areas and definitely grabs thinner hairs.</li>
            <li>I wanted to wait until I&#x27;d been using this one for a long time, so I could give an accurate and informative review.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a nice small unit for tweezing hair.  </li>
            <li>It is nice and efficient, but I am not sure if it has better in performance than my previous one.</li>
            <li>I also now use it with the efficiency cap (which is just a little plastic cap that covers the massage rollers) because it really does seem to be more efficient that way.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this gadget!</li>
            <li>The light, shaving/trimmer head, efficiency cap and the brush were included with my old one too, but this one also comes with the cooling mitt that I honestly find is pretty useless.</li>
            <li>New growths will be thinner and much easier to pull.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t need a whole new coffee maker, just the glass pot.</li>
            <li>though it was a great idea, a way to epilate at home, but using it was torture and after a few tries I gave</li>
            <li>I previously used an epilator that had dual opposing heads, but this one works much better.</li>
            <li>use on clean dry skin straight out of a bath/shower.  </li>
            <li>I used the attachment with the massage roller, I don&#x27;t think it did anything especial in particular.</li>
            <li>Then saw this Braun with a light, which  is the only thing about my old Braun I did not like.</li>
            <li>my time using this device, I also had pretty consistent problems with in-grown hairs, which I tried to combat with daily loofa-scrubbing of the epilated areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And they are older then say, YOU.  </li>
            <li>But not for someone who is older who is looking for an alternative to shaving.</li>
            <li>I really loved it, but it is getting old and not working quite as well lately, so</li>
            <li>The main reason for her buying this was the cordless option.</li>
            <li>Eventually, it will be an occasional thing, more often than every leap year, but only when needed.</li>
            <li>And though it is an older model from Braun, it has served my need.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>The pain from the bumps is almost unbearable and are big enough to where I should consider them more as an abscess.</li>
            <li>Yesterday night, two weeks later from initial epilation, I had more growth all around.</li>
            <li>I used the have the older model</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall the Braun Series 5-5280 Silk Epil Epilator is a decent product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall the Braun Series 5-5280 Silk Epil Epilator is a decent product.</li>
            <li>electric cord continue to slide and desconnected from the main body.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve ever heard a commercial for laser hair removal, you may have noticed they tell you how quick it is, but they never mention that it hurts.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it on my legs and the hair doesn&#x27;t seem to grow back as quickly as it does after shaving.  </li>
            <li>which still did a half-way decent job.  </li>
            <li>So, if you are looking for an epilator and don&#x27;t mind some pain, this unit seems to be a decent choice.  </li>
            <li>main reason for purchasing this model was because it includes an electric razor.</li>
            <li>I actually never waxed these, mostly because I physically couldn&#x27;t since I don&#x27;t have 3 hands.</li>
            <li>I purchased this as a replacement for an older Braun model, the 5270 Xelle Silk-Epil Epilator.  </li>
            <li>Those were the two main problems I had with it.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling very smooth, and works a little bit faster.</li>
            <li>thing I like about this product is the little light that shines right on the area</li>
            <li>and all, I am pleased with this replacement and have high hopes for this epilator since the previous model lasted 5 years (and probably would have lasted longer if I didn&#x27;t snag it)</li>
            <li>The light is very handy and it wasn&#x27;t painful at all.</li>
            <li>The genius principal of the Epilady was that the metal coil would rotate and vibrate at a high speed and yank out your leg hair like an efficient electrical mower-tweezer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>One cap has \\&quot;High Frequency Massaging</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend this to others.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend buying this.</li>
            <li>I would recommend upgrading to the 7 series that can be used in water if you don&#x27;t have a high pain tolerance.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product,&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been waxing and using this sort of product for 20 years and have high expectations/standards when it comes to hair removal products.</li>
            <li>highly recommended...</li>
            <li>I would highly, highly agree with her.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for painless hair removal.</li>
            <li>And the epilator is much, much easier to run frequently over my lower legs, so those broken-off hairs are sure to get yanked out sooner or later (especially since the epilator gets hairs shorter than waxing can).</li>
            <li>I purchased this model because it got decent reviews and while a little pricey it was cheaper than most.</li>
            <li>Maybe I suffer from &#x27;too fine&#x27; hair which make it harder for the epilady to grip.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to get a good grip on it, since it&#x27;s pretty flat.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use it certain places because it can make you break out if your skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li>Just be very careful in the more sensitive areas, like under the arms.</li>
            <li>It is faster than the little ones, but it is still a lot more time consuming than shaving.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d say this epilator hurts a little bit more than Emoji&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>however and it was like when you gave birth and forgot the pain as soon as you saw your precious little baby.  </li>
            <li>This one is thankfully much improved over my old one.</li>
            <li>On my old one, it is a switch that just goes from off to medium to fast.</li>
            <li>I really like the swivel head upgrade from my old one.</li>
            <li>so I was really worried about the pain that nearly every review has talked about.</li>
            <li>It does not clear all the hairs on my legs no matter how many times I go over the same area.  </li>
            <li>We purchased this product because of the normal razor attachment.  </li>
            <li>It always left red itchy bumps that lasted for about an hr, which I thought maybe I just became more sensitive in age.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>It may take a few epliations for someone with more hair to adjust to any tweezing pain.  </li>
            <li>but this is normal.</li>
            <li>My last epilator was my first one, so I didn&#x27;t invest much money into it.</li>
            <li>But it sure beats shaving and messy waxing.  </li>
            <li>I will update after a few more weeks using it to let you guys know</li>
            <li>provided parts such as the shaverhead, and the trimmer cap is quite useful too.</li>
            <li>and I do not have to shave as often as I normally would.</li>
            <li>but since it&#x27;s one of their big selling points, worth mentioning.  </li>
            <li>Honestly though its like ripping the bandaid off vs slowly pulling millimeter by millimeter (tweezing).</li>
            <li>I can honestly say I am a bit let down because it does not get my tiny hairs like it is advertised to do....</li>
            <li>Also, dry brushing regularly with a good natural bristle brush helps to both eliminate existing and prevent future ingrown hairs.st a stationary plastic piece to pinch the hair.</li>
            <li>Also, dry brushing regularly with a good natural bristle brush helps to both eliminate existing and prevent future ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>new line of shimmery white epilators that Braun has released, including this 5280, offer just about any new, or seasoned, epilator user all of the options that they&#x27;ll want for as much hair removal as they&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li>keep in mind that, while you&#x27;re doing it less frequently than shaving, this takes more time than shaving.</li>
            <li>Over time, your hair WILL grow in finer, which can pose more of a challenge in getting the tweezers to grip the finer hair, but at that point, you might want to consider just epilating your skin when it&#x27;s dry (something that was, once, an epilator user&#x27;s only option...).</li>
            <li>So obviously I am thinking hey maybe something isn&#x27;t plugged right.</li>
            <li>I am giving it 4 star because it takes a little more time than I expected to have complete smooth skin.</li>
            <li>Less painful I was wondering if it was working and perfect that the head angles easily to conform to my legs.</li>
            <li>I found the 7.5 foot long cord to be adequate for my needs</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I find this to be well worth the minor downsides (moderate noise, cord, possible nips, sometimes more prolonged sensation of hair removal) because of the convenience it offers over waxing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I find this to be well worth the minor downsides (moderate noise, cord, possible nips, sometimes more prolonged sensation of hair removal) because of the convenience it offers over waxing.</li>
            <li>Because I noticed inconsistencies in the product listing versus what the product really seemed to be, I decided to look only at the product description listed on Braun&#x27;s own website instead of trusting the one here, and I suggest you do the same!  </li>
            <li>I have to shave every other day in order to feel smooth.  </li>
            <li>I was extremely judgmental about this until I used the device and found that the light did helpfully illuminate the area I was working on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was still really smooth, but not perfectly SILKY smooth like it had been the first 3 days.</li>
            <li>so I got a new one.</li>
            <li>I just bought this at a liquidation store for $29 new.</li>
            <li>The product is new and well-made.</li>
            <li>I shaved my legs on Sunday &amp; used my new epilator on Tuesday night.</li>
            <li>After trying to use some times, I had to buy a new one and throw this one out.  </li>
            <li>After about 3 weeks, I decided I wasn&#x27;t going to find it and should get a new one.</li>
            <li>I like my new Epilator</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re new to epilating, I still recommend an Azulene Oil for aftercare (preferred Parissa as it is non-greasy and odorless), but your preferred aftercare will do.  </li>
            <li>Quite gentle, better than I imagined, hardly use the cooling pad.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I have very fine hair that you can&#x27;t really see, if you touch my leg you can definitely feel hair and my legs were not smooth.</li>
            <li>And like previous Braun&#x27;s it is easily taken apart for cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Most importantly, its price is too expensive.</li>
            <li>The top part snags your skin and hurts like crazy and the top keeps coming off.  </li>
            <li>I had to go over the same area at least 4 times to take out a good amount of hair, and that STILL didn&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hurt a lot and the extra light on it is a big help.</li>
            <li>However, in one sitting, I managed to epilate my whole legs, my whole arms, including underarms, and my entire bikini area (Brazilian).</li>
            <li>Comes with a few different heads for close shave and a stubble kind of shave.  </li>
            <li>Kind of feels like a bunch of bees stinging you, but after a a few strokes you actually get used to  the pain.</li>
            <li>always thought an epilator was a waste for something who didn&#x27;t grow their own personal Everglades.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m left with too many noticably fine hairs even after going over my legs twice very slowly.  </li>
            <li>Also, it is very loud.</li>
            <li>However, if you are very sensitive and/or you are out of Pinot Grigio then by all means keep the massage</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to pain</li>
            <li>This also makes it really easy to accidentally overshoot the setting you want when you do turn it, since you hard to grip it kind of hard and turn it kind of hard.  </li>
            <li>I used this epilator for the first time last night, on my underarms.</li>
            <li>The first time I epilated it pulled out the hairs from the roots, but when they began to grow again it feels that it just cuts the hair because it grows back in three days</li>
            <li>when I first purchased it, I was going back and forth between the Braun, Epilady and Phillips brands.</li>
            <li>I have been epilating for a decade, time to replace my old Braun, bought the Enjoy, which for me did NOT work at all, removed only every 3rd hair.</li>
            <li>I epilate under arms, legs and the general bikini area and have found it to be very maneuverable.  </li>
            <li>face is to sensitive !</li>
            <li>and i am pleasantly surprised with the results!  </li>
            <li>However, after the first time, I find I only need to use it every 2 weeks or so</li>
            <li>It doesnt remove hair in the first run, you have to go over the same place twice or sometimes thrice.</li>
            <li>At first I thought the width of the head was much smaller but in fact, it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li>I bought mine at Walmart and took it back after my first use.</li>
            <li>With the first two uses, it did indeed work on short razor stuble.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do be sure to use a loofah or other exfoliating procedure regularly once you start epilating.</li>
            <li>All I can say is WOW!</li>
            <li>for me, epilators usually gives satisfying results but not with this product.</li>
            <li>The last time I used an epilator was in the 80&#x27;s when the Epilady first hit the market.  </li>
            <li>It took me about twenty minutes for my arms and of course, being my first time epilating, my arms are still bumpy and a bit red</li>
            <li>Worth the minor inconvenience, and I do save some time in the morning shower ablutions.</li>
            <li>especially the first time.  </li>
            <li>You can use this one without the &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; attachment: DON&#x27;T, it kind of sucked my skin into it and left a raw spot.  </li>
            <li>sensitive, thicker-skinned areas, because epilation there has just prompted too many ingrowns for me, even with the daily use of a thick sugar scrub that I make up at home (all I use is a whole LOT of granulated white sugar, and just enough of any shower gel to make up a thick, foamy paste of sugar suspended in soap - kinda the consistency of creamed butter and sugar for cookie dough, ideally).</li>

            <li>: I personally didn&#x27;t notice anything special about the softlift tips cover over the standard efficiency cover.</li>
            <li>This has a huge surface contact that you need less strokes to cover an area.</li>
            <li>It is not cordless, but the cord was long enough for me to comfortably use.  </li>
            <li>Not super comfortable but</li>
            <li>The epilator head can rotate to few degrees and this helps to remove hair easily.</li>
            <li>It seems to hurt at first, but is more of an irritating feeling that you do get used to.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend using this gadget every few days.  </li>
            <li>It should have other special features to make up for the price.</li>
            <li>I have it a year now and is still working great, hasn&#x27;t slow down.</li>
            <li>Even after multiple passes up, down, and side-to-side most hair was not removed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this multiple times and the pain is much more dull than when I first started.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, if you are a regular user of epilators I do suggest checking out the positive reviews as they may give a person with epilator experience more/better insight.</li>
            <li>On my lower legs, for example, I would describe the feeling to be like dragging sandpaper across my leg, whereas on my inner thighs, the feeling was more like being snapped with a rubber band (hard).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, discomfort was never really a problem.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately 10 passes left more than half the hair undisturbed on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>The problem with using this product vs. waxing is that waxing is one quick rip away of the hair, while I had to go over my legs several times with this epilator and there was still hair left.</li>
            <li>Electrolysis is great for small areas (such as eyebrows, upper lip, chin, etc), but would be prohibitive in terms of time and expense for larger areas</li>
            <li>There are a few fine hairs that the device missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I initially gave this product 5 stars, however, after using it for about 6 weeks I am far less pleased with my outcome.</li>
            <li>Make sure, to comletely dry yourself as well as all ghe parts that were washed under water before putting it back into place and before the epilator is turned back</li>
            <li>When you open the cap you can see that the mechanism that connect the motor to the cap has a slippery shape, and certainly will become inefficient after some use.  </li>
            <li>Now my underarms feel really smooth, but my legs are a little stubbly.</li>
            <li>cons are:&lt;br /&gt;She said it hurts a little more than waxing (which may be a matter of personal taste) and you have to use it with power cord plugged to it (unlike my shaver).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>: I am an Asian female with fine hair on my arms and thighs, coarse hair on legs under knees.</li>
            <li>(yes, I made sure it&#x27;s always the recommended length before epilating) and leaves tiny little arm/leg fuzzies.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much better at grabbing ALL the little hairs this one left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Obviously it doesn&#x27;t magically make it not hurt, but it&#x27;s a little bit of a distraction.</li>
            <li>Hair tend to break instead of being plucked clear from the roots.</li>
            <li>Now, I cant say the same the bikini area, but so far I really like it and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator, but I&#x27;ve been waxing and sugaring for several years and I generally prefer by-the-roots methods of hair removal to shaving.</li>
            <li>are long, maybe I&#x27;ll have to trim them first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned an epilator before, but this one is a whole different story.</li>
            <li>Overall, much</li>
            <li>épil epilators have been specially developed to minimize any discomfort and irritation.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>Ladies, consider this either a torture test or completely irrelevant.&lt;br</li>
            <li>for long term results, I can say that after five months of not using this device, it&#x27;s like I never used it in the first place.</li>
            <li>I replaced a 15 year old braun silk epil that broke with this model.  </li>
            <li>With my old one sometimes it would catch my skin and pinch</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think this one will (so far it hasn&#x27;t, but the design seems to prevent it as well).    </li>
            <li>epilator didn&#x27;t leave my legs completely hair-free, however, I just shaved yesterday</li>
            <li>and I have to say the results are much longer lasting than shaving.</li>
            <li>it worked well enough that shaving my legs went much faster</li>
            <li>I bought this Braun to replace my old 10+ year Braun.</li>
            <li>which my old one did not.  </li>
            <li>but lately I noticed more ingrown hairs than I ever had before.</li>
            <li>you would never want to place near an exposed rotating and vibrating</li>
            <li>My old one still works, but this one is supposed to work on even shorter hairs.</li>
            <li>The water really helps relieve the pain and open up the follicles.</li>
            <li>and it works absolutely the same.</li>
            <li>And a period after it has grown in a soft touch.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t really see a lot of hair grow back until about 1.5 weeks.</li>
            <li>, I had a Braun I bought at Macy&#x27;s in the late 90s, which lasted for about 10 years, and worked better than the Coil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, the downside is this shaver is wired, so u must be near to a elec point.</li>
            <li>I had an old one of these-</li>
            <li>I lost my old one</li>
            <li>She was using some old philips epilator for years.</li>
            <li>The only reason I pushed through is because I really don&#x27;t like shaving</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t leave the skin completely smooth either, so I&#x27;d recommend exfoliating and moisturizing the day after, which you&#x27;ll want to do once in a while to avoid a few ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>Had to replace an old one.</li>
            <li>your skin is really sensitive like mine and it hurts,</li>
            <li>I am 61 years old</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have as much leg hair as a younger person.</li>
            <li>It leaves you as soft as a Kitty.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For people whose skin is sensitive there is a glove with gel inside.</li>
            <li>It is quite loud.</li>
            <li>It also sounds like an adult product, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>It got a lot of the hairs away, which I was surprised to see.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using it for years, I don&#x27;t notice the pain anymore, but I did notice that my old Epil would miss hairs.</li>
            <li>This product, possibly because of the slower speed, didn&#x27;t cause as much discomfort as others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>For the sake of a complete review, I even tried in under my arms.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for another option for hair removal, this one not only works, but works gently.</li>
            <li>abd my legs are so soft still.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a bit loud</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not too loud that I couldn&#x27;t listen to music while epilating.</li>
            <li>So far, I have used all the provided parts of the epilator, which includes the epilator, efficiency cap, shaver head, trimmer cap, cleaning brush except for the cooling liquid and the glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, the fact that the epilator needs to be plugged in for usage requires the need to be near an outlet at all times.</li>
            <li>My old one broke and was biting me.</li>
            <li>So I decided to buy the closest thing I could find to the old one.  </li>
            <li>The old model had tweezers, but this one has one stationary side and one that moves in and out to grab the hairs.  </li>
            <li>or they are so soft I can&#x27;t feel them.  </li>
            <li>It really does work if you know how to use it properly</li>
            <li>Some may want to avoid using it on sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes my underarms feel so soft.</li>
            <li>Satinelle soft for 4 years and had to replace it because the head wasn&#x27;t working well after a while</li>
            <li>(http://www.amazon.com/Braun-SE7681-Silk-%C3%A9pil-Epilator-White/dp/B0077PLNNE/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1436110018&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;braun+epilator) I definitely think it&#x27;s worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>I really should have purchased a new one much sooner, but I kept using my previous (probably 12 years old)Epilator</li>
            <li>tryed my sister&#x27;s one from other brand and was much painless and wiredless, much practical....</li>
            <li>I had used one of the original Epiladies from long, long ago and swore I&#x27;d never try one again.  </li>
            <li>Even if I don&#x27;t get completely smooth results if it helps the hair grow back less frequently and finer</li>
            <li>but i wouldn&#x27;t necessarily recommend this particular one to a friend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.azon product page outlining the various Braun Silk-Epil models says that the Silk-Epil 5 is rechargeable.</li>
            <li>The Silk epil 5 has 2 speeds, low and high</li>
            <li>brand new Braun Silk-Epil 5 is an enormous improvement over my old Braun.</li>
            <li>I think he still wants to try it out long term and will probably be getting something to exfoliate and moisturize.</li>
            <li>This is the first epilator that I have ever used and the decision to try it came when I saw it on Amazon&#x27;s cyber Monday deals and was curious as to just what it was.</li>
            <li>Well, I used the trimming head first and, in the end, spent over two hours.</li>
            <li>For someone who is older, whose hair is thicker, and who doesn&#x27;t wax or tweeze, this product is not a good fit for you.  </li>
            <li>The middle is off, the left for regular speed and right for faster speed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Pivoting heads makes hard to do spots like knee area easy and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;-Does</li>
            <li>The product is not suitable for fine hair - it could not pull the hair strands out and ended up breaking almost 50pc of them.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>This is my 3rd Silk Epil probably over 20 years, getting used to the new design of the floating head.  </li>
            <li>It grabs the smallest of hairs, and works very fast compared to other brands I have used before.</li>
            <li>but it does leave an unattractive red \\&quot;hickey\\&quot; where the skin was pinched and obviously doesn&#x27;t feel very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Unlike the expensive cavitation machine, Braun is Braun for a reason:  good, solid history of manufacturing products.</li>
            <li>even bother with the \\&quot;extra gentle\\&quot; setting unless you&#x27;re very sensitive to pain.</li>
            <li>think I&#x27;m just a little bit more sensative to this type of hair removal system than other folks or</li>
            <li>Oh yeah, it works, but at a cost of some major torture.</li>
            <li>legs are not completely smooth after my first use, because much of the hair is still too short from just shaving 2 days ago, which is why my plan is to depilitate every day or 2..</li>
            <li>but the razor head was not sharp anymore.</li>
            <li>Sensitive areas obviously hurt more, less sensitive areas hurt less, and the longer I used it in one period,</li>
            <li>The only hair growth is new hair that is short and soft.  </li>
            <li>but I was ready to move on to the big leagues with a flat epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Can do without cooling pad though, other than that, the attachments given are useful for different functions.</li>
            <li>However, it takes quite a while to epilate such a large area and though the pain isn&#x27;t extreme, it gets hard to take to do both legs at the same time - and I am grateful I don&#x27;t need to use it on the area they indicate are more sensitive -</li>
            <li>I was able to do both of my legs in less than 30 minutes and the redness dissipated in less than 2 hours.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was my first use of an epilator, so I&#x27;m not sure if it was particular brand that sucked, or if epilators are all around not the way to go for me...</li>
            <li>I bought the other one for about the same price as this one $55, and it started slowing down after about 5 years of use, though it was mostly because it got caught on a thread that ended up tangling it up.</li>
            <li>mo3PUEZAYI0IWV5]]The video covers a lot of specifics, but here are the general highlights:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It breaks hair and requires multiple passes to clear.</li>
            <li>I did some research and changed a few things, and have not had any (or at least very many) ingrown hairs</li>
            <li>When epilating I move through a small area, then move the epilator back a bit to shine the light on the area I just epilated.</li>
            <li>for the painfulness of using it, that&#x27;s pretty much over unless you have extremely delicate skin.  </li>
            <li>The head is completely washable, which is a big plus.</li>
            <li>My upper legs are too sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just a big old baby.</li>
            <li>It recently broke after nearly 7 yrs.</li>
            <li>and I got this one because my old one was gross, but was still working.</li>
            <li>but I could barely see the difference.</li>
            <li>I kept it on my upper lip for quite awhile, hence the burn, but otherwise it shouldn&#x27;t be hot enough to burn you (unless you hold it on one spot for a long time like me!).&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li>Barely.  </li>
            <li>Apparently hurts like hell.</li>
            <li>It does not seem to pull the tiny hairs out as well as the old one.  </li>
            <li>The hair grew faster than with my old one, similar to if I would have shave</li>
            <li>My old EpiLady finally died after a number of years so this was a replacement.</li>
            <li>For a relatively hairless chick like me, it means I can be almost completely hair-</li>
            <li>When I shave, it normally grows back stubbly by the next morning.</li>
            <li>The on off switch is kind of difficult</li>
            <li>it completely died in about 6 months, which made me pretty upset, as it was not cheap at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave</li>
            <li>this is the worse epilator i ever used in my life, even shaving has a better results than this.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I&#x27;m thrilled about this product.  </li>
            <li>There is a lot of redness after epilation, so you definitely want to do your epilating at night and let your skin calm down before you have to be seen in public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It could be true if you&#x27;ve spent years using epilators, I guess, but certainly not at the beginning.</li>
            <li>I was under the impression this would yank hair out by the roots much like waxing and tweezing, but it appears to be a standard dry razor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy, not too painful after the first go, and you shouldn&#x27;t have any ingrown hairs if you&#x27;re careful</li>
            <li>I started on my lower leg on the less fleshy part first.  </li>
            <li>As I mentioned previously I was interested in this feature but didn&#x27;t have the highest of hopes as I knew it could be hit or miss.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m less interested in that.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, I don&#x27;t really use my epilator for more than the one area, so I&#x27;m not sure if some areas are more painful than others, but I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a few people complaining about the loose connector and thought this was important to point out.</li>
            <li>thing I didn&#x27;t like was the power cord came unplugged from the device very easily and the device became unplugged several times while I was using it, which wasn&#x27;t a huge deal, but it was a bit annoying once I got on a roll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>embarked on my hair removal quest in February: I intended to remove all of my body hair semi-permanently, maintaining the removal with the epilator, or at least significantly decrease the hair&#x27;s density and thickness.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I buy another one these I want to at least be worth the ingrown hairs!</li>
            <li>The pain was sharp and did not go away through the whole process.</li>
            <li>When the hair started coming in after these few days, it also wasn&#x27;t soft and fine like I had expected it to be; it was just as coarse and pointy as if I had shaved it, only it took longer to grow out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My one real qualm, and this is one I&#x27;ve had with other brands, is that it&#x27;s actually pretty bad at getting those hairs &amp;#34;as close as 0.5 mm.&amp;#34;  Rather than pluck them, the tweezers tend to break them because the hairs are too fine at that point to get a decent grip on.  </li>
            <li>but I thought for sure by now they would have improved it to be better and less painful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There were also some spots, such as my calf, back of knee, and kneecap that seemed to always have some amount of hair and never be completely smooth-feeling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t like the round control which looks nice but not nice to use</li>
            <li>I got little bumps when I first used it</li>
            <li>(Series 5-5280) does not get all the fine hairs, even after going over the area several times, and the head is not very flexible on the uneven areas like knee caps.  </li>
            <li>On the other hand, if you&#x27;re looking for modern day torture devices look no further.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and initially it took few minutes to get used to it, then I dint feel much pain.</li>
            <li>I tried it, and not only did it not work well, but it can grab and scar skin if you are not careful.</li>
            <li>I barely managed that last one.</li>
            <li>but after a while she noticed that the hairs were barely coming off even after making several passes.</li>
            <li>big difference between this one and the old different brand she had, initially there was a little&lt;br /&gt;pain</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a few months now and it was my first time ever using.  </li>
            <li>After a few weeks with my first epilator</li>
            <li>for ingrown hairs: I had a few after my first session.</li>
            <li>normally Nair or wax my legs and was curious to see if the technology had improved over the years.</li>
            <li>In the video I go over a few things you can do to reduce the pain if it is your first time.</li>
            <li>did after the first few sessions when they turn up the levels.</li>
            <li>But so did tweezing your eyebrows the first few times.  </li>
            <li>I wish it came with a soothing salve or wax for the first few uses.</li>
            <li>carefully that the overwhelming absence of any negative word in there.</li>
            <li>I tried doing it very slowly and very quickly.  </li>
            <li>The attachments that come with it are to shave more sensitive areas or very close to the skin- the later being something I haven&#x27;t tried because it looks like it would be painful.</li>
            <li>Lasts long no mess.</li>
            <li>My other epilator works very handy with rechargeable battery and can even work in the showers.&lt;br /&gt;- awkward switch.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This unit is a real improvement over previous ones.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The one benefit is that the regrowth was much smoother and less stubbly.</li>
            <li>I know ingrown hairs are normal with epilators but the Braun epilator seems to have a negative effect on my hairs because my skin on my legs used to be so much smoother with the Emjoi.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Comparatively, the Epilator isn&#x27;t quick - at least not for the legs.  </li>
            <li>My endorphins finally kicked in after the first few minutes</li>
            <li>No damage, didn&#x27;t drop it or anything other than normal use.</li>
            <li>But it definitely takes less time that waxing and very convenient to use.</li>
            <li>(the few times after it took less time because I was comfortable with the machine by then.  </li>
            <li>It only takes one or two times of getting sensitive skin stuck between the opposing heads to inspire anyone to switch to a single head epilator.</li>
            <li>So if you are thinking of getting this, then just know that it will take a little getting used to before you will really appreciate it.</li>
            <li>The other one still works, however it is made for Europe since I use to live in Europe.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Amazon delivered it very fast as usual.</li>
            <li>Takes a little longer than shaving and it really does remove extremely short hairs.</li>
            <li>so my review might be different from others who have thicker hair, but if you have really thin hair, I hope this will help you because I could not find any reviews from people with fine hair for multiple products...</li>
            <li>Second, it is true that once your skin/body \\&quot;adjusts\\&quot; to the process, it hurts less and less each time.  </li>

            <li> job.&lt;br /&gt;She told me something about the rotation being great.</li>
            <li> I checked amazon.com and saw a Philips that had great reviews and was cheaper.</li>
            <li> but if you have time this is a great hair removal technique.</li>
            <li> Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The Braun website has some great tips for using an epilator.</li>

            <li> great product - both function-wise and price-wise</li>
            <li> If you do plan on purchasing this, buying another gel pack would be a great idea.  </li>

            <li> works great</li>

            <li> but I am so happy with the purchase that I wanted to write a review.</li>
            <li> Great torture device.</li>
            <li> Odly though it does a great job of grabbing and yanking the hairs</li>
            <li> So if you get this... be brave.</li>
            <li> The epli function works great.</li>
            <li> Everything about it is great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this.</li>
            <li> I am happy with almost everything about this epilator.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> I had it for 8 years and it worked great.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s happy with this product.</li>
            <li> It is as claimed and does a great job.</li>
            <li> I had the silk-epil 5, and it was great.</li>
            <li> and the epilator did a great job.</li>
            <li> but this works great.</li>
            <li> Braun Epilator works great in hair removal.</li>
            <li> Great value for the money</li>
            <li> It works great for me</li>
            <li> happy with</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a month now and my legs feel great.  </li>
            <li> The ergonomics are great</li>
            <li> Here I use the very effective shaver that came with the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Works amazing!</li>
            <li> Amazing product!</li>
            <li> This works amazing!</li>
            <li> I use this often and its amazing!</li>
            <li> This makes it more fool-proof as you don&#x27;t have to get the angel perfect for it to work, the epilator takes care of that.  </li>
            <li> and I had no problem with it till it died after many years of doing a wonderful job.</li>
            <li> Good product at great price and all you need.</li>
            <li> She is very happy to have it too!! :)</li>
            <li> good price, lasts, and the trimmer attachment is great.</li>
            <li> product was a good surprise to her as she noticed it is very effective in removing the hair.</li>
            <li> So happy and very satisfied with product.</li>
            <li> very good and safe.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly good, but it still doesn&#x27;t catches everything.</li>
            <li> I had a good run with this one.   </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember when tweezing ever felt good...</li>
            <li> End result is wonderful and smooth....</li>
            <li> She loved it..</li>
            <li> It is so good.</li>
            <li> Heard good things about this product so decided to purchase this.</li>
            <li> Works good.</li>
            <li> The epilator is good as well</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my mom and she loved it...</li>
            <li> a good twenty years ago; maybe it gets easier as time goes by.</li>
            <li> good quality and service</li>
            <li> she loved it....</li>
            <li> guess pain is good.</li>
            <li> So, I tried it on under arm hair, and it did not do as a good as a job using a womens razor.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.</li>
            <li> It is a good epilator.</li>
            <li> Now I just have to wait and see if it&#x27;ll still work as good as it does a year from now.</li>
            <li> Everything was alright, good timing and good conditions...</li>
            <li> I loved to trimmer attachments.</li>
            <li> I personally loved it.</li>
            <li> My wife loved this one.</li>
            <li> and I know a lot of people who epilate and are a good support system as they say it gets easier with each time.</li>
            <li> I used it and its really good....</li>
            <li> its good to get it.......</li>
            <li> Good epilator.</li>
            <li> Good product and trust mark.</li>
            <li> so I knew what to expect comfort wise.</li>
            <li> good buy,  recommended  to buy.  </li>
            <li> Anyways, I figured today was a good day to put this epilator to use.</li>
            <li> I loved it.</li>
            <li> it is so good ,i like it</li>
            <li> I have been using the shaver part of it and that was a good deal.</li>
            <li> and it Works really good as i thought.</li>
            <li> still a good thing to include</li>
            <li> Anyway, I am using the tweezer head after using wax strips, for finalization, and it showed up a good plan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good product for the price.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;ll be just packed full of fuzz!!!  </li>
            <li> My wife is very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I use a body scrub from Tree Hut that does a great job and smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> So, all in all, I am happy with this product and glad I can stick with Braun epilators.  </li>
            <li> The accessories that come with this package are great- Love the concept of the gel pack for cooling and the pivoting head.&lt;br</li>
            <li> conclude, I am very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After reading many great reviews, I gave Emjoi eMagine Rechargeable</li>
            <li> This model is amazing too , a good upgrade.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be so very glad you did.</li>
            <li> The two speed settings are great and i love all the stuff it came with.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Its a good product , my wife liked it</li>
            <li> I love the light!!!</li>
            <li> This model really a great item with a nice price, I have purchased it for my wife who love it and noticed</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s for sure!</li>
            <li> Oh, boy, I love it!</li>
            <li> absolutely love my Silk Epil and would buy it again!</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> My first epilator was an Epilady that I was so impressed with the results, that I purchased a Braun because it seemed as though it would have been an upgrade.</li>
            <li> luck epilating - sure is a heck of a lot cheaper than waxing and buying razors and shaving cream all the time!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> It works so much better!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> I just love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good-not perfect.</li>
            <li> I love this item!  </li>
            <li> The packaging was great - easy to set up and get started.  </li>
            <li> Very good product and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The light is a very nice usable feature as it lets you see exactly what you are doing, and the head to trim is very nice and works great.</li>
            <li> Great product, the light makes it awsome..</li>
            <li> This epilator is amazing.</li>
            <li> However, this version is amazing</li>
            <li> Comfortable to hold, and the headlight is great bonus</li>
            <li> Keeping in mind that I bought my epilator primarily for bikini line, I am extremely happy with this product.</li>
            <li> It is really amazing.</li>
            <li> but when I tried the Braun silk epil 5, it was amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.</li>
            <li> kind of let things go</li>
            <li> and I liked the product.</li>
            <li> Having waxed my legs before I knew what the feeling of having the hair ripped out by the root would feel like, but epilating lacks the soothing factor of the warm wax.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> This comes with an epilator and shaver head which is really handy for me since I like to do both.</li>
            <li> It shaves perfectly, and SO fast.</li>
            <li> If you want a fast shaver, this is the best one I would say in existence.</li>
            <li> It would be a nice one to buy for someone using an epilator for the 1st time.</li>
            <li> liked that it is used corded &amp; cordless, and hoped the dual opposed heads would get the job done faster.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife liked it and she recommended also.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t feel any kind of pain.</li>
            <li> but as you keep using this machine your hair will get thinner (and it wont regrow as fast as when shaving which is the best part of this).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Wife liked it she</li>
            <li> but I returned because I dont liked, a friend told me that she bought yours on amazon, inmediatly I order one for me</li>
            <li> To be honest, it was the cost.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely use the cooling pad afterwards as well as a nice gel.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re supposed to dip the brush in alcohol each time (the rubbing kind, not the Pinot Grigio)</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re supposed to dip the brush in alcohol each time (the rubbing kind, not the Pinot Grigio)</li>
            <li> Braun Silk-epil 5280 is a nice product.  </li>
            <li> It helps to twist the head while running it under warm water.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> I used a Vine pick on this epilator thinking that it might come in handy for the removal of chest hairs, which I periodically like to remove.</li>
            <li> and she liked it,</li>
            <li> I can honestly say there was no pain on my legs.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave perfect but it works when you are in a pinch and don&#x27;t want to use a real razor in the shower.</li>
            <li> In this case, happy wife &#x3D; happy life because she was able to report that the Silk-Epil 5280 is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Definitely a nice feature, though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a nice feel to it, and fits in the hand nicely.  </li>
            <li> Does the job nicely.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m thrilled that I did.  </li>
            <li> and I was good :)  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Shape of the unit fits nicely in the hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I Love it so much! :D</li>
            <li> Allin all a very good product worth it the cost :)</li>
            <li> this new model is just great!</li>
            <li> THe best part was that the new hair that grew were lighter and thinner than previously.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is good and easy to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I must add that Amazon is great in letting me return the product and refund me so quickly, so I could buy another one (not Braun).</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> The cord falls out very easily.  </li>
            <li> On to the specifics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LEGS \\&quot;Removes hair as fine as a grain of sand\\&quot; is probably overstating it, but it does as good a removal job on my lower legs as waxing did.</li>
            <li> Worked well, once I figured out what angle was most effective.  </li>
            <li> There are two speed options and a light which does a good job lighting up the area.  </li>
            <li> and wow... it really is awesome.</li>
            <li> but you honestly have to be able to handle pain.</li>
            <li> This model replaced my old epilator and does a superb job.  </li>
            <li> was good and free of defects.</li>
            <li> The packaging is nice as well :)</li>
            <li> Just to compare, I Always uses Satinelle from Phillips (for more than 10 years), and never had this kind of problem.</li>
            <li> It would sure be nice if it were.</li>
            <li> the epilator just couldnt grasp the hair strands - probably because its very fine.</li>
            <li> Excellent - really does the job quickly!</li>
            <li> The good news is, pain will subsides significantly after repeated uses.</li>
            <li> Wow it&#x27;s an amazing epilator with a brilliant design.</li>
            <li> It works better, faster, and more effective.</li>
            <li> The built-in light is awesome and very helpful</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this distributor :)!</li>
            <li> am really very pleased with this item, my legs are smooth and there are NO stubbles.</li>
            <li> The recommendation is to use the razor to trim longer hair to a length 2-5mm that is most suitable for epilating.  </li>
            <li> I researched a lot before picking one and this was a great one for first time users.</li>
            <li> Worked great for first use.</li>
            <li> You can also wash the top part of it very easy, which makes it time saving and more sanitary.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tweezer accuracy: The 40 tweezers on this unit are very accurate at locating and plucking hairs.</li>
            <li> Once I figured that out, my epilation went very smoothly.  </li>
            <li> very comfortable to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works when is done very lightly.</li>
            <li> Mine clicked in very securely and hasn&#x27;t fallen out.</li>
            <li> It is VERY important to keep the skin</li>
            <li> It is VERY important to keep the skin</li>
            <li> Whereas those who have more experience with this TYPE of product seem to be pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> Luckily, this product seemed a good in-between and it doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, effective and so much better than shaving.</li>
            <li> In comparison to my previous epilator which was good, id say this one is EXCELLENT.</li>
            <li> I think you&#x27;ll be happy with your choice, and that it&#x27;ll last you for many, many years of happy hair removal! ; )</li>
            <li> : a good purchase for first timers!</li>
            <li> finer hair works better on slower speed.  </li>
            <li> For me, it works better on my arm pits than my legs.  </li>
            <li> It pulled most of the hairs from the root.</li>
            <li> but it is still better than shaving.</li>
            <li> I epilated two days in a row to make sure that I had gotten every hair.  </li>
            <li> for pain, it feels like a bug bite, nothing more.  </li>
            <li> Simply love it</li>
            <li> Only has 2 speeds, but works perfectly.</li>
            <li> sometimes it chews my skin, mostly at knees and elbows.</li>
            <li> You need to get used to how to effectively hold it and tilt to a more comfortable</li>
            <li> I have used an epilator for many years on my legs.  </li>
            <li> it won&#x27;t hurt more than it already has, and it might work</li>
            <li> Love Love This.</li>
            <li> love my armpits, there is no trace of hair now</li>
            <li> I like this better than waxing because you plug it in and use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Therefore, we would have to spend more time for shaving.</li>
            <li> It is a perfect product of Braun, if you are net looking for a cordless epilator.</li>
            <li> I love this one.  </li>
            <li> I think I will just stick with a razor :)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got the corded model, as I read the reviews on the cordless and the wet/dry models and how they were running out of power.</li>
            <li> and it never got me as smooth as the Silk Epil!</li>
            <li> It also is NOT water proof or able to use in water so if that&#x27;s a problem too, don&#x27;t get this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The epilator is an alternative to waxing if you want a more permanent solution (compared to shaving).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I could cover more ground with each row, but I did like that the head pivots</li>
            <li> They seem to pick up the hairs better and do a more thorough job without breaking hairs.  </li>
            <li> so I shave and then shave maybe one more time the week after</li>
            <li> I love Braun products and they always deliver</li>
            <li> I have suggested this product to many friends</li>
            <li> The rotating head also now pivots which better follows the contours of your body.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know why these aren&#x27;t more mainstream amongst Americans.</li>
            <li> only pet peeve is the button which would best be described as a dial.</li>
            <li> For me, this does a better job than the Emjoi</li>
            <li> There are too many parts that can be opened up and cleaned in this</li>
            <li> It works better than another more pricier brand.</li>
            <li> I LOVE  </li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t be better.</li>
            <li> Worked perfect for the couple of times I actually used it.</li>
            <li> I know it will be replaced, and I know that I love Braun epilators.  </li>
            <li> but I swear, it gets better.</li>
            <li> i had to go over each section 2 or 3 times to make sure all the hair is gone.</li>
            <li> The Silk Epil is a fabulous alternative!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I got this razor from bzzagent for free because there is no way I would of paid money for this!</li>
            <li> ANYWAY I love this epilator.</li>
            <li> then it&#x27;s significantly better.</li>
            <li> Even better have a glass of wine before.</li>
            <li> It is ok.</li>
            <li> i thought that no shipping fee because item was more than 35 $.</li>
            <li> /&gt;By the time that broke, I had discovered Amazon shopping, and after reading many reviews, I bought a Panasonic ES2067W Ultra Epilator,</li>
            <li> I have to say I love it.  </li>
            <li> but now you need to make sure you do it.</li>
            <li> Make sure the cable &amp;#34;clicks&amp;#34; into the machine.</li>
            <li> I love the buzzer/shave attachments for grooming as well.</li>
            <li> Sure.</li>
            <li> I use it mostly on my leg but have also used it on my underarms.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to go a week without touch ups.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product, yes it might pinch a little,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> The construction of this Braun is definitely more durable than the Epilady but in the end...</li>
            <li> love braun products.</li>
            <li> I am IN LOVE with this product.</li>
            <li> I put my foot on my thigh so that I could see my legs better</li>
            <li> Love the light torch...!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed you can get better products out there.  </li>
            <li> This epilator eliminates most of the leg hair in one swipe.</li>
            <li> So, I got my glass of favorite Pinot Grigio and got to work.  </li>
            <li> One more gulp of the Pinot Grigio</li>
            <li> You can get the Wet/Dry model 7181 for about $20 more than the cost of the 5280.  </li>
            <li> You can get the Wet/Dry model 7181 for about $20 more than the cost of the 5280.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I did.</li>
            <li> The epilator itself is really nice, the light helps alot.</li>
            <li> appreciate everyone&#x27;s reviews as it had made me more educated on the process and the product</li>
            <li> Please make sure you pull your skin apart as you move to get maximum results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It removes hair effectively and leaves your skin smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using epilators for many years now.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Much better than shaving</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> You have to go over the spot more than once</li>
            <li> Read instruction for more.</li>
            <li> What a relief not having to shave more often.</li>
            <li> It helps you see so many hairs that you would otherwise miss.</li>
            <li> I am not spending any more time on hair removal now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are better epilators out there, one&#x27;s that don&#x27;t make you scream in terror.</li>
            <li> more slowly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love my epilator</li>
            <li> A slinky cord would have made a lot more sense</li>
            <li> I love this epilator.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that this model is not waterproof and does not run off the cord, but for the price it was a great buy!</li>
            <li> I chose the Emjoi because I wasn&#x27;t sure if epilating was going to be my cup of tea and didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune to find out</li>
            <li> breakage: make sure you&#x27;re using the appropriate speed for the hair</li>
            <li> breakage: make sure you&#x27;re using the appropriate speed for the hair</li>
            <li> And it is better than shaving, the epilation lasts even more and (like I heard)</li>
            <li> Many years ago, I had an epi-lady.  </li>
            <li> Love that it came with the attachments and ice pack too.</li>
            <li> Love the Braun product line.</li>
            <li> When you consider the investment in time (going for the treatments) and finances required for waxing, electrolysis and laser hair removal treatments, epilation is the most efficient in both respects.  </li>
            <li> I can see more or fewer hairs depending on my perspective.</li>
            <li> But the downside of that is, it is using so many \\&quot;tweezers\\</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like cheap laser hair removal that takes months to be effective.</li>
            <li> I do wish I had bought a better quality epilator, though, as this one just doesn&#x27;t do the job well.</li>
            <li> It mostly breaks the hairs off at the root</li>
            <li> /&gt;First time epilating my underarms, I was able to get rid of atleast ninety five percent of the hair I had</li>
            <li> With Ice Glove is much better.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> but most people cant handle the pain.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using epilators for many, many years now, and Braun has been my go-to brand since my college years.</li>
            <li> Because of it I don&#x27;t think there is a better brand out there for epilators.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li> So much better than the one I bought 6 years ago.</li>
            <li> and it still works, make sure that you hear a click when plugging in the power cord to the epilator</li>
            <li> I have used Braun silk epils for more than 14 years</li>
            <li> I tested the trim function, and it worked ok.</li>
            <li> think the pain will get better with the use, so I will keep giving a try.</li>
            <li> The trimmer could be better.</li>
            <li> Sure beats waxing every 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> it gets most of the hairs if not all of them.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that if the hairs are over 3 or 4mm it hurts more for some reason (armpit area), so if they are I trim them with the trimmer and then epilate.</li>
            <li> I would like with batteries as that is what I was used to, but I guess its better this way, I was just not expecting it.</li>
            <li> The shaver seems okay</li>
            <li> Most of the hair on my body is where it belongs - on my head, and ummm...</li>
            <li> Have been in use for more than a year and there is no problem.</li>
            <li> and it seems to work just ok.</li>
            <li> though so maybe i just need more practice.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT</li>
            <li> but this is even better.</li>
            <li> I think you&#x27;ll be happy with your choice, and that it&#x27;ll last you for many, many years of happy hair removal! ; )that up with the application of a cotton ball soaked in rubbing alcohol, to clean and sterilize the tweezers on the heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Clean the epilator head before and after each use with warm water AND rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> Overall this is just a great product that I&#x27;m super happy about.</li>
            <li> The LED light makes it very easy to spot any missed hairs.</li>
            <li> Still a pretty good product though.</li>
            <li> They include a cooling glove that is used right before you epilate and it makes the process much more enjoyable!</li>
            <li> So far, so good - never had a Braun before - I had THE original Epilalady forever, until it just started to fall apart - loved it</li>
            <li> Thank you so much ,, shipping amazing and the item amazing 😍</li>
            <li> It does a nice job quickly</li>
            <li> For best results, wash your skin with water, dry it, and even apply a prep containing alcohol or another astringent.</li>
            <li> And I used it at the \\&quot;recommend length\\&quot; - easy to do as a stay-at-home mom. :)&lt;</li>
            <li> break the bank and let someone wax you nice and quick.  </li>
            <li> I preferred the cap with the rollers as it was more comfortable and seemed to be more</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and to clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> To me it was well worth the 15 dollars more than the Emjoi I purchased a month before!</li>
            <li> , the light and the trimming head are useful, but if we&#x27;re honest I think the most worthwhile is the pivoting head feature.</li>
            <li> and when it did it was much more fine.  </li>
            <li> I did however pop the epi head off and attach Shaver head to make sure it did work fine.  </li>
            <li> skin was clean of hair!</li>
            <li> The light is nice, but I&#x27;ve found that it doesn&#x27;t magically make every hair super visible.</li>
            <li> Braun is very good, not too big and efficient.&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li> I LOVE the light on it.  </li>
            <li> And the light, oh the light!</li>
            <li> Also the light works--I&#x27;m seeing the missed hair better.  </li>
            <li> After careful comparison, the Braun seemed like the best choice for the price, based on the reviews</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it has the light, so you can see better.</li>
            <li> more comfortable and fewer hairs were missed.</li>
            <li> It is quicker, more efficient, and has the light to help you see finer hairs.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it has a light as well</li>
            <li> It is great leaving skin soft</li>
            <li> Make sure your hairs are grease free</li>
            <li> The light on the front is my favorite feature of this model.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a better option than shaving, though it doesn&#x27;t leave you all smooth.  </li>
            <li> Thought this is a great update to my old model.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it works very well and should you choose an epilator, this would be a good one.</li>
            <li> Over all, this product really does a good job.</li>
            <li> This model had good reviews and the price was reasonable.  </li>
            <li> , you don&#x27;t feel any pain and also it is so easy to clean!</li>
            <li> braun makes great products thanks a lot super</li>
            <li> The product is good, easy to handle and fast worker.</li>
            <li> The rollers and the light are a bonus over my old model, and the trimmer/shaver is great.  </li>

            <li> easy to attached.</li>
            <li> but now it&#x27;s easy to use and don&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to handle the epilator because of this.</li>
            <li> The circle power button doesn&#x27;t make it easy to turn on and off.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use - just plug into an outlet.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> The most soothing thing you can do post-epilating is to apply a good natural lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Works well and comes apart easily for cleaning.</li>
            <li> No pain at all, it made hair removal so easy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use with my nondominant hand, too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use with my nondominant hand, too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used an older version of Braun slik epil for years and loved it.</li>
            <li> I used to have an older version of the Silk-epil that I loved.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and found that the first couple of times I used this product it broke more hair than it pulled.  </li>
            <li> I give it four stars because, with some tolerance for pain and a willingness to invest time, it can be pretty effective.</li>
            <li> this is a pretty nice product like any Braun product..</li>
            <li> I think that itchy bumps were  just the Panasonic one, as it tweezed in multi directions.&lt;br /&gt;Hands down, this Braun silk epil is the best I have ever tried and owned, as I summarized above.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally new to epilating, so I felt that this was a good product.</li>
            <li> But this is supposed to be a good epilator for new users</li>
            <li> Now my legs hair is too fine</li>
            <li> It worked fine</li>
            <li> Smooth finish and the rotating head makes it so easy.</li>
            <li> The device now has a comfortable ergonomic shape that fits easily into your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>
            <li> Any medium fine hairs don&#x27;t get picked up.</li>
            <li> Everiything was fine.</li>
            <li> i used the device to remove medium to fine hairs on my arms -</li>
            <li> i must say if you use the epilator it hurts depending on area for arm hairs is fine but legs, underarm is torture</li>
            <li> This was easy to use once I got over the horror of the sound.</li>
            <li> but I imagine they will be fine.  </li>
            <li> money).&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair</li>
            <li> However, waxing works fine in that situation.</li>
            <li> I had had it for years and it still worked fine.  </li>
            <li> epilator body is comfortable in the hand, and the buttons, and head release, are positioned where they are easy to reach while using the unit.</li>
            <li> Works great and is pretty much pain free.  </li>
            <li> The product was easy to use, easy to clean and something I would want to use again!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The world of epilators seems to revolve around two kinds of pricing - super cheap dinky units, and pricier units from top name brands.</li>
            <li> This is a good product however not as good as my previous one</li>
            <li> epilator is effective, easy to use, easy to clean and the cooling glove is very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;ve never hated anything in my life, I most certainly do now!</li>
            <li> works very good and soft, I really like it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- huge surface area for faster hair removal&lt;</li>
            <li> Its easy to clean and runs smoothly.</li>
            <li> body was silky smooth for 3 days straight, and then on the 4th day, I could kind of feel a difference.</li>
            <li> but I must say this is a huge improvement.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem as accurate with the &#x27;plucking&#x27;.</li>
            <li> The heads clean easily under water.  </li>
            <li> Great epilator; would give it 5 stars if only it was cordless.&lt;br /&gt;Still getting used to it, but results are great!(:&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still felt smooth.  </li>
            <li> It definitely hurt under the arms, but was great for everything else.</li>
            <li> Pulling hairs out of your body isn&#x27;t where you want to go cheap</li>
            <li> This comes with a cheap, drawstring bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got this one next and was a happy girl again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to wait two days and try it again to see if I can get completely smooth results.</li>
            <li> So I had a girl field-test this for me and give me her detailed opinion.  </li>
            <li> The pain is great, but if you&#x27;re starting out, it would be something you&#x27;d get used to (there&#x27;s no way around it -</li>
            <li> and I do use it to get a smooth bikini trim.</li>
            <li> I also get a light skin rash when I am in the sun which started around the time I got the Braun epilator</li>
            <li> I found that this pivoting cap was extremely comfortable to use and that the rollers helped guide the hair towards the tweezer-plates.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soooo smooth.</li>
            <li> I received this epilator free from Braun to test and review.</li>
            <li> the pivoting head helps get hairs on kneecaps and the light helps you see your progress.</li>
            <li> Skin is smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to cheap out and get a bag epilator and judge all others by that either.</li>
            <li> It works fantastic and I like the Additional accessories.</li>
            <li> I used the Braun Silk 5 Epilator in an attempt to have constantly smooth legs.</li>
            <li> Also its easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The built in light is hugely helpful.</li>
            <li> Some people say it can cut the hair, but I&#x27;ve looked at the hairs while cleaning (to make sure it was worth the pain, you know) and</li>
            <li> weeks of smooth skin is an overstatement.</li>
            <li> SMOOTH SKIN:&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using this epilator, my legs were SILKY SMOOTH.</li>
            <li> and when I did that my foot literally slide off my leg because of how silky smooth my leg was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it on my arm and legs and my skin is smooth and no grown in hair .</li>
            <li> The light allows me to catch the missed hairs.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and the pouch stows all parts together in one place.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing device that really gets the hair out.</li>
            <li> It uses a massging system so it is about as close to comfortable as an epilator</li>
            <li> Only porble is,that before you use hte epilator, you need to wipe your skin and effect will be great.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t get a baby smooth result.</li>
            <li> I was prepared for some discomfort, but in return I&#x27;d hoped for smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but it may turn out to be more useful to me than the epilator head.</li>
            <li> It is so helpful for getting really smooth results.</li>
            <li> light:</li>
            <li> Fortunately for me I did not buy this unit to use as a shaver so this isn&#x27;t a deal breaker for me but is something to consider if you plan to use this attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find the efficiency cover easier to use as it&#x27;s smooth</li>
            <li> , it is easy to use and clean it.</li>
            <li> Oh, the light that comes in the machine</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have an issue with the pain as it was fairly light for me.</li>
            <li> This Braun is a rare exception because it is both affordable and a top quality brand name.</li>
            <li> The light on this model is quite helpful.  </li>
            <li> But when I saw this was available</li>
            <li> I read through a lot of reviews and decided to purchase this one because I didn&#x27;t want something too cheap but also didn&#x27;t want something too</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy to clean -</li>
            <li> It is extrememly important that the epilator does not contact with water while it is plugged</li>
            <li> I prefer the one with a cord because it lasts a lot longer and still has the light on it.</li>
            <li> but the light is a nuisance which I cannot turn off.</li>
            <li> It does not leave your legs completely smooth because it does not always pull the hair from the root.</li>
            <li> I was prepared for the epilator to sound like a jet engine</li>
            <li> I also got pinched once or twice before I realized just how important keeping the skin taut was.</li>
            <li> that it has a light on it</li>
            <li> I used one without the a light before</li>
            <li> did a fantastic job.</li>
            <li> Overall, its a great product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice size, aesthetically pleasing; the built-in light really helps.</li>
            <li> For a young person, this would be a good fit.  </li>
            <li> Its been couple of months so far so good.</li>
            <li> Hair pull is also not as good as old one did</li>
            <li> just used this on my arms for the first time and it was so easy!</li>
            <li> , if you do it right before you go to bed, it&#x27;s much better.  </li>
            <li> She was able to understand and use it right away and just loves it.  </li>
            <li> The pain was so great, that she was not able to do more than a 3x6\\&quot; square on her leg!  </li>
            <li> the head that keeps chaining according it direction is very useful.</li>
            <li> Eventually, you need it very rarely.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s very worth it.</li>
            <li> After a week or two more on the lower setting, I hope to be brave enough to go up to the higher</li>
            <li> Wow the first I used this my eyes watered but it did a great job.  </li>
            <li> and i would recommend this one to anyone looking for a quick and easy hair removal.</li>
            <li> Braun wins hands down for the best!</li>
            <li> Maybe my expectation was set kind of high</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean - just remove the top, open, and run the head under warm water.</li>
            <li> it was working perfectly until I moved to USA and because of the voltage difference it didn&#x27;t work properly, so it was time for me to get a new one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with Braun&#x27;s epilators, and I feel that their changes to their epilators have only added to their offerings, and made them that much more appealing to anyone looking to have hairless skin for many, many days at a time (about five for me, on average).</li>

            <li> glides a lot more easily and doesn&#x27;t hurt quite as much.</li>
            <li> device itself is fairly straightforward to use: you attach either the epilating head and epilate to your heart&#x27;s content, or attach a shaving head to trim the hair if it&#x27;s too</li>
            <li> I was really excited to receive this epilator....</li>
            <li> Well worth the price I paid!</li>
            <li> Silk-Epil 5 now has 40 tweezer-plates on its rotating head, many more and more closely placed than earlier models.</li>
            <li> However, with the lower speed you will have to go over the area more times than with the higher speed.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t notice any significant hair breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t notice any significant hair breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cool light that lets you see hair</li>
            <li> I did read it&#x27;s better to get them waxed first</li>
            <li> so if you aren&#x27;t you might be ok with this, but I still would expect it to pull all hair the first time through...</li>
            <li> Shave really clean and super comfortable once you get used to epIlator</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, efficient and quick.</li>
            <li> My wife tell me it can clean the hair，but</li>
            <li> before i could get a clean look -</li>
            <li> It does a clean job.</li>
            <li> Is the silky smooth hair free skin worth the pain?</li>
            <li> Okay - I think my old one was better.  </li>
            <li> only thing that is not as good is that older models came with a nice zipper case.</li>
            <li> Since the Epil 5280 is recommended for those new to epilating, I thought this might be a good option for more sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li> This is the best epilator I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;twice as fast as my other epilators.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Really removes all hair, easy to use, easy to clean</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t have to if I didn&#x27;t want to be super silky smooth, and it&#x27;s just a quick shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While I was scared at first (it sat in the box under my sink for two weeks before I was brave enough to give it a go)</li>
            <li> I received aBraun Silk epil 5 epilator to try and overall, I am pretty happy with it.  </li>
            <li> The light is a fantastic addition and the pivoting head is so much better than my old one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a happy user of Braun, and am willing to encourage anyone that&#x27;s considering starting epilation to give this Braun epilator a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a happy user of Braun, and am willing to encourage anyone that&#x27;s considering starting epilation to give this Braun epilator a try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly more efficient and generally I don&#x27;t have to make many passes to get rid of stubborn hairs.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The maintained spots also weren&#x27;t as smooth as the freshly epilated patches.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would use the trimmer/shaver as I didn&#x27;t on my old Braun, but this one is nice</li>
            <li> /&gt;*it does a really good job actually removing the hair with speed and efficiency&lt;</li>
            <li> Great piece of engineering, works very efficiently and well thought features like the light to brighten up skin areas, ergonomic handling, simple design, water proof when cleaning.</li>
            <li> me personally, is seems to be a good beginner epilator.  </li>
            <li> It is a good investment for someone who needs regular waxing.</li>
            <li> Good product overall~</li>
            <li> I compared several versions of this online at Amazon and settled on this model because the price was good</li>
            <li> one has the potential to be good, but it just doesn&#x27;t grab all the hair.  </li>
            <li> Really recommend this one :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Absolutely cool the included gel pad before you use the 5280, and use the pad afterward to sooth your skin and minimize an irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are going to do a quick shave after epilating, clean you razor before and after with rubbing alcohol, and spray yourself with witch hazel after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to say it really pulls most hair out even shortest one.</li>
            <li> This one works great, and is especially good at removing thin, short hairs.</li>
            <li> the head unit being full of plucked hairs (explained under cons).</li>
            <li> It had a trimmer you could add on which was cool.</li>
            <li> It was not painful at all</li>
            <li> The angular head and the light are really useful features.</li>
            <li> I am used to the pain and pinching feeling, so basically it&#x27;s painless for me which is not bad at all.</li>
            <li> The main disadvantage of the epilator is that it doesn&#x27;t leave a very clean line, so if that&#x27;s important to you, you&#x27;ll have to tweeze, or edge with some waxing.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I liked it at first because it left my skin very smooth</li>
            <li> First o all, the tweezers don&#x27;t remove the hair easily.</li>
            <li> For someone starting out, ie: a young girl with fair hair who wants to go this tweeze-hair route, this might be a good product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;*the little light is a great plus (I never realized I missed that feature so</li>
            <li> I ended up spending an hour every other day just trying to maintain from my ankles to my thighs and the results weren&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li> Other than that great product.</li>
            <li> I hurts like a B for the first few times, but it gets much better and 4he results are great.</li>
            <li> My first epilator, I used it several time till now and very happy so far.</li>
            <li> I used many, even cheaper and from less reputable companies, alternatives that were wayyy much better than this one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair on my arms and what there is is pretty fine, so</li>
            <li> This product is quite convenient and quick.</li>
            <li> arrived quickly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lucky if it catches one hair.  </li>
            <li> for the performance, I feel like this epilator is able to get finer hairs than my older model.</li>
            <li> I can get away with epilating once a week, with a quick shave afterwards to get silky</li>
            <li> Particularly if you&#x27;re on a budget, I would give this epilator a try before going for more costly methods.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pulling so many hairs at once that it feels more like an overall numbing sensation rather than pain.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps the smaller, more egg shaped one would be better.</li>
            <li> The light is a very useful improvement and the tweezers make your job much faster.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe my hair is finer than most, but on the high setting it seems to break the hairs rather than pull them out.</li>
            <li> You epilate without any after Redness!smooth and truly Helpfull the guidance light ;-))</li>
            <li> This is my very first epilator and it is a breeze to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s my very first time epilating</li>
            <li> This is my very first epilator that I bought</li>
            <li> The two differnt epilation caps are fun to use as one of them massages the skin, which I found interestingly cool.</li>
            <li> easily used,  cleaned, quick to finish  even if you want to use on whole body</li>
            <li> It has a light, which ended up being much more useful than expected and my favorite part of the product.</li>
            <li> Although my skin has habituated to an epilator, this new model is more efficient.</li>
            <li> i am glad to listen and try out some new tactics.</li>
            <li> With the new epilators they have incorporated a better attachment system so the head engages with the motor all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My previous one was silk-epil 3 which worked great</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re still going strong, so if mine lasts as much</li>
            <li> I have been using Silk epil for many years but a very old model.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time hurt!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> Your skin will swell, will feel hot and irritated, but it will be gone when you wake up!  </li>
            <li> Going over the same spot repeatedly doesn&#x27;t seem to get many more hairs out than you got on the first pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bottom line, it turned out that this new Braun purchase was a good choice to replace my old model.</li>
            <li> But this is the best personal care item I&#x27;ve purchased in a very long time.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how much I love this new one better than my old one.  </li>
            <li> Works very well for fine hair and almost painless.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The most important point to remember about epilating is that the more you do it, the less you need it.</li>
            <li> I have had laser hair removal, so a lot of my hair is colorless, and the light helps so much to catch that.</li>
            <li> Only time will tell if I&#x27;ll be brave enough to try it on my underarms.epilating didn&#x27;t get my legs completely smooth</li>
            <li> My mom said that she used to have an epilady,but had recently thrown it out because even though she said it work amazingly</li>
            <li> The light is very helpful.</li>
            <li> works as you would expect, the light is really helpful.</li>
            <li> Really like the dual speed and the light.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m satisfied, my underarms are smooth and I can&#x27;t see the hair below the skin</li>
            <li> She used to have an old Silk-epil 3, and she says that this one is much better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;100% worth the price.</li>
            <li> It hurts but the result makes it all worth it.</li>
            <li> I did not know if it happened because I had hair stuck in the motor and that terminated its success?</li>
            <li> The shaver head is a nice extra although I haven&#x27;t used it yet.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m happy with the overall result.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it wasn&#x27;t worth the time</li>
            <li> Nice upgraded model from what I used earlier which is the 300 series.</li>
            <li> As far as ease of use, it doesn&#x27;t get any better than this one.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed that a good many of the negative comments are that epilators hurt or that they caused ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Totally worth the $50</li>
            <li> The only nice thing is that you can take the head off and wash it, but I do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it frequently.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> This is the best $50 I have spent recently.  </li>
            <li> Its totally worth it.</li>
            <li> but regardless is something nice to have at home as it comes with extra heads to change functionality</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget that even your own hair grows at different rates!</li>
            <li> are you should be golden.</li>
            <li> worth it if you but the effort in.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;it is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It will be a week or two before I can tell if there&#x27;s any more breakage (rather than removal from the root) than with my old unit</li>
            <li> but so far I love this thing.</li>
            <li> If you stretch you skin and epilate as per the instructions it will be a far better experience.</li>
            <li> Highly worth it, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experience far more razor bumps and ingrown hair from this epilator than I ever have with shaving or waxing.</li>
            <li> price is also economical....</li>
            <li> For the parts of my body that are more sensitive</li>
            <li> All the alternatives to shaving require some degree of pain tolerance, but this is one that allows you to go at your own pace, at your convenience in the comfort and privacy of your home - and at a much lesser price.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because it was recommended to me by a friend and it was definitely, definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I love it for my legs and hands very easy and less pain.</li>
            <li> Words cant explain how much this hurt epilating my legs the first time!!  </li>
            <li> I think the fact that it&#x27;s not a shock of pain (like in waxing), and that I can easily control where the epilator goes allows me to be a lot more comfortable with the feeling that epilating induces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose Braun as my brand of epilator because it was constantly coming up in reviews for the top epilator brands, and because they have been producing the product for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Now I bough her this new product and she is very happy to have reduced the time at half for the whole process.</li>
            <li> Wish I had bought this first, quick and efficient.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not hard, but not as easy as a pressure switch.</li>
            <li> That thing is so useful, not just because it makes it easier to use on curved parts of the body but because it&#x27;s SO MUCH EASIER TO CLEAN.  </li>
            <li> It is supposed to be better, but I don&#x27;t like it as much as the older series.</li>
            <li> Being able to epilate wet skin while actually in the shower adds a distinctive edge to successful epilation with a minimum of pain.</li>
            <li> Overall, a good product that I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> but the epilalator portion doesn&#x27;t stay and the release button is right where you hold the unit.</li>
            <li> HAIRS:&lt;br /&gt;I exfoliated right after I epilated</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Shaving head to get hair to the right length for epilation</li>
            <li> tried it for the first time last night and it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> Very romantic.easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend to anybody who wants a clean job  in  no time .</li>
            <li> My last one had a sliding switch that I liked a lot better, but for the most part I haven&#x27;t had much trouble accidentally turning it off or anything like that.</li>
            <li> I am giving it 3 stars only because it does do a fairly good job on my fine, menopausal facial hair.</li>
            <li> This 5280, with its three attachments, will get those new to epilation through to becoming seasoned epilator users without undue pain, and with years of reliable</li>
            <li> Easy to clean but little bit noisy :)</li>
            <li> Like the previous model, it also has a nice light which helps you see</li>
            <li> Being a brand loyal person that I am, I was sure that I wanted Silk-epil only.</li>
            <li> Dragging the Epilady along my bare shin stung more than hurt.</li>
            <li> I like it, I had the old Braun epilator and like it too, but  this one is completely different and much more better.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t tell you that it&#x27;s not painful, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as I remember.  </li>
            <li> After epilating consistently for almost 2 years, I figured an upgrade would be worth it.</li>
            <li> Do as much as you are able to tolerate (when you&#x27;re first starting out - eventually you&#x27;ll be able to use it on your whole body and you won&#x27;t bat an eyelash), apply a soothing moisturizer, and go to sleep.  </li>
            <li> and OMG does that smart!</li>
            <li> and OMG does that smart!</li>
            <li> My next epilator was the Braun Silk-Epil Super Soft which was faster and more accurate and could be used on parts of the body</li>
            <li> Super fast, painless, and my skin is the smoothest it&#x27;s ever been.</li>
            <li> Only time will tell if I&#x27;ll be brave enough to try it on my underarms.</li>
            <li> As for the ingrown hairs, you will definitely get them if you don&#x27;t keep the epilator close to the skin (the roller cap is great for this) to pluck the hair, if you don&#x27;t exfoliate regularly, and don&#x27;t moisturize your skin.  </li>
            <li> Rollers\\&quot; that are supposed to \\&quot;stimulate the skin effectively for an extra gentle epilation.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to use.</li>
            <li> and she said that this item is almost identical to the one she previously owned, and loved.  </li>
            <li> As long as the head unit is kept clear the unit does a remarkable job of plucking even the thinnest, shortest hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> epilator head on this model is also superior to previous models.</li>
            <li> On my upper legs it is light years more convenient than waxing, particularly since I have (ahem)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d had good experiences with the brand with the previous epilator</li>
            <li> Nice epiletor , small, easy to handle, bu it which it was cordless</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t say this in the manual but the first thing I did was to soak my legs in warm water and thoroughly dry them.  </li>
            <li> I like the long, easy to use cord and also the light, but I find this model</li>
            <li> as it pains very much...</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Still very very painful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The new, much appreciated, difference she felt worth mentioning was the light on it.  </li>
            <li> The SmartLight is one of the best innovations Braun has come up with - that light reveals SO much more than one could previously see with these, especially around corners and in tighter spaces, that the epilator user is just about guaranteed to get every little hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This particular epilator is the first full sized one I have owned.  </li>
            <li> I am very surprised how much better this new one is.</li>
            <li> The cord is also long and will enable you to sit on a towel in sunlight coming from a window to see fine blonde hairs better than the epilator light will allow.</li>
            <li> Great leaves my arms really smooth better than a razor but too painful for my legs</li>
            <li> I often have to do 20 or more passes on the same spot.</li>
            <li> I love how epilators keep my hairs from growing back scratchy and itchy.  </li>
            <li> ;).  </li>
            <li> The first times you use it, I have to admit it seems like a rip off.</li>
            <li> It is recommended that the first couple of months you epilate once a week.  </li>
            <li> Mine arrived today and the cord was the first thing I checked.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For first time users, if you are not used to pulling your hairs with a pair of tweezers, the process involves some amount of pain.</li>
            <li> Still, using an epilator for the first times requires some learning curve.</li>
            <li> (As a first time epilator, like me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> love how it pulls the coarse hairs from the roots</li>
            <li> I plan on getting laser hair removal in the future, which I hope to be a better method of hair removal than this.</li>
            <li> First time to use a Braun</li>
            <li> I summed up the results above, but for more info, read on:&lt;br /&gt;Yes, this thing works.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with an epilator, so I had no idea what to expect.  </li>
            <li> I would say that if you are used to the discomfort of waxing and interested in trying epilating, go for this one.  </li>
            <li> This is my third epilator over many years.  </li>
            <li> My only frustration is that I can use the efficiency cap but with this I found the cap with the rollers seemed to pick up the hairs better</li>
            <li> According the my wife, this device does not work without the cord, very dissapointing!</li>
            <li> She says it is supposed to hurt the first times....</li>
            <li> Overall satisfied for the deal price we paid, but we&#x27;re still learning with it</li>
            <li> My wife loves this so much!</li>
            <li> I actually like it better than the 7 for it can never run out of battery</li>
            <li> This is my first time using an epilator</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Either way, ~$10/year vs however much you&#x27;d spend on razors and shaving cream, I say it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> first was Epilady Coil Epilator in the 90s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s slow but done a great job</li>
            <li> First time user here.</li>
            <li> many models ago, a yellow one</li>
            <li> If ur a first time user, dont be foold by the icepack and what ever it promisrs-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually too cowardly to sit through the pain of actual epilating but this thing is wonderful.</li>
            <li> The first time I epilated, I&#x27;d waited about three weeks for my hair to grow.</li>
            <li> At first I used the massage head because I was worried about the pain, but I did not feel any pain</li>
            <li> I also was interested in the part where it says it will get the finest of hairs.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Braun!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m really glad I decided to give myself a present and upgrade my silkepil!</li>
            <li> I used the provided cooling pad with my first use and felt no pain.</li>
            <li> In addition, after the first couple of uses, the device did not work as well in terms of grasping the hair.</li>
            <li> I did both my legs in 10 minutes the first time</li>
            <li> so I have not yet had to trim the leg hair first with the Shaver/Trimmer head.  </li>
            <li> It works just great on mans thick hair...</li>
            <li> This is my first time using an epilator and decided to give this one a try.</li>
            <li> I tried this out first on my legs.</li>
            <li> Plan 3 hours for the first time from the exfoliation to gettting done with both legs.</li>
            <li> You can rinse it under tap water (unplug the AC adapter FIRST), or with the included brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First will be fainful, but than fain will almost disappear.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time.</li>
            <li> As for epilating itself: I was a first time epilator when I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> Someone on Amazon recommended getting a wax first and then using the epilator for maintenance.</li>
            <li> Do legs and arms first, and then underarms, and bikini area last.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that over time I&#x27;ll get better at it, and I&#x27;ve heard that the hairs will start to come back</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace one of the first Silk Epil&#x27;s out there.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pinching: Make sure while epilating areas with skin that could potentially be pinched you&#x27;re pulling your skin taut to avoid this.</li>
            <li> This was my first with an epilator.  </li>
            <li> Not my first epilator</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with this epilator.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Aside from these design annoyances, the device functions pretty well, so my review is mixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to have an epilady when it first came out, so I sort of know what to expect from this type of shaver.</li>
            <li> This is the first Epilator that I have bought and used.</li>
            <li> But it does do it&#x27;s job pretty well.</li>
            <li> , none of which were exactly comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find the I setting to be more tolerable, but it requires several passes to get all the hair in a given area.  </li>
            <li> My hair was grown in two weeks from a wax, way too much to do in one sitting without passing out!</li>
            <li> This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever owned and the first time I&#x27;ve ever tried it.</li>
            <li> That said, the way it epilates is totally tolerable and feels like it&#x27;s just scratching most of the time.</li>
            <li> This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> I should mention that my first try epilating my underarms</li>
            <li> I wouldnt blame the epilator as I know and willingly agreed to tolerate the pain.</li>
            <li> First I shower and exfoliated two days in a row.  </li>
            <li> but most of the hairs were pulled from the root and they have not grown back yet</li>
            <li> It hurts like a MOFO the first</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to back off of epilating more...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to back off of epilating more...</li>
            <li> I REALLY recommend you buy this product!</li>
            <li> This Braun Silk-Epil 5280 Epilator was my wife&#x27;s first epilator, and while the product works, she did not like the pain associated with the process and would rather shave.  </li>
            <li> Clever and quick machine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a comparison as this is my first epilator.</li>
            <li> The low setting is slower but more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to go with waxing as the lesser of the two evils!!! :)</li>
            <li> The second time I epilated my armpits was much better.</li>
            <li> The longer the hair is the more you will feel each individual hair being pulled and then yanked out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The longer the hair is the more you will feel each individual hair being pulled and then yanked out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Way better than my last one</li>
            <li> Hurts at first (like being snapped with a rubber band), but that eases up after a minute or two, once your body&#x27;s endorphins kick in.</li>
            <li> I paid a fortune for 12 laser hair removal sessions for my underarms, and while it got rid of most of the hair I still have enough stragglers to need to do something else about them.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using an epilator</li>
            <li> if this because it was my first time or not</li>
            <li> good quality and after a few times using it, you get used to the pain.</li>
            <li> This last one, the 5280, is absolutely the best of all previous models!</li>
            <li> I had never heard of epilators (what cave do i live in right?!)</li>
            <li> I have to say that my old one works better than this new one.</li>
            <li> I did have to go over the same area more than once, but that may have been due to my own resistance at first.</li>
            <li> Cleaning your epilator is easy enough; since many in this line can now be rinsed under running water, that&#x27;s an option, but I still prefer to use the brush to remove any loose hairs, and follow that up with the application of a cotton ball soaked in rubbing alcohol, to clean and sterilize the tweezers on the heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Depending on your outlook it is either awesome to see the pile of pulled hairs as you clean out the unit or depressing because reminds a person of how hairy their body really is.</li>
            <li> I actually don&#x27;t grow hair in certain places now though :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;The three star rating is largely due to the fact that this product is effective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good item I guess if you have high tolerance for pain, but definitely not worth 60$.</li>
            <li> True, epilators do take some getting used to, but you can work up to a full tolerance and you&#x27;ll not go back.</li>
            <li> Excellent results of minimal hair re-growth after a few uses.</li>
            <li> have to admit that the leap of faith it took to use the Epilady for the first time was pretty intense.</li>
            <li> The results are better than shaving and last much longer than shaving.</li>
            <li> left me as smooth as a fresh wax.  </li>
            <li> the old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good job Braun - compact, quiet, effective and well priced.</li>
            <li> : The instructions say to always use the protective head, but it is much more effective without it, just be careful around loose skin, it can get caught up in the tweezers.</li>
            <li> make sure the hair isn&#x27;t too long (it tugs repeatedly before maybe pulling out the hair)</li>
            <li> It pretty much gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways, I was essentially looking for something to replace my old one for around the same price point, and I was happy with what I found here.</li>
            <li> I was very nervous the first time</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used any other epilator, but I like this as much as one can like something that rips out your own hair.</li>
            <li> I thought, \\&quot;Surely they&#x27;ve come a long way in [x]</li>
            <li> As this is my first epilator, I don&#x27;t really have anything I can compare it to but in my opinion, it does the job</li>
            <li> First of all, for me the pain was intense..</li>
            <li> I would have bought her a 7 series model, but this one had a very good price, and cost only half the normal price.</li>
            <li> though it hurts a bit more, I think it is only because it is doing the job the older one was not.  </li>
            <li> The Braun Silk Epilator hurts, but you don&#x27;t have the intense heat that I&#x27;ve experienced with five different types of lasers, which I find more uncomfortable, though quick.  </li>
            <li> Warm water makes the hair shaft open up, causing the shaft to release the hair more easily, so epilating either in the shower, or just post-shower, is going to be the best choice for the least painful experience.</li>
            <li> The curved shape was nice when I was still learning the ins and outs of epilating as it&#x27;s less prone to pinching</li>
            <li> (make sure your skin is completely dry first!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li> (make sure your skin is completely dry first!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li> Also, the &#x27;circular on-off&#x27; switch is not as easy to use as the &#x27;slide style&#x27; switch on my earlier model.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a lazy pain free shaver for most of my life.</li>
            <li> But this one, set on low, makes it easy.</li>
            <li> The hairs will be so strong and deep</li>
            <li> It was no worse than other epilators, and more comfortable than the old Epilady products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As someone who lives in South Florida, having smooth legs, underarms and bikini line is important year round, and I am very excited to have found an alternative to shaving which lasts much longer than a traditional shave.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping I would be able to use it as my single, all-purpose method of hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> if you want an epilator, then Braun is certainly the brand you want (this model or another) -</li>
            <li> Since this epilator can be opened to a certain extent cleaning becomes easier, just time consuming.</li>
            <li> This silk epic 5 also came with a cooling pac, a sleeve to put the cooling pac in, a tiny brush to clean your machine, a trimmer clear thing to put on top of the shaver, and</li>
            <li> I have had epiladies for many years and only bought this new one because I had to.</li>
            <li> (I have tried both cold and warm waxing), and in the long term I think it will be more cost effective.</li>
            <li> These tweezer-plates can remove fine hairs as short as 0.5mm.</li>
            <li> I have REALLY fine Asian hair</li>
            <li> I personally have fine hair on my arms</li>
            <li> The main thing is that it hasn&#x27;t died on me yet like the first 2 I had.  </li>
            <li> The epilator works decently on the underarms, but doesn&#x27;t work at all on the legs!</li>
            <li> Even though it takes a several turns for a certain area to be completely smooth, but I believe it depwnds on the the hair growth as well.</li>
            <li> Learned the hard way .. but works good on legs ha</li>
            <li> The light makes it so much easier to see where to go next.</li>
            <li> While epilating didn&#x27;t get my legs completely smooth it worked well enough that shaving my legs went much faster</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an epilator that is accurate, can be used for extended periods of time without having to worry about recharging/replacing batteries, and you don&#x27;t mind being plugged into an outlet, I would definitely recommend this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Overall though, it&#x27;s great not having to shave my armpits everyday because of this.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Still, I really like this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very hairy person and my arm hairs</li>
            <li> This will help your hairs grow much finer.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone wanting to get rid of hair, and having smooth legs for lasting time!</li>
            <li> The trimmer is also very efficient and allows this epilator to be a 2 in 1.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I really wish it could have lasted longer</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> Epilation hurts, no way around it, but so does waxing and Epilation is much cheaper.</li>
            <li> My legs have been coarse free hair for a week now.  </li>
            <li> more pain than expected</li>
            <li> I am a man who bought this on a whim because I didn&#x27;t like how much leg hair I had.</li>
            <li> My hair density is absolutely unchanged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> does really well the</li>
            <li> The cooling pad really helps.</li>
            <li> Either way, it really hurt.</li>
            <li> I absolutely promise that the discomfort lessens with use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Silk-Epil 5 has a tiny light on the bottom.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Worked better than I had expected.</li>
            <li> Very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> you are looking to try out epilating at a reasonable price, this us the epilator for you.</li>
            <li> It sounds... intense....</li>
            <li> better than expected.</li>
            <li> Haha  </li>
            <li> I can appreciated the cooling pack being included also.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t really remember the model number)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li> It removed the hair fast with minimum irritation.  </li>
            <li> but the expense has become too much.</li>
            <li> so I figured it was a reasonable gamble.</li>
            <li> The amount of discomfort is no worse than waxing</li>
            <li> The Braun 5-5280 epilator is so fast that you almost don&#x27;t feel any pain.</li>
            <li> The handles that attach to it really help ease the pain.</li>
            <li> It really helps to contour to my skin</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t use the cooling pad, which may have, likely, diminished the red spots.&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer suggested Advil 30 minutes in advance, and that sounds like a great idea, but was not necessary for me.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not too much of a hassle</li>
            <li> and it does the job very well.</li>
            <li> I think I might epilate on the 6th or 7th day because today (5th day), the regrown hairs are very sparse and are about a millimeter or shorter.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take out that much hair.</li>
            <li> Its fast and efficient and I like the fact that I don&#x27;t have to lather up with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> leg hair doesn&#x27;t grow all that fast</li>
            <li> is much softer/longer than shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Less</li>
            <li> they work really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I am very picky.</li>
            <li> The frozen gel pack really helps reduce pain by numbing the skin a bit after using the epilator.</li>
            <li> otherwise you get a bunch of partial yanks which hurts the most.</li>
            <li> It really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cooling glove: I can&#x27;t list this as a pro or a con really as it did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pain: epilating by its very nature causes discomfort but doesn&#x27;t have to be unbearable.</li>

            <li> tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pain: epilating by its very nature causes discomfort but doesn&#x27;t have to be unbearable.</li>
            <li> The pain is just too much to bear for me I gave up after one leg (the vibration does nothing).</li>
            <li> Plug is very loose,detaches by the simplest touch im gona have to tape it or something because its sooo looose</li>
            <li> This model works very well and</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really bother me.</li>
            <li> , I went straight for the pits.  </li>
            <li> Quite frankly, TOO much time.  </li>
            <li> when seated so you can&#x27;t really tell if it is plugged in or not&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great for armpits and bikini area, but if you have thin hair, do not use this on that area.</li>
            <li> I have very thin/fine hair on my legs and it does not pick it up.</li>
            <li> there, I am really hoping I would get used to the pain and feeling some day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am enjoying my experience with the epilator as it does what I had expected of it except that I thought it would be chargable.</li>
            <li> but not bothering too much</li>
            <li> Easier especially with the light.</li>
            <li> Very usefull and fast.</li>
            <li> You really have stretch before using this thing.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> I really thought that will be just a gadget</li>
            <li> but&#x27; it really does help</li>
            <li> To much work.</li>
            <li> I would highly reccommend this product!</li>
            <li> It works very well.  </li>
            <li> That was a work-horse of an epilator, and frankly, I expected more from Braun.</li>
            <li> Then , reading the reviews I realized I had to really push it, it does not click, but it stays on its place.</li>
            <li> This razor is great--shaves very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes much longer...</li>
            <li> I also like that it has two velocities, in the armpit its nicer to go with the slower one, and on the legs the fast one is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;One comment of something I didn&#x27;t expect (which maybe I didn&#x27;t read the description fully)</li>
            <li> Where you epilate, of course, affects how intense that sensation is.</li>
            <li> Where you epilate, of course, affects how intense that sensation is.</li>
            <li> Keeping up with hair removal is much, much easier when it doesn&#x27;t involve a production.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really SEE it, but you can sorta kinda feel</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s because there wasn&#x27;t that much hair to GRAB</li>
            <li> and I would miss so much hair</li>
            <li> so I needed a replacement but wasn&#x27;t ready to spend $100</li>
            <li> real selling point though is the pivoting head.  </li>
            <li> but I tried it on gentle</li>
            <li> But I was younger then and far more trusting.</li>
            <li> Also, is really good for delicate skins that have allergies to creams for epilate.</li>
            <li> The old one had three rows of tweezer lines and the tweezers on this version are spread out more rather in the three solid lines across.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have worn out a couple of these of a different brand and so far I can say this one does work better.  </li>
            <li> Also make sure you&#x27;re gliding slowly and giving the epilator plenty of time to pluck all the hairs in a given area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Post-epilating: Use a good natural lotion to help soothe your skin and prevent/minimize red bumps.</li>

            <li> My upper lip is a bit more sensitive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only experienced a few instances with this unit where it passed a hair more than once or twice without plucking it and the reason for this ended up being due to</li>
            <li> It does hurt when you first start epilating, as you are basically plucking numerous hairs at once, but my skin got used to it quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This seems to be a nicely made little device and if you have the time, patience and can endure some discomfort, you will get decent results.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time I epilated, I was amazed at how smooth my skin was; it was like I had never had a single hair on my body there before.</li>
            <li> Pulls hair quickly leaving bare skin.</li>
            <li> It barely misses hairs, unless you&#x27;re going quickly over the area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several epilators in the past, but this one by far is the most effective.  </li>
            <li> Many of the newer models of many brands are expensive and since I was trying this for the first time, I didn&#x27;t want to invest too much money.  </li>
            <li> My other epilator is cordless and can go into the shower which I have to admit I like better.  </li>
            <li> The shaver works so much better than any other one I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li> It worked better than expected!</li>
            <li> Braun model appealed to me because it is a corded model which meant I wouldn&#x27;t be messing with swapping out batteries all the time, the tweezer head is flat, and it has an LED light which makes it easier to spot missed hairs.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t find the flaws to be significant enough to warrant deducting any stars from my rating.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t find the flaws to be significant enough to warrant deducting any stars from my rating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d suggest to spend more and get other ones, Braun SE 5280 Silk Epil 5 Epilator</li>
            <li> I went to epilate the second time for the hairs I didn&#x27;t pull out right the first time didn&#x27;t hurt as much.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, it does not shave the hair as clean as regular razor does.</li>
            <li> At first, most women will use an epilator every few weeks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not difficult to open the head unit and brush away the excess hairs but is still an annoyance that&#x27;s worth mentioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t expect it to be cordless, based on the reviews here, and I&#x27;m fine with the long cord.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line is that hair removal comes down to personal preference, and while this is a good product, if you&#x27;ll like it or not depends on what you want from your hair remover method.</li>
            <li> I actually recommended to my mom and she bought it right away!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use in sensitive areas and definitely grabs thinner hairs.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait until I&#x27;d been using this one for a long time, so I could give an accurate and informative review.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a nice small unit for tweezing hair.  </li>
            <li> It is nice and efficient, but I am not sure if it has better in performance than my previous one.</li>
            <li> I also now use it with the efficiency cap (which is just a little plastic cap that covers the massage rollers) because it really does seem to be more efficient that way.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this gadget!</li>
            <li> The light, shaving/trimmer head, efficiency cap and the brush were included with my old one too, but this one also comes with the cooling mitt that I honestly find is pretty useless.</li>
            <li> New growths will be thinner and much easier to pull.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t need a whole new coffee maker, just the glass pot.</li>
            <li> though it was a great idea, a way to epilate at home, but using it was torture and after a few tries I gave</li>
            <li> I previously used an epilator that had dual opposing heads, but this one works much better.</li>
            <li> use on clean dry skin straight out of a bath/shower.  </li>
            <li> I used the attachment with the massage roller, I don&#x27;t think it did anything especial in particular.</li>
            <li> Then saw this Braun with a light, which  is the only thing about my old Braun I did not like.</li>
            <li> my time using this device, I also had pretty consistent problems with in-grown hairs, which I tried to combat with daily loofa-scrubbing of the epilated areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And they are older then say, YOU.  </li>
            <li> But not for someone who is older who is looking for an alternative to shaving.</li>
            <li> I really loved it, but it is getting old and not working quite as well lately, so</li>
            <li> The main reason for her buying this was the cordless option.</li>
            <li> Eventually, it will be an occasional thing, more often than every leap year, but only when needed.</li>
            <li> And though it is an older model from Braun, it has served my need.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> The pain from the bumps is almost unbearable and are big enough to where I should consider them more as an abscess.</li>
            <li> Yesterday night, two weeks later from initial epilation, I had more growth all around.</li>
            <li> I used the have the older model</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall the Braun Series 5-5280 Silk Epil Epilator is a decent product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall the Braun Series 5-5280 Silk Epil Epilator is a decent product.</li>
            <li> electric cord continue to slide and desconnected from the main body.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever heard a commercial for laser hair removal, you may have noticed they tell you how quick it is, but they never mention that it hurts.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it on my legs and the hair doesn&#x27;t seem to grow back as quickly as it does after shaving.  </li>
            <li> which still did a half-way decent job.  </li>
            <li> So, if you are looking for an epilator and don&#x27;t mind some pain, this unit seems to be a decent choice.  </li>
            <li> main reason for purchasing this model was because it includes an electric razor.</li>
            <li> I actually never waxed these, mostly because I physically couldn&#x27;t since I don&#x27;t have 3 hands.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a replacement for an older Braun model, the 5270 Xelle Silk-Epil Epilator.  </li>
            <li> Those were the two main problems I had with it.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling very smooth, and works a little bit faster.</li>
            <li> thing I like about this product is the little light that shines right on the area</li>
            <li> and all, I am pleased with this replacement and have high hopes for this epilator since the previous model lasted 5 years (and probably would have lasted longer if I didn&#x27;t snag it)</li>
            <li> The light is very handy and it wasn&#x27;t painful at all.</li>
            <li> The genius principal of the Epilady was that the metal coil would rotate and vibrate at a high speed and yank out your leg hair like an efficient electrical mower-tweezer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> One cap has \\&quot;High Frequency Massaging</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend buying this.</li>
            <li> I would recommend upgrading to the 7 series that can be used in water if you don&#x27;t have a high pain tolerance.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product,&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing and using this sort of product for 20 years and have high expectations/standards when it comes to hair removal products.</li>
            <li> highly recommended...</li>
            <li> I would highly, highly agree with her.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for painless hair removal.</li>
            <li> And the epilator is much, much easier to run frequently over my lower legs, so those broken-off hairs are sure to get yanked out sooner or later (especially since the epilator gets hairs shorter than waxing can).</li>
            <li> I purchased this model because it got decent reviews and while a little pricey it was cheaper than most.</li>
            <li> Maybe I suffer from &#x27;too fine&#x27; hair which make it harder for the epilady to grip.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get a good grip on it, since it&#x27;s pretty flat.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use it certain places because it can make you break out if your skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li> Just be very careful in the more sensitive areas, like under the arms.</li>
            <li> It is faster than the little ones, but it is still a lot more time consuming than shaving.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d say this epilator hurts a little bit more than Emoji&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> however and it was like when you gave birth and forgot the pain as soon as you saw your precious little baby.  </li>
            <li> This one is thankfully much improved over my old one.</li>
            <li> On my old one, it is a switch that just goes from off to medium to fast.</li>
            <li> I really like the swivel head upgrade from my old one.</li>
            <li> so I was really worried about the pain that nearly every review has talked about.</li>
            <li> It does not clear all the hairs on my legs no matter how many times I go over the same area.  </li>
            <li> We purchased this product because of the normal razor attachment.  </li>
            <li> It always left red itchy bumps that lasted for about an hr, which I thought maybe I just became more sensitive in age.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> It may take a few epliations for someone with more hair to adjust to any tweezing pain.  </li>
            <li> but this is normal.</li>
            <li> My last epilator was my first one, so I didn&#x27;t invest much money into it.</li>
            <li> But it sure beats shaving and messy waxing.  </li>
            <li> I will update after a few more weeks using it to let you guys know</li>
            <li> provided parts such as the shaverhead, and the trimmer cap is quite useful too.</li>
            <li> and I do not have to shave as often as I normally would.</li>
            <li> but since it&#x27;s one of their big selling points, worth mentioning.  </li>
            <li> Honestly though its like ripping the bandaid off vs slowly pulling millimeter by millimeter (tweezing).</li>
            <li> I can honestly say I am a bit let down because it does not get my tiny hairs like it is advertised to do....</li>
            <li> Also, dry brushing regularly with a good natural bristle brush helps to both eliminate existing and prevent future ingrown hairs.st a stationary plastic piece to pinch the hair.</li>
            <li> Also, dry brushing regularly with a good natural bristle brush helps to both eliminate existing and prevent future ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> new line of shimmery white epilators that Braun has released, including this 5280, offer just about any new, or seasoned, epilator user all of the options that they&#x27;ll want for as much hair removal as they&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> keep in mind that, while you&#x27;re doing it less frequently than shaving, this takes more time than shaving.</li>
            <li> Over time, your hair WILL grow in finer, which can pose more of a challenge in getting the tweezers to grip the finer hair, but at that point, you might want to consider just epilating your skin when it&#x27;s dry (something that was, once, an epilator user&#x27;s only option...).</li>
            <li> So obviously I am thinking hey maybe something isn&#x27;t plugged right.</li>
            <li> I am giving it 4 star because it takes a little more time than I expected to have complete smooth skin.</li>
            <li> Less painful I was wondering if it was working and perfect that the head angles easily to conform to my legs.</li>
            <li> I found the 7.5 foot long cord to be adequate for my needs</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I find this to be well worth the minor downsides (moderate noise, cord, possible nips, sometimes more prolonged sensation of hair removal) because of the convenience it offers over waxing.</li>

            <li> Because I noticed inconsistencies in the product listing versus what the product really seemed to be, I decided to look only at the product description listed on Braun&#x27;s own website instead of trusting the one here, and I suggest you do the same!  </li>
            <li> I have to shave every other day in order to feel smooth.  </li>
            <li> I was extremely judgmental about this until I used the device and found that the light did helpfully illuminate the area I was working on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was still really smooth, but not perfectly SILKY smooth like it had been the first 3 days.</li>
            <li> so I got a new one.</li>
            <li> I just bought this at a liquidation store for $29 new.</li>
            <li> The product is new and well-made.</li>
            <li> I shaved my legs on Sunday &amp; used my new epilator on Tuesday night.</li>
            <li> After trying to use some times, I had to buy a new one and throw this one out.  </li>
            <li> After about 3 weeks, I decided I wasn&#x27;t going to find it and should get a new one.</li>
            <li> I like my new Epilator</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re new to epilating, I still recommend an Azulene Oil for aftercare (preferred Parissa as it is non-greasy and odorless), but your preferred aftercare will do.  </li>
            <li> Quite gentle, better than I imagined, hardly use the cooling pad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I have very fine hair that you can&#x27;t really see, if you touch my leg you can definitely feel hair and my legs were not smooth.</li>
            <li> And like previous Braun&#x27;s it is easily taken apart for cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Most importantly, its price is too expensive.</li>
            <li> The top part snags your skin and hurts like crazy and the top keeps coming off.  </li>
            <li> I had to go over the same area at least 4 times to take out a good amount of hair, and that STILL didn&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt a lot and the extra light on it is a big help.</li>
            <li> However, in one sitting, I managed to epilate my whole legs, my whole arms, including underarms, and my entire bikini area (Brazilian).</li>
            <li> Comes with a few different heads for close shave and a stubble kind of shave.  </li>
            <li> Kind of feels like a bunch of bees stinging you, but after a a few strokes you actually get used to  the pain.</li>
            <li> always thought an epilator was a waste for something who didn&#x27;t grow their own personal Everglades.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m left with too many noticably fine hairs even after going over my legs twice very slowly.  </li>
            <li> Also, it is very loud.</li>
            <li> However, if you are very sensitive and/or you are out of Pinot Grigio then by all means keep the massage</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to pain</li>
            <li> This also makes it really easy to accidentally overshoot the setting you want when you do turn it, since you hard to grip it kind of hard and turn it kind of hard.  </li>
            <li> I used this epilator for the first time last night, on my underarms.</li>
            <li> The first time I epilated it pulled out the hairs from the roots, but when they began to grow again it feels that it just cuts the hair because it grows back in three days</li>
            <li> when I first purchased it, I was going back and forth between the Braun, Epilady and Phillips brands.</li>
            <li> I have been epilating for a decade, time to replace my old Braun, bought the Enjoy, which for me did NOT work at all, removed only every 3rd hair.</li>
            <li> I epilate under arms, legs and the general bikini area and have found it to be very maneuverable.  </li>
            <li> face is to sensitive !</li>
            <li> and i am pleasantly surprised with the results!  </li>
            <li> However, after the first time, I find I only need to use it every 2 weeks or so</li>
            <li> It doesnt remove hair in the first run, you have to go over the same place twice or sometimes thrice.</li>
            <li> At first I thought the width of the head was much smaller but in fact, it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> I bought mine at Walmart and took it back after my first use.</li>
            <li> With the first two uses, it did indeed work on short razor stuble.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do be sure to use a loofah or other exfoliating procedure regularly once you start epilating.</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW!</li>
            <li> for me, epilators usually gives satisfying results but not with this product.</li>
            <li> The last time I used an epilator was in the 80&#x27;s when the Epilady first hit the market.  </li>
            <li> It took me about twenty minutes for my arms and of course, being my first time epilating, my arms are still bumpy and a bit red</li>
            <li> Worth the minor inconvenience, and I do save some time in the morning shower ablutions.</li>
            <li> especially the first time.  </li>
            <li> You can use this one without the &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; attachment: DON&#x27;T, it kind of sucked my skin into it and left a raw spot.  </li>
            <li> sensitive, thicker-skinned areas, because epilation there has just prompted too many ingrowns for me, even with the daily use of a thick sugar scrub that I make up at home (all I use is a whole LOT of granulated white sugar, and just enough of any shower gel to make up a thick, foamy paste of sugar suspended in soap - kinda the consistency of creamed butter and sugar for cookie dough, ideally).</li>

            <li> : I personally didn&#x27;t notice anything special about the softlift tips cover over the standard efficiency cover.</li>
            <li> This has a huge surface contact that you need less strokes to cover an area.</li>
            <li> It is not cordless, but the cord was long enough for me to comfortably use.  </li>
            <li> Not super comfortable but</li>
            <li> The epilator head can rotate to few degrees and this helps to remove hair easily.</li>
            <li> It seems to hurt at first, but is more of an irritating feeling that you do get used to.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend using this gadget every few days.  </li>
            <li> It should have other special features to make up for the price.</li>
            <li> I have it a year now and is still working great, hasn&#x27;t slow down.</li>
            <li> Even after multiple passes up, down, and side-to-side most hair was not removed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this multiple times and the pain is much more dull than when I first started.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, if you are a regular user of epilators I do suggest checking out the positive reviews as they may give a person with epilator experience more/better insight.</li>
            <li> On my lower legs, for example, I would describe the feeling to be like dragging sandpaper across my leg, whereas on my inner thighs, the feeling was more like being snapped with a rubber band (hard).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, discomfort was never really a problem.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately 10 passes left more than half the hair undisturbed on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> The problem with using this product vs. waxing is that waxing is one quick rip away of the hair, while I had to go over my legs several times with this epilator and there was still hair left.</li>
            <li> Electrolysis is great for small areas (such as eyebrows, upper lip, chin, etc), but would be prohibitive in terms of time and expense for larger areas</li>
            <li> There are a few fine hairs that the device missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I initially gave this product 5 stars, however, after using it for about 6 weeks I am far less pleased with my outcome.</li>
            <li> Make sure, to comletely dry yourself as well as all ghe parts that were washed under water before putting it back into place and before the epilator is turned back</li>
            <li> When you open the cap you can see that the mechanism that connect the motor to the cap has a slippery shape, and certainly will become inefficient after some use.  </li>
            <li> Now my underarms feel really smooth, but my legs are a little stubbly.</li>
            <li> cons are:&lt;br /&gt;She said it hurts a little more than waxing (which may be a matter of personal taste) and you have to use it with power cord plugged to it (unlike my shaver).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : I am an Asian female with fine hair on my arms and thighs, coarse hair on legs under knees.</li>
            <li> (yes, I made sure it&#x27;s always the recommended length before epilating) and leaves tiny little arm/leg fuzzies.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s much better at grabbing ALL the little hairs this one left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Obviously it doesn&#x27;t magically make it not hurt, but it&#x27;s a little bit of a distraction.</li>
            <li> Hair tend to break instead of being plucked clear from the roots.</li>
            <li> Now, I cant say the same the bikini area, but so far I really like it and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator, but I&#x27;ve been waxing and sugaring for several years and I generally prefer by-the-roots methods of hair removal to shaving.</li>
            <li> are long, maybe I&#x27;ll have to trim them first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned an epilator before, but this one is a whole different story.</li>
            <li> Overall, much</li>
            <li> épil epilators have been specially developed to minimize any discomfort and irritation.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> Ladies, consider this either a torture test or completely irrelevant.&lt;br</li>
            <li> for long term results, I can say that after five months of not using this device, it&#x27;s like I never used it in the first place.</li>
            <li> I replaced a 15 year old braun silk epil that broke with this model.  </li>
            <li> With my old one sometimes it would catch my skin and pinch</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think this one will (so far it hasn&#x27;t, but the design seems to prevent it as well).    </li>
            <li> epilator didn&#x27;t leave my legs completely hair-free, however, I just shaved yesterday</li>
            <li> and I have to say the results are much longer lasting than shaving.</li>
            <li> it worked well enough that shaving my legs went much faster</li>
            <li> I bought this Braun to replace my old 10+ year Braun.</li>
            <li> which my old one did not.  </li>
            <li> but lately I noticed more ingrown hairs than I ever had before.</li>
            <li> you would never want to place near an exposed rotating and vibrating</li>
            <li> My old one still works, but this one is supposed to work on even shorter hairs.</li>
            <li> The water really helps relieve the pain and open up the follicles.</li>
            <li> and it works absolutely the same.</li>
            <li> And a period after it has grown in a soft touch.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t really see a lot of hair grow back until about 1.5 weeks.</li>
            <li> , I had a Braun I bought at Macy&#x27;s in the late 90s, which lasted for about 10 years, and worked better than the Coil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, the downside is this shaver is wired, so u must be near to a elec point.</li>
            <li> I had an old one of these-</li>
            <li> I lost my old one</li>
            <li> She was using some old philips epilator for years.</li>
            <li> The only reason I pushed through is because I really don&#x27;t like shaving</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t leave the skin completely smooth either, so I&#x27;d recommend exfoliating and moisturizing the day after, which you&#x27;ll want to do once in a while to avoid a few ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Had to replace an old one.</li>
            <li> your skin is really sensitive like mine and it hurts,</li>
            <li> I am 61 years old</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have as much leg hair as a younger person.</li>
            <li> It leaves you as soft as a Kitty.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For people whose skin is sensitive there is a glove with gel inside.</li>
            <li> It is quite loud.</li>
            <li> It also sounds like an adult product, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> It got a lot of the hairs away, which I was surprised to see.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using it for years, I don&#x27;t notice the pain anymore, but I did notice that my old Epil would miss hairs.</li>
            <li> This product, possibly because of the slower speed, didn&#x27;t cause as much discomfort as others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> For the sake of a complete review, I even tried in under my arms.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for another option for hair removal, this one not only works, but works gently.</li>
            <li> abd my legs are so soft still.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a bit loud</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not too loud that I couldn&#x27;t listen to music while epilating.</li>
            <li> So far, I have used all the provided parts of the epilator, which includes the epilator, efficiency cap, shaver head, trimmer cap, cleaning brush except for the cooling liquid and the glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, the fact that the epilator needs to be plugged in for usage requires the need to be near an outlet at all times.</li>
            <li> My old one broke and was biting me.</li>
            <li> So I decided to buy the closest thing I could find to the old one.  </li>
            <li> The old model had tweezers, but this one has one stationary side and one that moves in and out to grab the hairs.  </li>
            <li> or they are so soft I can&#x27;t feel them.  </li>
            <li> It really does work if you know how to use it properly</li>
            <li> Some may want to avoid using it on sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes my underarms feel so soft.</li>
            <li> Satinelle soft for 4 years and had to replace it because the head wasn&#x27;t working well after a while</li>
            <li> (http://www.amazon.com/Braun-SE7681-Silk-%C3%A9pil-Epilator-White/dp/B0077PLNNE/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1436110018&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;braun+epilator) I definitely think it&#x27;s worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> I really should have purchased a new one much sooner, but I kept using my previous (probably 12 years old)Epilator</li>
            <li> tryed my sister&#x27;s one from other brand and was much painless and wiredless, much practical....</li>
            <li> I had used one of the original Epiladies from long, long ago and swore I&#x27;d never try one again.  </li>
            <li> Even if I don&#x27;t get completely smooth results if it helps the hair grow back less frequently and finer</li>
            <li> but i wouldn&#x27;t necessarily recommend this particular one to a friend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.azon product page outlining the various Braun Silk-Epil models says that the Silk-Epil 5 is rechargeable.</li>
            <li> The Silk epil 5 has 2 speeds, low and high</li>
            <li> brand new Braun Silk-Epil 5 is an enormous improvement over my old Braun.</li>
            <li> I think he still wants to try it out long term and will probably be getting something to exfoliate and moisturize.</li>
            <li> This is the first epilator that I have ever used and the decision to try it came when I saw it on Amazon&#x27;s cyber Monday deals and was curious as to just what it was.</li>
            <li> Well, I used the trimming head first and, in the end, spent over two hours.</li>
            <li> For someone who is older, whose hair is thicker, and who doesn&#x27;t wax or tweeze, this product is not a good fit for you.  </li>
            <li> The middle is off, the left for regular speed and right for faster speed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Pivoting heads makes hard to do spots like knee area easy and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;-Does</li>
            <li> The product is not suitable for fine hair - it could not pull the hair strands out and ended up breaking almost 50pc of them.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Silk Epil probably over 20 years, getting used to the new design of the floating head.  </li>
            <li> It grabs the smallest of hairs, and works very fast compared to other brands I have used before.</li>
            <li> but it does leave an unattractive red \\&quot;hickey\\&quot; where the skin was pinched and obviously doesn&#x27;t feel very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unlike the expensive cavitation machine, Braun is Braun for a reason:  good, solid history of manufacturing products.</li>
            <li> even bother with the \\&quot;extra gentle\\&quot; setting unless you&#x27;re very sensitive to pain.</li>
            <li> think I&#x27;m just a little bit more sensative to this type of hair removal system than other folks or</li>
            <li> Oh yeah, it works, but at a cost of some major torture.</li>
            <li> legs are not completely smooth after my first use, because much of the hair is still too short from just shaving 2 days ago, which is why my plan is to depilitate every day or 2..</li>
            <li> but the razor head was not sharp anymore.</li>
            <li> Sensitive areas obviously hurt more, less sensitive areas hurt less, and the longer I used it in one period,</li>
            <li> The only hair growth is new hair that is short and soft.  </li>
            <li> but I was ready to move on to the big leagues with a flat epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Can do without cooling pad though, other than that, the attachments given are useful for different functions.</li>
            <li> However, it takes quite a while to epilate such a large area and though the pain isn&#x27;t extreme, it gets hard to take to do both legs at the same time - and I am grateful I don&#x27;t need to use it on the area they indicate are more sensitive -</li>
            <li> I was able to do both of my legs in less than 30 minutes and the redness dissipated in less than 2 hours.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was my first use of an epilator, so I&#x27;m not sure if it was particular brand that sucked, or if epilators are all around not the way to go for me...</li>
            <li> I bought the other one for about the same price as this one $55, and it started slowing down after about 5 years of use, though it was mostly because it got caught on a thread that ended up tangling it up.</li>
            <li> mo3PUEZAYI0IWV5]]The video covers a lot of specifics, but here are the general highlights:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It breaks hair and requires multiple passes to clear.</li>
            <li> I did some research and changed a few things, and have not had any (or at least very many) ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> When epilating I move through a small area, then move the epilator back a bit to shine the light on the area I just epilated.</li>
            <li> for the painfulness of using it, that&#x27;s pretty much over unless you have extremely delicate skin.  </li>
            <li> The head is completely washable, which is a big plus.</li>
            <li> My upper legs are too sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just a big old baby.</li>
            <li> It recently broke after nearly 7 yrs.</li>
            <li> and I got this one because my old one was gross, but was still working.</li>
            <li> but I could barely see the difference.</li>
            <li> I kept it on my upper lip for quite awhile, hence the burn, but otherwise it shouldn&#x27;t be hot enough to burn you (unless you hold it on one spot for a long time like me!).&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> Barely.  </li>
            <li> Apparently hurts like hell.</li>
            <li> It does not seem to pull the tiny hairs out as well as the old one.  </li>
            <li> The hair grew faster than with my old one, similar to if I would have shave</li>
            <li> My old EpiLady finally died after a number of years so this was a replacement.</li>
            <li> For a relatively hairless chick like me, it means I can be almost completely hair-</li>
            <li> When I shave, it normally grows back stubbly by the next morning.</li>
            <li> The on off switch is kind of difficult</li>
            <li> it completely died in about 6 months, which made me pretty upset, as it was not cheap at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave</li>
            <li> this is the worse epilator i ever used in my life, even shaving has a better results than this.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I&#x27;m thrilled about this product.  </li>
            <li> There is a lot of redness after epilation, so you definitely want to do your epilating at night and let your skin calm down before you have to be seen in public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It could be true if you&#x27;ve spent years using epilators, I guess, but certainly not at the beginning.</li>
            <li> I was under the impression this would yank hair out by the roots much like waxing and tweezing, but it appears to be a standard dry razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy, not too painful after the first go, and you shouldn&#x27;t have any ingrown hairs if you&#x27;re careful</li>
            <li> I started on my lower leg on the less fleshy part first.  </li>
            <li> As I mentioned previously I was interested in this feature but didn&#x27;t have the highest of hopes as I knew it could be hit or miss.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m less interested in that.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, I don&#x27;t really use my epilator for more than the one area, so I&#x27;m not sure if some areas are more painful than others, but I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a few people complaining about the loose connector and thought this was important to point out.</li>
            <li> thing I didn&#x27;t like was the power cord came unplugged from the device very easily and the device became unplugged several times while I was using it, which wasn&#x27;t a huge deal, but it was a bit annoying once I got on a roll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> embarked on my hair removal quest in February: I intended to remove all of my body hair semi-permanently, maintaining the removal with the epilator, or at least significantly decrease the hair&#x27;s density and thickness.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I buy another one these I want to at least be worth the ingrown hairs!</li>
            <li> The pain was sharp and did not go away through the whole process.</li>
            <li> When the hair started coming in after these few days, it also wasn&#x27;t soft and fine like I had expected it to be; it was just as coarse and pointy as if I had shaved it, only it took longer to grow out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My one real qualm, and this is one I&#x27;ve had with other brands, is that it&#x27;s actually pretty bad at getting those hairs &amp;#34;as close as 0.5 mm.&amp;#34;  Rather than pluck them, the tweezers tend to break them because the hairs are too fine at that point to get a decent grip on.  </li>
            <li> but I thought for sure by now they would have improved it to be better and less painful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There were also some spots, such as my calf, back of knee, and kneecap that seemed to always have some amount of hair and never be completely smooth-feeling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like the round control which looks nice but not nice to use</li>
            <li> I got little bumps when I first used it</li>
            <li> (Series 5-5280) does not get all the fine hairs, even after going over the area several times, and the head is not very flexible on the uneven areas like knee caps.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, if you&#x27;re looking for modern day torture devices look no further.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and initially it took few minutes to get used to it, then I dint feel much pain.</li>
            <li> I tried it, and not only did it not work well, but it can grab and scar skin if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> I barely managed that last one.</li>
            <li> but after a while she noticed that the hairs were barely coming off even after making several passes.</li>
            <li> big difference between this one and the old different brand she had, initially there was a little&lt;br /&gt;pain</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few months now and it was my first time ever using.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks with my first epilator</li>
            <li> for ingrown hairs: I had a few after my first session.</li>
            <li> normally Nair or wax my legs and was curious to see if the technology had improved over the years.</li>
            <li> In the video I go over a few things you can do to reduce the pain if it is your first time.</li>
            <li> did after the first few sessions when they turn up the levels.</li>
            <li> But so did tweezing your eyebrows the first few times.  </li>
            <li> I wish it came with a soothing salve or wax for the first few uses.</li>
            <li> carefully that the overwhelming absence of any negative word in there.</li>
            <li> I tried doing it very slowly and very quickly.  </li>
            <li> The attachments that come with it are to shave more sensitive areas or very close to the skin- the later being something I haven&#x27;t tried because it looks like it would be painful.</li>
            <li> Lasts long no mess.</li>
            <li> My other epilator works very handy with rechargeable battery and can even work in the showers.&lt;br /&gt;- awkward switch.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This unit is a real improvement over previous ones.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The one benefit is that the regrowth was much smoother and less stubbly.</li>
            <li> I know ingrown hairs are normal with epilators but the Braun epilator seems to have a negative effect on my hairs because my skin on my legs used to be so much smoother with the Emjoi.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Comparatively, the Epilator isn&#x27;t quick - at least not for the legs.  </li>
            <li> My endorphins finally kicked in after the first few minutes</li>
            <li> No damage, didn&#x27;t drop it or anything other than normal use.</li>
            <li> But it definitely takes less time that waxing and very convenient to use.</li>
            <li> (the few times after it took less time because I was comfortable with the machine by then.  </li>
            <li> It only takes one or two times of getting sensitive skin stuck between the opposing heads to inspire anyone to switch to a single head epilator.</li>
            <li> So if you are thinking of getting this, then just know that it will take a little getting used to before you will really appreciate it.</li>
            <li> The other one still works, however it is made for Europe since I use to live in Europe.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Amazon delivered it very fast as usual.</li>
            <li> Takes a little longer than shaving and it really does remove extremely short hairs.</li>
            <li> so my review might be different from others who have thicker hair, but if you have really thin hair, I hope this will help you because I could not find any reviews from people with fine hair for multiple products...</li>
            <li> Second, it is true that once your skin/body \\&quot;adjusts\\&quot; to the process, it hurts less and less each time.  </li>
            <li> This arise partly because event the lowest speed is FAST and hence there is no way to slowly epilate if you&#x27;re sensitive.</li>
            <li> only down side is I live in Australia</li>
            <li> Right out of the box my number one complaint is it didn&#x27;t come with an instruction manual</li>
            <li> Legs took me a little longer the first time because I was nervous and extra careful.  </li>
            <li> Also it doesn&#x27;t have the other addaptors the old one had.</li>
            <li> So all you ladies out there here is a new ouch less devise to remove all those unwanted hairs, face, legs, etc.</li>
            <li> May be a bit more painful for those who normally shave.</li>
            <li> Any irritation I have is gone by the next day if not a few hours later and over the years, I now have less hair that is growing in because of epilating.</li>
            <li> Printing, have not had it long enough to tell anything final.</li>
            <li> It gets hot after awhile, usually after quite a long while</li>
            <li> it takes much longer than shaving and it misses little hairs ALL over despite everything I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy with it, just sad that I couldn&#x27;t find the other model anywhere :s</li>
            <li> I have to say that it works, but you will need to go over the same places a few times; and for women, DO NOT do it during that time of the month when your nerves are extra sensitive!</li>
            <li> process was much less painful than I recalled, which is great news.  </li>
            <li> and I have no idea how to properly use this razor beyond the basic dry razor aspect.</li>
            <li> I can surmise how to attach the heads and use it as a daily dry razor to shave my legs and such, but the epilator aspect is beyond me.</li>
            <li> Never had this problem with any other similar items, so I&#x27;m not sure why they couldn&#x27;t get this right.  </li>
            <li> The higher setting is for &amp;#34;experienced&amp;#34; epilators, and I do not fall into that category (at least not yet).&lt;br</li>
            <li> shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I remember my first experience with my epi lady coil depilatory in the late 1980&#x27;s and...</li>
            <li> It takes entirely too long.</li>
            <li> Advantageous because it eliminates the use of batteries and you do not need to care about having enough charge on it for a long body epilation time.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t consider it a complaint as this epilator blows my other epilator (with full metal tweezers) out of the water on accuracy</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t consider it a complaint as this epilator blows my other epilator (with full metal tweezers) out of the water on accuracy</li>
            <li> the design is some how that the cord doesn&#x27;t stick in tightly and falls out frequently during use and that is a pain!</li>
            <li> I will say the first one or two times it does hurt a little bit - if you can get past the first few strokes</li>
            <li> Although if you are going over a meaty section that isn&#x27;t flat like your leg, it COULD pinch you so be warned!</li>
            <li> the less sensitive areas she used it on</li>
            <li> I spent the entire time trying to hold the cord in place or putting it back in.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning the epilator can be annoying as it takes a while to clean with the brush, but certainly not impossible.</li>
            <li> My delight with the product was quickly extinguished the first time I used it and discovered how painful it was.  </li>
            <li> Not enough to be noticeable to other people, but enough for me.</li>
            <li> Even after using it in circles, even after going over the same area numerous times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other annoyance with this device is that IT HAS TO BE PLUGGED IN WHILE USING IT.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I find I am only able to remove half the hairs, so it sort of defeats the purpose of using the device.  </li>
            <li> All subsequent treatments have proven disappointing and I&#x27;ve had to return to shaving because the device left behind so much hair no matter how many times I went over the same area.</li>
            <li> high price but low experiencing，feel hard pain when use it，</li>
            <li> The cooling &amp;#34;mitt&amp;#34; it comes with is a little bit gimmicky (it&#x27;s basically just a sleeve for a cold pack - you can use your own cold packs just fine ; ) ) but</li>
            <li> It still feels a little warm and uncomfortable but certainly not painful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> To be honest, the pain is not as bad as people say it is,&lt;br /</li>
            <li> while using this epilator was more painful than shaving in general</li>
            <li> The cord is long enough, the light is extremely useful to identify small hairs that were missed,  no doubt it is painful</li>
            <li> really cordless like listing says, or commonly defective.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not, however the cord is sufficiently long.</li>
            <li> If the hair gets too long, use the shaver and then buzz the stubble.</li>
            <li> but then the insides of the head were jammed with hair and the head wouldn&#x27;t open no matter what I tried</li>
            <li> That said, I also hadn&#x27;t epilated in a long time when I used this one so that could have intensified the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> or so that I spent on this especially since the Emoji epilator alone costs around $60 and that doesn&#x27;t even come with a shaver.</li>
            <li> My name is Wandrwoman and I am a long term epilator.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Epilators have come a long way baby, since the 1980&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I spent about 20 minutes, granted, I am 40 now, so my leg hair is sparser than when I was younger (and I now - of course I have lip hair - ahhhh, to be a woman!).</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to grow my leg hair out long at all for the epilator to catch it and get rid of it.</li>
            <li> I guess if you were trimming fairly long hair (bikini area)</li>
            <li> I guess if you were trimming fairly long hair (bikini area)</li>
            <li> Wish I&#x27;d just purchased it a long time ago.</li>
            <li> You can also use the shaver attachment to precut hairs that are too long for epilation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used epilators as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like that you need to use it plugged, since there is no cordless, but anyway is a minor thing to consider.</li>
            <li> spent a lot of time trying to get the same results I get with a razor or waxing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a minor quibble</li>
            <li> For the money that will be saved waxing/ shaving, plus the hope that it will thin hair over time, I say it&#x27;s worth a shot.</li>
            <li> So I ignored that annoying fact because I had good results.</li>
            <li> Much quicker and less messy than waxing.</li>
            <li> Either you are on the regular feed or faster speed, when you try to switch it off, you tend to slide all the way to the other speed setting instead of off.</li>
            <li> I am only giving it 3 stars however due to the fragility of the parts and also I wish it was the wet/dry.  </li>
            <li> I am only giving it 3 stars however due to the fragility of the parts and also I wish it was the wet/dry.  </li>
            <li> The product is designed for removal of leg hair, but can also be used in other areas to remove short hair.  </li>
            <li> but I have to epilate only once a week instead of shaving every other day.</li>
            <li> There are other options (such as [[ASIN:B004OVH8H4 Emjoi</li>
            <li> There are other options (such as [[ASIN:B004OVH8H4 Emjoi</li>
            <li> My underarms are a little red with some ingrown hairs, but I can see a big difference!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using the enclosed cold pack the first time you use it.</li>
            <li> The cord is very long and it can be a bit of a bother sometimes, but you learn to work with it</li>
            <li> I have had it less than a year, and it is slowing down, hardly working at full power.</li>
            <li> figured I was the happiest with Braun before, and chose this one to avoid recharging time, and didn&#x27;t care for Wet/ Dry option.  </li>
            <li> Always use an epilator on dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget to leave time for it to dry before using it.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> I had many painful blue spots because of that.</li>
            <li> I was afraid of the pain, but it is obvious that you have to feel it if you want to be free of undesirable hair.</li>
            <li> And if you use it regularly where you only have a few hairs at a time, you won&#x27;t feel it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No messes to clean up, no waxes left behind to remove &amp; no more scalded feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t miss one single hair.</li>
            <li> I can be hairless every single day of the year.</li>
            <li> it is very cool, you cannot feel any discomfort using this epilator, the cold pad helps a lot with it also.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> With that in mind, I was a bit nervous to get started - I picked a small patch of hair near my ankle and jumped in.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, on the lower setting, it took a lot of back and forth over the same area to really pull all of the hair.  </li>
            <li> My armpits left dark shadows</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious to see how long it takes the hair to grow back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The one I had for years fell victim to a flood in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> I think the product sold to me has loose heads.</li>
            <li> I was close to the outlet, but simple movement up and down the leg unplugged the cable.</li>
            <li> Subsequent uses did inflict less pain.</li>
            <li> Her grow back rate is about a week and a half to two when she uses this.</li>
            <li> In addition, wet epilating seemed to work slower than dry.</li>
            <li> A week later I saw some sporadic growth and epilated again, which took less than thirty minutes.</li>
            <li> The redness was a lot less in these occasions and was gone by the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, when I tried to look for hairs on my legs, I could only find like less than 10 hairs in total slightly growing.</li>
            <li> Over the past several months I&#x27;ve determined it&#x27;s something I definitely want to stick with</li>
            <li> Personally I like to just stay on the slower speed as I find there to be a lot less breakage this way.</li>
            <li> Personally I like to just stay on the slower speed as I find there to be a lot less breakage this way.</li>
            <li> some day, in the future, the hair is going to grow thinner and even less than now.</li>
            <li> the head now moves and makes towards you have to pass several times on the same spot to remove the small hairs.</li>
            <li> The clipper attachment seems to be pretty much useless, which is not a big downside for me.</li>
            <li> a long time user of Epil products (25 yrs), on legs only, the &amp;#34;ouch!&amp;#34; factor does not apply to me, so the extra items (different heads, cold pack etc) are just &amp;#34;filler&amp;#34; to appeal to new users.  </li>
            <li> At least so far it has been for me!</li>
            <li> Have used Braun Silk Epil for years, not sure what model number my last one was, but it was quite a few years old.</li>
            <li> Does not clean properly .</li>
            <li> I was wishing the head was a little larger</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous to use this product simply because of the pain I thought would come with it.</li>
            <li> My underarms did get a little red, but after like 3 minutes, the redness was gone and my underarms looked great!&lt;br</li>
            <li> On the 5th day, overall hairs have started to regrow a little</li>
            <li> No plucking little piles of hair out of the corners of the device, no shaking the thing repeatedly to get all the hairs out of the back.  </li>
            <li> have very thick fast growing hair.</li>
            <li> After each use the hair grows back finer and finer until it hardly grows back at all.</li>
            <li> If I had never waxed my legs before I would&#x27;ve found the experience of using the epilator much more painful.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t more painful than waxing.</li>
            <li> As the title says, this is the most painful epilator I have ever tried</li>
            <li> This epilator (for me) causes the Hugest, Most Painful ingrown hairs of which is something that I have Never had in my life until purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> which gets more painful with each try.&lt;br</li>
            <li> efficient\\&quot; (read more painful).  </li>
            <li> It was painful but the results were better than expected.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to epilate my armpits before--it was just too painful.</li>
            <li> I have owned the old one for at least 10 years and it was still working quite well</li>
            <li> The first time i used it, it was so painful but by the second time it barely hurt at all.</li>
            <li> but I expected that.</li>
            <li> Epilation doesn&#x27;t pain that much as I expected.</li>
            <li> Just to give you an idea - a few days back, I picked up Philips by accident to do my business</li>
            <li> I was done a few mins later.</li>
            <li> so you need to be careful while using it.</li>
            <li> I do recommend to the men to tread carefully if using this on your face.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s military</li>
            <li> up on epilators for few years, and finally back to shopping for one this year.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was a replacement after an earlier épilator started giving trouble within months.</li>
            <li> When I use the product, the results lasts for longer than I ever expected.</li>
            <li> Tried Braun to see how others brands are, but after my experience and waste of money, I&#x27;m back to Satinelle again.</li>
            <li> I have had minimal ingrown</li>
            <li> This process takes a lot of work, and there&#x27;s not much payoff.</li>
            <li> Few months later the cap of the epilator head starts to get out of place during using and squeeze my skin inbetween the cap and the head.</li>
            <li> but it definitely took a few strokes to get to my desired results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this item for 54 dollars and if it does not break for any unfortunate reason, I believe that purchasing this item will be worth spending my money.</li>
            <li> but it really is not.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I still shave all the time, although there&#x27;s not much hair on my legs or under my arms.</li>
            <li> There are still areas such as behind the knee and closer to my bikini area that are too sensitive.  </li>
            <li> left my old one behind.</li>
            <li> I agree that the On switch being a dial is kind of annoying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using epilators for over 10 years, and I always liked Braun epilators, but this one has a really annoying defect in the design, which is the charging cable getting unplugged all the time while using the epilator.</li>
            <li> /&gt;PAIN Where waxing is usually one sharp, fast rip that has a sort of impact almost like being slapped, the epilator feels like a series of pricks or small zaps.</li>
            <li> /&gt;PAIN Where waxing is usually one sharp, fast rip that has a sort of impact almost like being slapped, the epilator feels like a series of pricks or small zaps.</li>
            <li> I read every single review on this website and other websites on the epilation Process and this product and other products before i bought this product.</li>
            <li> So if you think you are not strong enough feeling pain</li>
            <li> I also have less and less hair each time it grows back.  </li>
            <li> dial to turn it on (settings low and high and off) is horrible and easily overshoots to the opposite setting.&lt;br /&gt;Claims to have a pivoting head; this is false, the CAP that fits over the tweezer wheel pivotes, but not the actual tweezer</li>
            <li> Move from clean to dirty areas on your body.</li>
            <li> it smarts the first few times but if you can suck it up after that the pain is significantly decreased.</li>
            <li> But an already up-side is that the half of my leg that I have finished hasn&#x27;t grown back even a little bit.</li>
            <li> The plug does not fit properly it keeps on coming out when&#x27;s are using it not happy with the product simple problem that the plug should plug in the points properly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if other epilators are faster.  </li>
            <li> have gone from shaving every other day to using to SE5280 twice a week.  </li>
            <li> Once there is no more hair left, it doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> I will still use it on the other two areas with hopes to eliminate some hair growth all together.</li>
            <li> I did not try bikini line yet, but judging from other comments on epilators, I may just hold off on it for a while longer.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure it is necessarily any gentler than other epilators.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s alright.</li>
            <li> The other cap is called \\&quot;the efficiency cap\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I dont know how people can use it for other areas ..</li>
            <li> I use this on my legs and other have used it on my face</li>
            <li> and I have tried other before.</li>
            <li> I have not tried the trimmer or other accessories yet</li>
            <li> For that i had to manually take a sharp object and pull them out and then epilate.</li>
            <li> Judging from the other reviews of this, the excruciating pain was not exclusive to gender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Braun seemed to have the largest variety of epilator types over all other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> all the way to the other speed.  </li>
            <li> I figure if I can&#x27;t see the hairs, other people won&#x27;t see them either.</li>
            <li> She didn&#x27;t have any other model to compare it too.</li>
            <li> I do a pass every other day with it as</li>
            <li> and I have to say that I preferred the other one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Frankly, unpleasant, but part of that is definitely my fault, since it was pretty shaggy there and didn&#x27;t trim.</li>
            <li> Finer hairs are still left behind which left me having to shave anyway.</li>
            <li> , I plugged it in and was surprised that it wasn&#x27;t crazy loud like the one I had years ago.  </li>
            <li> This was my first time using and epilator and one very painful experience, one I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m to wildly interested in repeating.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Notes from another user in the household: The less effective, less painful setting is simply not worthwhile.</li>
            <li> I used to regard Braun as a good company to make durable products, but I am very disappointed now.</li>
            <li> IT was also hard to pull the skin on the back of my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Since external URL posting is not allowed in Amazon reviews, you&#x27;ll just have to search for the web page yourself, but it isn&#x27;t hard to find.</li>
            <li> Upper legs are kinda hard to get too.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to buy a cheap one for the fear that, well, it would be a bad epilator.</li>
            <li> second treatment wasnt as bad as first because I knew what I was in for ...</li>
            <li> Several reviews complained about the cord coming off</li>
            <li> Assuming, perhaps naively, that the pain had reached a density and intensity that couldn&#x27;t possibly be increased upon.</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;ve used the epilator several times over the past week since my leg hair was growing in somewhat unevenly</li>
            <li> My introduction to this method of hair removal was sometime in the late 1980&#x27;s with the Epilady, a medieval looking device with an exposed curved metal coil.</li>
            <li> power cord is extremely long (90\\&quot;), there is a small brush for cleaning the heads, and everything fits neatly into a draw string pouch for storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> power cord is extremely long (90\\&quot;), there is a small brush for cleaning the heads, and everything fits neatly into a draw string pouch for storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works like a charm, I would say average hair growth.</li>
            <li> I was pretty frustrated with the last one I bought, as the drive wheel on the razor stopped working almost immediately.</li>
            <li> Aspirin helps, and be careful what time of the month you do it--if your body is tender already, wait a few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times and the pain ranges from minimal to unnoticeable.</li>
            <li> This works worse than my five year old one.  </li>
            <li> If you shave constantly your hair is thick</li>
            <li> As far as pain, waxes are 10x worse than this.</li>
            <li> After a few tries I do get it to turn off, but it shouldn&#x27;t be this hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very pale with quite dark hair, and a little coarse.</li>
            <li> Its not very smooth.</li>
            <li> Also I&#x27;ve found it to be less painful to epilate shortly after taking a hot bath or shower</li>
            <li> Also I&#x27;ve found it to be less painful to epilate shortly after taking a hot bath or shower</li>
            <li> Least pain is shaving, longest lasting is waxing, but the epilator will result in less hair over time...</li>
            <li> you have issues with ingrown hairs, I recommend stopping by a Trader Joes and getting some tea tree oil (I&#x27;m saying this because I&#x27;ve seen people rate down epilators and write reviews saying &amp;</li>
            <li> i usually wax my arms and legs, but this has the same results without the mess!</li>
            <li> Painful, but very much worth it!</li>
            <li> Before writing this review, I went and read some of the other reviews as I wondered whether I would be too harsh to say NEVER AGAIN with this product.</li>
            <li> There were a few other perks about it</li>
            <li> It recommends pulling the skin taut during use as well, which does make the pain less.  </li>
            <li> The longer I would use the epilator anywhere, the less it would hurt (as endorphins kicked in, maybe?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the less it</li>
            <li> For one thing, it hurts less.</li>
            <li> I had previously.</li>
            <li> It epilates hair faster than the previous one I had.</li>
            <li> This epilator cost less than one waxing appointment</li>
            <li> Less hair to pull out each time.  </li>
            <li> It took me about a week to get half my leg finished.</li>
            <li> Again, it took me less than thirty minutes.</li>
            <li> My previous silk-épil lasted 10yrs.</li>
            <li> and less hair growing back.&lt;br /&gt;Always used Braun for quality.  </li>
            <li> but I did slightly burn myself when I tried using the product on my face and mistook the heat for the pain of epilating.</li>
            <li> Here and there hairs are half plugged and edges are seen.</li>
            <li> I thought that twice the amount of tweezers might make the epilator hurt less.</li>
            <li> Less regrowth over time</li>
            <li> I tested it on my arm and noticed a slight tingle.  </li>
            <li> I read reviews that pain gets less after each epilation secession.</li>
            <li> Also the head is narrower and it has never had the power that the previous one had.</li>
            <li> I got the previous Silk epil 5 before but it broke.</li>
            <li> The description on the product says it is cordless which is not true.</li>
            <li> One thing I agree with the other reviewer&#x27;s here is that it does the job but is quite painful especially if you&#x27;re sensitive.</li>
            <li> But I also didn&#x27;t want to buy an expensive one, just in case it didn&#x27;t live up to its performance.</li>
            <li> was super painful</li>
            <li> so it was super painful epilatin</li>
            <li> does not clean all hair at armpit</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much less messy than waxing</li>
            <li> Again, lots faster and less trouble than waxing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Was using a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; epilator previously, so this one feels painful on first try!</li>
            <li> the positive side, it&#x27;s less painful than I expected.</li>
            <li> It helps to take little breaks in between.</li>
            <li> I bleeded a little, but I think it was just because I&#x27;m not used to epilating or waxing that area.</li>
            <li> If you already pulling your hairs on your legs or arms, then you know the drill, and this little machine will have it done in no time.</li>
            <li> and I could epilate a little faster using that.  </li>
            <li> Yes, there is a little pain in the beginning</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, of course it&#x27;s going to hurt, you&#x27;re ripping out your hair with a little electronic gismo.  </li>
            <li> A LOT, just do little bits at a</li>
            <li> like I did because two of the little plastic comb teeth busted off.  :</li>
            <li> You just detach the power cord, pop off the cap and brush it with the little included brush.  </li>
            <li> You just detach the power cord, pop off the cap and brush it with the little included brush.  </li>
            <li> It hurts a little bit at the beginning when the hair is pulled out.</li>
            <li> That was a little trickier.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it and she was a little bit concern about buying it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it a little while now</li>
            <li> and it looks working a little worse.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Very minimal pain (like small pricks to the skin)</li>
            <li> Works well, but you do have to make several passes, even going very slowly to get all the hairs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Taking that into account, I set this bad boy onto my leg and nearly howled like Teen Wolf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really find it disappointing</li>
            <li> The cold really helps take the pain away as the hair is removed.</li>
            <li> If I could do it again, I would put a bag of ice in my lap while I epilated my legs and let the whole area numb up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really helps you see what you&#x27;re doing in those awkward spots, and it highlights the hairs you&#x27;re hoping to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this epilator for a few months now on my arms and underarms.</li>
            <li> and it is never smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having used these for years, I can pass along a few tips.</li>
            <li> and I used to shave them everyday.</li>
            <li> Now I can just touch up the few hairs that pop</li>
            <li> I wish my old one had broken sooner!  </li>
            <li> now that  I have used it a few times</li>
            <li> the my legs are not totally smooth after I am done...</li>
            <li> and then a few hairs are getting longer</li>
            <li> Will save you time from shaving everyday.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to waste my money.</li>
            <li> It has missed a few hairs on my legs  but nothing to get upset over.  </li>
            <li> Waxes always left stubble behind that had to be waxed again &amp; again &amp; again</li>
            <li> It does tend to leave some hair cut rather than pulled out, which i disliked.</li>
            <li> * The plug on this cord is designed to click into place inside the epilator but requires a firm push.</li>
            <li> The product was not tested on myself, but by my wife who switched away from a sub $20 unit for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now and well...  </li>
            <li> I have always used Braun epilators and have tried the cordless one for a few years.</li>
            <li> I suppose; it comes with a few trimming heads that I have yet to try, but they seem like they could be helpful too.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled to be throwing away all my dreadful, goopy DIY waxing kits.</li>
            <li> I have to firmly push the cable, as it was loosen every time I moved the epilator.</li>
            <li> This hurt even after doing it a few times.</li>
            <li> There are some broken hairs left behind but waxing left some too.</li>
            <li> Again with the shagginess that I was too impatient to trim, and I suggest you learn from my mistakes and trim the hair close to the skin, then let it grow for a week or so before epilating.</li>
            <li> Again with the shagginess that I was too impatient to trim, and I suggest you learn from my mistakes and trim the hair close to the skin, then let it grow for a week or so before epilating.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Basically, don&#x27;t waste your money on the elongated version of this model.</li>
            <li> The slower speed pulls hairs out at a slower speed, meaning that for any given area, it pulls fewer hairs out at a time and is therefore less painful than the higher speed would be.</li>
            <li> BUT, I have kept up with epilating and it has been much, much less painful after the first session.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no more painful than using a semi-dull razor blade &amp; about as quick.</li>
            <li> Every two or three days I had to spend about half an hour going over spots I had already done in the past before I could make any progress on spots I hadn&#x27;t hit yet.</li>
            <li> I figured that since shaving dry scaly legs is not good then epilatoring (is that a word?)</li>
            <li> The legs do feel a little raw after an epilating session, sort of like a low-intensity rug burn.  </li>
            <li> So do small patches at a time, just as if you were waxing, with the skin held tight.</li>
            <li> So do small patches at a time, just as if you were waxing, with the skin held tight.</li>
            <li> However, epilating my arms and legs were not very painful, infact I would say it probably wasnt painful at all.</li>
            <li> and cant take it any where , have to sit near the switch as it works with the electricity only :(</li>
            <li> To say this product is painless is not True!</li>
            <li> no more dark shadowy underarms!</li>
            <li> All in all the experience was far less painful than childbirth and far less expensive than waxing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pain is not that bad once you get the first 5 minutes of it done and taking breaks.</li>
            <li> Keeping up with hair removal is much, much easier when it doesn&#x27;t involve a production.r /&gt;BIKINI AREA Deeply unpleasant, but again, some of that was user error.</li>
            <li> For non waxing users like me its a bit painful at first.</li>
            <li> She says it works, but it&#x27;s pretty painful on the legs.</li>
            <li> She said it was painful for the first time</li>
            <li> Yes at first its painful.</li>
            <li> It was pretty painful</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get every hair, but I think part of that is because my hair has become so thin after epilating for so long.</li>
            <li> It will get a few, but not most.</li>
            <li> not very effective when it comes to removing hair</li>
            <li> and you didn&#x27;t have to pass over the same area multiple times, it was just to painful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had older Phillips models which I frankly remember to be less painful but also had slower speeds.</li>
            <li> It worked just out of package, but failed to turn on after a few days later.</li>
            <li> After repeated uses though I have less breakage and regrowth takes at least two weeks before it becomes noticeable.  </li>
            <li> dry scaly ones would be worse.  </li>
            <li> recommend this product for people that can handle a little discomfort for a longer term results!</li>
            <li> The dial-shaped switch on the front is a little hard to use.  </li>
            <li> Then I realized because when you shave you are cutting adult hairs from the skin up</li>
            <li> works not perfectly, needs multiple epilations of one zone</li>
            <li> I have never had a problem with this machine before these past couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> Of course, the process of epilating is an uncomfortable feeling and will especially be for someone whose never epilated</li>
            <li> Epilator users usually do it in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> She tried an epilator in the past but still prefers waxing.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> So, I wind up epilating about once a month, usually get almost two weeks after that</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this head stopped working correctly after only a couple of months.  </li>
            <li> usually shave</li>
            <li> No more waiting around for the hair to grow</li>
            <li> It comes with a gel cooling sleeve, a cleaning brush and a small bag that holds</li>
            <li> Not sure why they use words like &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;comfort&amp;#34; because it&#x27;s everything but that.</li>
            <li> You do need to make sure you&#x27;re moisturizing/efoliating before use or the redness, irritation, and ingrown hairs will be terrible.</li>
            <li> No more making waxing appointments, driving there , and paying every time.</li>
            <li> A small package to carry around when I travel.</li>
            <li> If it does, usually going over it from another direction</li>
            <li> It have used Braun products in the past.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to find the head for the last model</li>
            <li> If it happens it&#x27;s not the most horrible thing in the world</li>
            <li> And, I assure you, I&#x27;m not a hairy beast with an excessive amount of hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through three or four Braun epilators over the past 15 years.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I do not recommend this one :(</li>
            <li> no more five o&#x27;clock shadow on my legs...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> /&gt;While it epilates well enough, the model design is seriously flawed in comparison to the 5270.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Cord</li>
            <li> For starters, my legs were not bright pink with each pass!!  </li>
            <li> I also found this one to be less painful than my old one.  </li>
            <li> My wife had a previous Braun model, for at least 5 years, and she needed at least 4-5 hours to finish the job on both legs.</li>
            <li> It is a lot faster than my previous one!!</li>
            <li> In this day and age, that seems a little ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> My plan is to try it every other day until the hair begins to thin out, and see from there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the massaging head, and I do think it makes it a little less painful to epilate.</li>
            <li> The second time I epilated around the bikini line, it was much, much less unpleasant.</li>
            <li> The second time I epilated around the bikini line, it was much, much less unpleasant.</li>
            <li> My skin is still red, irritated and slightly swollen afterwards, but it&#x27;s hardly painful at all anymore.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took a hard push to get it on</li>
            <li> Maybe the others didn&#x27;t push the cord on hard enough?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it might be hard to reach places like the knees...</li>
            <li> After two years it gets dull and doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned an epilator before and, while it&#x27;s always going to hurt a bit to use one of these, the old one was so painful that I could hardly stand it, and</li>
            <li> Too bad the &#x27;plucking&#x27; action did not work as efficiently.</li>
            <li> I have to epilate every 3 days and it takes 30 minutes at least.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- includes cold press to lessen pain prior to hair removal, and lessen swelling after hair removal</li>
            <li> I turned 30 and time was not kind to me)....</li>
            <li> Sucks in the skin.</li>
            <li> I remembered them as loud and painful</li>
            <li> My wife complained that during epilation her skin would get caught up in it and cause blood clots.</li>
            <li> Some people made them sound horrible!</li>
            <li> but WOW it was painful.  </li>
            <li> Painful as hell for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I did not want to spend too much on a epilator as I was scared I would hate it or the pain would be unbearable.</li>
            <li> does NOT stay plugged into the base, slips out very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , you still can see short hair on the skin surface looking like small black dots its so annoying</li>
            <li> was so disappointed I resold it on ebay and bought a new 5270</li>
            <li> Plus, it does not have the small brush that comes with it!</li>
            <li> It removes hairs after long sessions with the cheaper one, and it does it with less pain and less noise - two things she hated about</li>
            <li> It can remove very small hairs up to 0.5 mm.</li>
            <li> The first time I used the product, it was very painful.</li>
            <li> , it is impossible that they all grow at the same rate.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I am not brave enough to use it for underarms or thighs, I use veet cold wax strips for that.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> /&gt;It may be that I am used to epilating by now, but I find this model to be markedly less painful than the previous or others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> Now, every time I use it it less and less painful.  </li>
            <li> The pain wasn&#x27;t so bad, it hurts for the second it touches your skin and grabs the hair.</li>
            <li> Then I finally got up the nerve to use it, and it wasn&#x27;t as bad as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Not good for me.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry about it cutting you, I have never ever been cut when I&#x27;ve practically jammed the shaver head into my leg.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find the process painful but understand that can be an individual experience.  </li>
            <li> The cold pack helps numb the area because, let&#x27;s face it, ripping out several hairs by the root is not comfortable.</li>
            <li> I had a similar product about 15 years ago and it was terribly painful</li>
            <li> /&gt;Epilation itself is a painful process of removing hair, especially when removing the underms area, this is probably not the epilators fault.</li>
            <li> The first time is the worst.</li>
            <li> The shaver, though people complained that it wasn&#x27;t that close of a shave, I have to disagree!</li>
            <li> AND i don&#x27;t even have thick hair!  </li>
            <li> The adapter has a problem, and so the epilator motor is so slow !</li>
            <li> so I am going to try very hard to make this review about the epilator itself rather than a comparison between using a razor or using an epilator.</li>
            <li> But wow was it painful!  </li>
            <li> You get tough with pain endurance after all that time.</li>
            <li> The dial is a little awkward to turn on with one hand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is one slightly annoying thing about the shaver head, which is that you have to go over the area multiple times to get all the hairs.</li>
            <li> I would say approximately max 10 times if even.</li>
            <li> cannot use wax (allergies), and I am TIRED of</li>
            <li> I do not see any hairs that were broken off.</li>
            <li> Finally tired of stubble I moved on to waxing.  </li>
            <li> So I went from shaving (yuck), to waxing (hate it), and used a depilatory which left my skin with burns for days (ouch)!</li>
            <li> My hair is somewhat thin</li>
            <li> So convenient, but it still leaves some strays behind.</li>
            <li> This does the trick and it doesn&#x27;t hurt any worse than the laser</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used in epilator in nearly 20 years, and I had memories of a very painful process.  </li>
            <li> It was a little uncomfortable, but then again it is plucking hair from your pores!  </li>
            <li> and it was painful as some of the other reviews stated.</li>
            <li> There were some areas she didn&#x27;t want to use it due to fear it might be really painful.  </li>
            <li> but I find it too painful to sit down for a session.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still quite painful, and I hope that will go down over time...</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad product, but this one in no way compares with the previous model.</li>
            <li> It gets less painful though.</li>
            <li> I also found it less painful than waxing, but you should still expect the some sort of semi-painful sensation.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little bit painful</li>
            <li> A little painful</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worse than a pinterest fail.  </li>
            <li> and it was still VERY painful, secondly;</li>
            <li> stopped working after less than a year :(</li>
            <li> I wanted this so bad, and when it finally arrived, I was so nervous to start using it, because of all the reviews saying how painful it was.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s no more painful</li>
            <li> when I did my legs, it wasn&#x27;t too painful at all, and I don&#x27;t usually get waxed.</li>
            <li> I hate stubble, and the prickly feeling you get when you get little goosebumbs.</li>
            <li> push the cord firmly into the base</li>
            <li> I was skeptical</li>
            <li> /&gt;Realistically, if you are worried about the pain that this product produces, you merely need to look at what the manufacturer wrote.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I always used the epilator on setting 1 just because of the frightening noise it made on setting 2.</li>
            <li> I was getting bored just hearing that numbing buzz.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too expensive for something that doesn&#x27;t deliver it&#x27;s promise, I sent it back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it could be a bit uncomfortable at the beginning</li>
            <li> I can see how the underarm may be difficult to tolerate, as well as the bikini</li>
            <li> It was expensive but it works.  </li>
            <li> The pain element could&#x27;ve been enough to take all the stars away, but this product isn&#x27;t terrible if you can handle the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shaver head: I personally found the shaver head to be awful.</li>
            <li> I bought it to replace a Braun 5270 that unfortunately had stopped working.  </li>
            <li> Nope, same awful pain.</li>
            <li> Ladies,  gents, this is not for the faint of heart.  </li>
            <li> , sorry [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I find the on/off to be difficult - you have to turn it with your finger.  </li>
            <li> i thought its cordless with the charger, but i felt so sad that its with the cord.</li>
            <li> I like it because I spray tan in the summer, so it does not strip off my fake tan</li>
            <li> I was very confused.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was very frustrating.</li>
            <li> I suppose if you try and hate epilating, you at least have the razor to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Power cord keeps coming off while using...very annoying and not effective</li>
            <li> It is very difficult and painful to use, not a good buy.</li>
            <li> Now that I have kids, it is nearly impossible to find the time to go and it is expensive.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try this, hoping it would get rid of these nasty looking black underarms.</li>
            <li> (Yet, it would be silly for anyone to expect to buy an epilator and have no type of painful sensation knowing it is basically a motorized tweezing device).</li>
            <li> Dangerous epilator.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it would pinch my skin</li>
            <li> Having a cord in this day and age seems inconvenient.</li>
            <li> On this one they changed the on/off button, which is a bit awkward to change from speed II to I you always have to turn it off</li>
            <li> There is no way around it, removing hair by the roots from the bikini area requires a lot of awkward contortion and reaching.</li>
            <li> There is no way around it, removing hair by the roots from the bikini area requires a lot of awkward contortion and reaching.</li>
            <li> Yes, I was afraid...</li>
            <li> afraid of the pain that is.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m mad about it because I didn&#x27;t like it from the start.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it wasn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> Plus you won&#x27;t have to buy those expensive razor cartridges again!</li>
            <li> But boy was I wrong!</li>
            <li> I use this on my bikini area as epilation there causes mad ingrowns.</li>
            <li> I was stupid and thought no biggie ill get rid of the couple areas I have issues with ...</li>
            <li> AREA Deeply unpleasant, but again, some of that was user error.</li>
            <li> Very expensive, for me doesnt work i will return it .</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t nearly as bad as I imagined</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t nearly as bad as some of the horror stories I read online were.</li>
            <li> (It doesn&#x27;t hurt that bad)</li>
            <li> Bad design all around.  </li>
            <li> but if you are used to waxing, then this is not so bad.  </li>
            <li> This one is really bad.</li>
            <li> It was NOT as bad as I thought.</li>
            <li> My legs felt like a sting, but was bearable and my armpits weren&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li> I gave this product three chances before I judge its quality, and its bad.</li>
            <li> The pain is just as bad as I remember.</li>
            <li> (stay away from painful epilators that will pinch you, make you bleed, and give you infected ingrown hairs -- yuck)</li>
            <li> The process is painful</li>
            <li> it painful?  </li>
            <li> Really painful.</li>
            <li> does the job, it&#x27;s not as painful as I imagine it.</li>
            <li> Removing longer hairs can be painful</li>
            <li> However, my armpit hair removal attempt was quite painful.  </li>
            <li> Its painful process but</li>
            <li> /&gt;People complain about pain, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s painful after using it couple</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even finish one leg because it was so painful.</li>
            <li> It was extremely painful to use.  </li>
            <li> so Iits wasnt at all painful epilating my arms.</li>
            <li> My wife tried using it, but felt it was too painful for her liking.  </li>
            <li> As for the tweezer head, it is indeed painful, and the gel is not that efficient (maybe is my frigde, I don&#x27;t know).</li>
            <li> It works, it is not that painful.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be painful on my chin</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t find it painful, but then, I&#x27;ve been plucking my eyebrows since I was 12.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed</li>
            <li> I was sooo disappointed until I realized my mistake of picking up Philips.</li>
            <li> One thing that disappointed me was, i get lot of ingrown hair after using this.</li>
            <li> do not buy this one :(</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but i had to for this one because i was completely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed in this model and will probably be replacing it with another brand.</li>
            <li> The wire has a very bad connection to the machine and keeps disconnecting, which makes it impossible to use the epilator efficiently.</li>
            <li> You have to turn this stupid circle thing</li>
            <li> But, it is really annoying to have to reconnect the epilator every minute or</li>
            <li> I was so shocked!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never epilated before, IT IS PAINFUL!</li>
            <li> But the pain and scare of being sucked in by metal parts is very bad.</li>
            <li> Very bad, I have got the item without charger.</li>
            <li> Otherwise you could end up with very painful ingrown hairs if regrowth can&#x27;t get to the surface of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> SOOO disappointed!</li>
            <li> and I was very disappointed from this product.</li>
            <li> Worst of all, I got ingrown hair on my legs.</li>
            <li> Philips was pathetic.</li>
            <li> Worst design of an epilator.</li>
            <li> I have the 7th version of it, and it was terrible.</li>
            <li> Not even my worst enemy.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t terrible</li>
            <li> and I hated it!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Its a good product , my wife liked it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly good, but it still doesn&#x27;t catches everything. I often have to do 20 or more passes on the same spot.</li>
            <li> I really like it. Easy to use, effective and so much better than shaving. I also prefer this over waxing. Pull the trigger on this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love how epilators keep my hairs from growing back scratchy and itchy.  After a couple years of using them, my leg hairs are noticeably finer and my legs are never scratchy even when I let the hair grow back (winter...kind of let things go ;).  This particular epilator is the first full sized one I have owned.  It is faster than the little ones, but it is still a lot more time consuming than shaving.  If I want to stay perfectly hairless I have to epilate every 3 days and it takes 30 minutes at least.  I don&#x27;t know if other epilators are faster.  Still, I really like this.  I LOVE the light on it.  The heads clean easily under water.  The on off switch is kind of difficult but I like having 2 speed options...finer hair works better on slower speed.  The main thing is that it hasn&#x27;t died on me yet like the first 2 I had.  Tip: The instructions say to always use the protective head, but it is much more effective without it, just be careful around loose skin, it can get caught up in the tweezers.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few months now and it was my first time ever using.  For me, it works better on my arm pits than my legs.  It does not clear all the hairs on my legs no matter how many times I go over the same area.  It also pinches my skin sometimes under my arm pits.  It lasts about a week but does not get all hairs.  It cerainly does not make my legs smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time hurt! Be prepared. I needed to use the ice pack.  It gets less painful though.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and followed the advice.  1. make sure the hair isn&#x27;t too long (it tugs repeatedly before maybe pulling out the hair) 2. use on clean dry skin straight out of a bath/shower.  3.  push the cord firmly into the base and you shouldn&#x27;t have an problems  4.  I use a soft natural scrub brush in the shower to remove dead skin cells limiting ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it hurt?  It is like a snap of rubber band in the beginning but has lessened as I have continued to use it.  It works on my face taking the peach fuzz and some darker hairs ( not all because they grown in at different angles)  There are still areas such as behind the knee and closer to my bikini area that are too sensitive.  Here I use the very effective shaver that came with the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gone from shaving every other day to using to SE5280 twice a week.  Depending on your outlook it is either awesome to see the pile of pulled hairs as you clean out the unit or depressing because reminds a person of how hairy their body really is.</li>
            <li> The product came just as stated. It works great!</li>
            <li> I used this epilator for the first time last night, on my underarms. The pain wasn&#x27;t so bad, it hurts for the second it touches your skin and grabs the hair. It felt like it was scratching the surface of my skin but it was tolerable. It helps to take little breaks in between. It pulled most of the hairs from the root. I bleeded a little, but I think it was just because I&#x27;m not used to epilating or waxing that area. Once there is no more hair left, it doesn&#x27;t hurt. I used the attachment with the massage roller, I don&#x27;t think it did anything especial in particular. Overall I&#x27;m satisfied, my underarms are smooth and I can&#x27;t see the hair below the skin like I do when I shave. I&#x27;m going to try it on my arms next, mind you I&#x27;m a very hairy person and my arm hairs are long, maybe I&#x27;ll have to trim them first. I&#x27;ll continue to update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this epilator for a few months now on my arms and underarms. The first time I epilated it pulled out the hairs from the roots, but when they began to grow again it feels that it just cuts the hair because it grows back in three days and it is never smooth. And it still hurts.</li>
            <li> I have been epilating for years, but I have never used a Braun.  This is the best one I have ever used.  For some reason I assumed this was cordless but it&#x27;s not, however the cord is sufficiently long.</li>
            <li> this product supposed to work without keeping it plugged in but the one I receive doesn&#x27;t work without plugging it in when ever I unplugged it doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Wow the first I used this my eyes watered but it did a great job.  I used it on my legs underarms and bikini area, I went all out.  The hair didn&#x27;t come back for a week and when it did it was much more fine.  All great.  Now my legs hair is too fine it doesn&#x27;t grab it well and I&#x27;m left with too many noticably fine hairs even after going over my legs twice very slowly.  I will still use it on the other two areas with hopes to eliminate some hair growth all together.</li>
            <li> Great epilator; would give it 5 stars if only it was cordless.&lt;br /&gt;Still getting used to it, but results are great!(:&lt;br /&gt;If  you have issues with ingrown hairs, I recommend stopping by a Trader Joes and getting some tea tree oil (I&#x27;m saying this because I&#x27;ve seen people rate down epilators and write reviews saying &amp;#34;this is going in the trash&amp;#34; simply because of ingrown hairs, but those are not caused by the epilator..smh)&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice size, aesthetically pleasing; the built-in light really helps. Doesn&#x27;t heat up, picks up all hairs. I like it(:</li>
            <li> Great product, the light makes it awsome.. (My wife experience)</li>
            <li> It is very difficult and painful to use, not a good buy.</li>
            <li> My wife is very pleased with the product. She used to have an old Silk-epil 3, and she says that this one is much better. The head is completely washable, which is a big plus.</li>
            <li> It pretty much gets the job done.  After several uses it doesn&#x27;t hurt like I thought it would.  I use the traditional shaver too.  I like that it has dual use. I&#x27;ve used it only on my underarms.  If I can find a waxing method that I like, I would do that over using the epilator but it is still better than shaving.</li>
            <li> If you are considering buying an epilator, don&#x27;t pay the big bucks on more expensive models, this one is all you need.</li>
            <li> I have shaved all my life.  I had never heard of epilators (what cave do i live in right?!) until my sister talked to me about it being in a magazine.  Talk about best invention ever created! I have to shave every other day in order to feel smooth.  I hate stubble, and the prickly feeling you get when you get little goosebumbs. With this thing, the smoothness lasted! The first times you use it, I have to admit it seems like a rip off. It seems like it misses hairs and the next morning you wake up with stubble. I epilated two days in a row to make sure that I had gotten every hair.  Then I realized because when you shave you are cutting adult hairs from the skin up, it is impossible that they all grow at the same rate.  After that second day, I did not epilate for a week.  Still felt smooth.  After about 8 days I had to epilate again.  It is recommended that the first couple of months you epilate once a week.  This will help your hairs grow much finer.  Once your body is used to it, you will notice you don&#x27;t have to do it that often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for pain, it feels like a bug bite, nothing more.  It does not hurt.  I did both underarms and legs.  Legs took me a little longer the first time because I was nervous and extra careful.  The second time it only took me 15 minutes for both legs. Underarms, max of a minute for both!lol I did not try bikini line yet, but judging from other comments on epilators, I may just hold off on it for a while longer. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to get rid of hair, and having smooth legs for lasting time!</li>
            <li> Worked well, once I figured out what angle was most effective.  Used it on chin and neck, so it maneuvers well in angled places (did not pinch the skin like I feared it would).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned an epilator before, but this one is a whole different story. Super fast, painless, and my skin is the smoothest it&#x27;s ever been. It definitely hurt under the arms, but was great for everything else. And the light, oh the light! Why did no one think of this before? Didn&#x27;t miss one single hair. The trimmer is also very efficient and allows this epilator to be a 2 in 1.&lt;br /&gt;100% worth the price. Pulling hairs out of your body isn&#x27;t where you want to go cheap (stay away from painful epilators that will pinch you, make you bleed, and give you infected ingrown hairs -- yuck)</li>
            <li> It hurts but the result makes it all worth it. Simply love it</li>
            <li> Several reviews complained about the cord coming off so I almost didn&#x27;t buy this model. Mine arrived today and the cord was the first thing I checked. It took a hard push to get it on and now it does not want to come off.  I&#x27;m leaving it there. Maybe the others didn&#x27;t push the cord on hard enough?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the 4th one of these I&#x27;ve bought, all Braun. Each lasted for years of intermittent use. (In the winter I wear jeans so why keep my legs perfect all the time?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit is a real improvement over previous ones. The swivel head is great!  Also the light works--I&#x27;m seeing the missed hair better.  Plus the cord is longer.  Overall, much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that is not as good is that older models came with a nice zipper case. This comes with a cheap, drawstring bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having used these for years, I can pass along a few tips. The first time is the worst. Once you&#x27;ve got the hair out, it doesn&#x27;t all grow back at the same rate so touch ups are easier.  Aspirin helps, and be careful what time of the month you do it--if your body is tender already, wait a few days. If the hair gets too long, use the shaver and then buzz the stubble.</li>
            <li> Great product. Only has 2 speeds, but works perfectly. Hurts as it should. IT WORKS GIRLS!</li>
            <li> works not perfectly, needs multiple epilations of one zone</li>
            <li> I had a good run with this one.   I used it about once a month and I always took care of it. Cleaned and brushed it after every &amp;#34;session&amp;#34; with it.  However, just recently it just stopped working. I was very confused. I did not know if it happened because I had hair stuck in the motor and that terminated its success? I looked inside and everything seemed to be working.   I have never had a problem with this machine before these past couple of weeks. I am so disappointed and I really wish it could have lasted longer (it lasted about a year)  I hope someone might know something about this and can help me out!</li>
            <li> It works very well. I was skeptical when I first purchased it, I was going back and forth between the Braun, Epilady and Phillips brands. After careful comparison, the Braun seemed like the best choice for the price, based on the reviews and it&#x27;s features. Every hair comes out as promised. My underarms and bikini area look as if they were waxed. Of course, the process of epilating is an uncomfortable feeling and will especially be for someone whose never epilated (Yet, it would be silly for anyone to expect to buy an epilator and have no type of painful sensation knowing it is basically a motorized tweezing device). I don&#x27;t remember when tweezing ever felt good... But it&#x27;s no more painful then threading or waxing. Nonetheless, pain perception differs in every individual. Also, it comes with a shaver which works great too for any person that can&#x27;t handle epilating so you win either way. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I had the same model before, accidentally dropped it and it stopped working. Bought the same model again. It is nice and efficient, but I am not sure if it has better in performance than my previous one. sometimes it chews my skin, mostly at knees and elbows.</li>
            <li> satisfactory delivery</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my wife... As she told ..The process is painful but.... End result is wonderful and smooth.... She loved it..</li>
            <li> Not good for me. It breaks hair and requires multiple passes to clear.</li>
            <li> Our first epilator has a small head surface area. This has a huge surface contact that you need less strokes to cover an area. It also came with a bunch of accessories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For first time users, if you are not used to pulling your hairs with a pair of tweezers, the process involves some amount of pain. If you already pulling your hairs on your legs or arms, then you know the drill, and this little machine will have it done in no time. The good news is, pain will subsides significantly after repeated uses. New growths will be thinner and much easier to pull. Still, using an epilator for the first times requires some learning curve. You need to get used to how to effectively hold it and tilt to a more comfortable angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- huge surface area for faster hair removal&lt;br /&gt;- foil shaver attachment&lt;br /&gt;- 100-240v will work overseas&lt;br /&gt;- includes cold press to lessen pain prior to hair removal, and lessen swelling after hair removal&lt;br /&gt;- comes with a carrying pouch&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- will only work attached to an AC outlet. Epilator users usually do it in the bathroom. My other epilator works very handy with rechargeable battery and can even work in the showers.&lt;br /&gt;- awkward switch. The rotary switch in the midlle has three settings. The middle is off, the left for regular speed and right for faster speed. Either you are on the regular feed or faster speed, when you try to switch it off, you tend to slide all the way to the other speed setting instead of off.</li>
            <li> It is so good. I totally recommend it. It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have used an epilator for many years on my legs.  Since the Epil 5280 is recommended for those new to epilating, I thought this might be a good option for more sensitive areas.  It worked fine but I&#x27;m not sure it is necessarily any gentler than other epilators.  There are two speed options and a light which does a good job lighting up the area.  The shaver head is a nice extra although I haven&#x27;t used it yet.  My other epilator is cordless and can go into the shower which I have to admit I like better.  This one needs to be plugged in while in use.</li>
            <li> Great leaves my arms really smooth better than a razor but too painful for my legs</li>
            <li> There are two questions that anyone thinking about using this might want to ask. (As a first time epilator, like me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, is it painful?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Realistically, if you are worried about the pain that this product produces, you merely need to look at what the manufacturer wrote. Read it carefully:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Is epilation painful?&lt;br /&gt;Silk épil epilators have been specially developed to minimize any discomfort and irritation.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note carefully that the overwhelming absence of any negative word in there. There isn&#x27;t any \\&quot;No\\&quot;, \\&quot;not\\&quot;, \\&quot;negative\\&quot;, or anything like that. Rather, they coyly announce, \\&quot;We&#x27;ve minimized your discomfort.\\&quot; When your child asks you if an immunization is going to hurt, what is your answer? Do you say, \\&quot;No\\&quot;, or do you say, \\&quot;Not much\\&quot;? Note that here they don&#x27;t say EITHER of those things. They say, \\&quot;It&#x27;s minimal.\\&quot; That&#x27;s a warning sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking that into account, I set this bad boy onto my leg and nearly howled like Teen Wolf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brings us to the Second Question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it efficient?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was possibly where I made my critical choice. Assuming, perhaps naively, that the pain had reached a density and intensity that couldn&#x27;t possibly be increased upon. Therefore, I thought to myself, \\&quot;I might as well turn the power up...it won&#x27;t hurt more than it already has, and it might work faster.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Efficiency mode activated! Wait. Strike that. Pain mode activated! It hurt MORE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note to self. Do not use epilator ever again. Ever. I give it four stars because, with some tolerance for pain and a willingness to invest time, it can be pretty effective. Like using a lighter to remove nose hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes from another user in the household: The less effective, less painful setting is simply not worthwhile. Subsequent uses did inflict less pain. If you are not a cowering, simpering child, the pain isn&#x27;t THAT bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Yes. Yes it is.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Harkius</li>
            <li> Love Love This. I have been epilating for a decade, time to replace my old Braun, bought the Enjoy, which for me did NOT work at all, removed only every 3rd hair. Then saw this Braun with a light, which  is the only thing about my old Braun I did not like. Wish I had bought this first, quick and efficient.  The light makes it so much easier to see where to go next. Epilation hurts, no way around it, but so does waxing and Epilation is much cheaper.</li>
            <li> This eplilator has two pieces.  A trimmer and the epilator. It also comes with a cleaning brush and a gel pack to ice the areas before/after epilation, a case and a plug.&lt;br /&gt;I love how it pulls the coarse hairs from the roots and it&#x27;s GONE! The feeling as you use it on your legs reminds me of getting a tattoo.  It recommends pulling the skin taut during use as well, which does make the pain less.  It seems to hurt at first, but is more of an irritating feeling that you do get used to. My legs have been coarse free hair for a week now.  The only hair growth is new hair that is short and soft.  I used it on my armpits as well.&lt;br /&gt;I love my armpits, there is no trace of hair now and I used to shave them everyday. Now I can just touch up the few hairs that pop up.&lt;br /&gt;I am really very pleased with this item, my legs are smooth and there are NO stubbles. I like this better than waxing because you plug it in and use.&lt;br /&gt;I only gave it 4 starts because the plug keeps falling out during use.</li>
            <li> more pain than expected</li>
            <li> After a few weeks with my first epilator I&#x27;m happy with the purchase and the results. I&#x27;ve used it a few times and the pain ranges from minimal to unnoticeable. The hairs are fewer and my skin smoother. Of course I&#x27;ve been using it in tandem with tend skin to avoid ingrowns. So far I&#x27;m happy with the overall result.</li>
            <li> I am a man who bought this on a whim because I didn&#x27;t like how much leg hair I had. Ladies, consider this either a torture test or completely irrelevant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device itself is fairly straightforward to use: you attach either the epilating head and epilate to your heart&#x27;s content, or attach a shaving head to trim the hair if it&#x27;s too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s talk about results and my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I embarked on my hair removal quest in February: I intended to remove all of my body hair semi-permanently, maintaining the removal with the epilator, or at least significantly decrease the hair&#x27;s density and thickness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began from my ankles, working my way up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discomfort:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always used the epilator on setting 1 just because of the frightening noise it made on setting 2. The longer I would use the epilator anywhere, the less it would hurt (as endorphins kicked in, maybe?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discomfort varied by the are of my body I used the device on and the density of the hair in that area. On my lower legs, for example, I would describe the feeling to be like dragging sandpaper across my leg, whereas on my inner thighs, the feeling was more like being snapped with a rubber band (hard).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, discomfort was never really a problem. Sensitive areas obviously hurt more, less sensitive areas hurt less, and the longer I used it in one period, the less it hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is why I stopped using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I epilated, I was amazed at how smooth my skin was; it was like I had never had a single hair on my body there before. As time passed (about a week for me) I had to start maintaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was very frustrating. Every two or three days I had to spend about half an hour going over spots I had already done in the past before I could make any progress on spots I hadn&#x27;t hit yet. When the hair started coming in after these few days, it also wasn&#x27;t soft and fine like I had expected it to be; it was just as coarse and pointy as if I had shaved it, only it took longer to grow out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The maintained spots also weren&#x27;t as smooth as the freshly epilated patches. You could see in some of the follicles hair that had yet to grow out enough to be pulled, but had grown enough to be seen, so I always had this sort-of-smooth-not-really look to the epilated spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were also some spots, such as my calf, back of knee, and kneecap that seemed to always have some amount of hair and never be completely smooth-feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for long term results, I can say that after five months of not using this device, it&#x27;s like I never used it in the first place. My hair density is absolutely unchanged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my time using this device, I also had pretty consistent problems with in-grown hairs, which I tried to combat with daily loofa-scrubbing of the epilated areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it wasn&#x27;t worth the time investment to use this device. I ended up spending an hour every other day just trying to maintain from my ankles to my thighs and the results weren&#x27;t that great. I plan on getting laser hair removal in the future, which I hope to be a better method of hair removal than this.</li>
            <li> Nice upgraded model from what I used earlier which is the 300 series. the head that keeps chaining according it direction is very useful.</li>
            <li> Heard good things about this product so decided to purchase this. Maybe my expectation was set kind of high but I feel I made a mistake in buying this. I have to make multiple passes to get all the hair off my legs and I am not hairy at all (genetics). In fact, even after multiple passes, some hair are still left. Worst of all, I got ingrown hair on my legs. Did not have them prior to using this.</li>
            <li> It definitely does the job, if you can withstand the pain.  I end up only using it on my knees and lower legs.  My upper legs are too sensitive.  Works well though.  Hair stays away longer than shaving.  Updated, I changed the rating from a 4 to a 2 star.  After using it almost all of the hairs growing back were ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this gadget! It&#x27;s a must on my bathroom and everytime I travel. I looove it!</li>
            <li> This product is quite convenient and quick. Moreover, we can use it to shave hair without using shaving cream since it doesn&#x27;t cause scratches like regular razor. However, it is noisy when it is turned on. Additionally, it does not shave the hair as clean as regular razor does. Therefore, we would have to spend more time for shaving. Most importantly, its price is too expensive. It should have other special features to make up for the price.</li>
            <li> Works amazing! Hurts but I expected that. I wouldn&#x27;t use it certain places because it can make you break out if your skin is sensitive. Other than that great product. I actually don&#x27;t grow hair in certain places now though :)</li>
            <li> It is a perfect product of Braun, if you are net looking for a cordless epilator.</li>
            <li> My wife says she loves it and does really well the job.&lt;br /&gt;She told me something about the rotation being great.</li>
            <li> I love it for my legs and hands very easy and less pain.Just could not use for underarms..as it pains very much...Allin all a very good product worth it the cost :)</li>
            <li> It is a lot faster than my previous one!! I like the fact that it has the light, so you can see better. You can also wash the top part of it very easy, which makes it time saving and more sanitary. I have it a year now and is still working great, hasn&#x27;t slow down. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Bought it two weeks back ... It is just the same what is mentioned and showed in the pictures ... Epilation doesn&#x27;t pain that much as I expected. I recommend it totally !!!</li>
            <li> I replaced a 15 year old braun silk epil that broke with this model.  I wish my old one had broken sooner!  I love this one.  I have had laser hair removal, so a lot of my hair is colorless, and the light helps so much to catch that. With my old one sometimes it would catch my skin and pinch and I don&#x27;t think this one will (so far it hasn&#x27;t, but the design seems to prevent it as well).    Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I had Braun silk-epil for years but then the insides of the head were jammed with hair and the head wouldn&#x27;t open no matter what I tried so I got a new one. I checked amazon.com and saw a Philips that had great reviews and was cheaper. So, I got it. Makes sense? NO. Such a big mistake thinking anything can ever replace Braun! Philips was pathetic. I got this one next and was a happy girl again. Just to give you an idea - a few days back, I picked up Philips by accident to do my business and when I started using it on my legs, it would pull nothing out .... 3 rounds and it picked 10 hair may be. I was sooo disappointed until I realized my mistake of picking up Philips. I got Braun next and wow... it really is awesome. I was done a few mins later. Thank you Braun, I am never breaking up with you ever again.</li>
            <li> Shave really clean and super comfortable once you get used to epIlator</li>
            <li> So happy and very satisfied with product. Very easy to use and to clean.</li>
            <li> arrived quickly and I liked the product. First time to use a Braun and I&#x27;d have to say- the best epilator I have used since I started using them 20 years ago.</li>
            <li> If I had never waxed my legs before I would&#x27;ve found the experience of using the epilator much more painful. Having waxed my legs before I knew what the feeling of having the hair ripped out by the root would feel like, but epilating lacks the soothing factor of the warm wax. It feels like a smarting, pinching sensation but the epilator works and the sensation passes as soon as you pull the epilator away from the skin. It still feels a little warm and uncomfortable but certainly not painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The epilator didn&#x27;t leave my legs completely hair-free, however, I just shaved yesterday so I think either some of the hair was too short or my technique with the epilator needs to be improved. While I was scared at first (it sat in the box under my sink for two weeks before I was brave enough to give it a go) it wasn&#x27;t nearly as bad as I imagined and it wasn&#x27;t nearly as bad as some of the horror stories I read online were. Overall it hurt, some, but it worked quite well. I was able to do both of my legs in less than 30 minutes and the redness dissipated in less than 2 hours. If I was in a hurry I&#x27;d shave but if you have time this is a great hair removal technique. I&#x27;m curious to see how long it takes the hair to grow back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I still have some stubble on my legs I&#x27;m going to wait two days and try it again to see if I can get completely smooth results. Even if I don&#x27;t get completely smooth results if it helps the hair grow back less frequently and finer then I&#x27;ll keep doing this and shaving. Oh, the things we do for beauty...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I didn&#x27;t like was the power cord came unplugged from the device very easily and the device became unplugged several times while I was using it, which wasn&#x27;t a huge deal, but it was a bit annoying once I got on a roll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ETA: I&#x27;ve used the epilator several times over the past week since my leg hair was growing in somewhat unevenly and I have to say the results are much longer lasting than shaving. While epilating didn&#x27;t get my legs completely smooth it worked well enough that shaving my legs went much faster and I didn&#x27;t feel the need to shave my legs every day. I did try using the epilator on my thighs and OMG does that smart! But I think with time it will definitely get easier and it&#x27;s definitely a product that I&#x27;ll continue using well into the future. Only time will tell if I&#x27;ll be brave enough to try it on my underarms.epilating didn&#x27;t get my legs completely smooth it worked well enough that shaving my legs went much faster and I didn&#x27;t feel the need to shave my legs every day.

            <li> Does it work?  Sure.&lt;br /&gt;Is it painful?  Absolutely!&lt;br /&gt;-&lt;br /&gt;Hi.  Yes, I am a guy.  This product is for a girl.  So I had a girl field-test this for me and give me her detailed opinion.  I summed up the results above, but for more info, read on:&lt;br /&gt;Yes, this thing works. But wow was it painful!  The pain was so great, that she was not able to do more than a 3x6\\&quot; square on her leg!  And, she bled!  Ew!&lt;br /&gt;Now, let&#x27;s talk about the whys - the person in question does not regularly wax or tweeze their legs.  And they are older then say, YOU.  For someone starting out, ie: a young girl with fair hair who wants to go this tweeze-hair route, this might be a good product.  For someone who is older, whose hair is thicker, and who doesn&#x27;t wax or tweeze, this product is not a good fit for you.  The pain is great, but if you&#x27;re starting out, it would be something you&#x27;d get used to (there&#x27;s no way around it - it YANKS out the hair!).&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving this 3 stars even though she didn&#x27;t like it.  For a young person, this would be a good fit.  But not for someone who is older who is looking for an alternative to shaving.</li>
            <li> Wow it&#x27;s an amazing epilator with a brilliant design. My skin is sensitive and initially it took few minutes to get used to it, then I dint feel much pain. I felt as if I&#x27;m using it for years now. The cooling pad really helps. It&#x27;s perfect in a way it has shaver, trimmer and efficiency caps. Those are added advantages. The epilator head can rotate to few degrees and this helps to remove hair easily. I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> Happy with my purchase. Works good.</li>
            <li> does not clean all hair at armpit</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with an epilator, so I had no idea what to expect.  Ouch!  I think I will just stick with a razor :)  As far as ease of use, it doesn&#x27;t get any better than this one.  I just plugged it in and went for it.  It is not cordless, but the cord was long enough for me to comfortably use.  I would say that if you are used to the discomfort of waxing and interested in trying epilating, go for this one.  I had to give the product 3 stars, while it worked, it is just not for me.  I wish I could give it 3.5 stars.</li>
            <li> I bought this Braun to replace my old 10+ year Braun. This one is thankfully much improved over my old one. Although my skin has habituated to an epilator, this new model is more efficient. For one thing, it hurts less. The rollers and the light are a bonus over my old model, and the trimmer/shaver is great.  I didn&#x27;t think I would use the trimmer/shaver as I didn&#x27;t on my old Braun, but this one is nice and I do use it to get a smooth bikini trim. I epilate under arms, legs and the general bikini area and have found it to be very maneuverable.  I&#x27;m glad I got the corded model, as I read the reviews on the cordless and the wet/dry models and how they were running out of power. Corded is the only way for me - no hassles in hurrying the job or using it whenever I need to. The cord is also long and will enable you to sit on a towel in sunlight coming from a window to see fine blonde hairs better than the epilator light will allow. I also noticed that a good many of the negative comments are that epilators hurt or that they caused ingrown hairs. True, epilators do take some getting used to, but you can work up to a full tolerance and you&#x27;ll not go back. The Braun website has some great tips for using an epilator. Any irritation I have is gone by the next day if not a few hours later and over the years, I now have less hair that is growing in because of epilating. As for the ingrown hairs, you will definitely get them if you don&#x27;t keep the epilator close to the skin (the roller cap is great for this) to pluck the hair, if you don&#x27;t exfoliate regularly, and don&#x27;t moisturize your skin.  I use a body scrub from Tree Hut that does a great job and smells fantastic! Bottom line, it turned out that this new Braun purchase was a good choice to replace my old model. I can epilate and shave and trim even easier now. My husband loves the results too. Awesome.</li>
            <li> This comes with an epilator and shaver head which is really handy for me since I like to do both. The shaver, though people complained that it wasn&#x27;t that close of a shave, I have to disagree! I used the Panasonic (i forgot what model) that was just a shaver and it never got me as smooth as the Silk Epil! The epilator is good as well but you honestly have to be able to handle pain. It&#x27;s plucking a lot of hairs at once and I&#x27;d say this epilator hurts a little bit more than Emoji&#x27;s. That said, I also hadn&#x27;t epilated in a long time when I used this one so that could have intensified the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth the $50 or so that I spent on this especially since the Emoji epilator alone costs around $60 and that doesn&#x27;t even come with a shaver. This silk epic 5 also came with a cooling pac, a sleeve to put the cooling pac in, a tiny brush to clean your machine, a trimmer clear thing to put on top of the shaver, and of course the cable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is NOT cordless so if you don&#x27;t want a corded machine don&#x27;t go with this. But the cord doesn&#x27;t get in my way at all and I don&#x27;t mind it. It also is NOT water proof or able to use in water so if that&#x27;s a problem too, don&#x27;t get this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is one slightly annoying thing about the shaver head, which is that you have to go over the area multiple times to get all the hairs. My advice to you is to press the shaver DEEPER into you. Don&#x27;t worry about it cutting you, I have never ever been cut when I&#x27;ve practically jammed the shaver head into my leg. Also no need to worry about the epilator ever pinching you. Although if you are going over a meaty section that isn&#x27;t flat like your leg, it COULD pinch you so be warned! (It doesn&#x27;t hurt that bad)</li>
            <li> I was really excited to receive this epilator....now that  I have used it a few times I can honestly say I am a bit let down because it does not get my tiny hairs like it is advertised to do....I really find it disappointing the my legs are not totally smooth after I am done...</li>
            <li> It can remove the hair on my feet easily.</li>
            <li> Worst design of an epilator. The top part snags your skin and hurts like crazy and the top keeps coming off.  Bad design all around.  It&#x27;s great that it has interchangeable heads but the epilalator portion doesn&#x27;t stay and the release button is right where you hold the unit. Won&#x27;t be buying another Braun that&#x27;s for sure!</li>
            <li> For non waxing users like me its a bit painful at first. But it&#x27;s really good! I got little bumps when I first used it but it&#x27;s just swalloing from ripping the hair out. My skin doesn&#x27;t tend to inflammate, so I didnt have any complains. It works excellent, it&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been looking for. Totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> I just bought this at a liquidation store for $29 new. I don&#x27;t use the Epilator attachment, just the regular shaving one. And I have to say, this is the BEST shaver I&#x27;ve ever purchased. It shaves perfectly, and SO fast. Because I don&#x27;t use the Epilator, there is no pain involved. lol. If you want a fast shaver, this is the best one I would say in existence. At least so far it has been for me!</li>
            <li> My girl like this product because she is used to waxing. She tried an epilator in the past but still prefers waxing.&lt;br /&gt;This product was a good surprise to her as she noticed it is very effective in removing the hair. The problem is that is hurts. The epilator is an alternative to waxing if you want a more permanent solution (compared to shaving).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the pros are:&lt;br /&gt;The epilator is effective, easy to use, easy to clean and the cooling glove is very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons are:&lt;br /&gt;She said it hurts a little more than waxing (which may be a matter of personal taste) and you have to use it with power cord plugged to it (unlike my shaver).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She will keep waxing as it still is her method of choice.&lt;br /&gt;But if you want an epilator, then Braun is certainly the brand you want (this model or another) - her words.&lt;br /&gt;So the product is recommended.</li>
            <li> Ooooooouuuuuccch! What in the world was I thinking? This was my first time using and epilator and one very painful experience, one I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m to wildly interested in repeating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;m just a little bit more sensative to this type of hair removal system than other folks or I&#x27;m just a big old baby. Either way, it really hurt. The indicator for me should have been the cooling pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it it work? Oh yeah, it works, but at a cost of some major torture. If you can tolerate the pain and your vain enough to withstand such agony, you are a stronger person than I and I conceed to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it works very well and should you choose an epilator, this would be a good one.</li>
            <li> This is my third epilator over many years.  The one I used the longest was also a Braun Xelle.  I really loved it, but it is getting old and not working quite as well lately, so I figured I should replace it.  I bought this as a replacement and felt that it worked comparably well.  My only frustration is that I can use the efficiency cap but with this I found the cap with the rollers seemed to pick up the hairs better and I could epilate a little faster using that.  Once I figured that out, my epilation went very smoothly.  It pulled the hairs well.  I was wishing the head was a little larger so I could cover more ground with each row, but I did like that the head pivots which my old one did not.  This makes it more fool-proof as you don&#x27;t have to get the angel perfect for it to work, the epilator takes care of that.  I also found this one to be less painful than my old one.  I think the roller head helped to reduce the pain.  In fact, for me I found this to be relatively painless.  So, all in all, I am happy with this product and glad I can stick with Braun epilators.  I have tried others and just like these the best.  They seem to pick up the hairs better and do a more thorough job without breaking hairs.  I do find that epilators work best for me if I shave a couple of times in between epilations.  So, I wind up epilating about once a month, usually get almost two weeks after that and then a few hairs are getting longer so I shave and then shave maybe one more time the week after and then do an epilation the week after that.</li>
            <li> Solid product.  I&#x27;ve owned several epilators in the past, but this one by far is the most effective.  Its not perfect, but if you&#x27;re looking to buy an epilator, this is probably one of the better ones on the market.</li>
            <li> stopped working after less than a year :(</li>
            <li> I should have read the review that said it&#x27;s not cordless. I had the Braun SE7681 for years (http://www.amazon.com/Braun-SE7681-Silk-%C3%A9pil-Epilator-White/dp/B0077PLNNE/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1436110018&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;braun+epilator) I definitely think it&#x27;s worth the extra money. I had to replace it because I got a chain stuck in it (which my fault). I tried this one out, but having to plug it in each time is a hassle! Other than that it&#x27;s alright. Does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> My Emjoi epilator broke after 9 years of use so I decided to try out the Braun Epilator. I liked it at first because it left my skin very smooth but lately I noticed more ingrown hairs than I ever had before. I know ingrown hairs are normal with epilators but the Braun epilator seems to have a negative effect on my hairs because my skin on my legs used to be so much smoother with the Emjoi. I also get a light skin rash when I am in the sun which started around the time I got the Braun epilator but I have no idea if there is a connection.</li>
            <li> Love !!! I hurts like a B for the first few times, but it gets much better and 4he results are great. I dont have tp shave my legs for about 5 days :D</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my mom and she loved it... I love Braun products and they always deliver</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used an older version of Braun slik epil for years and loved it. It recently broke after nearly 7 yrs. I just purchased this one and its great. Smooth finish and the rotating head makes it so easy. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> This model replaced my old epilator and does a superb job.  I have the smoothest legs in the south.  I don&#x27;t find the process painful but understand that can be an individual experience.  Also, I gave up shaving my legs a good twenty years ago; maybe it gets easier as time goes by.</li>
            <li> removes hair. What else can I say. If there was a machine that put hair on bald heads, now there would be a product.</li>
            <li> high price but low experiencing，feel hard pain when use it，</li>
            <li> Works great and is pretty much pain free.  I use it on my legs and I&#x27;ve been very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> My wife had a previous Braun model, for at least 5 years, and she needed at least 4-5 hours to finish the job on both legs. I was getting bored just hearing that numbing buzz. Now I bough her this new product and she is very happy to have reduced the time at half for the whole process. I would have bought her a 7 series model, but this one had a very good price, and cost only half the normal price. So, I went for the sale. We are happy with the product. I gave it 5 stars because it does well what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I would have preferred a cordless model. It&#x27;s not a big deal though.</li>
            <li> Used it for 2 months now.  Everything works well.  I have been using Silk epil for many years but a very old model.  I can&#x27;t tell you how much I love this new one better than my old one.  It works better, faster, and more effective.</li>
            <li> Excellent results of minimal hair re-growth after a few uses. Well worth the price I paid! I have suggested this product to many friends</li>
            <li> Great product, works really great!</li>
            <li> I had a braun epilator before that worked great and I got this one because my old one was gross, but was still working. I have to say that my old one works better than this new one. I have to pass it on the same place several times until it removes all the hair. The only nice thing is that you can take the head off and wash it, but I do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> According the my wife, this device does not work without the cord, very dissapointing! Just got it. She has to stay where it&#x27;s plugged in! Plus, it does not have the small brush that comes with it! The main reason for her buying this was the cordless option. Also, it is very loud.</li>
            <li> We purchased this product because of the normal razor attachment.  Unfortunately, this head stopped working correctly after only a couple of months.  Braun products have become unreliable.</li>
            <li> My name is Wandrwoman and I am a long term epilator. My introduction to this method of hair removal was sometime in the late 1980&#x27;s with the Epilady, a medieval looking device with an exposed curved metal coil. The genius principal of the Epilady was that the metal coil would rotate and vibrate at a high speed and yank out your leg hair like an efficient electrical mower-tweezer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit that the leap of faith it took to use the Epilady for the first time was pretty intense. Just looking at the exposed vibrating and rotating coil was enough to send one running for the hills. But I was younger then and far more trusting. Dragging the Epilady along my bare shin stung more than hurt. All in all the experience was far less painful than childbirth and far less expensive than waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most important point to remember about epilating is that the more you do it, the less you need it. Eventually, you need it very rarely. The hair is pulled out at the root. After each use the hair grows back finer and finer until it hardly grows back at all. At first, most women will use an epilator every few weeks. Then perhaps once a month. Eventually, it will be an occasional thing, more often than every leap year, but only when needed. I absolutely promise that the discomfort lessens with use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Epilators have come a long way baby, since the 1980&#x27;s. The exposed coils have been replaced by a turning cylinder with tiny metal plates that open and close as they pass along the surface of your leg. My next epilator was the Braun Silk-Epil Super Soft which was faster and more accurate and could be used on parts of the body you would never want to place near an exposed rotating and vibrating coil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My brand new Braun Silk-Epil 5 is an enormous improvement over my old Braun. If you are thinking of upgrading, to do so is quite worthwhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Silk-Epil 5 now has 40 tweezer-plates on its rotating head, many more and more closely placed than earlier models. These tweezer-plates can remove fine hairs as short as 0.5mm. The rotating head also now pivots which better follows the contours of your body.  I found the use was faster, more comfortable and fewer hairs were missed. The device now has a comfortable ergonomic shape that fits easily into your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two different caps are supplied to be used with the epilating head. One cap has \\&quot;High Frequency Massaging Rollers\\&quot; that are supposed to \\&quot;stimulate the skin effectively for an extra gentle epilation.\\&quot; I found that this pivoting cap was extremely comfortable to use and that the rollers helped guide the hair towards the tweezer-plates. The other cap is called \\&quot;the efficiency cap\\&quot;.  It has no rollers but it pivots to \\&quot;ensure maximal skin contact\\&quot;. I preferred the cap with the rollers as it was more comfortable and seemed to be more efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A razor head with a trimmer cap is also supplied with the Silk-Epil 5. The recommendation is to use the razor to trim longer hair to a length 2-5mm that is most suitable for epilating.  This electric razor works well, but I would rather use the epilator. I suppose if you try and hate epilating, you at least have the razor to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Silk-Epil 5 has a tiny light on the bottom. I was extremely judgmental about this until I used the device and found that the light did helpfully illuminate the area I was working on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A \\&quot;cooling glove\\&quot; (a gel pack that fits into a plastic sleeve) is supplied. I didn&#x27;t need to use it because I didn&#x27;t have any discomfort or pain. My household can always use an extra gel pack, though, so it is sitting in the freezer waiting for the next ache or bruise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another benefit of the Silk-Epil 5 is that, once you remove the electric cord, it is fully submersible in water for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it can&#x27;t be used in the shower or bath because it is not rechargeable. It must be attached to a power cord to be used. The chart on the Amazon product page outlining the various Braun Silk-Epil models says that the Silk-Epil 5 is rechargeable. This is inaccurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power cord is extremely long (90\\&quot;), there is a small brush for cleaning the heads, and everything fits neatly into a draw string pouch for storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very good, well made product. I highly recommend it.azon product page outlining the various Braun Silk-Epil models says that the Silk-Epil 5 is rechargeable.

            <li> Braun Series 5-5280 Silk Epilator 1 count&lt;br /&gt;  It does a nice job quickly and I would highly recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> Before writing this review, I went and read some of the other reviews as I wondered whether I would be too harsh to say NEVER AGAIN with this product. It appears that for first-time epilator users, this is not the product they should be using/trying - or perhaps they/we should not be using epilators at all. Whereas those who have more experience with this TYPE of product seem to be pretty happy with it. Therefore, take what I&#x27;m about to say with a grain of salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually shave but I&#x27;ve also gotten waxed, so while using this epilator was more painful than shaving in general it wasn&#x27;t more painful than waxing. The problem with using this product vs. waxing is that waxing is one quick rip away of the hair, while I had to go over my legs several times with this epilator and there was still hair left. Between the extra pain and the fact that it just doesn&#x27;t remove the hair the way wax or a razor does, I think I&#x27;ll avoid epilators from now on. HOWEVER, if you are a regular user of epilators I do suggest checking out the positive reviews as they may give a person with epilator experience more/better insight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used an epilator before this one, but I gave it a try once my friend told me about it. This works great. My friends that use epilators are all international.i don&#x27;t know why these aren&#x27;t more mainstream amongst Americans.</li>
            <li> The description on the product says it is cordless which is not true. The 5280 brown epilator I have received cannot be utilized as cordless.</li>
            <li> My Emjoy broke after just over a year of using it. I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m mad about it because I didn&#x27;t like it from the start.&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy with this Braun:&lt;br /&gt;*it does a really good job actually removing the hair with speed and efficiency&lt;br /&gt;*the little light is a great plus (I never realized I missed that feature so much)&lt;br /&gt;*I like that it comes with different heads for trimming and shaving&lt;br /&gt;*2 speeds&lt;br /&gt;*WASHABLE!!! (you have to unplug it of course!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only pet peeve is the button which would best be described as a dial. I personally prefer one of those buttons that you push to speed 1 or 2. That being said, you won&#x27;t be turning it off and on by accident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Worked better than I had expected. For me, this does a better job than the Emjoi I had previously. Gets all the shorter hairs, which is awesome.</li>
            <li> good quality and service</li>
            <li> I have been epilating for about ten years. I have used the epilady, two different models of emjoi, and two models of Braun. Braun wins hands down for the best! It is quicker, more efficient, and has the light to help you see finer hairs. It does hurt when you first start epilating, as you are basically plucking numerous hairs at once, but my skin got used to it quickly. To me it was well worth the 15 dollars more than the Emjoi I purchased a month before!</li>
            <li> I bought this product at Bed Bath and Beyond for around the same price. My mom said that she used to have an epilady,but had recently thrown it out because even though she said it work amazingly and you didn&#x27;t have to pass over the same area multiple times, it was just to painful.We looked at this brand because it had very good reviews and frankly I can&#x27;t see why. Even after multiple passes up, down, and side-to-side most hair was not removed. I understood not all hair would be removed but I could barely see the difference. If I buy another one these I want to at least be worth the ingrown hairs!</li>
            <li> Great piece of engineering, works very efficiently and well thought features like the light to brighten up skin areas, ergonomic handling, simple design, water proof when cleaning. Was using a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; epilator previously, so this one feels painful on first try! Can do without cooling pad though, other than that, the attachments given are useful for different functions.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this and uses it regularly. Braun is one of the best brands out there and I highly recommend buying this.</li>
            <li> This works worse than my five year old one.  I&#x27;m lucky if it catches one hair.  Very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> The epilator works decently on the underarms, but doesn&#x27;t work at all on the legs! Any medium fine hairs don&#x27;t get picked up.</li>
            <li> This is the best epilator I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;twice as fast as my other epilators.&lt;br /&gt;The only down side is I live in Australia and it comes with a US plug, I just needed to get an adaptor.</li>
            <li> I can be hairless every single day of the year. No more waiting around for the hair to grow so I can get waxed. No need for a razor that bruises my skin. This epilator is amazing. Leaves my skin soooo smooth. I don&#x27;t know how it does that. I think the product sold to me has loose heads. While using the epilator the head comes off quite often and my skin gets stuck to it. Ouch! Really painful. But I guess its about the way you hold it. There are too many parts that can be opened up and cleaned in this so you need to be careful while using it. But it is a wonder</li>
            <li> I received this epilator free from Braun to test and review. I love this product and use it frequently. It works better than another more pricier brand. the pivoting head helps get hairs on kneecaps and the light helps you see your progress. would recommend to friends, and would purchase.</li>
            <li> I received aBraun Silk epil 5 epilator to try and overall, I am pretty happy with it.  The packaging was great - easy to set up and get started.  It comes with a gel cooling sleeve, a cleaning brush and a small bag that holds everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used in epilator in nearly 20 years, and I had memories of a very painful process.  With that in mind, I was a bit nervous to get started - I picked a small patch of hair near my ankle and jumped in.  I began, as recommended in the instructions, with the lower setting.  The higher setting is for &amp;#34;experienced&amp;#34; epilators, and I do not fall into that category (at least not yet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The process was much less painful than I recalled, which is great news.  Unfortunately, on the lower setting, it took a lot of back and forth over the same area to really pull all of the hair.  After a week or two more on the lower setting, I hope to be brave enough to go up to the higher setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me personally, is seems to be a good beginner epilator.  As someone who lives in South Florida, having smooth legs, underarms and bikini line is important year round, and I am very excited to have found an alternative to shaving which lasts much longer than a traditional shave.  This will also help cut back on the need for waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking to try out epilating at a reasonable price, this us the epilator for you.</li>
            <li> I could hear her screaming all the way from the living room.... It sounds... intense.... She says it is supposed to hurt the first times....all and all she loved it....guess pain is good. When I researched into it, it pulls out your hairs!!!!! but girls are mysterious so I take her word for it and her words were... I LOVE  IT</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by a co worker during a conversation about removing facial hair. I tried it, and not only did it not work well, but it can grab and scar skin if you are not careful. Also, I dont think it is supposed to be used on womens face. So, I tried it on under arm hair, and it did not do as a good as a job using a womens razor.</li>
            <li> You epilate without any after Redness!smooth and truly Helpfull the guidance light ;-))</li>
            <li> better than expected. excellent quality. couldn&#x27;t be better. would definitely buy again. braun makes great products thanks a lot super</li>
            <li> Ordered Dec 2, 2013. Today is Feb 11, 2014. Worked perfect for the couple of times I actually used it. I would say approximately max 10 times if even. Three days ago I go to use it and it doesn&#x27;t work anymore. So obviously I am thinking hey maybe something isn&#x27;t plugged right. I double check everything. This thing is garbage! save your money.</li>
            <li> To say this product is painless is not True! Haha  I  used  on my legs and it brought tears in some places ... but ... it did remove hair and I have had hairless legs for longer ... second treatment wasnt as bad as first because I knew what I was in for ... I dont know how people can use it for other areas .. .. and do not use it for ur face .....!!!I was stupid and thought no biggie ill get rid of the couple areas I have issues with ... well It peeled off layers of my skin ...face is to sensitive ! Learned the hard way .. but works good on legs ha</li>
            <li> The one I received made one tiny spark after charging it, and that was it.  I know it will be replaced, and I know that I love Braun epilators.  This is my third one.  Once I got used to the feel, I have been using it on my face ever since.  For me, it even gets rid of the super-fine blond fuzz on my face.  My old one still works, but this one is supposed to work on even shorter hairs.</li>
            <li> Everiything was fine. Thans</li>
            <li> Not sure why they use words like &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;comfort&amp;#34; because it&#x27;s everything but that. Over all, this product really does a good job.</li>
            <li> Painful, but very much worth it! Skin is smooth afterwards. Very good product and worth every penny. Will save you time from shaving everyday.</li>
            <li> This is the first epilator that I have ever used and the decision to try it came when I saw it on Amazon&#x27;s cyber Monday deals and was curious as to just what it was. I have to say that it works, but you will need to go over the same places a few times; and for women, DO NOT do it during that time of the month when your nerves are extra sensitive! I can appreciated the cooling pack being included also. For the money that will be saved waxing/ shaving, plus the hope that it will thin hair over time, I say it&#x27;s worth a shot. I do recommend to the men to tread carefully if using this on your face. My husband tried it one morning without telling me. He&#x27;s military so I think he was hoping it would last longer than a shave, which it did, but his face was very red for that day. I think he still wants to try it out long term and will probably be getting something to exfoliate and moisturize. You do need to make sure you&#x27;re moisturizing/efoliating before use or the redness, irritation, and ingrown hairs will be terrible. Overall satisfied for the deal price we paid, but we&#x27;re still learning with it</li>
            <li> This is a good product. Its easy to clean and runs smoothly. I researched a lot before picking one and this was a great one for first time users.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about 10 years that I have been using epilators. I had the Braun Silk-epil in purple (I don&#x27;t really remember the model number) it was working perfectly until I moved to USA and because of the voltage difference it didn&#x27;t work properly, so it was time for me to get a new one. Being a brand loyal person that I am, I was sure that I wanted Silk-epil only. Finally decided on getting this one and received it today. Oh, boy, I love it! It epilates hair faster than the previous one I had. I love the fact that it has a light as well so you can find those hair you sometimes miss.. I am used to the pain and pinching feeling, so basically it&#x27;s painless for me which is not bad at all. The accessories that come with this package are great- Love the concept of the gel pack for cooling and the pivoting head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair regrowth is definitely reduced and they grow back finer and lighter with time.. Will definitely recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> I recently started epilating and I have to say, it&#x27;s well worth it. Yes, there is a little pain in the beginning but I swear, it gets better. I would recommend upgrading to the 7 series that can be used in water if you don&#x27;t have a high pain tolerance. The water really helps relieve the pain and open up the follicles.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like it. It took me several times to go over the same spot to see any results. It would be a nice one to buy for someone using an epilator for the 1st time.</li>
            <li> does the job, it&#x27;s not as painful as I imagine it. Also, is really good for delicate skins that have allergies to creams for epilate.</li>
            <li> PERFECT! My wife loves this so much!</li>
            <li> I actually like it better than the 7 for it can never run out of battery and it works absolutely the same. It&#x27;s light, efficient and quick.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using an epilator and i am pleasantly surprised with the results!  It removed the hair fast with minimum irritation.  There was pain but I eventually got used to it - on a scale of 1 to 10, the pain was around a 4.5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;one draw back:  i used the device to remove medium to fine hairs on my arms - i had to go over each section 2 or 3 times to make sure all the hair is gone. There are a few fine hairs that the device missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall: a good purchase for first timers!</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, and was as described.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my bikini line and underarms waxed for years but the expense has become too much. This epilator cost less than one waxing appointment so I figured it was a reasonable gamble. The gamble paid off! I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to use. Takes a little longer than shaving and it really does remove extremely short hairs. It has been 4 days since I used the Silk Epil and there is no stubble yet. The amount of discomfort is no worse than waxing so it is definitely bearable. Removing longer hairs can be painful so I recommend trimming longer hairs before using the Silk Epil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love my Silk Epil and would buy it again! No more making waxing appointments, driving there , and paying every time. The Silk Epil is a fabulous alternative!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my teenage daughter. She says it works, but it&#x27;s pretty painful on the legs. She switches up with this and razors. Her grow back rate is about a week and a half to two when she uses this.</li>
            <li> Well I was expecting it to be awesome but unfortunately it wasn&#x27;t! The razor pulled my hairs on my legs so it hurt! I&#x27;m so glad I got this razor from bzzagent for free because there is no way I would of paid money for this!</li>
            <li> I have the 7th version of it, and it was terrible. Although you can take it inside the shower, the buttery life is so short and you cannot use it while it is in the plug. Also, it hurts me when I used it. However, this version is amazing and I bought 4 of it to my family and friends as a gift and all of them looooooovvvvveeeeee it</li>
            <li> I had a braun epilator  for 10 years when it dye  i bought the braun se 280 it&#x27;s been great,love it!</li>
            <li> The Braun 5-5280 epilator is so fast that you almost don&#x27;t feel any pain. It comes with an ice pack to be used before the epilator. The ice reduce any pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The epilator also comes with several heads that you can use for different parts of the body. It seems to me that you also cut men hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used on my leg, the leg hair was totally eliminated by its root. And a period after it has grown in a soft touch. It seems to me that, when the hair is taken by the its root, it is reduced some way with time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The depilatory machine comes with a tinny bag to keep all the accessories. In this item i still prefer the nécessaire it used to come with the former Braun epilators (yellow one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun says in the manual that you also can use it in the shower (never tried)..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To conclude, I am very satisfied with the product. It is a good epilator. As there is newer Braun model in the market, it has a good-cost benefit relation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon delivered it very fast as usual.</li>
            <li> I did not want to spend too much on a epilator as I was scared I would hate it or the pain would be unbearable. I purchased this model because it got decent reviews and while a little pricey it was cheaper than most. I didn&#x27;t want to cheap out and get a bag epilator and judge all others by that either. ANYWAY I love this epilator. I will say the first one or two times it does hurt a little bit - if you can get past the first few strokes then it&#x27;s significantly better. Even better have a glass of wine before. I use this on my legs and other have used it on my face (yeah I said it - I turned 30 and time was not kind to me).... it smarts the first few times but if you can suck it up after that the pain is significantly decreased.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift and she said that this item is almost identical to the one she previously owned, and loved.  The new, much appreciated, difference she felt worth mentioning was the light on it.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> It is great leaving skin soft</li>
            <li> Best investment ever! It came with and extra head attachment for shaving as well. So if you can&#x27;t handle the pain of epilating, you can always use the shaver. The shaver works so much better than any other one I&#x27;ve tried before. The epilator is very good as well.</li>
            <li> It works fantastic and I like the Additional accessories. Epilating will hurt when you&#x27;re not used to it. Now I just have to wait and see if it&#x27;ll still work as good as it does a year from now.</li>
            <li> It is ok. Not the best, not the worst</li>
            <li> It works like a wonder. The handles that attach to it really help ease the pain.</li>
            <li> My expectations were met. The light is very helpful. The product is new and well-made. It is a good investment for someone who needs regular waxing.</li>
            <li> Thanx , verygood product&lt;br /&gt;But i thought that no shipping fee because item was more than 35 $.</li>
            <li> Very expensive, for me doesnt work i will return it .</li>
            <li> I had purchased this epilator to replace my Braun epilator 5270. I bought the other one for about the same price as this one $55, and it started slowing down after about 5 years of use, though it was mostly because it got caught on a thread that ended up tangling it up. Either way, ~$10/year vs however much you&#x27;d spend on razors and shaving cream, I say it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I was essentially looking for something to replace my old one for around the same price point, and I was happy with what I found here. The light, shaving/trimmer head, efficiency cap and the brush were included with my old one too, but this one also comes with the cooling mitt that I honestly find is pretty useless. You have to keep it in a refrigerator, and although I haven&#x27;t used it, since I&#x27;m used to epilating, I haven&#x27;t found a need to \\&quot;soothe the skin\\&quot; before or after. The only difference I don&#x27;t like on this model is the dial to turn it on the 2 speeds. On my old one, it is a switch that just goes from off to medium to fast. The dial is a little awkward to turn on with one hand. I really like the swivel head upgrade from my old one. It really helps to contour to my skin better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the performance, I feel like this epilator is able to get finer hairs than my older model. It leaves my skin feeling very smooth, and works a little bit faster. I also don&#x27;t really see a lot of hair grow back until about 1.5 weeks. The hair that does grow back is a lot finer as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All and all, I am pleased with this replacement and have high hopes for this epilator since the previous model lasted 5 years (and probably would have lasted longer if I didn&#x27;t snag it)</li>
            <li> -Epilates faster than any I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;-Pivoting heads makes hard to do spots like knee area easy and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;-Does not irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;-Great grooming/shaving attachments.&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;- Comfortable to hold, and the headlight is great bonus function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY EPILATORS HISTORY:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using epilators for about 20 years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first was Epilady Coil Epilator in the 90s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When that broke, I had a Braun I bought at Macy&#x27;s in the late 90s, which lasted for about 10 years, and worked better than the Coil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the time that broke, I had discovered Amazon shopping, and after reading many reviews, I bought a Panasonic ES2067W Ultra Epilator, figured I&#x27;d give a wet/dry cordless one a try.&lt;br /&gt;Which backfired, as when the power died, I had to recharge for a while before I could finish epilating.  In addition, wet epilating seemed to work slower than dry. It always left red itchy bumps that lasted for about an hr, which I thought maybe I just became more sensitive in age.&lt;br /&gt;Then it completely died in about 6 months, which made me pretty upset, as it was not cheap at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave up on epilators for few years, and finally back to shopping for one this year.&lt;br /&gt;After reading many great reviews, I gave Emjoi eMagine Rechargeable a shot.&lt;br /&gt;I liked that it is used corded &amp; cordless, and hoped the dual opposed heads would get the job done faster.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately 10 passes left more than half the hair undisturbed on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;As it&#x27;s too expensive for something that doesn&#x27;t deliver it&#x27;s promise, I sent it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured I was the happiest with Braun before, and chose this one to avoid recharging time, and didn&#x27;t care for Wet/ Dry option.  I was reluctant to buy this one before i tried the Emjoi, because of the reviews about its loosening power cord, but found that it is not a problem if you &amp;#34; click&amp;#34; it in, no brainer.&lt;br /&gt;This Epilator does not leave any itchy bumps at all after use. I think that itchy bumps were  just the Panasonic one, as it tweezed in multi directions.&lt;br /&gt;Hands down, this Braun silk epil is the best I have ever tried and owned, as I summarized above.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had bought it earlier!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps there is something to be said about German engineering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I am an Asian female with fine hair on my arms and thighs, coarse hair on legs under knees.</li>
            <li> very good and safe. easy to attached. very comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;instructions were handy.&lt;br /&gt;product was good and free of defects.</li>
            <li> This is the best $50 I have spent recently.  I have been waxing my arms and legs for about 15 years. Now that I have kids, it is nearly impossible to find the time to go and it is expensive.  So I decided to buy an epilator.  I read lots of reviews and debated between wet/dry and corded/cordless.  Cost was another factor.  Many of the newer models of many brands are expensive and since I was trying this for the first time, I didn&#x27;t want to invest too much money.  This model had good reviews and the price was reasonable.  And though it is an older model from Braun, it has served my need.&lt;br /&gt;And I have to say I love it.  The cord is long enough, the light is extremely useful to identify small hairs that were missed,  no doubt it is painful but if you are used to waxing, then this is not so bad.  And if you use it regularly where you only have a few hairs at a time, you won&#x27;t feel it.&lt;br /&gt;The only con compared to waxing is that you need to exfoliate your skin separately.  Waxing took care of it but now you need to make sure you do it.</li>
            <li> Works well and does what I need.  Faxing, copying. Printing, have not had it long enough to tell anything final.</li>
            <li> It is good and easy to use. Quite gentle, better than I imagined, hardly use the cooling pad. However, the downside is this shaver is wired, so u must be near to a elec point. Good product overall~</li>
            <li> Thank you so much ,, shipping amazing and the item amazing 😍</li>
            <li> On time and great conditions!!! Very satisfied!!! Highly recommended!!! Everything was alright, good timing and good conditions... I strongly recommend this distributor :)!</li>
            <li> My wife liked it and she recommended also.</li>
            <li> Dangerous epilator. Sucks in the skin. Thinking about suing Braun. It works when is done very lightly. But the pain and scare of being sucked in by metal parts is very bad.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;It is not rechargeable but that doesn&#x27;t bother me. Make sure the cable &amp;#34;clicks&amp;#34; into the machine. If it does not click it will still work but it will keep disconnecting all the time.&lt;br /&gt;I have been epilating since I was 14 so I don&#x27;t feel any kind of pain. If you shave constantly your hair is thick so it could be a bit uncomfortable at the beginning but as you keep using this machine your hair will get thinner (and it wont regrow as fast as when shaving which is the best part of this).&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product. Its totally worth it. Plus you won&#x27;t have to buy those expensive razor cartridges again!</li>
            <li> best epilator I ever had.</li>
            <li> this is a pretty nice product like any Braun product.. i must say if you use the epilator it hurts depending on area for arm hairs is fine but legs, underarm is torture lol but regardless is something nice to have at home as it comes with extra heads to change functionality</li>
            <li> great product - both function-wise and price-wise</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and found that the first couple of times I used this product it broke more hair than it pulled.  After repeated uses though I have less breakage and regrowth takes at least two weeks before it becomes noticeable.  Using this on my arms and legs is bearable and gets easier each time.  However, my armpit hair removal attempt was quite painful.  I&#x27;ll have to psych myself up to try it again.  I love the buzzer/shave attachments for grooming as well.</li>
            <li> Pulling hair out hurts. I shaved my legs on Sunday &amp; used my new epilator on Tuesday night. I spent about 20 minutes, granted, I am 40 now, so my leg hair is sparser than when I was younger (and I now - of course I have lip hair - ahhhh, to be a woman!). My plan is to try it every other day until the hair begins to thin out, and see from there. I can see how the underarm may be difficult to tolerate, as well as the bikini area.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot use wax (allergies), and I am TIRED of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I remember my first experience with my epi lady coil depilatory in the late 1980&#x27;s and... Well, let&#x27;s just say the difference is NIGHT &amp; DAY. For starters, my legs were not bright pink with each pass!!  Sure. I have some red dots. No biggie. I also didn&#x27;t use the cooling pad, which may have, likely, diminished the red spots.&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer suggested Advil 30 minutes in advance, and that sounds like a great idea, but was not necessary for me.&lt;br /&gt;My legs are not completely smooth after my first use, because much of the hair is still too short from just shaving 2 days ago, which is why my plan is to depilitate every day or 2.. Less hair to pull out each time.  Don&#x27;t forget that even your own hair grows at different rates!</li>
            <li> Awesome!! This is my very first epilator and it is a breeze to use. I was very nervous the first time but now it&#x27;s easy to use and don&#x27;t hurt. I use it mostly on my leg but have also used it on my underarms. Very minimal pain (like small pricks to the skin) and I have only used it a handful number of times. I will definitely stick to epilating and will not go back to shaving! I wish it was cordless but it&#x27;s not too much of a hassle, the cord just gets in the say sometimes.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I highly recommend using the enclosed cold pack the first time you use it. The cold pack helps numb the area because, let&#x27;s face it, ripping out several hairs by the root is not comfortable. However, after the first time, I find I only need to use it every 2 weeks or so and it does the job very well.</li>
            <li> Wife liked it she it&#x27;s slow but done a great job</li>
            <li> It never charged.  I always had to use it with the cord attached.  I loved to trimmer attachments.</li>
            <li> I love this! Pulls hair quickly leaving bare skin. I&#x27;m able to go a week without touch ups. The shaver works well at trimming hair to optimal length.</li>
            <li> Really happy with this product amazing !!!!!!</li>
            <li> As the title says, this is the most painful epilator I have ever tried and I have tried other before. It is going to stay in the box forever. I regret having bought it.</li>
            <li> I used the Braun Silk 5 Epilator in an attempt to have constantly smooth legs. I was a little nervous to use this product simply because of the pain I thought would come with it. But Braun thought of that! They include a cooling glove that is used right before you epilate and it makes the process much more enjoyable! I didn&#x27;t have to grow my leg hair out long at all for the epilator to catch it and get rid of it. I recommend following the instructions stating to use the product at night to let the redness go away while you sleep. The product was easy to use, easy to clean and something I would want to use again!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product for people that can handle a little discomfort for a longer term results!</li>
            <li> First time user here. This was easy to use once I got over the horror of the sound. Hhahaha.&lt;br /&gt;It works as you would expect, the light is really helpful. I do not have any issues with it damaging my skin or anything. Just follow the directions are you should be golden.</li>
            <li> I personally loved it.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome tool to help rid yourself of hair.  Its painful process but worth it if you but the effort in.  If you do plan on purchasing this, buying another gel pack would be a great idea.  The cold really helps take the pain away as the hair is removed.</li>
            <li> I had one Brown epilator at my dads house almost for 10 years, when I moved on and let it is at home. I was lookin for any where to get one, I bought one on Sally but I returned because I dont liked, a friend told me that she bought yours on amazon, inmediatly I order one for me and I really happy is everything that I want!!</li>
            <li> It doesnt remove hair in the first run, you have to go over the same place twice or sometimes thrice. But i guess it depends on the type of hair you have. Also its easy to clean. One thing that disappointed me was, i get lot of ingrown hair after using this. It doesnt give the same finish as waxing would. Its not very smooth.</li>
            <li> Nice epiletor , small, easy to handle, bu it which it was cordless</li>
            <li> Amazing product! It worked better than expected! Highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement after an earlier épilator started giving trouble within months. Five star for Amazon customer service, otherwise I would have been stuck with a dud piece.&lt;br /&gt;It works like a charm, I would say average hair growth. Works very well for fine hair and almost painless.&lt;br /&gt;Although I am not brave enough to use it for underarms or thighs, I use veet cold wax strips for that.&lt;br /&gt;And I have used it in the 220 V world with an plug (not voltage) adapter. A small package to carry around when I travel.</li>
            <li> This is a good product however not as good as my previous one</li>
            <li> My wife tell me it can clean the hair，but it is enough noisy。</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product, yes it might pinch a little,&lt;br /&gt;but after a while you get used to it. To be honest, the pain is not as bad as people say it is,&lt;br /&gt; I think it&#x27;s a great invention for removing arm, leg, and armpit hair.&lt;br /&gt; My hair doesn&#x27;t grow back for WEEKS. I HIGHLY recommend this product,&lt;br /&gt;it is definitely worth the money. The packaging is nice as well :)</li>
            <li> I had an old one of these- many models ago, a yellow one and it finally died. I compared several versions of this online at Amazon and settled on this model because the price was good and I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever use it in the water.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it for the first time last night and it&#x27;s amazing. The light is a fantastic addition and the pivoting head is so much better than my old one. At first I thought the width of the head was much smaller but in fact, it&#x27;s not. The old one had three rows of tweezer lines and the tweezers on this version are spread out more rather in the three solid lines across.&lt;br /&gt;I used it on my lower legs, knees (front and back) and inner thighs and thought the pivoting head worked well.&lt;br /&gt;It will be a week or two before I can tell if there&#x27;s any more breakage (rather than removal from the root) than with my old unit but so far I love this thing. I&#x27;ve been waxing and using this sort of product for 20 years and have high expectations/standards when it comes to hair removal products.</li>
            <li> My first epilator was an Epilady that I was so impressed with the results, that I purchased a Braun because it seemed as though it would have been an upgrade. But boy was I wrong! This epilator (for me) causes the Hugest, Most Painful ingrown hairs of which is something that I have Never had in my life until purchasing this product. The pain from the bumps is almost unbearable and are big enough to where I should consider them more as an abscess. The construction of this Braun is definitely more durable than the Epilady but in the end... I&#x27;d rather go through 20 Epilady&#x27;s in a month than to ever make a purchase of this product again. If I&#x27;ve never hated anything in my life, I most certainly do now! And there is no way in HeLL that I would recommend this to Anyone! Not even my worst enemy.</li>
            <li> I use Brown Silk epil since 17 years. I lost my old one and I had to replace it. Works perfect. Give them 4 stars because they don&#x27;t include a bag to storage the device and the parts.</li>
            <li> My wife loved this one. She was using some old philips epilator for years. Once she hands to this one, saved her 1 hour job to 10 mins.</li>
            <li> Does the job. If ur a first time user, dont be foold by the icepack and what ever it promisrs- no pain no gain.</li>
            <li> One thing I agree with the other reviewer&#x27;s here is that it does the job but is quite painful especially if you&#x27;re sensitive. This arise partly because event the lowest speed is FAST and hence there is no way to slowly epilate if you&#x27;re sensitive. I&#x27;ve had older Phillips models which I frankly remember to be less painful but also had slower speeds.</li>
            <li> love braun products. works great and i would recommend this one to anyone looking for a quick and easy hair removal. i usually wax my arms and legs, but this has the same results without the mess!</li>
            <li> Bought for the extra trimming function. I&#x27;m usually too cowardly to sit through the pain of actual epilating but this thing is wonderful. The built in light is hugely helpful.</li>
            <li> I like it, I had the old Braun epilator and like it too, but  this one is completely different and much more better.</li>
            <li> Definitely not for people who don&#x27;t like the feeling of having your leg hair pulled out or have a low pain tolerance. It took me about a week to get half my leg finished. The only reason I pushed through is because I really don&#x27;t like shaving and I know a lot of people who epilate and are a good support system as they say it gets easier with each time. But an already up-side is that the half of my leg that I have finished hasn&#x27;t grown back even a little bit. When I shave, it normally grows back stubbly by the next morning.</li>
            <li> I bought this from my husband&#x27;s amazon account.The product is not suitable for fine hair - it could not pull the hair strands out and ended up breaking almost 50pc of them.&lt;br /&gt;Also i had to keep going over the same area again and again before i could get a clean look - the epilator just couldnt grasp the hair strands - probably because its very fine.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little bit painful</li>
            <li> I despise shaving and I knew the pain of waxing, but it wasn&#x27;t the pain that scared me from buying an epilator. To be honest, it was the cost. I didn&#x27;t want to buy a cheap one for the fear that, well, it would be a bad epilator. But I also didn&#x27;t want to buy an expensive one, just in case it didn&#x27;t live up to its performance. I didn&#x27;t want to waste my money. Luckily, this product seemed a good in-between and it doesn&#x27;t disappoint. I know people who&#x27;ve had their Brauns for three or four years and they&#x27;re still going strong, so if mine lasts as much I&#x27;ll be a happy woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, the light and the trimming head are useful, but if we&#x27;re honest I think the most worthwhile is the pivoting head feature. It&#x27;s so easy to handle the epilator because of this. Some parts like the inside of the knee are still tricky because it&#x27;s not a miracle worker, but it&#x27;s what sold me on this. The cord is very long and it can be a bit of a bother sometimes, but you learn to work with it and I prefer it to having to recharge batteries. It barely misses hairs, unless you&#x27;re going quickly over the area. If it does, usually going over it from another direction does the work. Some people say it can cut the hair, but I&#x27;ve looked at the hairs while cleaning (to make sure it was worth the pain, you know) and all the hairs I saw had their heads and such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just keep in mind that, while you&#x27;re doing it less frequently than shaving, this takes more time than shaving. The first time I epilated, I&#x27;d waited about three weeks for my hair to grow. Because it grows back at different rates and, efficiency, you know? Well, I used the trimming head first and, in the end, spent over two hours. From ankles to upper thigh, front and back. My legs were red for two days. A week later I saw some sporadic growth and epilated again, which took less than thirty minutes. Yesterday night, two weeks later from initial epilation, I had more growth all around. Not enough to be noticeable to other people, but enough for me. Again, it took me less than thirty minutes. The redness was a lot less in these occasions and was gone by the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four weeks of smooth skin is an overstatement. It could be true if you&#x27;ve spent years using epilators, I guess, but certainly not at the beginning. Expect something from 7-15 days, although it does depend for your climate. (Tropical summer for me, so hair grows faster.) This doesn&#x27;t leave the skin completely smooth either, so I&#x27;d recommend exfoliating and moisturizing the day after, which you&#x27;ll want to do once in a while to avoid a few ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I am IN LOVE with this product. I have REALLY fine Asian hair so my review might be different from others who have thicker hair, but if you have really thin hair, I hope this will help you because I could not find any reviews from people with fine hair for multiple products...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO PAIN AT ALL:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s my very first time epilating so I was really worried about the pain that nearly every review has talked about. However, when I used this epilator, I used it on my legs, arms, underarms, and bikini line, and I did not feel ANY pain at all! At first I used the massage head because I was worried about the pain, but I did not feel any pain so I changed to the efficiency cap, and I still did not feel ANY pain. I held up my arm while epilating my armpit, so I did not get pinched at all. My underarms did get a little red, but after like 3 minutes, the redness was gone and my underarms looked great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO INGROWN HAIRS:&lt;br /&gt;I exfoliated right after I epilated so I have no ingrown hairs ~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SILKY SMOOTH SKIN:&lt;br /&gt;Although I have very fine hair that you can&#x27;t really see, if you touch my leg you can definitely feel hair and my legs were not smooth. After using this epilator, my legs were SILKY SMOOTH. I was so shocked! I put my foot on my thigh so that I could see my legs better and when I did that my foot literally slide off my leg because of how silky smooth my leg was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DURATION:&lt;br /&gt;My body was silky smooth for 3 days straight, and then on the 4th day, I could kind of feel a difference. It was still really smooth, but not perfectly SILKY smooth like it had been the first 3 days. However, when I tried to look for hairs on my legs, I could only find like less than 10 hairs in total slightly growing. On the 5th day, overall hairs have started to regrow a little and I can see the tiny hairs if I look at my arms and legs from 2 inches away. I think I might epilate on the 6th or 7th day because today (5th day), the regrown hairs are very sparse and are about a millimeter or shorter.</li>
            <li> It have used Braun products in the past. This one is really bad. It pulls hair and also cut the skin.</li>
            <li> I read reviews on all the different models of this item for weeks before making a final decision.  It seems to have the features I wanted from the 2 most expensive versions, except for them being cordless.  Based on reviews saying this one will last longer because it is not cordless I chose this one.  I also was interested in the part where it says it will get the finest of hairs.  I have worn out a couple of these of a different brand and so far I can say this one does work better.  It has missed a few hairs on my legs  but nothing to get upset over.  I have not tried the trimmer or other accessories yet but I imagine they will be fine.  I did not order it for the cooling glove.  I would have preferred the wipes, but for twice the money I did not order the one that comes with those.</li>
            <li> I bought mine at Walmart and took it back after my first use. 1. It takes entirely too long. I had to go over the same area at least 4 times to take out a good amount of hair, and that STILL didn&#x27;t do it. 2. It doesn&#x27;t take out that much hair. Finer hairs are still left behind which left me having to shave anyway. 3. My skin looked a bit bumpy after using it. Two days after even. 4. I got a massive in grown hairsbin my armpit after using this, and I NEVER get ingrown hair in my arm pits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first use of an epilator, so I&#x27;m not sure if it was particular brand that sucked, or if epilators are all around not the way to go for me...but that was my experience.</li>
            <li> Had to replace an old one. Works great. Does the job.</li>
            <li> Unexpensive but great epilator. Really removes all hair, easy to use, easy to clean (I can flush it with water). I use it on my arm and legs and my skin is smooth and no grown in hair . For pain reduction use cooling glove. I don&#x27;t know what else to ask from $50 epilator.</li>
            <li> I bought one for my wife. She said it was painful for the first time but now she got used to it, not the pain though. If you stretch you skin and epilate as per the instructions it will be a far better experience. Its been couple of months so far so good.</li>
            <li> great product... highly recommended... Love the light torch...!</li>
            <li> Awesome product... My previous silk-épil lasted 10yrs. This model is amazing too , a good upgrade.  Thanks Braun! -lili yager</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally new to epilating, so I felt that this was a good product. I did have to go over the same area more than once, but that may have been due to my own resistance at first. If you&#x27;ve never epilated before, IT IS PAINFUL! But it&#x27;s very worth it. It&#x27;s been 6 months since I last used this device (it&#x27;s packed away while we&#x27;re between homes), but my hair is still growing in slower and thinner than it did before. Highly worth it, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It pulls some hair and breaks others.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work properly. but, is no seller guilt.</li>
            <li> I have been using silkepil for the longest time. I have owned the old one for at least 10 years and it was still working quite well but the razor head was not sharp anymore. So I decided that it was time for an upgrade. this new model is just great! You don&#x27;t need anything fancier, I&#x27;d say. The light is a very useful improvement and the tweezers make your job much faster.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m really glad I decided to give myself a present and upgrade my silkepil!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed you can get better products out there.  I wanted to wait until I&#x27;d been using this one for a long time, so I could give an accurate and informative review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, of course it&#x27;s going to hurt, you&#x27;re ripping out your hair with a little electronic gismo.  Second, it is true that once your skin/body \\&quot;adjusts\\&quot; to the process, it hurts less and less each time.  My skin is still red, irritated and slightly swollen afterwards, but it&#x27;s hardly painful at all anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest beef I have with this epilator is that it breaks the hair (yes, I made sure it&#x27;s always the recommended length before epilating) and leaves tiny little arm/leg fuzzies.  It just doesn&#x27;t get it all.  For the money, get a different epilator like an Emjoi or Panasonic.  I recently got a panasonic a couple of weeks ago and it&#x27;s much better at grabbing ALL the little hairs this one left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one has the potential to be good, but it just doesn&#x27;t grab all the hair.  Even after using it in circles, even after going over the same area numerous times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other annoyance with this device is that IT HAS TO BE PLUGGED IN WHILE USING IT.  In this day and age, that seems a little ridiculous.  The unit is big enough that you&#x27;d think it&#x27;d have a battery in it that&#x27;s rechargeable.  NOPE!  You&#x27;ll have to sit relatively close to an outlet while you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between those two aspects of it, you can find better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, a couple of tips when epilating:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your skin is really sensitive like mine and it hurts, A LOT, just do little bits at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you do it right before you go to bed, it&#x27;s much better.  Do as much as you are able to tolerate (when you&#x27;re first starting out - eventually you&#x27;ll be able to use it on your whole body and you won&#x27;t bat an eyelash), apply a soothing moisturizer, and go to sleep.  Your skin will swell, will feel hot and irritated, but it will be gone when you wake up!  :o)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck epilating - sure is a heck of a lot cheaper than waxing and buying razors and shaving cream all the time!</li>
            <li> This epilator eliminates most of the leg hair in one swipe. I used the provided cooling pad with my first use and felt no pain.I am 61 years old so I don&#x27;t have as much leg hair as a younger person. It may take a few epliations for someone with more hair to adjust to any tweezing pain.  Its fast and efficient and I like the fact that I don&#x27;t have to lather up with shaving cream. The light allows me to catch the missed hairs. It is easy to clean and the pouch stows all parts together in one place.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  The product is almost painless to me.  It was expensive but it works.  When I use the product, the results lasts for longer than I ever expected.</li>
            <li> I initially gave this product 5 stars, however, after using it for about 6 weeks I am far less pleased with my outcome. I&#x27;ve experience far more razor bumps and ingrown hair from this epilator than I ever have with shaving or waxing. In addition, after the first couple of uses, the device did not work as well in terms of grasping the hair. With the first two uses, it did indeed work on short razor stuble. All subsequent treatments have proven disappointing and I&#x27;ve had to return to shaving because the device left behind so much hair no matter how many times I went over the same area. I am giving it 3 stars only because it does do a fairly good job on my fine, menopausal facial hair. The coarse hair on my legs...I&#x27;ve given up. It&#x27;s ineffective and I regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> I used the have the older model but I must say this is a huge improvement. Doesn&#x27;t hurt a lot and the extra light on it is a big help.</li>
            <li> It had been several years since I had last used an epilator.  I remembered them as loud and painful so I had a bit of apprehension going in.  So, I got my glass of favorite Pinot Grigio and got to work.  It doesn&#x27;t say this in the manual but the first thing I did was to soak my legs in warm water and thoroughly dry them.  I figured that since shaving dry scaly legs is not good then epilatoring (is that a word?) dry scaly ones would be worse.  I don&#x27;t think this one is cordless because the manual said nothing about charging it beforehand.  The power cord detaches just for washing it under water I believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I plugged it in and was surprised that it wasn&#x27;t crazy loud like the one I had years ago.  I started on my lower leg on the less fleshy part first.  Ah yes, the pain was coming back to me now.  One more gulp of the Pinot Grigio however and it was like when you gave birth and forgot the pain as soon as you saw your precious little baby.  I did both my legs in 10 minutes the first time (the few times after it took less time because I was comfortable with the machine by then.  I also now use it with the efficiency cap (which is just a little plastic cap that covers the massage rollers) because it really does seem to be more efficient that way.  However, if you are very sensitive and/or you are out of Pinot Grigio then by all means keep the massage action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely use the cooling pad afterwards as well as a nice gel.  I use an aloe vera gel that is for sunburn soothing. I keep the gel in my fridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My leg hair doesn&#x27;t grow all that fast and I keep to a schedule using it so I have not yet had to trim the leg hair first with the Shaver/Trimmer head.  I did however pop the epi head off and attach Shaver head to make sure it did work fine.  It looks like a quality personal trimmer although you don&#x27;t want to go dropping it on your ceramic tile like I did because two of the little plastic comb teeth busted off.  :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to clean.  You just detach the power cord, pop off the cap and brush it with the little included brush.  You&#x27;re supposed to dip the brush in alcohol each time (the rubbing kind, not the Pinot Grigio) but I don&#x27;t always because I am the only one using it so I don&#x27;t get all freaky about it.  You can wash it under running water as well but I haven&#x27;t had to.  I guess if you were trimming fairly long hair (bikini area) then you would need to use the running water.  The chart above indicates that it isn&#x27;t washable that way but that chart above ALSO indicates the 5280 is cordless operated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all I like this Epilator. I am only giving it 3 stars however due to the fragility of the parts and also I wish it was the wet/dry.  You can get the Wet/Dry model 7181 for about $20 more than the cost of the 5280.  I know a lot of women who like that one cause they Epi in the bubble bath...with candles and wine.  Very romantic.easy to clean.

            <li> I used it and its really good....price is also economical....i think, its good to get it.......Easy to clean but little bit noisy :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything &amp; all left me damaged. But this is the best personal care item I&#x27;ve purchased in a very long time. Wish I&#x27;d just purchased it a long time ago. As far as pain, waxes are 10x worse than this. Waxes always left stubble behind that had to be waxed again &amp; again &amp; again which gets more painful with each try.&lt;br /&gt; So, if you want put an end to the hair question....the anxiety that goes with knowing its time again, then just get this item. It&#x27;s no more painful than using a semi-dull razor blade &amp; about as quick. No messes to clean up, no waxes left behind to remove &amp; no more scalded feeling afterwards. It leaves you as soft as a Kitty.&lt;br /&gt; If you don&#x27;t choose this one, just get one. You&#x27;ll be so very glad you did. I researched them &amp; this was #1 rated by users across the nation. It works just great on mans thick hair...no problems there. Just one final note.....Hide it from the wife or you&#x27;ll find it in her plunder the next time you need it.....and it&#x27;ll be just packed full of fuzz!!!  HA!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using an epilator and decided to give this one a try. I&#x27;m really glad I did. It&#x27;s an amazing device that really gets the hair out. I used this on my legs and underarms. Now my underarms feel really smooth, but my legs are a little stubbly. It does tend to leave some hair cut rather than pulled out, which i disliked. But i will keep using it as it rips 70% of the hair out. I had to go back and use tweezers in some places. The epilator itself is really nice, the light helps alot. The two speed settings are great and i love all the stuff it came with. Really recommend this one :)</li>
            <li> My sister told me about this product.  I have never used one before.  So great not to have to shave all the time.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I did very Extensive Research before I bought this product. I read every single review on this website and other websites on the epilation Process and this product and other products before i bought this product. That should by it self say something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate everyone&#x27;s reviews as it had made me more educated on the process and the product so keep it going!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick fast growing hair. I tried this out first on my legs. And yes it does take a while to do it so its not a 10 minute thing like shaving. Plan 3 hours for the first time from the exfoliation to gettting done with both legs. The pain is not that bad once you get the first 5 minutes of it done and taking breaks. You get used to the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I exfoliated before i used it, I waited about 30-45 minutes after exfoliating and then epilated. Yes at first its painful. But its also ADDICTIVE after you see the results. Please make sure you pull your skin apart as you move to get maximum results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin was clean of hair! Not like shaving where you start getting growth the next day. I would say it took about 6 days for me. THe best part was that the new hair that grew were lighter and thinner than previously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside of this was that i got A LOT of ingown hairs and especially at the back of my legs. I dont know if it has to do with the direction in which my hair growns or what. For that i had to manually take a sharp object and pull them out and then epilate. IT was also hard to pull the skin on the back of my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this again and the results are the same except for the ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has any solution to this i am glad to listen and try out some new tactics.I will keep updating this as i keep doing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I still like my product. I just need to figure out tactics for the ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying, this is an epilator!  That means, no matter how well designed or what you do to prepare, there may be discomfort during hair removal, and irritation afterward.  Always use an epilator on dry skin.  For best results, wash your skin with water, dry it, and even apply a prep containing alcohol or another astringent. Personally, I prefer Witch Hazel. That said...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun Silk-epil 5280 is a nice product.  It has 40 sets of &amp;#34;tweezers&amp;#34; which remove hair as you run it over your skin.  The product is designed for removal of leg hair, but can also be used in other areas to remove short hair.  It uses a massging system so it is about as close to comfortable as an epilator can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product package includes the epilator, a cooling gel pad, a shaver head, trimmer cap, and efficiency cap for trimming different length hair, and a cleaning brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also includes an AC adapter and a travel pouch. You can select from one of two speeds depending on your preference.  The lower speed takes longer but is gentler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 5280 removed leg hair well.  It was a little uncomfortable, but then again it is plucking hair from your pores!  It was no worse than other epilators, and more comfortable than the old Epilady products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is a breeze.  You can rinse it under tap water (unplug the AC adapter FIRST), or with the included brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely cool the included gel pad before you use the 5280, and use the pad afterward to sooth your skin and minimize an irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the product performs well.  It removes hair effectively and leaves your skin smooth.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd epilator.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using epilators for many years now.&lt;br /&gt;People complain about pain, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s painful after using it couple times.&lt;br /&gt;Skin is much softer/longer than shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Less and less hair growing back.&lt;br /&gt;Always used Braun for quality.  I saw another epilator with like 72 tweezers and just didn&#x27;t trust it.  Looks big so it might be hard to reach places like the knees...&lt;br /&gt;This Braun is very good, not too big and efficient.&lt;br /&gt;Yes it takes a while to get the job done, it&#x27;s not shaving!  Much better than shaving and if you compare to waxing, you save time anyways (and money).&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair so I need to pass couple time to get all off.  Not a problem to me.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this Braun epilator.</li>
            <li> I bought Braun Silk- Epil 5280 Epilator since I had another Braun Epilator before I know they are very good. The other one still works, however it is made for Europe since I use to live in Europe. I love this product. It has the different heads (shaving), depilating. For the parts of my body that are more sensitive I use the shaving head. You have to go over the spot more than once but this is normal. For people whose skin is sensitive there is a glove with gel inside. Read instruction for more.</li>
            <li> An epilator do its job great.Only porble is,that before you use hte epilator, you need to wipe your skin and effect will be great. First will be fainful, but than fain will almost disappear.</li>
            <li> Good epilator. It does a clean job. I was scared she  I used it for the first time. I was afraid it would pinch my skin but it didn&#x27;t do it at all. It hurts a little bit at the beginning when the hair is pulled out. And now I don&#x27; t feel anything. I would recommend to anybody who wants a clean job  in  no time .</li>
            <li> I deeply regret of buying this product.  First o all, the tweezers don&#x27;t remove the hair easily. They pull the hair several times before it actually pull.  The \\&quot; massage\\&quot; rollers don&#x27;t do any massage, in fact, it haver some points things that irritate the skin after some time.  The circle power button doesn&#x27;t make it easy to turn on and off.  When you open the cap you can see that the mechanism that connect the motor to the cap has a slippery shape, and certainly will become inefficient after some use.  After trying to use some times, I had to buy a new one and throw this one out.  Just to compare, I Always uses Satinelle from Phillips (for more than 10 years), and never had this kind of problem. Tried Braun to see how others brands are, but after my experience and waste of money, I&#x27;m back to Satinelle again.</li>
            <li> Performs as advertised!  What a relief not having to shave more often.</li>
            <li> I did not purchase this through Amazon but I am so happy with the purchase that I wanted to write a review. I have only used the epilator head so I cannot comment on the shaver and trimmer, or the cooling mitt. I am very pale with quite dark hair, and a little coarse. I use the product on my legs, arms, underarms, and entire bikini (Brazilian).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s easy to use - just plug into an outlet.&lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s easy to clean - just remove the top, open, and run the head under warm water. It helps to twist the head while running it under warm water.&lt;br /&gt;3. It has two speeds. The slower speed pulls hairs out at a slower speed, meaning that for any given area, it pulls fewer hairs out at a time and is therefore less painful than the higher speed would be. However, with the lower speed you will have to go over the area more times than with the higher speed. I like having the two speeds because it allows you to adjust based upon the sensitivity of the area you are epilating.&lt;br /&gt;4. It has a light, which ended up being much more useful than expected and my favorite part of the product. It helps you see so many hairs that you would otherwise miss. I would definitely get an epilator with a light!&lt;br /&gt;5. It pulls hairs out by the root. I do not see any hairs that were broken off. I have had minimal ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;6. The results are better than shaving and last much longer than shaving. I don&#x27;t have a shadow immediately after shaving and I don&#x27;t get hairy after a day or two. I can get away with epilating once a week, with a quick shave afterwards to get silky smooth.&lt;br /&gt;7. I save money on razors because I can away with buying cheaper ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;1. It is not Wet/Dry.&lt;br /&gt;2. It does not have the option of charging a battery or using batteries for travel use. It must plug into an outlet.&lt;br /&gt;3. It is quite loud. It also sounds like an adult product, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;4. It gets hot after awhile, usually after quite a long while but I did slightly burn myself when I tried using the product on my face and mistook the heat for the pain of epilating. I kept it on my upper lip for quite awhile, hence the burn, but otherwise it shouldn&#x27;t be hot enough to burn you (unless you hold it on one spot for a long time like me!).&lt;br /&gt;5. You don&#x27;t get a baby smooth result. It&#x27;s 99%. I still shave afterwards but I wouldn&#x27;t have to if I didn&#x27;t want to be super silky smooth, and it&#x27;s just a quick shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEUTRAL&lt;br /&gt;1. It takes longer to epilate than it does to shave but I have to epilate only once a week instead of shaving every other day. I am not spending any more time on hair removal now and I might be spending less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, those are the pros and cons for the product itself. As for epilating itself: I was a first time epilator when I purchased this product. The first time I used the product, it was very painful. I do consider myself to have a low pain tolerance. I took Tylenol and used a topical lidocaine cream and I don&#x27;t know if that helped at all. However, in one sitting, I managed to epilate my whole legs, my whole arms, including underarms, and my entire bikini area (Brazilian). I barely managed that last one. BUT, I have kept up with epilating and it has been much, much less painful after the first session. My legs, arms, and underarms are a breeze. The Brazilian still hurts a bit. Someone on Amazon recommended getting a wax first and then using the epilator for maintenance. I would highly, highly agree with her. You CAN do it my way, if you are broke like me, but it will hurt! If I could do it again, I would put a bag of ice in my lap while I epilated my legs and let the whole area numb up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for ingrown hairs: I had a few after my first session. I did some research and changed a few things, and have not had any (or at least very many) ingrown hairs since.&lt;br /&gt;1. Take a shower before you epilate.&lt;br /&gt;2. Get a pair of exfoliating gloves to use in the shower. They&#x27;re cheapand they work really well.&lt;br /&gt;3. Clean the epilator head before and after each use with warm water AND rubbing alcohol. Don&#x27;t forget to leave time for it to dry before using it.&lt;br /&gt;4. Move from clean to dirty areas on your body. Do legs and arms first, and then underarms, and bikini area last.&lt;br /&gt;5. Get a spray bottle and some witch hazel, and spray your body after epilating. If you can&#x27;t shower before epilating, do this before epilating as well.&lt;br /&gt;6. If you are going to do a quick shave after epilating, clean you razor before and after with rubbing alcohol, and spray yourself with witch hazel after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ta-da. It&#x27;s super easy, not too painful after the first go, and you shouldn&#x27;t have any ingrown hairs if you&#x27;re careful (maybe bikini area but otherwise not). I would make this purchase again! And I am very picky.</li>
            <li> It leaves the skin damaged!! Does not clean properly . Here and there hairs are half plugged and edges are seen.</li>
            <li> Let me preface this by saying that my reviewer name is not a misnomer. I used a Vine pick on this epilator thinking that it might come in handy for the removal of chest hairs, which I periodically like to remove. Judging from the other reviews of this, the excruciating pain was not exclusive to gender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing hurts. A lot. The pain was sharp and did not go away through the whole process. I thought of Han Solo being tortured at the end of Empire Strikes Back as a proper comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The three star rating is largely due to the fact that this product is effective. It got a lot of the hairs away, which I was surprised to see. The epilator cannot work without being attached to the cord, which goes against the product description. The pain element could&#x27;ve been enough to take all the stars away, but this product isn&#x27;t terrible if you can handle the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether or not you want to is a different story. I&#x27;m sure there are better epilators out there, one&#x27;s that don&#x27;t make you scream in terror. On the other hand, if you&#x27;re looking for modern day torture devices look no further.</li>
            <li> This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever used. I was prepared for some discomfort, but in return I&#x27;d hoped for smooth skin. The reality is that this epilator just doesn&#x27;t get all the hairs. Even after carefully following all the directions, you&#x27;re left with a lot of stubble. Going over the same spot repeatedly doesn&#x27;t seem to get many more hairs out than you got on the first pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side, it&#x27;s less painful than I expected. The frozen gel pack really helps reduce pain by numbing the skin a bit after using the epilator. There is a lot of redness after epilation, so you definitely want to do your epilating at night and let your skin calm down before you have to be seen in public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I like about this product is the little light that shines right on the area you&#x27;re epilating. It really helps you see what you&#x27;re doing in those awkward spots, and it highlights the hairs you&#x27;re hoping to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t even bother with the \\&quot;extra gentle\\&quot; setting unless you&#x27;re very sensitive to pain. The only way I can get any results at all is by using the efficiency cap and the \\&quot;extra efficient\\&quot; setting. This process takes a lot of work, and there&#x27;s not much payoff. I&#x27;m hoping that over time I&#x27;ll get better at it, and I&#x27;ve heard that the hairs will start to come back more slowly.&lt;br /&gt;Do be sure to use a loofah or other exfoliating procedure regularly once you start epilating. Otherwise you could end up with very painful ingrown hairs if regrowth can&#x27;t get to the surface of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit also comes with a shaver head attachment. I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but it may turn out to be more useful to me than the epilator head. You can also use the shaver attachment to precut hairs that are too long for epilation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contrary to the chart on this page, this unit is NOT cordless. It would sure be nice if it were.</li>
            <li> the design is some how that the cord doesn&#x27;t stick in tightly and falls out frequently during use and that is a pain!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace one of the first Silk Epil&#x27;s out there. It works so much better! Since I&#x27;ve been using it for years, I don&#x27;t notice the pain anymore, but I did notice that my old Epil would miss hairs. This one does not and makes shaving underarms and around knees easier as well. I love my epilator and I think Braun makes the best out there! Can&#x27;t beat not having to shave every day!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used any other epilator, but I like this as much as one can like something that rips out your own hair.</li>
            <li> works very good and soft, I really like it</li>
            <li> my daughter loves it ..</li>
            <li> I used epilators as long as I can remember. My previous one was silk-epil 3 which worked great and I had no problem with it till it died after many years of doing a wonderful job. So I bought this one from amazon about two years ago. I have to say it really pulls most hair out even shortest one. Why I am giving it just two stars then? Because of the crappy design. The cord does not even click in place, I had to keep holding it with my fingers during usage because it slips out from its socket and the machine stops. So I ignored that annoying fact because I had good results. Few months later the cap of the epilator head starts to get out of place during using and squeeze my skin inbetween the cap and the head. I had many painful blue spots because of that. I figured  to take the cap out totally and continue using it because I did not want to throw my money in the garbage. Now the shaver head did the same, it did not squeeze my skin but the cap simply pop out when I turn it on and the process stops.  I could not take the cap out and continue using it, because the shaver head cap has a role in the process unlike the epilator head which could function with out the cap. I dont know if Braun improved those defects in design since I bought mine or not but definitly I am shopping another brand.</li>
            <li> FREAKING HURTS! Great torture device. Make sure your hairs are grease free otherwise you get a bunch of partial yanks which hurts the most. Honestly though its like ripping the bandaid off vs slowly pulling millimeter by millimeter (tweezing). So yeah it works but I find it too painful to sit down for a session. Odly though it does a great job of grabbing and yanking the hairs so I got to give it 4 stars... So if you get this... be brave. Oh yeah the power cord makes you think its got a battery in it. Dont be fooled this thing has to be plugged in to work. A slinky cord would have made a lot more sense</li>
            <li> After two years it gets dull and doesn&#x27;t work as well. It was difficult to find the head for the last model so we just purchased another one, the price difference was only 20 bucks or so.</li>
            <li> It worked just out of package, but failed to turn on after a few days later. I used to regard Braun as a good company to make durable products, but I am very disappointed now. I refunded this item rather than replacement.</li>
            <li> I love this epilator. I previously used an epilator that had dual opposing heads, but this one works much better. It only takes one or two times of getting sensitive skin stuck between the opposing heads to inspire anyone to switch to a single head epilator. This one works great, and is especially good at removing thin, short hairs. The light on the front is my favorite feature of this model. It is so helpful for getting really smooth results. The only downside is that this model is not waterproof and does not run off the cord, but for the price it was a great buy!</li>
            <li> I began epilating last year with an [[ASIN:B003II4D2C Emjoi Divine]]. I chose the Emjoi because I wasn&#x27;t sure if epilating was going to be my cup of tea and didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune to find out it wasn&#x27;t. Over the past several months I&#x27;ve determined it&#x27;s something I definitely want to stick with so I decided it was time to upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My two biggest gripes with the Emjoi were the short battery life (I was replacing batteries every 30-45 minutes) and the curved shape of the tweezer head. The curved shape was nice when I was still learning the ins and outs of epilating as it&#x27;s less prone to pinching but I was ready to move on to the big leagues with a flat epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Braun model appealed to me because it is a corded model which meant I wouldn&#x27;t be messing with swapping out batteries all the time, the tweezer head is flat, and it has an LED light which makes it easier to spot missed hairs. There were a few other perks about it (ie: the cooling glove and shaving attachment) that intrigued me as well. Overall my impression of the Braun 5-5280 Silk Epil Epilator is as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Corded design: Some people prefer cordless epilators but for me personally I prefer the corded design. I found the 7.5 foot long cord to be adequate for my needs and I don&#x27;t find the cord to be bothersome or in the way at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**IMPORTANT** The plug on this cord is designed to click into place inside the epilator but requires a firm push. I&#x27;ve noticed a few people complaining about the loose connector and thought this was important to point out. If your plug is falling out of your epilator it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s not properly clicked into place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LED light: As I mentioned previously I was interested in this feature but didn&#x27;t have the highest of hopes as I knew it could be hit or miss. All I can say is WOW! It really makes a difference. When epilating I move through a small area, then move the epilator back a bit to shine the light on the area I just epilated. The LED light makes it very easy to spot any missed hairs. After seeing the difference I&#x27;ll never go back to a non-lighted model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tweezer accuracy: The 40 tweezers on this unit are very accurate at locating and plucking hairs. I&#x27;ve only experienced a few instances with this unit where it passed a hair more than once or twice without plucking it and the reason for this ended up being due to the head unit being full of plucked hairs (explained under cons). As long as the head unit is kept clear the unit does a remarkable job of plucking even the thinnest, shortest hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair build-up: The design of this epilator causes the plucked hairs to get caught and build up inside the rotating head unit. When this occurs the unit begins to lose accuracy. It&#x27;s not difficult to open the head unit and brush away the excess hairs but is still an annoyance that&#x27;s worth mentioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaver head: I personally found the shaver head to be awful. It shaved maybe 50% of the hairs in a given area. Fortunately for me I did not buy this unit to use as a shaver so this isn&#x27;t a deal breaker for me but is something to consider if you plan to use this attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pinching: Make sure while epilating areas with skin that could potentially be pinched you&#x27;re pulling your skin taut to avoid this. If it happens it&#x27;s not the most horrible thing in the world but it does leave an unattractive red \\&quot;hickey\\&quot; where the skin was pinched and obviously doesn&#x27;t feel very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SoftLift tips: I personally didn&#x27;t notice anything special about the softlift tips cover over the standard efficiency cover. I find the efficiency cover easier to use as it&#x27;s smooth so I just stick with that one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Design: I had my doubts about the tweezer design of this model. Instead of there being two moving metal tweezers that pinch together, this unit operates by having one moving metal tweezer press against a stationary plastic piece to pinch the hair. I had my doubts about this design but I can&#x27;t consider it a complaint as this epilator blows my other epilator (with full metal tweezers) out of the water on accuracy and I didn&#x27;t notice any significant hair breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cooling glove: I can&#x27;t list this as a pro or a con really as it did nothing for me. The most soothing thing you can do post-epilating is to apply a good natural lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the Braun Series 5-5280 Silk Epil Epilator is a decent product. As I said it&#x27;s not without its flaws but this seems to be par for the course when it comes to epilating and I didn&#x27;t find the flaws to be significant enough to warrant deducting any stars from my rating. If you&#x27;re looking for an epilator that is accurate, can be used for extended periods of time without having to worry about recharging/replacing batteries, and you don&#x27;t mind being plugged into an outlet, I would definitely recommend this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Epilating tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pain: epilating by its very nature causes discomfort but doesn&#x27;t have to be unbearable. To minimize pain, hold your skin taut whenever possible and trim longer hair before epilating. Also I&#x27;ve found it to be less painful to epilate shortly after taking a hot bath or shower (make sure your skin is completely dry first!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair breakage: make sure you&#x27;re using the appropriate speed for the hair you&#x27;re trying to epilate. Personally I like to just stay on the slower speed as I find there to be a lot less breakage this way. Also make sure you&#x27;re gliding slowly and giving the epilator plenty of time to pluck all the hairs in a given area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Post-epilating: Use a good natural lotion to help soothe your skin and prevent/minimize red bumps. Also, dry brushing regularly with a good natural bristle brush helps to both eliminate existing and prevent future ingrown hairs.st a stationary plastic piece to pinch the hair.

            <li> Keeping in mind that I bought my epilator primarily for bikini line, I am extremely happy with this product. It&#x27;s so much less messy than waxing (I have tried both cold and warm waxing), and in the long term I think it will be more cost effective. I also found it less painful than waxing, but you should still expect the some sort of semi-painful sensation. I think the fact that it&#x27;s not a shock of pain (like in waxing), and that I can easily control where the epilator goes allows me to be a lot more comfortable with the feeling that epilating induces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose Braun as my brand of epilator because it was constantly coming up in reviews for the top epilator brands, and because they have been producing the product for a very long time. Braun seemed to have the largest variety of epilator types over all other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I don&#x27;t really use my epilator for more than the one area, so I&#x27;m not sure if some areas are more painful than others, but I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This was my first with an epilator.  I must say i&#x27;m impressed! left me as smooth as a fresh wax.  It was pretty painful but I need to build up by tolerance.  The thing i despised bout this product is the cord falls off with the slightest tug or pull.  I spent the entire time trying to hold the cord in place or putting it back in.  Will get a cordless!</li>
            <li> I was afraid of the pain, but it is obvious that you have to feel it if you want to be free of undesirable hair. I like it, it is easy to use and clean it. good quality and after a few times using it, you get used to the pain. It is a bearable pain so you don&#x27;t suffer like using wax. And it is better than shaving, the epilation lasts even more and (like I heard) some day, in the future, the hair is going to grow thinner and even less than now. Oh, the light that comes in the machine it&#x27;s wonderful, makes easier to manage it. So, for me it is the best option. Good product and trust mark.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife. She has been using epilator for hair removal since a year without any problems. This one though was not at all helpful. My wife complained that during epilation her skin would get caught up in it and cause blood clots. I would not recommend this to anyone who loves their skin.</li>
            <li> does it&#x27;s job but hurts like a bitch</li>
            <li> Words cant explain how much this hurt epilating my legs the first time!!  After that it got easier, because the hairs were sparser.  I would have to touch up weekly but didnt have to shave in between.  I couldnt do my underarms though.... the pain was out of this world!!</li>
            <li> Unlike the expensive cavitation machine, Braun is Braun for a reason:  good, solid history of manufacturing products.</li>
            <li> It dose what it is supposed to do. The built-in light is awesome and very helpful</li>
            <li> Really like the dual speed and the light. Not my first epilator so I knew what to expect comfort wise. This product, possibly because of the slower speed, didn&#x27;t cause as much discomfort as others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> it is very cool, you cannot feel any discomfort using this epilator, the cold pad helps a lot with it also.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like that you need to use it plugged, since there is no cordless, but anyway is a minor thing to consider.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been hesitating to buy this item for a month now and I do regret it. The pain is just too much to bear for me I gave up after one leg (the vibration does nothing). My mother wanted to try it and she liked it, but after a while she noticed that the hairs were barely coming off even after making several passes. It&#x27;s a good item I guess if you have high tolerance for pain, but definitely not worth 60$.</li>
            <li> Many years ago, I had an epi-lady.  I though it was a great idea, a way to epilate at home, but using it was torture and after a few tries I gave up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally Nair or wax my legs and was curious to see if the technology had improved over the years. It was night and day! The Silk epil 5 has 2 speeds, low and high and it&#x27;s recommended to start with the lower speed, so I did.  I can honestly say there was no pain on my legs. I was amazed.  For the sake of a complete review, I even tried in under my arms. That was a little trickier. It wasn&#x27;t terrible but I could see that that might take some getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for another option for hair removal, this one not only works, but works gently. Recommended!</li>
            <li> Plug is very loose,detaches by the simplest touch im gona have to tape it or something because its sooo looose</li>
            <li> I just got this!  It is really amazing. Almost painless and I havent even used the ice pack yet!</li>
            <li> Works well and comes apart easily for cleaning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once and it was painful as some of the other reviews stated. But it got the job done! Love that it came with the attachments and ice pack too.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with this epilator.  I bought it to replace a Braun 5270 that unfortunately had stopped working.  This one seems to remove the hairs in fewer passes, so that&#x27;s a big plus.  Like the previous model, it also has a nice light which helps you see hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The minuses are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The cord falls out very easily.  Never had this problem with any other similar items, so I&#x27;m not sure why they couldn&#x27;t get this right.  While I&#x27;m using the epilator, once in a while the cord falls out and I have to go plug it in again.  It gets annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The dial-shaped switch on the front is a little hard to use.  It&#x27;s hard to get a good grip on it, since it&#x27;s pretty flat.  This also makes it really easy to accidentally overshoot the setting you want when you do turn it, since you hard to grip it kind of hard and turn it kind of hard.  The \\&quot;off\\&quot; position is in the middle, and the two speeds are on either side, so whenever I try to turn it off, I end up accidentally turning it all the way to the other speed.  After a few tries I do get it to turn off, but it shouldn&#x27;t be this hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from these design annoyances, the device functions pretty well, so my review is mixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like others mentioned, it is NOT a cordless device, despite what the product listing here says.  Because I noticed inconsistencies in the product listing versus what the product really seemed to be, I decided to look only at the product description listed on Braun&#x27;s own website instead of trusting the one here, and I suggest you do the same!  Since external URL posting is not allowed in Amazon reviews, you&#x27;ll just have to search for the web page yourself, but it isn&#x27;t hard to find.</li>
            <li> I thought that twice the amount of tweezers might make the epilator hurt less. No such luck! Maybe if they created some type of numbing spray or lotion that you could use to lessen the pain would be perfect. If only.&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is OUCH! I had a similar product about 15 years ago and it was terribly painful but I thought for sure by now they would have improved it to be better and less painful. Nope, same awful pain. I couldn&#x27;t even finish one leg because it was so painful. I&#x27;ll stick to shaving with a razor, thank you!</li>
            <li> 1. Power cord keeps coming off while using...very annoying and not effective&lt;br /&gt;2. Hair pull is also not as good as old one did</li>
            <li> Right out of the box my number one complaint is it didn&#x27;t come with an instruction manual and I have no idea how to properly use this razor beyond the basic dry razor aspect. I can surmise how to attach the heads and use it as a daily dry razor to shave my legs and such, but the epilator aspect is beyond me. The attachments that come with it are to shave more sensitive areas or very close to the skin- the later being something I haven&#x27;t tried because it looks like it would be painful. I was under the impression this would yank hair out by the roots much like waxing and tweezing, but it appears to be a standard dry razor. It doesn&#x27;t shave perfect but it works when you are in a pinch and don&#x27;t want to use a real razor in the shower.</li>
            <li> I used to have an epilady when it first came out, so I sort of know what to expect from this type of shaver. I don&#x27;t have an issue with the pain as it was fairly light for me. Too bad the &#x27;plucking&#x27; action did not work as efficiently. This doesn&#x27;t seem as accurate with the &#x27;plucking&#x27;. Hair tend to break instead of being plucked clear from the roots. In effect, this is the same as shaving. Maybe I suffer from &#x27;too fine&#x27; hair which make it harder for the epilady to grip. However, waxing works fine in that situation. All said, I&#x27;ll be sticking to my wax strips a while longer (no pun intended).</li>
            <li> I do not recommended.&lt;br /&gt;The electric cord continue to slide and desconnected from the main body.&lt;br /&gt;I tryed my sister&#x27;s one from other brand and was much painless and wiredless, much practical.... do not buy this one :(</li>
            <li> Have used Braun Silk Epil for years, not sure what model number my last one was, but it was quite a few years old. I believed it wasn&#x27;t working as well as it once did.  Boy was I correct.  This model works very well and though it hurts a bit more, I think it is only because it is doing the job the older one was not.  Comes with a few different heads for close shave and a stubble kind of shave.  The epli function works great. And like previous Braun&#x27;s it is easily taken apart for cleaning.  Love the Braun product line.</li>
            <li> This works amazing! Everything about it is great. I Love it so much! :D</li>
            <li> The wire has a very bad connection to the machine and keeps disconnecting, which makes it impossible to use the epilator efficiently.</li>
            <li> I used to be terrified of Epilators! This is the first Epilator that I have bought and used. I had watched several youtube videos and read people&#x27;s experiences about these. Some people made them sound horrible! I used it last night on my legs and armpits. It was NOT as bad as I thought. My legs felt like a sting, but was bearable and my armpits weren&#x27;t bad either. I did both legs, no sweat. Now, I cant say the same the bikini area, but so far I really like it and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Very good. My first epilator, I used it several time till now and very happy so far. It doesn&#x27;t have battery so you always need to plug in during usage. But it does do it&#x27;s job pretty well. It&#x27;s also not water proof which wasn&#x27;t my requirement. It can remove very small hairs up to 0.5 mm. Usually epilating first time does hurt a lot but in my case as I used to do wax a lot, it wasn&#x27;t hurting at all. Good product at great price and all you need.</li>
            <li> this is the worse epilator i ever used in my life, even shaving has a better results than this. I used many, even cheaper and from less reputable companies, alternatives that were wayyy much better than this one. I gave this product three chances before I judge its quality, and its bad. not very effective when it comes to removing hair, you still can see short hair on the skin surface looking like small black dots its so annoying AND i don&#x27;t even have thick hair!  for me, epilators usually gives satisfying results but not with this product. I never write reviews, but i had to for this one because i was completely disappointed.</li>
            <li> The world of epilators seems to revolve around two kinds of pricing - super cheap dinky units, and pricier units from top name brands. This Braun is a rare exception because it is both affordable and a top quality brand name. The product was not tested on myself, but by my wife who switched away from a sub $20 unit for a few weeks. In this case, happy wife &#x3D; happy life because she was able to report that the Silk-Epil 5280 is worth every penny. It removes hairs after long sessions with the cheaper one, and it does it with less pain and less noise - two things she hated about the old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good job Braun - compact, quiet, effective and well priced. Something everyone looks for in an epilator.</li>
            <li> The last time I used an epilator was in the 80&#x27;s when the Epilady first hit the market.  My delight with the product was quickly extinguished the first time I used it and discovered how painful it was.  I am embarassed to say it went back in the box and was pushed to the back of the closet, where it stayed.  In the years since, I&#x27;ve been waxed and have had electrolysis and laser treatments, none of which were exactly comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hoping perhaps 25-30 years had brought some improvement in epilation, I tried the Braun Silk Epil Epilator 5-5280 on my legs.  I won&#x27;t tell you that it&#x27;s not painful, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much as I remember.  If you&#x27;ve ever heard a commercial for laser hair removal, you may have noticed they tell you how quick it is, but they never mention that it hurts.  The Braun Silk Epilator hurts, but you don&#x27;t have the intense heat that I&#x27;ve experienced with five different types of lasers, which I find more uncomfortable, though quick.  Electrolysis is great for small areas (such as eyebrows, upper lip, chin, etc), but would be prohibitive in terms of time and expense for larger areas but I don&#x27;t think you could consider it for underarms or lower legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparatively, the Epilator isn&#x27;t quick - at least not for the legs.  There are two settings - I and II, with I being \\&quot;extra gentle\\&quot; and II being \\&quot;extra efficient\\&quot; (read more painful).  I find the I setting to be more tolerable, but it requires several passes to get all the hair in a given area.  The light on this model is quite helpful.  I have been using it on my legs and the hair doesn&#x27;t seem to grow back as quickly as it does after shaving.  However, it takes quite a while to epilate such a large area and though the pain isn&#x27;t extreme, it gets hard to take to do both legs at the same time - and I am grateful I don&#x27;t need to use it on the area they indicate are more sensitive - the bikini line and the underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seems to be a nicely made little device and if you have the time, patience and can endure some discomfort, you will get decent results.  When you consider the investment in time (going for the treatments) and finances required for waxing, electrolysis and laser hair removal treatments, epilation is the most efficient in both respects.  All the alternatives to shaving require some degree of pain tolerance, but this is one that allows you to go at your own pace, at your convenience in the comfort and privacy of your home - and at a much lesser price.  Particularly if you&#x27;re on a budget, I would give this epilator a try before going for more costly methods.</li>
            <li> This works perfect.  It&#x27;s been three days abd my legs are so soft still. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. A little painful but once you use it it&#x27;s a piece of cake.</li>
            <li> I like the long, easy to use cord and also the light, but I find this model (Series 5-5280) does not get all the fine hairs, even after going over the area several times, and the head is not very flexible on the uneven areas like knee caps.  Also, the &#x27;circular on-off&#x27; switch is not as easy to use as the &#x27;slide style&#x27; switch on my earlier model.&lt;br /&gt;As a long time user of Epil products (25 yrs), on legs only, the &amp;#34;ouch!&amp;#34; factor does not apply to me, so the extra items (different heads, cold pack etc) are just &amp;#34;filler&amp;#34; to appeal to new users.  I would prefer a model that &amp;#34;gets the job done&amp;#34; for legs only and adjust the cost accordingly.  It&#x27;s like breaking your glass coffe pot - you don&#x27;t need a whole new coffee maker, just the glass pot.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended. Very good product.</li>
            <li> I recently lost my last Braun epilator during a move. After about 3 weeks, I decided I wasn&#x27;t going to find it and should get a new one. My last epilator was my first one, so I didn&#x27;t invest much money into it. After epilating consistently for almost 2 years, I figured an upgrade would be worth it. I&#x27;m really happy with this. It doesn&#x27;t get every hair, but I think part of that is because my hair has become so thin after epilating for so long. It doesn&#x27;t really bother me. I figure if I can&#x27;t see the hairs, other people won&#x27;t see them either. I agree that the On switch being a dial is kind of annoying. My last one had a sliding switch that I liked a lot better, but for the most part I haven&#x27;t had much trouble accidentally turning it off or anything like that. The light is nice, but I&#x27;ve found that it doesn&#x27;t magically make every hair super visible. I can see more or fewer hairs depending on my perspective. Definitely a nice feature, though. I&#x27;ve only used the massaging head, and I do think it makes it a little less painful to epilate. Obviously it doesn&#x27;t magically make it not hurt, but it&#x27;s a little bit of a distraction. I also like that the head pivots. Overall, a good product that I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a lazy pain free shaver for most of my life. Finally tired of stubble I moved on to waxing.  I was paying $20 every 2 weeks to have my underarms done.  Eff that! Tried wax kits at home.... anyone every tried waxing your armpits alone?  It&#x27;s worse than a pinterest fail.  I remembered using my mom&#x27;s epilady when I was 10, on a dare from her of course.  The pain is just as bad as I remember. Ladies,  gents, this is not for the faint of heart.  Mind you, I went straight for the pits.  My endorphins finally kicked in after the first few minutes but WOW it was painful.  Is the silky smooth hair free skin worth the pain? Barely.  But it sure beats shaving and messy waxing.  I strongly recommend using this gadget every few days.  My hair was grown in two weeks from a wax, way too much to do in one sitting without passing out!</li>
            <li> Apparently hurts like hell. Beware. My girlfriend used it twice and called it quits.</li>
            <li> I had used one of the original Epiladies from long, long ago and swore I&#x27;d never try one again.  It was extremely painful to use.  But when I saw this was available I thought, \\&quot;Surely they&#x27;ve come a long way in [x] years.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes and no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the painfulness of using it, that&#x27;s pretty much over unless you have extremely delicate skin.  It&#x27;s pulling so many hairs at once that it feels more like an overall numbing sensation rather than pain.  But the downside of that is, it is using so many \\&quot;tweezers\\&quot; it doesn&#x27;t do a very good job of getting them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent a lot of time trying to get the same results I get with a razor or waxing.  Quite frankly, TOO much time.  I tried doing it very slowly and very quickly.  Neither way made hair removal effortless.  And, I assure you, I&#x27;m not a hairy beast with an excessive amount of hair.  And I used it at the \\&quot;recommend length\\&quot; - easy to do as a stay-at-home mom. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, sorry [[ASIN:B0077PLO60 Braun Silk-Epil 5280 Epilator]], I&#x27;m going to stick with waxing and shaving for now.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3PUEZAYI0IWV5]]The video covers a lot of specifics, but here are the general highlights:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Less regrowth over time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Cool light that lets you see hair you miss&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Cleaner than shaving&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Shaving head to get hair to the right length for epilation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Still very very painful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t work when unplugged(not really cordless like listing says, or commonly defective. Either way)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Cord doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;click\\&quot; when seated so you can&#x27;t really tell if it is plugged in or not&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technique matters! In the video I go over a few things you can do to reduce the pain if it is your first time. It&#x27;s still quite painful, and I hope that will go down over time...I will update after a few more weeks using it to let you guys know if it gets better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is that hair removal comes down to personal preference, and while this is a good product, if you&#x27;ll like it or not depends on what you want from your hair remover method. Least pain is shaving, longest lasting is waxing, but the epilator will result in less hair over time...it&#x27;s like cheap laser hair removal that takes months to be effective.</li>
            <li> good buy,  recommended  to buy.  easily used,  cleaned, quick to finish  even if you want to use on whole body</li>
            <li> This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever owned and the first time I&#x27;ve ever tried it. I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now and well...  it takes much longer than shaving and it misses little hairs ALL over despite everything I&#x27;ve tried! That said, the way it epilates is totally tolerable and feels like it&#x27;s just scratching most of the time. I do wish I had bought a better quality epilator, though, as this one just doesn&#x27;t do the job well.</li>
            <li> This is the first epilator I&#x27;ve ever owned. I read through a lot of reviews and decided to purchase this one because I didn&#x27;t want something too cheap but also didn&#x27;t want something too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just used this on my arms for the first time and it was so easy! I did read it&#x27;s better to get them waxed first so I did at a spa (around the end of September). Anyways, I figured today was a good day to put this epilator to use. It took me about twenty minutes for my arms and of course, being my first time epilating, my arms are still bumpy and a bit red (this also happened after I got them waxed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit loud but it&#x27;s not too loud that I couldn&#x27;t listen to music while epilating. The light is very handy and it wasn&#x27;t painful at all. It&#x27;s also easy to clean - I pop off the cap and brush it with the included brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does come with attachments like the cooling glove/pouch and various caps but I only see myself using the trimmer cap in the future. As this is my first epilator, I don&#x27;t really have anything I can compare it to but in my opinion, it does the job and I love it! It got all the hairs on my arm and works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Excellent - really does the job quickly!</li>
            <li> Great for armpits and bikini area, but if you have thin hair, do not use this on that area. I have very thin/fine hair on my legs and it does not pick it up. It will get a few, but not most. It mostly breaks the hairs off at the root and it just feels like it&#x27;s pulling it out. Overall though, it&#x27;s great not having to shave my armpits everyday because of this. I&#x27;ve used this multiple times and the pain is much more dull than when I first started.</li>
            <li> This is my very first epilator that I bought and I must say I&#x27;m impressed with this item. So far, I have used all the provided parts of the epilator, which includes the epilator, efficiency cap, shaver head, trimmer cap, cleaning brush except for the cooling liquid and the glove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Epilation itself is a painful process of removing hair, especially when removing the underms area, this is probably not the epilators fault. I should mention that my first try epilating my underarms was super painful, I almost teared my eyes. I wouldnt blame the epilator as I know and willingly agreed to tolerate the pain. So if you think you are not strong enough feeling pain then epilation may not be the method for you. However, epilating my arms and legs were not very painful, infact I would say it probably wasnt painful at all. But I guess it depends on individuals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The epilator is NOT chargable, it needs to be connected to the power outlet at all times of use, which I thought was advantageous as well as disadvantageous. Advantageous because it eliminates the use of batteries and you do not need to care about having enough charge on it for a long body epilation time. However, the fact that the epilator needs to be plugged in for usage requires the need to be near an outlet at all times. It is extrememly important that the epilator does not contact with water while it is plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The provided parts such as the shaverhead, and the trimmer cap is quite useful too. shaverhead can be used for shaving, while the trimmer cap helps lessen the length of hair, I hope u know which hair I am referring to. The two differnt epilation caps are fun to use as one of them massages the skin, which I found interestingly cool. Even though it takes a several turns for a certain area to be completely smooth, but I believe it depwnds on the the hair growth as well.I personally have fine hair on my arms so Iits wasnt at all painful epilating my arms. My underarms have fine-medium hair growth so it was super painful epilatin there, I am really hoping I would get used to the pain and feeling some day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning the epilator can be annoying as it takes a while to clean with the brush, but certainly not impossible. Since this epilator can be opened to a certain extent cleaning becomes easier, just time consuming. Hpwever, the epilator can also be washed under running water, only when it is competely unplugged from any power source and turned off. Make sure, to comletely dry yourself as well as all ghe parts that were washed under water before putting it back into place and before the epilator is turned back on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time epilating my underarms, I was able to get rid of atleast ninety five percent of the hair I had but it definitely took a few strokes to get to my desired results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am enjoying my experience with the epilator as it does what I had expected of it except that I thought it would be chargable. I bought this item for 54 dollars and if it does not break for any unfortunate reason, I believe that purchasing this item will be worth spending my money. I am happy with almost everything about this epilator.</li>
            <li> This is a nice small unit for tweezing hair.  Would be nicer if it was cordless, and could be used in the shower.  It&#x27;s washable, but not entirely water proof.  It&#x27;s got a nice feel to it, and fits in the hand nicely.  I tested it on my arm and noticed a slight tingle.  My wife tried using it, but felt it was too painful for her liking.  She said she will stick to waxing and get it over with in one shot. If you don&#x27;t mind some pain, this will probably work for you.  I would look for a cordless one if they offer it.  Having a cord in this day and age seems inconvenient.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Braun Silk-Epil in a 20 year period.  Needless to say, I&#x27;m thrilled about this product.  I really should have purchased a new one much sooner, but I kept using my previous (probably 12 years old)Epilator which still did a half-way decent job.  This last one, the 5280, is absolutely the best of all previous models!</li>
            <li> This model really a great item with a nice price, I have purchased it for my wife who love it and noticed&lt;br /&gt;a big difference between this one and the old different brand she had, initially there was a little&lt;br /&gt;pain but not bothering too much and now it is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks amazon</li>
            <li> I am so happy I got this one! I&#x27;ve been epilating for years and I still think that Braun is the way to go.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well. I&#x27;d suggest to spend more and get other ones, Braun SE 5280 Silk Epil 5 Epilator With Ice Glove is much better.</li>
            <li> I have had epiladies for many years and only bought this new one because I had to. My old one broke and was biting me. I am very surprised how much better this new one is. Easier especially with the light. Less painful I was wondering if it was working and perfect that the head angles easily to conform to my legs. I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Okay - I think my old one was better.  The one I had for years fell victim to a flood in the bathroom.  I had had it for years and it still worked fine.  So I decided to buy the closest thing I could find to the old one.  I find the on/off to be difficult - you have to turn it with your finger.  I preferred a push up/down switch.  You can use this one without the &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; attachment: DON&#x27;T, it kind of sucked my skin into it and left a raw spot.  It does not seem to pull the tiny hairs out as well as the old one.  The old model had tweezers, but this one has one stationary side and one that moves in and out to grab the hairs.  Unfortunately, I find I am only able to remove half the hairs, so it sort of defeats the purpose of using the device.  If you have never used an epilator, please know that it does hurt, but the pain lessens with continued use.</li>
            <li> Great product. Very usefull and fast. Lasts long no mess. Can take it with me any where I go. Love it.</li>
            <li> The plug does not fit properly it keeps on coming out when&#x27;s are using it not happy with the product simple problem that the plug should plug in the points properly. They should try to fix the problem.</li>
            <li> I have always used Braun epilators and have tried the cordless one for a few years. I prefer the one with a cord because it lasts a lot longer and still has the light on it. Would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my granddaughter.  She was able to understand and use it right away and just loves it.  We&#x27;re saving a ton of money not buying disposable razors anymore.</li>
            <li> i thought its cordless with the charger, but i felt so sad that its with the cord. and cant take it any where , have to sit near the switch as it works with the electricity only :(</li>
            <li> I loved it. People always told me that epilator pains a lot but when I tried the Braun silk epil 5, it was amazing. No pain at all, it made hair removal so easy.</li>
            <li> First I shower and exfoliated two days in a row.  Then I used it on my legs and armpits. It has been a couple weeks now and some of the hairs that were not pulled from the root I can see growing back but most of the hairs were pulled from the root and they have not grown back yet or they are so soft I can&#x27;t feel them.  It hurts like a MOFO the first time.&lt;br /&gt;When I went to epilate the second time for the hairs I didn&#x27;t pull out right the first time didn&#x27;t hurt as much.  I guess I am use to it now.  It really does work if you know how to use it properly but most people cant handle the pain.  I would not use this for bikini area.  Upper legs are kinda hard to get too.  You really have stretch before using this thing.&lt;br /&gt;Just break the bank and let someone wax you nice and quick.  Then use the epilator to maintain the wax.  I would not use this if you do not wax.  The hairs will be so strong and deep it would be unbearable to epilate.</li>
            <li> Both my daughters swear by this devise. So all you ladies out there here is a new ouch less devise to remove all those unwanted hairs, face, legs, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using epilators for many, many years now, and Braun has been my go-to brand since my college years. Braun&#x27;s epilators have proven reliable and durable for me over all of these years, and each one that I&#x27;ve gotten is STILL working, and going strong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new line of shimmery white epilators that Braun has released, including this 5280, offer just about any new, or seasoned, epilator user all of the options that they&#x27;ll want for as much hair removal as they&#x27;re looking for. This 5280, with its three attachments, will get those new to epilation through to becoming seasoned epilator users without undue pain, and with years of reliable use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The epilator body is comfortable in the hand, and the buttons, and head release, are positioned where they are easy to reach while using the unit. The SmartLight is one of the best innovations Braun has come up with - that light reveals SO much more than one could previously see with these, especially around corners and in tighter spaces, that the epilator user is just about guaranteed to get every little hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; There are others in this line that are wet/dry, and rechargeable, which is an advantage. Being able to epilate wet skin while actually in the shower adds a distinctive edge to successful epilation with a minimum of pain. Warm water makes the hair shaft open up, causing the shaft to release the hair more easily, so epilating either in the shower, or just post-shower, is going to be the best choice for the least painful experience. Over time, your hair WILL grow in finer, which can pose more of a challenge in getting the tweezers to grip the finer hair, but at that point, you might want to consider just epilating your skin when it&#x27;s dry (something that was, once, an epilator user&#x27;s only option...). Cleaning your epilator is easy enough; since many in this line can now be rinsed under running water, that&#x27;s an option, but I still prefer to use the brush to remove any loose hairs, and follow that up with the application of a cotton ball soaked in rubbing alcohol, to clean and sterilize the tweezers on the heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you tend to have ingrown hairs, that CAN pose a problem with an epilator. I&#x27;ve had to back off of epilating more... sensitive, thicker-skinned areas, because epilation there has just prompted too many ingrowns for me, even with the daily use of a thick sugar scrub that I make up at home (all I use is a whole LOT of granulated white sugar, and just enough of any shower gel to make up a thick, foamy paste of sugar suspended in soap - kinda the consistency of creamed butter and sugar for cookie dough, ideally). There are other options (such as [[ASIN:B004OVH8H4 Emjoi After Epilation Cream With Hair Growth Inhibitor]], which I&#x27;ve never used), but for me, I think the smartest thing for me to do at this point is to stick to epilating areas where the hair will not grow back in curls that never break the surface of thicker skin...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with Braun&#x27;s epilators, and I feel that their changes to their epilators have only added to their offerings, and made them that much more appealing to anyone looking to have hairless skin for many, many days at a time (about five for me, on average). It seems to me that either you&#x27;re in the Emjoi camp, or the Braun camp, regarding epilators. I&#x27;m a happy user of Braun, and am willing to encourage anyone that&#x27;s considering starting epilation to give this Braun epilator a try. I think you&#x27;ll be happy with your choice, and that it&#x27;ll last you for many, many years of happy hair removal! ; )that up with the application of a cotton ball soaked in rubbing alcohol, to clean and sterilize the tweezers on the heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you tend to have ingrown hairs, that CAN pose a problem with an epilator.

            <li> I just love it!, you don&#x27;t feel any pain and also it is so easy to clean! I actually recommended to my mom and she bought it right away! She is very happy to have it too!! :)</li>
            <li> I had several Epilators from Braun before and I was very disappointed from this product. The hair grew faster than with my old one, similar to if I would have shave</li>
            <li> I used to have an older version of the Silk-epil that I loved. Because of it I don&#x27;t think there is a better brand out there for epilators. I had it for 8 years and it worked great. I dropped it on a tile floor and it something shifted inside and now it is not working well anymore. So I bough this one. It is supposed to be better, but I don&#x27;t like it as much as the older series. That flexible head doesn&#x27;t always do it for me. Sometimes I miss quite a bit because of it. Also it doesn&#x27;t have the other addaptors the old one had. It had a trimmer you could add on which was cool. Wish they kept this in this version. Still a pretty good product though.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this product. It was painful but the results were better than expected. I read reviews that pain gets less after each epilation secession. Don&#x27;t be scared to buy this product. It works well. I REALLY recommend you buy this product!</li>
            <li> This Braun Silk-Epil 5280 Epilator was my wife&#x27;s first epilator, and while the product works, she did not like the pain associated with the process and would rather shave.  There were some areas she didn&#x27;t want to use it due to fear it might be really painful.  With that said, using this product will depend on a person&#x27;s pain threshold and what area it is used on.  Some may want to avoid using it on sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the less sensitive areas she used it on, she said you had to sometimes go back over an area to get all the hair.  So, if you are looking for an epilator and don&#x27;t mind some pain, this unit seems to be a decent choice.  She didn&#x27;t have any other model to compare it too.</li>
            <li> The product is good, easy to handle and fast worker. I love the light!!! I really thought that will be just a gadget but&#x27; it really does help</li>
            <li> My old EpiLady finally died after a number of years so this was a replacement. I like the 40 tweezers but the light is a nuisance which I cannot turn off.</li>
            <li> So much better than the one I bought 6 years ago.</li>
            <li> The adapter has a problem, and so the epilator motor is so slow ! I dont recommend this product for you</li>
            <li> I still have this epilator and it still works, make sure that you hear a click when plugging in the power cord to the epilator otherwise it will unplug in the middle of your depilation session.</li>
            <li> Omg! I&#x27;m in love! I was the type of girl who was shaving every day. My armpits left dark shadows and I hated it! So I went from shaving (yuck), to waxing (hate it), and used a depilatory which left my skin with burns for days (ouch)! I decided to try this, hoping it would get rid of these nasty looking black underarms. I&#x27;m not going to lie, I was nervous trying it. It does hurt. Kind of feels like a bunch of bees stinging you, but after a a few strokes you actually get used to  the pain. My underarms are a little red with some ingrown hairs, but I can see a big difference! Use tend skin afterwards to get rid of the bumps, ingrown hairs, etc. Wooooo hoooo no more dark shadowy underarms! Just try it and go with it even if it does hurt a bit!</li>
            <li> To much work. Now that I&#x27;ve got it, it&#x27;ll just collect dust. I would not have bought this if I knew what all the entails were.</li>
            <li> it is so good ,i like it and i think it is beneficial for me , thank  you for your help  .</li>
            <li> Works great! Makes my underarms feel so soft. It pulls my hair from the root! I would highly reccommend this product!</li>
            <li> Have to get use to it</li>
            <li> When using it, it ripped some of my skin off and pinched my skin so I was bleeding and had bruises. The epilator part of it also just stopped working. I have been using the shaver part of it and that was a good deal. If I was given the chance to buy it or not knowing what I do now, I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it. Just wax or shave ladies.</li>
            <li> It works very well.  After using it for a while, I found the hairs grow back slower.  It was not painful at all once I got used to it.  I definitely prefer it over shaving.</li>
            <li> It works great!!! I have used Braun silk epils for more than 14 years and I never had any issues. Great brand and excellent product.</li>
            <li> the power cord to the epilator keeps falling off when using. Also my ingrown hair increased after i started using this epilator.</li>
            <li> I bought this epilator because i used to have one (same Brand) in my country so i decided to buy the same one and it Works really good as i thought.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it and she was a little bit concern about buying it but it turned out well. She&#x27;s happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was recommended to me by a friend and it was definitely, definitely worth it. I&#x27;ve owned an epilator before and, while it&#x27;s always going to hurt a bit to use one of these, the old one was so painful that I could hardly stand it, and I&#x27;d end up bruised all over somehow (maybe I wasn&#x27;t using it right?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This glides a lot more easily and doesn&#x27;t hurt quite as much. It&#x27;s easy to use in sensitive areas and definitely grabs thinner hairs. The cooling &amp;#34;mitt&amp;#34; it comes with is a little bit gimmicky (it&#x27;s basically just a sleeve for a cold pack - you can use your own cold packs just fine ; ) ) but still a good thing to include I suppose; it comes with a few trimming heads that I have yet to try, but they seem like they could be helpful too. Overall this is just a great product that I&#x27;m super happy about. I am thrilled to be throwing away all my dreadful, goopy DIY waxing kits.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product. I am giving it 4 star because it takes a little more time than I expected to have complete smooth skin. Reason being that I had scroll the epilator 4 to 5 times on the same area to remove all hair. But it definitely takes less time that waxing and very convenient to use. I am very happy that I decided to buy it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good-not perfect. It does not leave your legs completely smooth because it does not always pull the hair from the root. I like it because I spray tan in the summer, so it does not strip off my fake tan and I do not have to shave as often as I normally would.</li>
            <li> It is as claimed and does a great job. One of the best choices for the money. Does the job nicely.</li>
            <li> I used a Braun silk-epil for 5+ years and then replaced it with this model(only because it stopped working). I have had it less than a year, and it is slowing down, hardly working at full power. Maybe I got a bad product, but this one in no way compares with the previous model. That was a work-horse of an epilator, and frankly, I expected more from Braun. I am extremely disappointed in this model and will probably be replacing it with another brand. Also the head is narrower and it has never had the power that the previous one had. SOOO disappointed!</li>
            <li> Clever and quick machine. I tested the trim function, and it worked ok. As for the tweezer head, it is indeed painful, and the gel is not that efficient (maybe is my frigde, I don&#x27;t know). Anyway, I am using the tweezer head after using wax strips, for finalization, and it showed up a good plan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the pain will get better with the use, so I will keep giving a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using epilators for over 10 years, and I always liked Braun epilators, but this one has a really annoying defect in the design, which is the charging cable getting unplugged all the time while using the epilator. I was close to the outlet, but simple movement up and down the leg unplugged the cable. The cable does not click to the epilator; that could explain why. But, it is really annoying to have to reconnect the epilator every minute or so.&lt;br /&gt;I must add that Amazon is great in letting me return the product and refund me so quickly, so I could buy another one (not Braun).</li>
            <li> I definitely like it!  It&#x27;s a better option than shaving, though it doesn&#x27;t leave you all smooth.  I did think that it could grab shorter hairs than it can, though, so 4 stars.  I don&#x27;t have a comparison as this is my first epilator.</li>
            <li> It works, it is not that painful. The trimmer could be better. I have to firmly push the cable, as it was loosen every time I moved the epilator. Then , reading the reviews I realized I had to really push it, it does not click, but it stays on its place. Good product for the price.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  Would have preferred the On-Off button to be vertical rather than having to turn it from side to side.</li>
            <li> I wanted this so bad, and when it finally arrived, I was so nervous to start using it, because of all the reviews saying how painful it was. Then I finally got up the nerve to use it, and it wasn&#x27;t as bad as I thought it would be. Just be very careful in the more sensitive areas, like under the arms. when I did my legs, it wasn&#x27;t too painful at all, and I don&#x27;t usually get waxed. After using it now for over a month, it doesn&#x27;t hurt anymore at all. So if you are thinking of getting this, then just know that it will take a little getting used to before you will really appreciate it.</li>
            <li> A noticeable improvement over the last version I had (Excel, I think).  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> My sister calls it her beard trimmer.  I thought it would be painful on my chin but it really is not.  My upper lip is a bit more sensitive but I am getting used to it.  Sure beats waxing every 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> I love it. It is great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through three or four Braun epilators over the past 15 years. I was pretty frustrated with the last one I bought, as the drive wheel on the razor stopped working almost immediately. With the new epilators they have incorporated a better attachment system so the head engages with the motor all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The epilator head on this model is also superior to previous models. I have never been able to epilate my armpits before--it was just too painful. But this one, set on low, makes it easy. Not super comfortable but bearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my legs, I use the lower setting as well. Maybe my hair is finer than most, but on the high setting it seems to break the hairs rather than pull them out. The low setting is slower but more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main reason for purchasing this model was because it includes an electric razor. I use this on my bikini area as epilation there causes mad ingrowns. This razor is great--shaves very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I dislike about the Silk-epil 5 is the power switch. You have to turn this stupid circle thing and it&#x27;s not hard, but not as easy as a pressure switch.</li>
            <li> I had the silk-epil 5, and it was great. On this one they changed the on/off button, which is a bit awkward to change from speed II to I you always have to turn it off first.&lt;br /&gt;Also the head now moves and makes towards you have to pass several times on the same spot to remove the small hairs. It takes much longer... Unfortunately I do not recommend this one :(</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Silk Epil probably over 20 years, getting used to the new design of the floating head.  Highly recommend for painless hair removal.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. I used the Philips purple/white  Satinelle soft for 4 years and had to replace it because the head wasn&#x27;t working well after a while... Bought this one to try it out and I have to say I was very impressed. The angular head and the light are really useful features. In comparison to my previous epilator which was good, id say this one is EXCELLENT. it gets most of the hairs if not all of them.</li>
            <li> Does not work without the charger</li>
            <li> It is absolutely awesome. The light is a very nice usable feature as it lets you see exactly what you are doing, and the head to trim is very nice and works great. I have noticed that if the hairs are over 3 or 4mm it hurts more for some reason (armpit area), so if they are I trim them with the trimmer and then epilate. It grabs the smallest of hairs, and works very fast compared to other brands I have used before. I also like that it has two velocities, in the armpit its nicer to go with the slower one, and on the legs the fast one is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;One comment of something I didn&#x27;t expect (which maybe I didn&#x27;t read the description fully) is that it doesn&#x27;t work with batteries, but you have to plug it into an electrical outlet. I would like with batteries as that is what I was used to, but I guess its better this way, I was just not expecting it.</li>
            <li> If pain is your friend then go for it. This hurt even after doing it a few times. I&#x27;ll continue to go with waxing as the lesser of the two evils!!! :)</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator, but I&#x27;ve been waxing and sugaring for several years and I generally prefer by-the-roots methods of hair removal to shaving. I was hoping I would be able to use it as my single, all-purpose method of hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t expect it to be cordless, based on the reviews here, and I&#x27;m fine with the long cord. Mine clicked in very securely and hasn&#x27;t fallen out. I was prepared for the epilator to sound like a jet engine but it&#x27;s quieter than a blender or hairdryer. The clipper attachment seems to be pretty much useless, which is not a big downside for me. The shaver seems okay but I doubt I&#x27;ll use it. On to the specifics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LEGS \\&quot;Removes hair as fine as a grain of sand\\&quot; is probably overstating it, but it does as good a removal job on my lower legs as waxing did. There are some broken hairs left behind but waxing left some too. And the epilator is much, much easier to run frequently over my lower legs, so those broken-off hairs are sure to get yanked out sooner or later (especially since the epilator gets hairs shorter than waxing can). On my upper legs it is light years more convenient than waxing, particularly since I have (ahem) quite a lot of upper leg and thigh, and it used to take forever to wax a patch at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ARMPITS Frankly, unpleasant, but part of that is definitely my fault, since it was pretty shaggy there and didn&#x27;t trim. I also got pinched once or twice before I realized just how important keeping the skin taut was. The second time I epilated my armpits was much better. Again, lots faster and less trouble than waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ARMS I actually never waxed these, mostly because I physically couldn&#x27;t since I don&#x27;t have 3 hands. I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair on my arms and what there is is pretty fine, so I doubt I will epilate them regularly, but it was novel to try it once and the epilator did a great job. They were very red and bumpy for several hours after being epilated, no surprise there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BIKINI AREA Deeply unpleasant, but again, some of that was user error. Again with the shagginess that I was too impatient to trim, and I suggest you learn from my mistakes and trim the hair close to the skin, then let it grow for a week or so before epilating. There is no way around it, removing hair by the roots from the bikini area requires a lot of awkward contortion and reaching. The advantage of the epilator, of course, is that I don&#x27;t have to do all those acrobatics with a dripping spatula of wax in one hand. It&#x27;s easy to use with my nondominant hand, too. It is VERY important to keep the skin you&#x27;re epilating as taut as possible, or the tweezers may nip you. So do small patches at a time, just as if you were waxing, with the skin held tight. The second time I epilated around the bikini line, it was much, much less unpleasant. The main disadvantage of the epilator is that it doesn&#x27;t leave a very clean line, so if that&#x27;s important to you, you&#x27;ll have to tweeze, or edge with some waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PAIN Where waxing is usually one sharp, fast rip that has a sort of impact almost like being slapped, the epilator feels like a series of pricks or small zaps. Where you epilate, of course, affects how intense that sensation is. I don&#x27;t mind the difference but some people might. The longer the hair is the more you will feel each individual hair being pulled and then yanked out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I find this to be well worth the minor downsides (moderate noise, cord, possible nips, sometimes more prolonged sensation of hair removal) because of the convenience it offers over waxing. Keeping up with hair removal is much, much easier when it doesn&#x27;t involve a production.r /&gt;BIKINI AREA Deeply unpleasant, but again, some of that was user error.

            <li> Best thing I&#x27;ve ever bought! Had another one but this works great. Hurts yes....but I&#x27;m used to it.</li>
            <li> I use this often and its amazing! My hair is somewhat thin so sometimes it feels as though hair is being ripped out but I only have to do it about once every week to two weeks. Best invention ever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a hairy woman. Most of the hair on my body is where it belongs - on my head, and ummm...well, I&#x27;m not shaving THAT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I still shave all the time, although there&#x27;s not much hair on my legs or under my arms. I think it&#x27;s just habit. You can&#x27;t really SEE it, but you can sorta kinda feel the stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always thought an epilator was a waste for something who didn&#x27;t grow their own personal Everglades. I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun Epilator works great in hair removal. For a relatively hairless chick like me, it means I can be almost completely hair- and stubble-free in all the places I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t find it painful, but then, I&#x27;ve been plucking my eyebrows since I was 12. You get tough with pain endurance after all that time. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s because there wasn&#x27;t that much hair to GRAB, so you hairy dames should take this recommendation with a grain of salt. Your pain threshold and your thatched legs might be much different than my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one benefit is that the regrowth was much smoother and less stubbly. Worth the minor inconvenience, and I do save some time in the morning shower ablutions. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Have been in use for more than a year and there is no problem. Great value for the money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about a month now and it seems to work just ok. It seems like it breaks a lot of hairs off rather than pulling them out. I&#x27;ve never used an epilator before though so maybe i just need more practice. The first time i used it, it was so painful but by the second time it barely hurt at all. I wish I  had another one to compare it to. I will keep using it but i wouldn&#x27;t necessarily recommend this particular one to a friend.</li>
            <li> Love it. Way better than my last one</li>
            <li> I like my new Epilator it takes me about an hour to do both of my legs. And I don&#x27;t have to plug my hair for about 3-4 weeks my hair got thinner what I also appreciate. It works great for me I like that it has a light on it so you can see what you doing. I used one without the a light before and I would miss so much hair so I would have to go back again.</li>
            <li> left my old one behind. second time buying this. good price, lasts, and the trimmer attachment is great.</li>
            <li> This thing is WONDERFUL. My silk epil xelle broke after 4 years so I needed a replacement but wasn&#x27;t ready to spend $100 so I went for this cheaper option (since the cordless would not work with the cord).&lt;br /&gt;It did a fantastic job. It&#x27;s obvious that in 4 years the technology on these devices has improved.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;I still haven&#x27;t tried the razor part but I&#x27;m less interested in that.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps</li>
            <li> So convenient, but it still leaves some strays behind.</li>
            <li> Painful as hell for my sensitive skin. I just did not work for me. Used this the day I bought it and never used it again!!</li>
            <li> It dose work but painfull so I returned it.</li>
            <li> Works well, but you do have to make several passes, even going very slowly to get all the hairs. Hurts at first (like being snapped with a rubber band), but that eases up after a minute or two, once your body&#x27;s endorphins kick in. I paid a fortune for 12 laser hair removal sessions for my underarms, and while it got rid of most of the hair I still have enough stragglers to need to do something else about them. This does the trick and it doesn&#x27;t hurt any worse than the laser did after the first few sessions when they turn up the levels.</li>
            <li> Thought this is a great update to my old model.  Like the fact that it has a shaver trimmer head.  Also like how you can rinse the head under running water after use. I would recommend this to anyone who has used an Epilator before or has been in the habit of waxing. Much quicker and less messy than waxing. May be a bit more painful for those who normally shave.</li>
            <li> Worked great for first use. Stopped working immediately thereafter. No damage, didn&#x27;t drop it or anything other than normal use.</li>
            <li> Very bad, I have got the item without charger.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a replacement for an older Braun model, the 5270 Xelle Silk-Epil Epilator.  I&#x27;d had good experiences with the brand with the previous epilator and when it was damaged I figured I&#x27;d stick in house for a replacement.  I&#x27;ve had it a little while now and it&#x27;s still great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may be that I am used to epilating by now, but I find this model to be markedly less painful than the previous or others I&#x27;ve tried.  It&#x27;s slightly more efficient and generally I don&#x27;t have to make many passes to get rid of stubborn hairs.  My one real qualm, and this is one I&#x27;ve had with other brands, is that it&#x27;s actually pretty bad at getting those hairs &amp;#34;as close as 0.5 mm.&amp;#34;  Rather than pluck them, the tweezers tend to break them because the hairs are too fine at that point to get a decent grip on.  It&#x27;s a minor quibble but since it&#x27;s one of their big selling points, worth mentioning.  I do a pass every other day with it as habit and regrowth lessens all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real selling point though is the pivoting head.  That thing is so useful, not just because it makes it easier to use on curved parts of the body but because it&#x27;s SO MUCH EASIER TO CLEAN.  You take the shield off the head and have access to the entire tweezer roller!  No plucking little piles of hair out of the corners of the device, no shaking the thing repeatedly to get all the hairs out of the back.  Open it up, shake or rinse it out and you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re new to epilating, I still recommend an Azulene Oil for aftercare (preferred Parissa as it is non-greasy and odorless), but your preferred aftercare will do.  The legs do feel a little raw after an epilating session, sort of like a low-intensity rug burn.  Don&#x27;t try exfoliating your skin until a day later.  Exfoliating and an aftercare product will help prevent ingrown hair.</li>
            <li> I love this item!  Yes, I was afraid...afraid of the pain that is.  But I decided to bight the bullet and I&#x27;m thrilled that I did.  Yes, it hurts and it hurts a lot. especially the first time.  But once I got passed the initial pain the endorphins kicked in and I was good :)  Now, every time I use it it less and less painful.  I also have less and less hair each time it grows back.  And for the hair that does grow back, it is finer and lighter...no more five o&#x27;clock shadow on my legs...LOVE IT</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good and ergonomic.  I used the philips one before and I like it but this is even better. To me it&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does hurt.  But so did tweezing your eyebrows the first few times.  After a couple weeks of use, it starts getting easier.  It&#x27;s been a month now and my legs feel great.  I use it once a week now instead of shaving 3 times a week.  Eventually, this is supposed to work for months at a time without needing to epilate.  It feels well made and not flimsy in any area.  The ergonomics are great so it doesn&#x27;t strain your hand to use.  Overall, its a great product.  I wish it came with a soothing salve or wax for the first few uses.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using an epilator so I am going to try very hard to make this review about the epilator itself rather than a comparison between using a razor or using an epilator. First of all, for me the pain was intense.. I&#x27;m not sure if this because it was my first time or not but I tried it on gentle and it was still VERY painful, secondly; it didn&#x27;t remove all the hair on the first pass through, which was unfortunate because of my first point. Those were the two main problems I had with it. I am very sensitive to pain so if you aren&#x27;t you might be ok with this, but I still would expect it to pull all hair the first time through... maybe it just takes practice? But this is supposed to be a good epilator for new users so I found it unacceptable. Because of that, I couldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> I bought this model to replace my Braun 5270 epilator that had worn out.&lt;br /&gt;I was so disappointed I resold it on ebay and bought a new 5270 again.&lt;br /&gt;While it epilates well enough, the model design is seriously flawed in comparison to the 5270.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Cord does NOT stay plugged into the base, slips out very easily.&lt;br /&gt;The dial to turn it on (settings low and high and off) is horrible and easily overshoots to the opposite setting.&lt;br /&gt;Claims to have a pivoting head; this is false, the CAP that fits over the tweezer wheel pivotes, but not the actual tweezer head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Shape of the unit fits nicely in the hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, don&#x27;t waste your money on the elongated version of this model. Perhaps the smaller, more egg shaped one would be better.</li>
            <li> So far, so good - never had a Braun before - I had THE original Epilalady forever, until it just started to fall apart - loved it - I think this may be a step up.</li>
            <li> I got the previous Silk epil 5 before but it broke. So I got this one to replace it and I have to say that I preferred the other one.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the round control which looks nice but not nice to use and it looks working a little worse.&lt;br /&gt;But globally it does the job and I&#x27;m happy with it, just sad that I couldn&#x27;t find the other model anywhere :s</li>
