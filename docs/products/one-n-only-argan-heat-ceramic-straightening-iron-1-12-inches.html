            <li>I love it, thank you!</li>
            <li>i thought this worked amazingly for my hair type.</li>
            <li>It is amazing</li>

            <li>She liked it</li>
            <li>and i liked it for a while.</li>
            <li>I never thought I would be able to straighten my hair as good as my hair dresser.  </li>
            <li>but it had made my hair so nice and shiny.</li>
            <li>Kind of upset that it does not work on my hair texture.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even need it on a high heat setting for it to do a wonderful job.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Holds heat and tames frizzes, very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have used the CHI before too, but it works fine for 1 year and after it stops heating up as good as it did.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best straightener I have ever owned!</li>
            <li>I tried this out because my stylist told me it would be best for my natural hair.</li>
            <li>she says its best straightener she used by far</li>
            <li>The best by far and better</li>
            <li>I love the swivel and longer cord it has.  </li>
            <li>Okay I feel like I&#x27;m rambling now</li>
            <li>My recent haircut seems to require that I straighten it to make it look its best.  </li>
            <li>Better than the chi</li>
            <li>but with this lovely argan heat straightener I cut that time to 10mins</li>
            <li>I am so in love with this straightener.</li>
            <li>Just wish I wouldn&#x27;t gotten the 1&amp;#34; instead for more styling options</li>
            <li>I get the salon quality results without paying anyone to do something I can do myself at home :)</li>
            <li>Love being able to adjust the heat.  </li>
            <li>I love this straightening iron...</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>it came with and in most sections</li>
            <li>I wash my hair every week so that should be after 3-4 more uses.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I went with this one.  </li>
            <li>I love this straightening iron.</li>
            <li>(FHI was better).</li>
            <li>BUT, this one is better.</li>
            <li>more damaged.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s some magic in the plates</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s OK,  lesson learned.</li>
            <li>I like the Nano Titanium better than the argan oil infused.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Top of the line product for an inexpensive price.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product thinking more $$&#x3D;better product.</li>
            <li>It is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>no matter what setting, I&#x27;m glad this doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>My hair is swinging, bouncy, shiny and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair SO smooth and the argon oil it comes with is amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>my favorite amazon purchase i am soooo satisfied.</li>
            <li>these are better than a chi</li>
            <li>Great product fast delivery</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about the wider plates or the claim to have Organ oil infused in them.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair looking healthy.</li>

            <li>As of my first use its fairly good.</li>
            <li>Pretty good straightner for the price.</li>
            <li>Best thing I&#x27;ve bought in a long time.</li>
            <li>They asked what she was doing different to her hair and all she told them was that she got an awesome new argan infused straight iron for her birthday from her wonderful daughter.  </li>
            <li>It really did give me salon results without spending so much money :D</li>
            <li>Great product, this is by far my favorite straightener.</li>
            <li>That alone makes it a very special straightener indeed.</li>
            <li>, I am pleased with it so far, the argan oil has a very nice smell to it</li>
            <li>I love the heat settings on this iron, bcz I have fine hair</li>
            <li>My daughter has the longest most beautiful red hair.</li>
            <li>and so far she is happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Despite all these cons I still had to give 4 stars cuz it does work well, which is the most important thing.</li>
            <li>This one has been great so far</li>
            <li>Very well priced for a good quality product</li>
            <li>Also, one teardrop full of the argan oil that comes with the straightener and your hair feels like silk!</li>
            <li>OK, so first of all, the prime shipped it next day and the price is awesome!</li>
            <li>Easy to control.</li>
            <li>The iron heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li>This straightener was so easy to straighten my hair</li>
            <li>This iron also isn&#x27;t as easy to comb case</li>
            <li>to get my hair sort of straightened, however, it puffs soooo easy.</li>
            <li>Falls over easily which could result in some stuff getting melted.</li>
            <li>This iron is great, it gets really hot very quickly and stays hot throughout use.</li>
            <li>I read alot of good rewiews before i bought this hair straightener, and i really expected this to be a really good iron.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK,  nothing special.</li>
            <li>I love al the Babyliss Line, specially the Babyliss Pro Nano Titanium, but</li>
            <li>Ecellent, thank you very much!!</li>
            <li>Great flat iron, heats up quickly, does a great job of straightening my naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>it leaves it feeling shiny, silky, and smooth.</li>
            <li>and it worked fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It also pulled and didn&#x27;t glide smoothly over my hair.</li>
            <li>Goes thru my hair like butter and soooo smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing straight iron for the price...</li>
            <li>my hair looks fantastic</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and leaves my hair feeling nice and silky.</li>
            <li>Feels cheap.</li>
            <li>In no time my hair goes from frizzy and UN manageable to silky smooth.</li>
            <li>It burns your hair and does not make it silky smooth like the CHI products do.</li>
            <li>This straightner works great, I have really coarse hair</li>
            <li>and so far so good.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not as good as the professional brands.</li>
            <li>Got nice and hot quickly, but didn&#x27;t like the snagging/pulling feeling.</li>
            <li>Flat iron, works really good love</li>
            <li>this flat iron wasnt great..</li>
            <li>It does the job quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li>At first I was sceptical about this straightener because I didn&#x27;t know the brand, but I am completely in love with it.</li>
            <li>Love this straight iron!</li>
            <li>After the first time she used it, she went to a function and friends were touching her hair.</li>
            <li>and I get very smooth and straight hair.  </li>
            <li>This is the best investment I have made as far as flat irons.</li>
            <li>The best flat iron I&#x27;ve owned so far.</li>
            <li>This is great because my hair is very dry and curly.  </li>
            <li>Works better than chi the setting make it really.</li>
            <li>but im gunna use it for a month then write a full review.</li>
            <li>I have thick curly hair and this Straightener does the job perfectly every time.</li>
            <li>You know how you find a good thing, and it&#x27;s suddenly discontinued.</li>
            <li>Ok but not as good as the Chi straightener we had previously.</li>
            <li>This is an exceptional high quality product for a very affordable price.  </li>
            <li>very smooth iron pad with a nice pink color.</li>
            <li>I had not heard of this brand but went with it for the other great reviews.</li>
            <li>but I got used to it quickly and stopped snagging my hair about halfway through.</li>
            <li>It heated up quickly.</li>
            <li>It heated up quickly and gave my hair a sleek, finished look.</li>
            <li>adequately-  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get very hot.</li>
            <li>Heats up very fast !</li>
            <li>:) They couldn&#x27;t believe how flat and shiny looking it was and after touching, they couldn&#x27;t believe how silky it was.  </li>
            <li>I love this flat iron, ordered on amazon about two years ago and its still working and up to standards :)</li>
            <li>does it get hot!  </li>
            <li>She definitely wanted a new one, and it was a great replacement.</li>
            <li>This gets your hair super straight and smooth without damaging it</li>
            <li>I bought mine a few months ago and it is still working great.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair so smooth and straight.</li>
            <li>It works but not as amazing as my last one.</li>
            <li>My hair is natural &amp; COMPLETELY out of control, I always think of my hair texture as 5d lol, but this iron got my hair almost bone straight with just ONE pass yesterday.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping was the only good thing.</li>
            <li>A gentleman was kind enough to give me a demonstration.  </li>
            <li>the argon oil  makes it soft and healthy looking without being too oily (trust</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I Bought this Amazing Flat Iron, on Ulta.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical when I bought this, but I have to say I LOVE LOVE LOVE this straightener!</li>
            <li>The ceramic head does a great job in smoothing my hair with very little work.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and it heats up very fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Heats up fast, and straightens my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>very sturdy quality and make my hair staight very fast!</li>
            <li>for me its half the price so that is a pretty good value/rating.  </li>
            <li>Gets hot fast and stays hot!  </li>
            <li>I wanted it at 25 at first</li>
            <li>but it gets suuuper HOT.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still freaking straight!</li>
            <li>level 24 was way too hot for my hair</li>
            <li>Just received mine today and tried it out for the first time…</li>
            <li>And I noticed the iron curled pretty well</li>
            <li>love my One &#x27;n Only hair care products.</li>
            <li>(plus it is pretty inexpensive).  </li>
            <li>Made my hair too hot that it burnt my fingers.  </li>
            <li>, I have not had any electrical product in the last 15-20 years that doesn&#x27;t automatically shut off after not being used for 10 minutes, so make sure you&#x27;re turning this off when you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li>First time trying it today</li>
            <li>It also can get fairly hot depending on what level you put it on though the handle and edges never do.</li>
            <li>Love this product but have only had it 6 months</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>My hair is sooo shiny and straight!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the higher temperature or the thinner plates</li>
            <li>and I am considering ordering more of the oil in the future.</li>
            <li>Very prompt!</li>
            <li>It works great on my thick, course hair.</li>

            <li>I did fry my bangs the first time I used this iron because I used too much of the sample product that came with</li>
            <li>My youngest doesn&#x27;t cry because the iron glides through her hair without snagging and her hair comes straight the first time through.</li>
            <li>The sample of argan oil was underwhelming and had leaked inside the box, but really that&#x27;s not why I bought this iron in the first place.  </li>
            <li>so Im sure people with coarse or really curly hair would have no problem getting it straight with this.</li>
            <li>I have thick, wavy hair and this flat iron works great!  </li>
            <li>I have never been able to have the gorgeous, pin-straight hair because I was cursed with thick, wavy, coarse hair that refuses to be tamed.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a chi, sedu, and cheap walmart flat irons in the past, and honestly this one gets hotter than all of them!</li>
            <li>But the hair IS super soft after using this.</li>
            <li>First the material looks like its made of plastic (cheap) and second when i turned it on, there came this smell, and when i straightened my hair there came alot of smoke out.</li>
            <li>Not wanting to spend a large amount of money of a fancy-schmancy one, I just used a large curling iron to straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li>i love these they straighten my hair better than any other flat iron I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do not use too much argan oil and make sure hair is completely dry.</li>
            <li>It does come with a little argan oil that you put in your own hair as an added bonus.  </li>
            <li>Also, i suggest adding a little of the argan oil to your hair when its damp, it really adds a nice shine.</li>
            <li>I love my new flat iron &amp; I</li>
            <li>Purchased for my Granddaughter and she Highly Recommends this product!</li>
            <li>Thanks for the fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I had the chi nano which didnt hold up very well after a years</li>
            <li>It feels like quality, hears up fairly fast, and has adjustable heat.</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s actually really fast because it would take me three hours to straighten my hair with the walmart brand.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>much maybe once</li>
            <li>It heats up really fast with just one push of a button.  </li>
            <li>My hair is straight laid.</li>
            <li>When I used this iron it made my hair very oily looking.  </li>
            <li>My hair was salon straight with one pass.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly and course hair.</li>
            <li>This straightener works very well</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend this to anyone that wants straight and smooth hair.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my sister, her hair looks perfectly straight after using this</li>
            <li>I really like it...</li>
            <li>It heats up and is ready to use within a minute and boy</li>
            <li>and I love the way it heats up in about 45 sec.</li>
            <li>My eldest&#x27;s hair stayed straight for two weeks and had the prettiest shine.</li>
            <li>but it left it feeling soft and frizz free!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used CHI irons, and the ones I&#x27;ve purchased lately haven&#x27;t been heating up good.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different flat irons, and I love this one, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t beat the price for such an amazing flat iron.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t know if it is normal!</li>
            <li>People compliment me left and right about how shiny and pretty my hair is since I started using this iron.</li>
            <li>I am African amer, cool product.</li>
            <li>If any of you are considering a new hair straightener-this is the one!  </li>
            <li>I previously had a name brand flat iron that I loved, but it broke.  </li>
            <li>less frizz and more shine versus my chi</li>
            <li>I previously had a CHI which I had for many years until it broke.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase more when the sample gets low.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair very straight, healthy and shine, won&#x27;t burn my ends which was my major concern from the previous I bought at the mall and cheaper</li>
            <li>It does get very,very hot, but the plates don&#x27;t have enough weight to really smooth my hair, which is coarse.</li>
            <li>Works good for thick wavy/curly (and in my case, unmanageable) hair!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many straighteners and hair products trying to find the right products for my thick &amp; curly, frizzy hair</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Just wasn&#x27;t a great flat iron for my thick curly hair.</li>
            <li>One of the best flat irons out there and believe me I have been buying expensive one to the cheapest.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair so soft!!</li>
            <li>I always gave up doing my hair because my hair is extremely thick and long, but this flat iron is amazing!!!!  </li>
            <li>63 year old mom wants one for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t use the flat iron much and it already stopped working!!</li>
            <li>Overall, I really like the product though and would certainly buy again.</li>
            <li>Well... I never encountered such high technology that didn&#x27;t work from first time use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I live it........</li>
            <li>I purchased mine about 3 years ago and it still works like new . .</li>
            <li>This flat iron heats up quickly and doesn&#x27;t snag my hair like my old one did.</li>
            <li>The little bottle of Argan Oil is nice too, as I can smooth down the frizz that the flat iron can&#x27;t reach at the part of my hair.  </li>
            <li>It heats up in the stated 30 seconds and the heat controls are exact for the various textures of hair listed.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it to anybody who wants to straighten hair!</li>
            <li>First off I was using a chi straightener but wanted to try something else since my current straightener was frying my hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;It gets hot enough</li>
            <li>I put off making a purchase because I did not want to overprocess my hair with the hot iron using it daily, but I don&#x27;t have to.  </li>
            <li>It gets hot enough to burn my hair but it doesn&#x27;t straighten it well or leave it shiny.</li>
            <li>I have only had the cheap flat irons that you can buy at places like Wal-mart.  </li>
            <li>I had the Chi at home back in Mexico and is good, but this one is much les expensive and leaves my hair very silky</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for weeks and have only had positive results.  </li>
            <li>This was my first flat iron</li>
            <li>My hair has been soft and smooth (and straight) all day with no frizz or kinks like I usually get when straightening my hair.</li>
            <li>With the 1 1/2 inch straightening iron, it significantly cut down the styling time.  </li>
            <li>I have been flat ironing (several passes) and then using the old fashioned pressing comb (I know right!)</li>
            <li>She loves how passed through her hair smoothly, and it a little hotter than the one she has.</li>
            <li>I have used Chi for years and this flat iron is half the price and works 100xs better.</li>
            <li>Love it, and it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair like previous flat irons have done.</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy to curly hair.  </li>
            <li>It has held up well so far for her</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft, and silky.  </li>
            <li>so naturally I have problems getting my hair how I want it.</li>
            <li>I have natural wavy and frizzy hair, so this straightener does its job.</li>
            <li>It took only one pass each section of hair to get it straight and another pass to curl it.</li>
            <li>so I did a considerable amount of research before buying.  </li>
            <li>Once I got mine set, I just went ahead and marked the dial with a sharpie marker</li>
            <li>We are all natural, myself and my oldest have 4c/d texture,</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s actually staying straight instead of poofing right back up two hours later.</li>
            <li>I have natural fine blond hair with just a small amount of natural wave.  </li>
            <li>my hair is curly this flat iron I straighten my hair go out in the heat still straight.  </li>
            <li>Ok, I previously always bought the more expensive professional brands..like FHI, and I think I owned a CHI once</li>
            <li>My hair is smooth, shiny, and fabulous usually until the end of the day with little or no other products used (except when it rains, nothing can save me then).  </li>
            <li>The plate came loose and it won&#x27;t even warm up such a waste of money</li>
            <li>The straightness and shine last through humidity and even light rain like my previous one never did.  </li>
            <li>so i really hope it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since using this straightener, my hair is long, straight, and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected from the picture to the delivered product.</li>
            <li>It gets hot enough to make my hair smoother than any flat iron I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I have super thick (about 3 heads worth I am told) and long hair.  </li>
            <li>I got this iron a few days ago and tried it out for the first time yesterday and went out in the high humidity air of a Trinidad evening.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I have never gone past the first setting as it&#x27;s hot enough to straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I bought this iron--and this is coming from someone with thick, wavy, and frizzy hair!</li>
            <li>The iron does not heat up high enough to straighten my normal, not real wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this iron for awhile now but within the last year I decided to do natural.</li>
            <li>Went back to my old straightener.</li>
            <li>It works so well that my 13 year old used it all the time that I finally had to buy her one and</li>
            <li>It did not heat up enough to work for my thick hair, maybe it works better on different types of hair.</li>
            <li>I have really thick curly hair and my original flat iron was breaking and had to get a new one saw this one</li>
            <li>the plates glide easier and its half the weight..makes my hair which is coarse and bleached much softer with less effort and passes..use with a few drops of argan oil amazing results..</li>
            <li>It is super thick and has lots of natural curl.  </li>
            <li>I thought this hot iron would do less damage to my hair but that was not the result.</li>
            <li>by far my fav flat iron</li>
            <li>It even provides a nice subtle under curl at the bottom due to the width of the plates; and because of the heat output, it&#x27;s essentially a one pass iron.  </li>
            <li>And with my last one It broke (unfortunately ) I was excited at first because everyone gassed the iron up on the review.</li>
            <li>Next, I have been natural for 2 years (had the big chop) and my hair loves to revert to its teenie tiny spiral curls at even the slightest blow of wind.</li>
            <li>No other flat iron compares to this one.</li>
            <li>Gets very hot which works well with my thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of natural wave, especially when I left it air dry.  </li>

            <li> But this straightening iron is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Price is Amazing as well.</li>
            <li> She liked it</li>
            <li> and i liked it for a while.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would be able to straighten my hair as good as my hair dresser.  </li>
            <li> but it had made my hair so nice and shiny.</li>
            <li> Kind of upset that it does not work on my hair texture.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even need it on a high heat setting for it to do a wonderful job.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Holds heat and tames frizzes, very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have used the CHI before too, but it works fine for 1 year and after it stops heating up as good as it did.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best straightener I have ever owned!</li>
            <li> I tried this out because my stylist told me it would be best for my natural hair.</li>
            <li> she says its best straightener she used by far</li>
            <li> The best by far and better</li>
            <li> I love the swivel and longer cord it has.  </li>
            <li> Okay I feel like I&#x27;m rambling now</li>
            <li> My recent haircut seems to require that I straighten it to make it look its best.  </li>
            <li> Better than the chi</li>
            <li> but with this lovely argan heat straightener I cut that time to 10mins</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this straightener.</li>
            <li> Just wish I wouldn&#x27;t gotten the 1&amp;#34; instead for more styling options</li>
            <li> I get the salon quality results without paying anyone to do something I can do myself at home :)</li>
            <li> Love being able to adjust the heat.  </li>
            <li> I love this straightening iron...</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li> it came with and in most sections</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every week so that should be after 3-4 more uses.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I went with this one.  </li>
            <li> I love this straightening iron.</li>
            <li> (FHI was better).</li>
            <li> BUT, this one is better.</li>
            <li> more damaged.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s some magic in the plates</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s OK,  lesson learned.</li>
            <li> I like the Nano Titanium better than the argan oil infused.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Top of the line product for an inexpensive price.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product thinking more $$&#x3D;better product.</li>
            <li> It is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> no matter what setting, I&#x27;m glad this doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> My hair is swinging, bouncy, shiny and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair SO smooth and the argon oil it comes with is amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> my favorite amazon purchase i am soooo satisfied.</li>
            <li> these are better than a chi</li>
            <li> Great product fast delivery</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about the wider plates or the claim to have Organ oil infused in them.</li>
            <li> :)</li>

            <li> I have purchased many of flat irons over the years and this is the best one to-date.  </li>
            <li> Love my flat iron it works great!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very excited to receive this hair straightener.</li>
            <li> but this flat iron works great!</li>
            <li> Best flat iron I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> Excellent flat iron.</li>

            <li> Very HAPPY with my purchased Flat iron!</li>
            <li> Heats up quick and my hair looks better than ever!</li>
            <li> As of my first use its fairly good.</li>
            <li> Pretty good straightner for the price.</li>
            <li> Best thing I&#x27;ve bought in a long time.</li>
            <li> They asked what she was doing different to her hair and all she told them was that she got an awesome new argan infused straight iron for her birthday from her wonderful daughter.  </li>
            <li> It really did give me salon results without spending so much money :D</li>
            <li> Great product, this is by far my favorite straightener.</li>
            <li> That alone makes it a very special straightener indeed.</li>
            <li> , I am pleased with it so far, the argan oil has a very nice smell to it</li>
            <li> I love the heat settings on this iron, bcz I have fine hair</li>
            <li> My daughter has the longest most beautiful red hair.</li>
            <li> and so far she is happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Despite all these cons I still had to give 4 stars cuz it does work well, which is the most important thing.</li>
            <li> This one has been great so far</li>
            <li> Very well priced for a good quality product</li>
            <li> Also, one teardrop full of the argan oil that comes with the straightener and your hair feels like silk!</li>
            <li> OK, so first of all, the prime shipped it next day and the price is awesome!</li>
            <li> Easy to control.</li>
            <li> The iron heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li> This straightener was so easy to straighten my hair</li>
            <li> This iron also isn&#x27;t as easy to comb case</li>
            <li> to get my hair sort of straightened, however, it puffs soooo easy.</li>
            <li> Falls over easily which could result in some stuff getting melted.</li>
            <li> This iron is great, it gets really hot very quickly and stays hot throughout use.</li>
            <li> I read alot of good rewiews before i bought this hair straightener, and i really expected this to be a really good iron.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK,  nothing special.</li>
            <li> I love al the Babyliss Line, specially the Babyliss Pro Nano Titanium, but</li>
            <li> Ecellent, thank you very much!!</li>
            <li> Great flat iron, heats up quickly, does a great job of straightening my naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> it leaves it feeling shiny, silky, and smooth.</li>
            <li> and it worked fantastic.  </li>
            <li> It also pulled and didn&#x27;t glide smoothly over my hair.</li>
            <li> Goes thru my hair like butter and soooo smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing straight iron for the price...</li>
            <li> my hair looks fantastic</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and leaves my hair feeling nice and silky.</li>
            <li> Feels cheap.</li>
            <li> In no time my hair goes from frizzy and UN manageable to silky smooth.</li>
            <li> It burns your hair and does not make it silky smooth like the CHI products do.</li>
            <li> This straightner works great, I have really coarse hair</li>
            <li> and so far so good.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not as good as the professional brands.</li>
            <li> Got nice and hot quickly, but didn&#x27;t like the snagging/pulling feeling.</li>
            <li> Flat iron, works really good love</li>
            <li> this flat iron wasnt great..</li>
            <li> It does the job quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li> At first I was sceptical about this straightener because I didn&#x27;t know the brand, but I am completely in love with it.</li>
            <li> Love this straight iron!</li>
            <li> After the first time she used it, she went to a function and friends were touching her hair.</li>
            <li> and I get very smooth and straight hair.  </li>
            <li> This is the best investment I have made as far as flat irons.</li>
            <li> The best flat iron I&#x27;ve owned so far.</li>
            <li> This is great because my hair is very dry and curly.  </li>
            <li> Works better than chi the setting make it really.</li>
            <li> but im gunna use it for a month then write a full review.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and this Straightener does the job perfectly every time.</li>
            <li> You know how you find a good thing, and it&#x27;s suddenly discontinued.</li>
            <li> Ok but not as good as the Chi straightener we had previously.</li>
            <li> This is an exceptional high quality product for a very affordable price.  </li>
            <li> very smooth iron pad with a nice pink color.</li>
            <li> I had not heard of this brand but went with it for the other great reviews.</li>
            <li> but I got used to it quickly and stopped snagging my hair about halfway through.</li>
            <li> It heated up quickly.</li>
            <li> It heated up quickly and gave my hair a sleek, finished look.</li>
            <li> adequately-  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get very hot.</li>
            <li> Heats up very fast !</li>
            <li> :) They couldn&#x27;t believe how flat and shiny looking it was and after touching, they couldn&#x27;t believe how silky it was.  </li>
            <li> I love this flat iron, ordered on amazon about two years ago and its still working and up to standards :)</li>
            <li> does it get hot!  </li>
            <li> She definitely wanted a new one, and it was a great replacement.</li>
            <li> This gets your hair super straight and smooth without damaging it</li>
            <li> I bought mine a few months ago and it is still working great.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair so smooth and straight.</li>
            <li> It works but not as amazing as my last one.</li>
            <li> My hair is natural &amp; COMPLETELY out of control, I always think of my hair texture as 5d lol, but this iron got my hair almost bone straight with just ONE pass yesterday.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping was the only good thing.</li>
            <li> A gentleman was kind enough to give me a demonstration.  </li>
            <li> the argon oil  makes it soft and healthy looking without being too oily (trust</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I Bought this Amazing Flat Iron, on Ulta.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I bought this, but I have to say I LOVE LOVE LOVE this straightener!</li>
            <li> The ceramic head does a great job in smoothing my hair with very little work.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and it heats up very fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Heats up fast, and straightens my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> very sturdy quality and make my hair staight very fast!</li>
            <li> for me its half the price so that is a pretty good value/rating.  </li>
            <li> Gets hot fast and stays hot!  </li>
            <li> I wanted it at 25 at first</li>
            <li> but it gets suuuper HOT.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still freaking straight!</li>
            <li> level 24 was way too hot for my hair</li>
            <li> Just received mine today and tried it out for the first time…</li>
            <li> And I noticed the iron curled pretty well</li>
            <li> love my One &#x27;n Only hair care products.</li>
            <li> (plus it is pretty inexpensive).  </li>
            <li> Made my hair too hot that it burnt my fingers.  </li>
            <li> , I have not had any electrical product in the last 15-20 years that doesn&#x27;t automatically shut off after not being used for 10 minutes, so make sure you&#x27;re turning this off when you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> First time trying it today</li>
            <li> It also can get fairly hot depending on what level you put it on though the handle and edges never do.</li>
            <li> Love this product but have only had it 6 months</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> My hair is sooo shiny and straight!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the higher temperature or the thinner plates</li>
            <li> and I am considering ordering more of the oil in the future.</li>
            <li> Very prompt!</li>
            <li> It works great on my thick, course hair.</li>
            <li> Initially, I was quite pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Initially, I was quite pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder blade length, thicker wavy hair, and this does an excellent job smoothing and straightening my weird cowlicks.</li>
            <li> The result wasen´t good either, my hair felt dried.</li>
            <li> I had the chance to use it myself and my hair was straight, styled &amp; beautiful in less time than my professional series.  </li>
            <li> This flat iron has been able to straighten my hair in one stroke, and it&#x27;s smooth soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just so excited that it feels so soft</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I am seriously in love with this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron!</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron!!</li>
            <li> It glides through my hair very well and leaves it very straight.  </li>
            <li> Heats up quick and leaves your hair feeling so soft!</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron!!!  </li>
            <li> I have very curly hair (3c/4a curls to be exact)</li>
            <li> I did fry my bangs the first time I used this iron because I used too much of the sample product that came with</li>
            <li> My youngest doesn&#x27;t cry because the iron glides through her hair without snagging and her hair comes straight the first time through.</li>
            <li> The sample of argan oil was underwhelming and had leaked inside the box, but really that&#x27;s not why I bought this iron in the first place.  </li>
            <li> so Im sure people with coarse or really curly hair would have no problem getting it straight with this.</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair and this flat iron works great!  </li>
            <li> I have never been able to have the gorgeous, pin-straight hair because I was cursed with thick, wavy, coarse hair that refuses to be tamed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a chi, sedu, and cheap walmart flat irons in the past, and honestly this one gets hotter than all of them!</li>
            <li> But the hair IS super soft after using this.</li>
            <li> First the material looks like its made of plastic (cheap) and second when i turned it on, there came this smell, and when i straightened my hair there came alot of smoke out.</li>
            <li> Not wanting to spend a large amount of money of a fancy-schmancy one, I just used a large curling iron to straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li> i love these they straighten my hair better than any other flat iron I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do not use too much argan oil and make sure hair is completely dry.</li>
            <li> It does come with a little argan oil that you put in your own hair as an added bonus.  </li>
            <li> Also, i suggest adding a little of the argan oil to your hair when its damp, it really adds a nice shine.</li>
            <li> I love my new flat iron &amp; I</li>
            <li> Purchased for my Granddaughter and she Highly Recommends this product!</li>
            <li> Thanks for the fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I had the chi nano which didnt hold up very well after a years</li>
            <li> It feels like quality, hears up fairly fast, and has adjustable heat.</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s actually really fast because it would take me three hours to straighten my hair with the walmart brand.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> much maybe once</li>
            <li> It heats up really fast with just one push of a button.  </li>
            <li> My hair is straight laid.</li>
            <li> When I used this iron it made my hair very oily looking.  </li>
            <li> My hair was salon straight with one pass.  </li>
            <li> I have very curly and course hair.</li>
            <li> This straightener works very well</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend this to anyone that wants straight and smooth hair.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister, her hair looks perfectly straight after using this</li>
            <li> I really like it...</li>
            <li> It heats up and is ready to use within a minute and boy</li>
            <li> and I love the way it heats up in about 45 sec.</li>
            <li> My eldest&#x27;s hair stayed straight for two weeks and had the prettiest shine.</li>
            <li> but it left it feeling soft and frizz free!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used CHI irons, and the ones I&#x27;ve purchased lately haven&#x27;t been heating up good.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different flat irons, and I love this one, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price for such an amazing flat iron.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t know if it is normal!</li>
            <li> People compliment me left and right about how shiny and pretty my hair is since I started using this iron.</li>
            <li> I am African amer, cool product.</li>
            <li> If any of you are considering a new hair straightener-this is the one!  </li>
            <li> I previously had a name brand flat iron that I loved, but it broke.  </li>
            <li> less frizz and more shine versus my chi</li>
            <li> I previously had a CHI which I had for many years until it broke.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase more when the sample gets low.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair very straight, healthy and shine, won&#x27;t burn my ends which was my major concern from the previous I bought at the mall and cheaper</li>
            <li> It does get very,very hot, but the plates don&#x27;t have enough weight to really smooth my hair, which is coarse.</li>
            <li> Works good for thick wavy/curly (and in my case, unmanageable) hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many straighteners and hair products trying to find the right products for my thick &amp; curly, frizzy hair</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Just wasn&#x27;t a great flat iron for my thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> One of the best flat irons out there and believe me I have been buying expensive one to the cheapest.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair so soft!!</li>
            <li> I always gave up doing my hair because my hair is extremely thick and long, but this flat iron is amazing!!!!  </li>
            <li> 63 year old mom wants one for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t use the flat iron much and it already stopped working!!</li>
            <li> Overall, I really like the product though and would certainly buy again.</li>
            <li> Well... I never encountered such high technology that didn&#x27;t work from first time use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I live it........</li>
            <li> I purchased mine about 3 years ago and it still works like new . .</li>
            <li> This flat iron heats up quickly and doesn&#x27;t snag my hair like my old one did.</li>
            <li> The little bottle of Argan Oil is nice too, as I can smooth down the frizz that the flat iron can&#x27;t reach at the part of my hair.  </li>
            <li> It heats up in the stated 30 seconds and the heat controls are exact for the various textures of hair listed.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it to anybody who wants to straighten hair!</li>
            <li> First off I was using a chi straightener but wanted to try something else since my current straightener was frying my hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;It gets hot enough</li>
            <li> I put off making a purchase because I did not want to overprocess my hair with the hot iron using it daily, but I don&#x27;t have to.  </li>
            <li> It gets hot enough to burn my hair but it doesn&#x27;t straighten it well or leave it shiny.</li>
            <li> I have only had the cheap flat irons that you can buy at places like Wal-mart.  </li>
            <li> I had the Chi at home back in Mexico and is good, but this one is much les expensive and leaves my hair very silky</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for weeks and have only had positive results.  </li>
            <li> This was my first flat iron</li>
            <li> My hair has been soft and smooth (and straight) all day with no frizz or kinks like I usually get when straightening my hair.</li>
            <li> With the 1 1/2 inch straightening iron, it significantly cut down the styling time.  </li>
            <li> I have been flat ironing (several passes) and then using the old fashioned pressing comb (I know right!)</li>
            <li> She loves how passed through her hair smoothly, and it a little hotter than the one she has.</li>
            <li> I have used Chi for years and this flat iron is half the price and works 100xs better.</li>
            <li> Love it, and it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair like previous flat irons have done.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy to curly hair.  </li>
            <li> It has held up well so far for her</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft, and silky.  </li>
            <li> so naturally I have problems getting my hair how I want it.</li>
            <li> I have natural wavy and frizzy hair, so this straightener does its job.</li>
            <li> It took only one pass each section of hair to get it straight and another pass to curl it.</li>
            <li> so I did a considerable amount of research before buying.  </li>
            <li> Once I got mine set, I just went ahead and marked the dial with a sharpie marker</li>
            <li> We are all natural, myself and my oldest have 4c/d texture,</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s actually staying straight instead of poofing right back up two hours later.</li>
            <li> I have natural fine blond hair with just a small amount of natural wave.  </li>
            <li> my hair is curly this flat iron I straighten my hair go out in the heat still straight.  </li>
            <li> Ok, I previously always bought the more expensive professional brands..like FHI, and I think I owned a CHI once</li>
            <li> My hair is smooth, shiny, and fabulous usually until the end of the day with little or no other products used (except when it rains, nothing can save me then).  </li>
            <li> The plate came loose and it won&#x27;t even warm up such a waste of money</li>
            <li> The straightness and shine last through humidity and even light rain like my previous one never did.  </li>
            <li> so i really hope it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since using this straightener, my hair is long, straight, and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected from the picture to the delivered product.</li>
            <li> It gets hot enough to make my hair smoother than any flat iron I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I have super thick (about 3 heads worth I am told) and long hair.  </li>
            <li> I got this iron a few days ago and tried it out for the first time yesterday and went out in the high humidity air of a Trinidad evening.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I have never gone past the first setting as it&#x27;s hot enough to straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I bought this iron--and this is coming from someone with thick, wavy, and frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> The iron does not heat up high enough to straighten my normal, not real wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this iron for awhile now but within the last year I decided to do natural.</li>
            <li> Went back to my old straightener.</li>
            <li> It works so well that my 13 year old used it all the time that I finally had to buy her one and</li>
            <li> It did not heat up enough to work for my thick hair, maybe it works better on different types of hair.</li>
            <li> I have really thick curly hair and my original flat iron was breaking and had to get a new one saw this one</li>
            <li> the plates glide easier and its half the weight..makes my hair which is coarse and bleached much softer with less effort and passes..use with a few drops of argan oil amazing results..</li>
            <li> It is super thick and has lots of natural curl.  </li>
            <li> I thought this hot iron would do less damage to my hair but that was not the result.</li>
            <li> by far my fav flat iron</li>
            <li> It even provides a nice subtle under curl at the bottom due to the width of the plates; and because of the heat output, it&#x27;s essentially a one pass iron.  </li>
            <li> And with my last one It broke (unfortunately ) I was excited at first because everyone gassed the iron up on the review.</li>
            <li> Next, I have been natural for 2 years (had the big chop) and my hair loves to revert to its teenie tiny spiral curls at even the slightest blow of wind.</li>
            <li> No other flat iron compares to this one.</li>
            <li> Gets very hot which works well with my thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of natural wave, especially when I left it air dry.  </li>
            <li> I only needed a new one because I dropped mine on really hard concrete.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several standard, find them anywhere, $20-$30 flat irons.  </li>
            <li> When I blow dry my hair or when I let it dry naturally, I always go over it again with this tool.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron to replace my 2nd Chi that died after 2 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent years just being disappointed in every straightener I&#x27;ve owned, &amp; I&#x27;m sooo happy I made this investment.</li>
            <li> an im left with long silky hair frfr</li>
            <li> I can do one pass with this flat iron</li>
            <li> I loooveeee this flat iron...</li>
            <li> I have had to make a couple of adjustments with this flat iron to recieve optimal results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also had to eliminate my flip at the ends style with this flat iron.</li>
            <li> but I could smell my hair burning with this flat iron when I would try to add a curl or flip to the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> I just received this flat iron today.  </li>
            <li> I can flat iron both my daughter&#x27;s in about an hour, that had never happened before.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see how anyone could give this a bad review, since I have the most obnoxiously unruly hair and it comes out nearly</li>
            <li> I only used this product twice a week, I expected it would last longer than it did.</li>
            <li> This iron did my whole head of BSL hair in less than 45 minutes and it was not blow dried straight beforehand but was dried with the diffuser.</li>
            <li> I have thick very frizzy curly hair (I&#x27;m mixed)</li>
            <li> The one n only straightens my hair with one single pass opposed to my Chi that took a couple of passes.</li>
            <li> I went to hot and permanently straightened a very small portion (thank god) of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After 6 months the plates started coming loose and left an odor on my hair.</li>
            <li> This is the second flat iron I have owned, the other one being a conair 2 in 1 1.5 inch barrel curling iron and flat iron that I have owned for 3 years but now takes forever to heat up</li>
            <li> the cord is long so you can move about if you need to.  </li>
            <li> I wish I would have bought this a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I have long, and curly hair</li>
            <li> The straightening iron keeps my thick hair straight between shampoos (3 or 4 days) without having to touch it up.  </li>
            <li> I have thick wavy frizzy hair and this makes my hair straight and shiny.</li>
            <li> I had no real experience with a flat iron</li>
            <li> I bought this after owning a Chi and several other devices.</li>
            <li> if you are someone with frizzy or dry hair</li>
            <li> After she washes her hair it used to take her 2 hours just to dry and style her hair.  </li>
            <li> There is one little con though; it can catch and snag your a bit if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> I usually buy less expensive and thought I&#x27;d try a more expensive iron and get better results.</li>
            <li> The argan oil infusion seems to be working :) I&#x27;m not sure how it&#x27;s infused in the plates (still a bit skeptical about that)</li>
            <li> I have been through three expensive straighteners in the past five years and this one is my favorite</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really used to 1.5 inch irons</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a few months</li>
            <li> I bought this to straighten my 4b 4c hair and with some creme press all I can say is be careful....</li>
            <li> However, after only a few weeks, it did not heat</li>
            <li> I have the curliest, tightest hair that is thick but soft.  </li>
            <li> We are telling everyone about it and highly recommend it for all hair types but especially thick and naturally curly hair!</li>
            <li> So I have wavy thick hair normally straightening my hair takes half an hour</li>
            <li> And Im half white and black</li>
            <li> Seriously, don&#x27;t waste your time with a $100-180 flat iron.</li>
            <li> Before this we had to take an iron to it every other day if she was careful to not sweat and stay away from moisture.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that with my Chi I had a lap full of broken hair that I have not experienced with the one n only.</li>
            <li> I always have trouble getting to the roots without burning myself, but with this flat iron i can get extremely close without burns.</li>
            <li> i have dry, frizzy, thick hair and its styled in a short bob.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a Babyliss Pro Extreme, and the lady in the beauty supply said they didn&#x27;t have any.  </li>
            <li> hair usually takes over an hour to straighten and with this one it only takes my 30 mins!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> but sometimes it sounds weird when it&#x27;s hot</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t damage or &amp;#34;fry&amp;#34; hair like other straighteners.  </li>
            <li> I personally have the expensive professional Babyliss straightener</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not worth the money I payed.</li>
            <li> I have really thick curly hair and it took only 45 minutes without the oil they included.</li>
            <li> I am a mixed girl with thick semi curly frizzy poofy hair</li>
            <li> and when it does and is in use it cools down  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned other straighteners before with all sorts of heat pads on them, none have ever worked as well as this little fella.  </li>
            <li> I thought I would never find anything comparable and less money.  </li>
            <li> I was prepared to spend $100 on another Chi when I discovered this one for half the price and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I have very long and thick hair</li>
            <li> It came with a little vial of argon oil also.</li>
            <li> pulls on my hair a little</li>
            <li> Was a little scared not getting a chi</li>
            <li> Lost a star for a few reasons tho. 1: it doesnt seem to sit/lay well on counter.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no tank to fill up with the messy argan oil, just built with it in.  </li>
            <li> My hair seems like it&#x27;s the absolute worst to deal with, but this iron helped soo much.</li>
            <li> And its half the price!</li>
            <li> My hair is still shiny, which is not easy with the type of hair I have.  </li>
            <li> She says this does not pull on her hair like cheaper brands in the past have</li>
            <li> I bought this on a recommendation and was not pleased.  </li>
            <li> My hair didn&#x27;t revert at all and even though it is texlaxed it usually does.</li>
            <li> It comes with a small bottle of oil that I put on the ceramic plates about once a week.  </li>
            <li> Buyer beware, dont waste your money!</li>
            <li> Fairly expensive especially since the one I purchased was faulty.</li>
            <li> I paid over twice what I paid for this one, and find that this one works just as well, if not better.</li>
            <li> I have bought expensive flat irons in the past, had a Paul Mitchell for years until it eventually died.</li>
            <li> We all have different texture of hair…I am wavy, my daughter has very thick hair and my mom thin...</li>
            <li> She uses it every day and let me tell you this kid is hard on her products.</li>
            <li> I must say I&#x27;m pleasantly shocked by this flat iron.</li>
            <li> Works well for thick curly hair without damage!</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair just below the shoulder.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure it is!!</li>
            <li> The fact I have to go buy another straightener makes this matter worse.</li>
            <li> Not great at all.</li>
            <li> Not a great iron.</li>
            <li> I hate flat ironing my hair and my two daughters hair.</li>
            <li> FAKE FAKE FAKE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical when I read reviews claiming things are &amp;#34;miracle workers&amp;#34; because I try it, and go figure it&#x27;s not all that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy about it at all !!!</li>
            <li> Well, I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I went from a $125 iron that had just been worn out to this one and was initially skeptical.  </li>
            <li> I have owned really expensive straightners.</li>
            <li> Very frustrating and lengthy process.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment...</li>
            <li> Yeah, i wish i dident buy this :(</li>
            <li> The chi is crap compared to this.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> DISAPPOINTED!</li>
            <li> Did not straighten my hair one bit, very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the performance.</li>
            <li> I bought this when my Cricket died and am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Terrible, rips my hairs out!</li>
            <li> the quality is crap!</li>
            <li> Its insane.</li>
            <li> This product is the worst and at this point I wish I purchased a Remington.</li>
            <li> to do my hair (and I hate doing my hair!)</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.  I have purchased many of flat irons over the years and this is the best one to-date.  It heats up in the stated 30 seconds and the heat controls are exact for the various textures of hair listed.  I love the swivel and longer cord it has.  This is an exceptional high quality product for a very affordable price.  A must buy!!!!</li>
            <li> Heats up quick and my hair looks better than ever!</li>
            <li> Terrible, rips my hairs out!</li>
            <li> Oh. My. Goodness. This thing is some kind of wizardry! I&#x27;ve spent years just being disappointed in every straightener I&#x27;ve owned, &amp; I&#x27;m sooo happy I made this investment. My hair is natural &amp; COMPLETELY out of control, I always think of my hair texture as 5d lol, but this iron got my hair almost bone straight with just ONE pass yesterday. ONE. PASS. &amp; it was only on 24! I wanted it at 25 at first but it gets suuuper HOT. The argan oil that came with it worked so well, I ordered the 3.4 ounce bottle. Okay I feel like I&#x27;m rambling now but it&#x27;s the end of the next day after I straightened and it&#x27;s still freaking straight! This is the best iron I&#x27;ve ever owned. There is one little con though; it can catch and snag your a bit if you&#x27;re not careful. I&#x27;m not really used to 1.5 inch irons but I got used to it quickly and stopped snagging my hair about halfway through. I&#x27;m just so excited that it feels so soft and it&#x27;s actually staying straight instead of poofing right back up two hours later. It really did give me salon results without spending so much money :D I just don&#x27;t see how this couldn&#x27;t work for everybody. My hair seems like it&#x27;s the absolute worst to deal with, but this iron helped soo much. If it worked for me, it should DEFINITELY work for you! If you have any doubts about buying this iron, just go for it! This thing is awesome and you deserve awesomeness ;}</li>
            <li> Did not straighten my hair one bit, very disappointed with this product. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend. Fast shipping was the only good thing. The fact I have to go buy another straightener makes this matter worse.</li>
            <li> it burned my hair :&amp;#34;(</li>
            <li> This is by far the best straightener I have ever owned!</li>
            <li> I have only used this a couple of times since receiving it.  I have naturally wavy to curly hair.  My recent haircut seems to require that I straighten it to make it look its best.  It does the job quickly and easily.  I had no real experience with a flat iron so I was expecting it to be a lot more difficult.  I like the many choices of degree of heat, the width is great, too!  I receive a lot of compliments after I have used this product to style my hair.  I would definitely recommend it to anybody who wants to straighten hair!</li>
            <li> Works better than chi the setting make it really. Easy to control. Better than the chi</li>
            <li> So I have wavy thick hair normally straightening my hair takes half an hour cause my hair refuses to be tamed lol but with this lovely argan heat straightener I cut that time to 10mins an im left with long silky hair frfr no way im going back to conair lbs</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get very hot. Not great at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this iron for awhile now but within the last year I decided to do natural. This iron straightens my curls well but doesn&#x27;t give me that salon feeling that I like.</li>
            <li> FAKE FAKE FAKE this product us not babyliss and DOES NOT WORK</li>
            <li> Purchased for my Granddaughter and she Highly Recommends this product! Loves the Argon Oil that came with it. Thanks for the fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this straightener. I originally used my best friends and just had to have one for myself. I have very long and thick hair and that is no problem for this straightener.</li>
            <li> I had the chi nano which didnt hold up very well after a years use..paint started to crack..on plates..this flat iron wasnt great..i bought the argan oil iron and find its hotter adjustable dial temp..the plates glide easier and its half the weight..makes my hair which is coarse and bleached much softer with less effort and passes..use with a few drops of argan oil amazing results..less frizz and more shine versus my chi..ive been a stylist 20 yrs..by far my fav flat iron</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron! It feels like quality, hears up fairly fast, and has adjustable heat. It came with a little vial of argon oil also. Great iron for the price. I had not heard of this brand but went with it for the other great reviews.</li>
            <li> As of my first use its fairly good. pulls on my hair a little but im gunna use it for a month then write a full review.</li>
            <li> i thought this worked amazingly for my hair type. i have dry, frizzy, thick hair and its styled in a short bob. it has heat adjusting levels from 1 to 24 (being 450 degrees) i think. and i only have to put it on level 15 to straighten my hair! it leaves it feeling shiny, silky, and smooth. I love it! level 24 was way too hot for my hair so Im sure people with coarse or really curly hair would have no problem getting it straight with this. however, i do recommend getting the argan repair shampoo and conditioner with the repair mask before you straighten because it worked so well! if you are someone with frizzy or dry hair it is PERFECT! Also, i suggest adding a little of the argan oil to your hair when its damp, it really adds a nice shine. i love it!</li>
            <li> I bought into all the hype. Can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s a babyliss. Doesn&#x27;t say babyliss on the box so I&#x27;m not sure it is!!</li>
            <li> My daughter has the longest most beautiful red hair. I purchased this product for her and so far so good. She uses it every day and let me tell you this kid is hard on her products. It has held up well so far for her and she&#x27;s even done some Aryan oil treatments with it. She says this does not pull on her hair like cheaper brands in the past have and so far she is happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> After 6 months the plates started coming loose and left an odor on my hair. I only used this product twice a week, I expected it would last longer than it did.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my girlfriend, it was on her wishlist. She loves how passed through her hair smoothly, and it a little hotter than the one she has. She definitely wanted a new one, and it was a great replacement.</li>
            <li> LOVE this Straightner! I have really thick curly hair and it took only 45 minutes without the oil they included. And that&#x27;s actually really fast because it would take me three hours to straighten my hair with the walmart brand.</li>
            <li> Just received mine today and tried it out for the first time…absolutely amazing! I&#x27;ve tried so many straighteners and hair products trying to find the right products for my thick &amp; curly, frizzy hair and I think I&#x27;ve finally found the solution! My hair has been soft and smooth (and straight) all day with no frizz or kinks like I usually get when straightening my hair. I recommend to anyone with unruly hair haha.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this straightener for about a week now and it works great.  Leaves my hair soft, and silky.  Just wish I wouldn&#x27;t gotten the 1&amp;#34; instead for more styling options</li>
            <li> I thought this hot iron would do less damage to my hair but that was not the result. Went back to my old straightener.</li>
            <li> Gift for my daughter. She liked it but I can&#x27;t say that she loves it.</li>
            <li> Flat iron, works really good love it 👍</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical when I read reviews claiming things are &amp;#34;miracle workers&amp;#34; because I try it, and go figure it&#x27;s not all that great.&lt;br /&gt;This is honestly the best straightener I have ever used in my hair. The chi is crap compared to this. I have thick very frizzy curly hair (I&#x27;m mixed) so naturally I have problems getting my hair how I want it. This flat iron has been able to straighten my hair in one stroke, and it&#x27;s smooth soft and shiny. I get the salon quality results without paying anyone to do something I can do myself at home :) I don&#x27;t see how anyone could give this a bad review, since I have the most obnoxiously unruly hair and it comes out nearly perfect.&lt;br /&gt;BUY IT, YOU WONT REGRET IT!!!</li>
            <li> Have been using for over a year now with no problems. It arrived quickly and it heats up very fast.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend for anyone!</li>
            <li> Ok but not as good as the Chi straightener we had previously.</li>
            <li> I purchased this about a year ago and i liked it for a while. I have curly hair so I don&#x27;t like to straighten it out much maybe once every 3-4months so I didn&#x27;t use the flat iron much and it already stopped working!! The plate came loose and it won&#x27;t even warm up such a waste of money I&#x27;m not happy about it at all !!!</li>
            <li> Love being able to adjust the heat.  Bought this iron because I bought the Argon Heat blow dryer and it worked fantastic.  When I straighten my hair with this iron it responds with just one pass.  I recommend this brand for all types of hair, you&#x27;ll be glad you tried it!</li>
            <li> i love these they straighten my hair better than any other flat iron I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
            <li> I live it........ It works very good</li>
            <li> I bought this on a recommendation and was not pleased.  My hair had a &#x27;burnt&#x27; smell and even broke off in spots.  I lowered the heat but ended up just putting this back in its box and it is sitting in the bottom of a drawer.  I did use the Argan Oil!</li>
            <li> Thank you... Exactly what I expected from the picture to the delivered product. Very well priced for a good quality product</li>
            <li> I have wavy, frizzy, uncontrollable hair.  When I blow dry my hair or when I let it dry naturally, I always go over it again with this tool.  I&#x27;ve owned other straighteners before with all sorts of heat pads on them, none have ever worked as well as this little fella.  My hair is smooth, shiny, and fabulous usually until the end of the day with little or no other products used (except when it rains, nothing can save me then).  Order and use this and your hair will be amazing!</li>
            <li> Love my flat iron it works great! Was a little scared not getting a chi but this flat iron works great!</li>
            <li> I love this straightening iron...the cord is long so you can move about if you need to.  It works great too!  Gets hot fast and stays hot!  I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> The best flat iron I&#x27;ve owned so far. I have very curly hair (3c/4a curls to be exact) and when I want to straighten my hair I always have trouble getting to the roots without burning myself, but with this flat iron i can get extremely close without burns. The argan oil infusion seems to be working :) I&#x27;m not sure how it&#x27;s infused in the plates (still a bit skeptical about that) so I bought the spray treatment along with it as a heat-protectant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several standard, find them anywhere, $20-$30 flat irons.  I never cared for any of them.  Not wanting to spend a large amount of money of a fancy-schmancy one, I just used a large curling iron to straighten my hair.  After looking and researching online, I decided on this one.  I LOVE IT.  I go over each section one time, that&#x27;s it.  It gets hot enough to make my hair smoother than any flat iron I&#x27;ve used.  I never thought I would be able to straighten my hair as good as my hair dresser.  This was a great buy.  Affordable and works AWESOME.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it doesn&#x27;t have an auto-shut off.  I highly recommend this flat iron.  Very happy with it!</li>
            <li> Best flat iron I have ever owned.  I have super thick (about 3 heads worth I am told) and long hair.  I have a lot of natural wave, especially when I left it air dry.  I can do one pass with this flat iron and I get very smooth and straight hair.  Very happy I gave this iron a shot.</li>
            <li> Did not produce results as promised, however it will cause heat damage....while on low heat.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use. Love this flat iron!!</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair very straight, healthy and shine, won&#x27;t burn my ends which was my major concern from the previous I bought at the mall and cheaper, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> I got this iron a few days ago and tried it out for the first time yesterday and went out in the high humidity air of a Trinidad evening. My hair didn&#x27;t revert at all and even though it is texlaxed it usually does. I used the argan oil it came with and in most sections I did only one pass on the 15 setting. The hair is not oily, it is flowing and I can&#x27;t keep my hands out of it. This is the second flat iron I have owned, the other one being a conair 2 in 1 1.5 inch barrel curling iron and flat iron that I have owned for 3 years but now takes forever to heat up and when it does and is in use it cools down  so I have to wait for it to heat up again. Very frustrating and lengthy process. This iron did my whole head of BSL hair in less than 45 minutes and it was not blow dried straight beforehand but was dried with the diffuser. And I noticed the iron curled pretty well too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will give an update in about a month of use. I wash my hair every week so that should be after 3-4 more uses.</li>
            <li> This straightner is very good! Heats up very fast ! Price is very good, I consider this a steal !! :)</li>
            <li> Pretty good straightner for the price. I was debating whether to get a chi or this one but I&#x27;m glad I went with this one.  It heats up really fast with just one push of a button.  I&#x27;ve only had it a few months so i really hope it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> It did not heat up enough to work for my thick hair, maybe it works better on different types of hair. It also pulled and didn&#x27;t glide smoothly over my hair. Just wasn&#x27;t a great flat iron for my thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> I love my new flat iron &amp; I love my One &#x27;n Only hair care products. My hair is straight laid.</li>
            <li> Great flat iron, heats up quickly, does a great job of straightening my naturally curly hair.  Haven&#x27;t used the oil that comes with it.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine received this straightener a year ago from a family friend.  I tried her straightener out once and I had to have it.  I bought mine a few months ago and it is still working great.  I have been through three expensive straighteners in the past five years and this one is my favorite (plus it is pretty inexpensive).  Hopefully it will continue to meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> Made my hair too hot that it burnt my fingers.  I didn&#x27;t even touch the iron with my hand.  Used it only once and didn&#x27;t use it after that.</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair and this flat iron works great!  The little bottle of Argan Oil is nice too, as I can smooth down the frizz that the flat iron can&#x27;t reach at the part of my hair.  The iron heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron.  I have really thick curly hair and my original flat iron was breaking and had to get a new one saw this one and I cant say enough about this.  One of the best flat irons out there and believe me I have been buying expensive one to the cheapest.  I straighten my hair than go out in the heat my hair is curly this flat iron I straighten my hair go out in the heat still straight.  I do recommened this product</li>
            <li> Excellent flat iron. The best by far and better yet I am a stylist and this is one of the best i ever tried..</li>
            <li> I have natural fine blond hair with just a small amount of natural wave.  When I used this iron it made my hair very oily looking.  I never used the oil that came with the iron.  Wish I would have just sprung for the Chi.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Goes thru my hair like butter and soooo smooth. I wish I would have bought this a long time ago. Best thing I&#x27;ve bought in a long time. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It does get very,very hot, but the plates don&#x27;t have enough weight to really smooth my hair, which is coarse. I don&#x27;t like that it does not have an auto shut-off, I have not had any electrical product in the last 15-20 years that doesn&#x27;t automatically shut off after not being used for 10 minutes, so make sure you&#x27;re turning this off when you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> Best Flat Iron I have ever bought! For the money I wasn&#x27;t expecting it but it had made my hair so nice and shiny. Great product.</li>
            <li> demasiado buena, me encanta....</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and this Straightener does the job perfectly every time.</li>
            <li> I love this straightening iron. It&#x60;s simple</li>
            <li> I believe this straightener deserves 5 stars! It is amazing! First time trying it today and I am blown away of the quality of this product. First off I was using a chi straightener but wanted to try something else since my current straightener was frying my hair AND it left it so frizzy looking; I do believe chi sells because of the name itself the quality is crap! And I will never purchase another! This straightener was so easy to straighten my hair and it wasn&#x27;t pulling on it and not only that but it left it feeling soft and frizz free! AAAMAAAZING!!! You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I tried this out because my stylist told me it would be best for my natural hair. It is great. I don&#x27;t straighten my hair often, but whenI do, it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of this iron, Felt like it was pulling my hair. Got nice and hot quickly, but didn&#x27;t like the snagging/pulling feeling.</li>
            <li> This thing is wonderful! Ok, I previously always bought the more expensive professional brands..like FHI, and I think I owned a CHI once (FHI was better). These are both great hair straighteners. BUT, this one is better. And its half the price! It makes my hair so smooth and straight. Its insane. How can a hair straightener make my hair smoother and shinier? You&#x27;d think it would only make my hair dryer...more damaged. But nope. There&#x27;s some magic in the plates I guess they call argan oil. That alone makes it a very special straightener indeed. Its smooth, sleek, thin. Just perfect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK,  nothing special. Kind of upset that it does not work on my hair texture.  It works but not as amazing as my last one. And with my last one It broke (unfortunately ) I was excited at first because everyone gassed the iron up on the review. But it&#x27;s not worth the money I payed. But it&#x27;s OK,  lesson learned. And Im half white and black so I have a cross between curly kinky hair to wavy</li>
            <li> I like the Nano Titanium better than the argan oil infused. This iron also isn&#x27;t as easy to comb case</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I previously had a CHI which I had for many years until it broke.  I thought I would never find anything comparable and less money.  If CHI is a 10 this product is a 9….and for me its half the price so that is a pretty good value/rating.  It works so well that my 13 year old used it all the time that I finally had to buy her one and now my mom, yes 63 year old mom wants one for Christmas.  We all have different texture of hair…I am wavy, my daughter has very thick hair and my mom thin...So I would say this has been a hit all the way around and works on all different hair types.  It comes with a small bottle of oil that I put on the ceramic plates about once a week.  It also can get fairly hot depending on what level you put it on though the handle and edges never do. Love this product but have only had it 6 months so I cannot rate on the longevity of it; just the quality of its use.  Hope it last several years like my CHI.</li>
            <li> My BUT loved her birthday gift. Said the item worked great! !!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter was very happy to receive this gift.  Top of the line product for an inexpensive price.  Very pleased!</li>
            <li> very smooth iron pad with a nice pink color. very sturdy quality and make my hair staight very fast! thanks!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so soft!! Gets very hot which works well with my thick, curly hair. Also, one teardrop full of the argan oil that comes with the straightener and your hair feels like silk!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product thinking more $$&#x3D;better product. Well, I was wrong. This product is the worst and at this point I wish I purchased a Remington. Buyer beware, dont waste your money!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the performance. The iron does not heat up high enough to straighten my normal, not real wavy hair.  Used 2 times and found it to be an inferior flatiron. I usually buy less expensive and thought I&#x27;d try a more expensive iron and get better results.DISAPPOINTED!</li>
            <li> Finally a hair straightener that works!!!!! It love it!!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I bought this, but I have to say I LOVE LOVE LOVE this straightener! It is fantastic!  The best one I&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li> I loooveeee this flat iron...it works wonders in my hair.....I have long, and curly hair n it does work great with my hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t put a lot of heat on my hair but when I do I use this iron and it works great!  I love the heat settings on this iron, bcz I have fine hair I have never gone past the first setting as it&#x27;s hot enough to straighten my hair.  There are some irons that produce a lot of steam no matter what setting, I&#x27;m glad this doesn&#x27;t. It glides through my hair very well and leaves it very straight.  I definitely recommend this iron!</li>
            <li> At first I was sceptical about this straightener because I didn&#x27;t know the brand, but I am completely in love with it. I have natural wavy and frizzy hair, so this straightener does its job. I don&#x27;t even need it on a high heat setting for it to do a wonderful job. Heats up quick and leaves your hair feeling so soft! Highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy my iron from Amazon, but wanted to do a review on it. I am a cosmetologist. I was looking for a Babyliss Pro Extreme, and the lady in the beauty supply said they didn&#x27;t have any.  A gentleman was kind enough to give me a demonstration.  He messed my hair up with heat protectant oversaturation, and I could smell my hair burning.  I went home and did an emergency treatment.  Lo and behold, I look at the box bottom and it is a Babyliss Pro!  I was ecstatic.  I added a leave in conditioner treatment and heat protectant, and I also put coconut oil on my ends.  I have the curliest, tightest hair that is thick but soft.  I started out with my setting on 10, but that was too low.  I went up to 15, 17, 20 then 23. That was the perfect setting for me.  My hair was salon straight with one pass.  My hair is swinging, bouncy, shiny and healthy looking. This iron comes with a 2 year warranty and Argan oil.  I&#x27;m going back to buy another one just in case they stop making them. You know how you find a good thing, and it&#x27;s suddenly discontinued. This is the best investment I have made as far as flat irons. No other flat iron compares to this one.</li>
            <li> Very nice.. Gets heated in a jiffy and gives good shine</li>
            <li> Great straightener! Works well for thick curly hair without damage!</li>
            <li> Great product. I would recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> OK, so first of all, the prime shipped it next day and the price is awesome! Next, I have been natural for 2 years (had the big chop) and my hair loves to revert to its teenie tiny spiral curls at even the slightest blow of wind. I have been flat ironing (several passes) and then using the old fashioned pressing comb (I know right!) to get my hair sort of straightened, however, it puffs soooo easy. This morning I get up and my hair was in a puffy state. This Iron Is Awesome!!! It took only one pass each section of hair to get it straight and another pass to curl it. The wind/humidity did not make it puffy on the way to work!! My hair is sooo shiny and straight! I have already convinced some friend and co-workers to buy it (they have seen me in my puffed hair and are impressed as well!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing straight iron for the price... it&#x27;s a good value.  Holds heat and tames frizzes, very easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is the best!! I am a mixed girl with thick semi curly frizzy poofy hair naturally.&lt;br /&gt;My hair usually takes over an hour to straighten and with this one it only takes my 30 mins!!!&lt;br /&gt;It gets hot enough so you only need 2 passes.&lt;br /&gt;Using the argon oil  makes it soft and healthy looking without being too oily (trust me).&lt;br /&gt;Love Love Love!!</li>
            <li> I should have made this purchase years ago.  The straightening iron keeps my thick hair straight between shampoos (3 or 4 days) without having to touch it up.  I put off making a purchase because I did not want to overprocess my hair with the hot iron using it daily, but I don&#x27;t have to.  I like the Argon oil sample that comes with it.  I will definitely purchase more when the sample gets low.</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever owned. I have used Chi for years and this flat iron is half the price and works 100xs better. I have very curly and course hair. People compliment me left and right about how shiny and pretty my hair is since I started using this iron. Will buy it over and over again. Great price!</li>
            <li> I am seriously in love with this flat iron. I&#x27;ve had a chi, sedu, and cheap walmart flat irons in the past, and honestly this one gets hotter than all of them! It makes my hair SO smooth and the argon oil it comes with is amazing. Seriously, don&#x27;t waste your time with a $100-180 flat iron. This one beats them all out and for a fraction of the price!</li>
            <li> The best I have had till now. I had the Chi at home back in Mexico and is good, but this one is much les expensive and leaves my hair very silky</li>
            <li> It says in the instructions that it&#x27;s a \\&quot;state of the art technology\\&quot;. Well... I never encountered such high technology that didn&#x27;t work from first time use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very excited to receive this hair straightener. That is until I turned it on and it didn&#x27;t heat at all. What a disappointment...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but it&#x27;s not as good as the professional brands. I think I will stick to my Chi.</li>
            <li> I purchased this flat iron to replace my 2nd Chi that died after 2 years. I was prepared to spend $100 on another Chi when I discovered this one for half the price and decided to give it a try. The one n only straightens my hair with one single pass opposed to my Chi that took a couple of passes. I also noticed that with my Chi I had a lap full of broken hair that I have not experienced with the one n only. I have had to make a couple of adjustments with this flat iron to recieve optimal results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Temperature setting- do not use the highest temperature setting or you are probably frying your hair. The basic Chi only heats to 380 and that&#x27;s probably the highest setting you want to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not use too much argan oil and make sure hair is completely dry. I did fry my bangs the first time I used this iron because I used too much of the sample product that came with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also had to eliminate my flip at the ends style with this flat iron. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the higher temperature or the thinner plates but I could smell my hair burning with this flat iron when I would try to add a curl or flip to the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> I love al the Babyliss Line, specially the Babyliss Pro Nano Titanium, but this model-line is great. Include the Argan Oil what makes great changes on the hair... / Excelente producto de la Linea Babyliss, me encantan los productos Babyliss Pro Nano Titanium pero esta linea es grandiosa. Incuye el Aceite de Argan que da grandes cambios al cabello</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used CHI irons, and the ones I&#x27;ve purchased lately haven&#x27;t been heating up good. I tried this argon one which was alot cheaper in price compaired to the CHI and I have been very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Love this straight iron! I have thick wavy frizzy hair and this makes my hair straight and shiny. I don&#x27;t have to go over each piece a bunch of times either.</li>
            <li> Amazing !!! I purchased mine about 3 years ago and it still works like new . . I let my coworker use it and she loved it she says its best straightener she used by far</li>
            <li> This is great because my hair is very dry and curly.  The ceramic head does a great job in smoothing my hair with very little work.</li>
            <li> This straightener works very well, I am pleased with it so far, the argan oil has a very nice smell to it and I am considering ordering more of the oil in the future. Ecellent, thank you very much!!</li>
            <li> Fairly expensive especially since the one I purchased was faulty. The plates did not touch and my hair slipped out without getting straightened. Returning for a refund.</li>
            <li> I like it my hair looks fantastic but sometimes it sounds weird when it&#x27;s hot, I don&#x27;t know if it is normal!</li>
            <li> Works great on my hair type!  Doesn&#x27;t damage or &amp;#34;fry&amp;#34; hair like other straighteners.  Would definitely recommend this to anyone that wants straight and smooth hair.</li>
            <li> makes your hair smell burnt after only 5 months.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my sister and she loved it.</li>
            <li> I have bought expensive flat irons in the past, had a Paul Mitchell for years until it eventually died. I bought this in it&#x27;s place and I am very pleased. You can&#x27;t beat the price for such an amazing flat iron. It heats up fast and leaves my hair feeling nice and silky.</li>
            <li> Very prompt! Very Satisfied!</li>
            <li> Works good for thick wavy/curly (and in my case, unmanageable) hair! Lost a star for a few reasons tho. 1: it doesnt seem to sit/lay well on counter. Falls over easily which could result in some stuff getting melted. Which leads me to my 2nd point, no automatic shut off! And lastly, id rather it have a digital temp read vs this dial control of 1-25. Despite all these cons I still had to give 4 stars cuz it does work well, which is the most important thing.</li>
            <li> I bought this to straighten my 4b 4c hair and with some creme press all I can say is be careful.... I went to hot and permanently straightened a very small portion (thank god) of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This baby works!</li>
            <li> Product was scratched and had finger prints on it inside the sealed box. Obviously was used, or returned and repackaged. Quality is not as I had thought. Prefer my Chi I purchased at my Salon.</li>
            <li> Great product, this is by far my favorite straightener. This is my second one and they last forever. I only needed a new one because I dropped mine on really hard concrete. This gets your hair super straight and smooth without damaging it and it actually curls if you know how to do it! I don&#x27;t need a curling iron I just use this. It is amazing</li>
            <li> my favorite amazon purchase i am soooo satisfied. these are better than a chi</li>
            <li> I went from a $125 iron that had just been worn out to this one and was initially skeptical.  I&#x27;ve had it for weeks and have only had positive results.  The straightness and shine last through humidity and even light rain like my previous one never did.  I&#x27;m so glad I bought this iron--and this is coming from someone with thick, wavy, and frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> Feels cheap. But the hair IS super soft after using this. And argan oil smells so goooood. I am African amer, cool product. But should be cheaper...</li>
            <li> I read alot of good rewiews before i bought this hair straightener, and i really expected this to be a really good iron. First the material looks like its made of plastic (cheap) and second when i turned it on, there came this smell, and when i straightened my hair there came alot of smoke out. The result wasen´t good either, my hair felt dried. Yeah, i wish i dident buy this :(</li>
            <li> Great product fast delivery</li>
            <li> I bought this when my Cricket died and am very disappointed. It gets hot enough to burn my hair but it doesn&#x27;t straighten it well or leave it shiny.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair just below the shoulder. This flat iron heats up quickly and doesn&#x27;t snag my hair like my old one did. I am very happy with it!</li>
            <li> If any of you are considering a new hair straightener-this is the one!  The ceramic plates are infused with argan oil that make hair silky smoothe.  There&#x27;s no tank to fill up with the messy argan oil, just built with it in.  It does come with a little argan oil that you put in your own hair as an added bonus.  I purchased this as a gift for my Mom that has lots of hair.  It is super thick and has lots of natural curl.  After she washes her hair it used to take her 2 hours just to dry and style her hair.  With the 1 1/2 inch straightening iron, it significantly cut down the styling time.  After the first time she used it, she went to a function and friends were touching her hair. :) They couldn&#x27;t believe how flat and shiny looking it was and after touching, they couldn&#x27;t believe how silky it was.  They asked what she was doing different to her hair and all she told them was that she got an awesome new argan infused straight iron for her birthday from her wonderful daughter.  I personally have the expensive professional Babyliss straightener and I want her&#x27;s instead.  I had the chance to use it myself and my hair was straight, styled &amp; beautiful in less time than my professional series.  Awesome price too!  Nothing but amazing things to say for this product!  We are telling everyone about it and highly recommend it for all hair types but especially thick and naturally curly hair!</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron, ordered on amazon about two years ago and its still working and up to standards :)</li>
            <li> I love this product. It heats up fast. It works great on my thick, course hair. In no time my hair goes from frizzy and UN manageable to silky smooth. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different flat irons, and I love this one, especially for the price.  Heats up fast, and straightens my hair quickly.  My hair is still shiny, which is not easy with the type of hair I have.  I previously had a name brand flat iron that I loved, but it broke.  I paid over twice what I paid for this one, and find that this one works just as well, if not better.</li>
            <li> Initially, I was quite pleased with this product. It heated up quickly. After 2 months it would turn off when I squeezed the handle. I attempted customer service with no avail. The price was great and the reviews were great. Just wish C//S would contact me back. Would like to try again.</li>
            <li> This has been a great straightner.</li>
            <li> This flatiron does not work 1/4 as well as my CHI, Another brand that I would never buy again. It burns your hair and does not make it silky smooth like the CHI products do. Be warned!</li>
            <li> Great straightening iron</li>
            <li> This straightner works great, I have really coarse hair and this is the best straightner I have ever had. I have owned really expensive straightners. I will stick to this one for now on.</li>
            <li> Received the package a lot earlier than I thought !! I love it, thank you!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister, her hair looks perfectly straight after using this</li>
            <li> Love it. Want to buy another one for a back up.</li>
            <li> excellent recommending</li>
            <li> I bought this after owning a Chi and several other devices. I wasn&#x27;t sure about the wider plates or the claim to have Organ oil infused in them. I must say I&#x27;m pleasantly shocked by this flat iron. This is an awesome iron and worth twice what I paid for it.</li>
            <li> I just received this flat iron today.  I have only had the cheap flat irons that you can buy at places like Wal-mart.  I always gave up doing my hair because my hair is extremely thick and long, but this flat iron is amazing!!!!  I would suggest buying a glove to hold your hair! :) I love this flat iron!!!  It only took me 15 mins. to do my hair (and I hate doing my hair!) and the results were perfection!</li>
            <li> Initially, I was quite pleased with this product. It heated up quickly and gave my hair a sleek, finished look. However, after only a few weeks, it did not heat adequately-  in fact, even on the highest setting, it was possible to touch the heating pad without discomfort. I will be returning the item and asking for a refund.</li>
            <li> Not a great iron. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I really like it... The way straighten my hair is perfect...</li>
            <li> I have never been able to have the gorgeous, pin-straight hair because I was cursed with thick, wavy, coarse hair that refuses to be tamed.  But this straightening iron is amazing.  It heats up and is ready to use within a minute and boy does it get hot!  I would definitely suggest using an Argan Oil pre-treatment on your hair before using the iron, to protect from breakage or heat damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using this straightener, my hair is long, straight, and shiny.  I&#x27;ve gotten nothing but compliments from coworkers, my husband, and friends.</li>
            <li> Love it, and it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair like previous flat irons have done.</li>
            <li> This was my first flat iron so I did a considerable amount of research before buying.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 months now. This one has been great so far and I love the way it heats up in about 45 sec. However, I do wish the control gave you the actual temperature.  The dial is set up with a number scale instead of degrees, so you have to look through the instructions to find the temperature table that matches up with its corresponding number. Once I got mine set, I just went ahead and marked the dial with a sharpie marker so I wouldn&#x27;t have to look up the table every time the dial needed resetting. Overall, I really like the product though and would certainly buy again.</li>
            <li> I Bought this Amazing Flat Iron, on Ulta. Best Flat iron i have purchased! Price is Amazing as well. I have Curly hair and it is amazing! Leaves my hair looking healthy. I have used the CHI before too, but it works fine for 1 year and after it stops heating up as good as it did. Very HAPPY with my purchased Flat iron! I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I hate flat ironing my hair and my two daughters hair. We are all natural, myself and my oldest have 4c/d texture, the youngest is tender headed. I bought this iron praying life would get easier and it has. I can flat iron both my daughter&#x27;s in about an hour, that had never happened before. My youngest doesn&#x27;t cry because the iron glides through her hair without snagging and her hair comes straight the first time through. My eldest&#x27;s hair stayed straight for two weeks and had the prettiest shine. Before this we had to take an iron to it every other day if she was careful to not sweat and stay away from moisture. This was the best investment ever. I also have the blow dryer. Which is heavenly.</li>
            <li> This iron is great, it gets really hot very quickly and stays hot throughout use. I have shoulder blade length, thicker wavy hair, and this does an excellent job smoothing and straightening my weird cowlicks. It even provides a nice subtle under curl at the bottom due to the width of the plates; and because of the heat output, it&#x27;s essentially a one pass iron.  The sample of argan oil was underwhelming and had leaked inside the box, but really that&#x27;s not why I bought this iron in the first place.  Give it a try!</li>
