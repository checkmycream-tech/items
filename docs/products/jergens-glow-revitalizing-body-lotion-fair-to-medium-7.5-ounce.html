    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>very happy with product.</li>
            <li>But the Revitalizing is the best one out there.</li>
            <li>it is AMAZING!!</li>
            <li>I am very fair skinned</li>
            <li>The seller was great</li>
            <li>This is a great moisturizer, but does not work as a tanner.</li>
            <li>been using throughout the winter, and my skin looks and feels great.</li>
            <li>It has greatly improved.</li>
            <li>great product</li>
            <li>Smells great n works great</li>
            <li>Good delivery time and all around great product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still searching for a good body bronzer.</li>
            <li>the plus side, though, if anyone needs a bottle I&#x27;m more than happy to get rid of it.</li>
            <li>Very appealing results.</li>
            <li>Best to apply after a hot shower and exfoliating your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are looking for an amazing looking tan, go out in the sun.  </li>
            <li>give my skin a nice glow mixing with my florida tan.</li>
            <li>This product goes on very easily, does not stain your hands.  </li>
            <li>Sincerely...</li>
            <li>I personally love the smell.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product many times since and for the price</li>
            <li>NIce light scent.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to continue tanning, but I still wanted to keep that healthy glow.</li>
            <li>but I am pleased to see it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>It fades evenly unlike many self tanners out there.</li>
            <li>A great moisturizer plus a light, gentle tanning all together make this a favorite for me.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>but it is strong.  </li>
            <li>I apply it at night and even with just one application I can see a huge difference with just 1 use.  </li>
            <li>I used precisely as indicated.  </li>
            <li>I ordered Jergens Natural Glow in Fair to Medium.  </li>
            <li>It gives my fair skin a natural tan color.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described&lt;br /&gt;Color looks good but not so much around knees, ankles, armpits, ect.</li>
            <li>I am very fair and find that this product is a little too &#x27;gradual&#x27; for me; I have to use it 5-6 times before I see any color at all.</li>
            <li>nothing really special about it cept</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear any perfume and this is not a bad smell</li>
            <li>Not too orange at all, a natural tan glow, I don&#x27;t see streaking at all, the smell had improved a lot, it still has a smell but very soft and light and with a nice scent.</li>
            <li>The new version has a light clean scent.</li>
            <li>I wanted a nice low level bronzer and this one did help with that</li>
            <li>, I like the scent (clean without being overly perfumey), and I like how it leaves my skin smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>works very well and quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lotion is a white color and applies very smooth.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li>So when Jergens came out with their glow lotion I figured it was a perfect solution to the &amp;#34;tan-or not to tan&amp;#34; conundrum facing everyone itching for a bronzed bod for wary of skin</li>
            <li>this was the first self tanner I ever bought.</li>
            <li>; that was very generous!</li>
            <li>I would most definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first self tanner that hasn&#x27;t turned me orange.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a subtle tan, this is a great product.</li>
            <li>And the next day I could still smell it that strongly.  </li>
            <li>This has a rather strong scent to it for something you are supposed to use daily.</li>
            <li>I will certainly use this again.</li>
            <li>The color builds if you use it every day, but it stops at a certain shade.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something completely real looking, this is your deal.  </li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing</li>
            <li>I really really like this tanner.</li>
            <li>There is a newer version now that is \\&quot;odor free\\&quot; that I dont care for as much.</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>I found this at my local convenience store and was extremely excited to try it.</li>
            <li>Besides being the wrong color, that product hasn&#x27;t been made for many, many years.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is great for first time users who are afraid of streaking.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a tropical tan, you normally can&#x27;t get this out of a bottle.  </li>
            <li>LIGHT ENOUGH FOR THIS PASTY WHITE GIRL...SLIGHT SMELL</li>
            <li>The color is very natural looking and starts showing almost immediately.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your skin feeling very soft.  </li>
            <li>Old, discontinued product should not be misrepresented with the new name and photo.</li>
            <li>Incidentally if you are pale, an amazing face bronzer that is incredibly subtle and smooth is the Tarte Maracuja Oil with bronzer in it.</li>
            <li>The only question I have is once I get a certain color</li>
            <li>What I received is Jergens Natural Glow for Medium Skin Tones.  </li>
            <li>My skin was glowing and soft.</li>
            <li>I had heard this recommended for pale skin but most definitely not.</li>
            <li>It doesnt give an orange look but a nice subtle tan that lasts about 4 or 5 days and you notice results on the 3rd usage.</li>
            <li>Use this product every summer, it looks like a true tan on my legs and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>
            <li>When I say pale, I don&#x27;t mean fair.</li>
            <li>I stopped using this product because I haven&#x27;t gotten a chance to go out and get a new bottle, but as I let my tan fade, I didn&#x27;t experience any of the weird, uneven color that others were saying they experienced.</li>
            <li>It smells really nice at first and throughout the day the smell fades, but doesn&#x27;t turn bad.</li>
            <li>The tube I received must be several years old.</li>
            <li>After I exfoliate in the shower, I dry off completely and apply the lotion.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> After I exfoliate in the shower, I dry off completely and apply the lotion.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m very white pale skin and after the first use I saw a slight color change, makes you look natural.</li>
            <li> As parts of skin lightened to its natural color, other parts took longer to fade so there were brownish spots, or islands, surrounded by the lightening up skin.  </li>
            <li> Love the gentle glow but hate the smell.</li>
            <li> wound up with strange brown blotches of tan on my neck, arms and legs.  </li>
            <li> The color is NOT orange on my skin (I have a yellow undertone to my skin) and after 7 days it looked like I had spent the weekend laying out at the beach.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone who wants a subtle tan.</li>
            <li> I noticed a subtle difference a few hours after the first application.</li>
            <li> Just be careful when applying.</li>
            <li> Should I start using the medium to tan version when this bottle is empty?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely fair-skinned.</li>
            <li> I let it dry a few minutes</li>
            <li> Even though I wasn&#x27;t as dark as I had been when I was tanning, I still had people commenting on how tan I was after 2-3 months after I had stopped tanning.</li>
            <li> I like the result of a slight tan without the danger of sun.</li>
            <li> The scent changes slightly but nothing like the tanning accelerator I&#x27;ve used in tanning beds before.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t meant to make pale people dark.</li>
            <li> Also, I noticed it is a bit uneven on areas that perhaps had some slight discoloration in the past.&lt;br</li>
            <li> that it showed a little chnage on my son</li>
            <li> It has little sparkles in it and smells A-OK.</li>
            <li> and I bought this to add a little color to my skin for spring/summer.  </li>
            <li> I use Jergens lotions all year &#x27;round.  </li>
            <li> I used to go to a tanning salon for a few months before using this.</li>
            <li> It looked like I had gotten a few days of sun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I am pale.</li>
            <li> I am not sure its made for your pores.</li>
            <li> Actually, three words: Really Effing streaky.</li>
            <li> This also makes me break out, I get small bumps all over my chest and stomach</li>
            <li> It is the old formula that stinks.</li>
            <li> , I thought it would fade slowly, naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but alas it made my skin orange</li>
            <li> I got the older version which has a disgusting scent .</li>
            <li> And for about a week or two, everything was &amp;#34;golden&amp;#34; (sorry, couldn&#x27;t help</li>
            <li> Silly me</li>
            <li> So, so, so disappointed!!</li>
            <li> The smell is horrible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an outrageous difference in just 3 days</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> works very well and quickly. I followed the directions closely in preparing my skin but alas it made my skin orange and it did streak. It may work for others but in my experience I  I would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> So, so, so disappointed!! Seller misled me with picture posted of product.  When I got it, I didn&#x27;t get the one portrayed on picture.  I got the older version which has a disgusting scent . The new version has a light clean scent. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described&lt;br /&gt;Color looks good but not so much around knees, ankles, armpits, ect. Just be careful when applying.</li>
            <li> I wanted a nice low level bronzer and this one did help with that but I didn&#x27;t care for the smell.  Maybe all bronzers smell that way, if so I guess I&#x27;ll be white and pasty.  The seller was great I would recommend them anytime.  Sincerely...</li>
            <li> I use this in addition to going out in the sun occasionally.  I have medium-light skin but have olive tones.  I never burn but tan gradually.  I get NO streaking with this product.  If you are looking for an amazing looking tan, go out in the sun.  If you are looking for a tropical tan, you normally can&#x27;t get this out of a bottle.  That is the movies folks.  If you are looking for something completely real looking, this is your deal.  Keeps me on the medium side of tan not the &amp;#34;pasty winter&amp;#34; side.  Smell is better than some really expensive tanners.  Again, if you don&#x27;t want smell, don&#x27;t get a self tanner.  BTW, i don&#x27;t use this on my face.  I use Maracuja oil with bronzing on my face.  I am not sure its made for your pores.</li>
            <li> it was an alright product. nothing really special about it cept that it showed a little chnage on my son</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this lotion and loves it and I bought it for that reason.  It is very moisturizing but I am not a fan of the scent.  I don&#x27;t wear any perfume and this is not a bad smell but it is strong.  And the next day I could still smell it that strongly.  I will be giving it to her to use.</li>
            <li> one word: STREAKY. Actually, three words: Really Effing streaky. I had to wear pants for a week. I had heard this recommended for pale skin but most definitely not. Incidentally if you are pale, an amazing face bronzer that is incredibly subtle and smooth is the Tarte Maracuja Oil with bronzer in it. That stuff will change your life. I&#x27;m still searching for a good body bronzer.</li>
            <li> yes i have using jergens glow body lotion for a while. it works well give my skin a nice glow mixing with my florida tan. very happy with product.</li>
            <li> Love the gentle glow but hate the smell.</li>
            <li> I like the result of a slight tan without the danger of sun. The moisturizer seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li> I use Jergens lotions all year &#x27;round.  I like the non-greasiness of it, I like the scent (clean without being overly perfumey), and I like how it leaves my skin smooth and soft.  So when Jergens came out with their glow lotion I figured it was a perfect solution to the &amp;#34;tan-or not to tan&amp;#34; conundrum facing everyone itching for a bronzed bod for wary of skin cancer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions indicated on the package.  I used precisely as indicated.  And for about a week or two, everything was &amp;#34;golden&amp;#34; (sorry, couldn&#x27;t help myself).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then I decided to let the tan fade.  Silly me, I thought it would fade slowly, naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wound up with strange brown blotches of tan on my neck, arms and legs.  As parts of skin lightened to its natural color, other parts took longer to fade so there were brownish spots, or islands, surrounded by the lightening up skin.  My friends offered concern over the unnatural coloring.  I took to wearing oxford button downs to cover up the mismatched color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, though, if anyone needs a bottle I&#x27;m more than happy to get rid of it.</li>
            <li> I really really like this tanner. this was the first self tanner I ever bought. It was $7 a bottle in the summer of 2012 since then the price has jumped to $8 or $9. I bought mine at Kinney Drugs but it is also found at Walmart. It is still cheapest to buy on Amazon/Ebay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great for first time users who are afraid of streaking. It doesnt give an orange look but a nice subtle tan that lasts about 4 or 5 days and you notice results on the 3rd usage. Best to apply after a hot shower and exfoliating your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lotion is a white color and applies very smooth. Doesnt tan your face too well. I also tried the Jergens for the face and still didnt notice a difference for me. But for others it has worked so youll have to find out for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;A big thing that people complain about this tanner is the smell. I personally love the smell. Thats why I bought it. To me it smells like Caramel. There is a newer version now that is \\&quot;odor free\\&quot; that I dont care for as much. But the Revitalizing is the best one out there.</li>
            <li> This product goes on very easily, does not stain your hands.  The color is very natural looking and starts showing almost immediately.  It lasts for quite a while.  Leaves your skin feeling very soft.  I will certainly use this again.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone who wants a subtle tan.</li>
            <li> turns you orange, would not reccommend</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer, but does not work as a tanner. It has little sparkles in it and smells A-OK. However, I did not see any improvement in the color of my skin tone. I started putting this on daily in March/April, and by the time summer hit, I was still as white as before. Props to Amazon for shipping me a 9 oz. bottle though; that was very generous!</li>
            <li> I know this is sort of the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; gradual tan product, but it doesn&#x27;t work well for me. I am very fair and find that this product is a little too &#x27;gradual&#x27; for me; I have to use it 5-6 times before I see any color at all. I&#x27;ve tried using a darker shade and still didn&#x27;t see results quickly enough for my taste. This also makes me break out, I get small bumps all over my chest and stomach anytime I use this. The smell is horrible.</li>
            <li> I ordered Jergens Natural Glow in Fair to Medium.  What I received is Jergens Natural Glow for Medium Skin Tones.  Besides being the wrong color, that product hasn&#x27;t been made for many, many years.  Old, discontinued product should not be misrepresented with the new name and photo.</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time.  It gives my fair skin a natural tan color.  I would purchase again from this seller.</li>
            <li> A great moisturizer plus a light, gentle tanning all together make this a favorite for me.&lt;br /&gt;Have been using throughout the winter, and my skin looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> Purchased this as an add on. The tube I received must be several years old. It is the old formula that stinks.</li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned and I bought this to add a little color to my skin for spring/summer.  I apply it at night and even with just one application I can see a huge difference with just 1 use.  The color is NOT orange on my skin (I have a yellow undertone to my skin) and after 7 days it looked like I had spent the weekend laying out at the beach.  I have purchased this product many times since and for the price it is AMAZING!!</li>
            <li> Good delivery time and all around great product.  I put it on in the morning and hit the yard and the sun.  NIce light scent.  Very appealing results.</li>
            <li> I really like it, I&#x27;m very white pale skin and after the first use I saw a slight color change, makes you look natural. Not too orange at all, a natural tan glow, I don&#x27;t see streaking at all, the smell had improved a lot, it still has a smell but very soft and light and with a nice scent. I shower then apply after during the day time, not before bed. I let it dry a few minutes then I put my clothing on. It has greatly improved.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely fair-skinned. I used to go to a tanning salon for a few months before using this. I didn&#x27;t want to continue tanning, but I still wanted to keep that healthy glow. I found this at my local convenience store and was extremely excited to try it. I cut tanning and started using this regularly. Even though I wasn&#x27;t as dark as I had been when I was tanning, I still had people commenting on how tan I was after 2-3 months after I had stopped tanning. My friends asked me if I was still going tanning. I stopped using this product because I haven&#x27;t gotten a chance to go out and get a new bottle, but as I let my tan fade, I didn&#x27;t experience any of the weird, uneven color that others were saying they experienced. I would most definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this 3 days in a row now. I took a before and during photo in my bathroom with no windows so the lighting was the same and I am definitely darker. It&#x27;s not an outrageous difference in just 3 days but I am pleased to see it&#x27;s working. It smells really nice at first and throughout the day the smell fades, but doesn&#x27;t turn bad. The scent changes slightly but nothing like the tanning accelerator I&#x27;ve used in tanning beds before. That would smell like burnt skin/vanilla after the tanning bed. With this I don&#x27;t have to use a tanning bed and it moisturizes just as well as a regular lotion. I will continue to use this unless it starts to turn me orange. The only question I have is once I get a certain color will it stop getting darker? Should I start using the medium to tan version when this bottle is empty? Hopefully the color this gives me will be tan enough to my satisfaction.</li>
            <li> I am pale. When I say pale, I don&#x27;t mean fair. I was lighter than a vampire. This lotion gave color to my skin. I noticed a subtle difference a few hours after the first application. My skin was glowing and soft. It looked like I had gotten a few days of sun. It&#x27;s the first self tanner that hasn&#x27;t turned me orange. I use it just like any self tanner. After I exfoliate in the shower, I dry off completely and apply the lotion. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and it&#x27;s never streaked. If I stop using it for a couple of days, the color fades. It fades evenly unlike many self tanners out there. If you are looking for a subtle tan, this is a great product. The color builds if you use it every day, but it stops at a certain shade. This isn&#x27;t meant to make pale people dark. I still look like myself and people keep telling me that I look healthier. No joke, I had a friend ask if I started taking vitamins. The only downside is that it has a funky after-smell that lingers for hours. If it weren&#x27;t for that, I would give this lotion a 5.</li>
            <li> LIGHT ENOUGH FOR THIS PASTY WHITE GIRL...SLIGHT SMELL</li>
            <li> This has a rather strong scent to it for something you are supposed to use daily. Also, I noticed it is a bit uneven on areas that perhaps had some slight discoloration in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I would go with a product like this again. If I am going to have that &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; I would rather it be something that works quicker.</li>
            <li> recieved on time..great product</li>
            <li> Smells great n works great</li>
            <li> Use this product every summer, it looks like a true tan on my legs and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>
