            <li>Amazing product..</li>
            <li>This is a good product, and I enjoy using it.  </li>
            <li>- this is just the stuff to keep it healthy after getting it color treated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be buying more when I run out.</li>
            <li>Great brand, I use the whole line, keeps my blonde hair bright and shiny, it also smells great, give it a try</li>
            <li>I surely recommend it</li>
            <li>I feel that it did a good job cleaning my hair without stripping it too much, and I liked the smell.</li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo for my recently colored blond hair and to go with the wonderful matching conditioners.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo for natural or color treated blondes.</li>
            <li>I just got my hair highlighted for the first time and I was loving it.</li>
            <li>but was sent in a huge pagkage and in Venezuela that cost a lot...</li>
            <li>It lathers nicely and my hair doesn&#x27;t break has much since I started using it.</li>
            <li>It feels clean and makes my hair look fresh and easy to style.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and fairly damaged from using my straightening iron, and this was a fairly nice shampoo that didn&#x27;t cause any further dryness, despite me being a daily hair-washer.</li>
            <li>I also use a strong moisturizing conditioner at the end just to lock in moisture, but the product really does what it says!</li>
            <li>I also liked that it didn&#x27;t feel like it was leaving a major product buildup on my hair.</li>
            <li>I purchased Paul Mitchell Blonde and feel that John Frieda Blonde is more affordable and does a really great job.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell and the price is very good since the shampoo is concentrated and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It made my hair soft and tangle free before I even used the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I tried John Frieda for darker blondes and that one definitely worked for me better</li>
            <li>Despite the positive reviews, this product did not do the trick for</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and colored blonde.</li>
            <li>Quality product with a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really need to add conditioner with this, but I do as my hair stylist recommends that.</li>
            <li>Makes hair much softer than super blonde but it does not give you quite as noticeable highlights after using it.</li>
            <li>Might be great for some but didn&#x27;t work for me unfortunately.</li>
            <li>So I bought this shampoo and conditioner and after the first use my hair was back to feeling extremely soft and silky.</li>
            <li>It last forever because it only takes a small amount to lather really good.</li>
            <li>I have used this shampoo for several months and I really like the way it makes your hair shine.</li>
            <li>OK for a few days and I noticed my roots were not reacting well to the blonde shampoo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it did, the results were subtle, but still I really liked the way this made my hair feel.</li>

            <li> Good consistency.  I do prefer the lightening formula of John Frieda, but this is a close second for me.</li>
            <li> I just got my hair highlighted for the first time and I was loving it. But a few weeks in parts of my hair were getting really dry and rough to the touch which was really disappointing. So I bought this shampoo and conditioner and after the first use my hair was back to feeling extremely soft and silky. I was soooo thankful! My natural hair is curly and semi hard to deal with as it tends to be dry, so I work hard to keep it from getting split ends - this is just the stuff to keep it healthy after getting it color treated. I also use a strong moisturizing conditioner at the end just to lock in moisture, but the product really does what it says!</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells great.  It lathers nicely and my hair doesn&#x27;t break has much since I started using it. Wish it came in bigger size.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for several months and I really like the way it makes your hair shine. It last forever because it only takes a small amount to lather really good. I would recommend this to any blonde as it takes the brassy color out.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, and I enjoy using it.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be buying more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I actually don&#x27;t have blonde hair, but bought this to see if it could bring out my highlights a bit. I&#x27;m not sure if it did, the results were subtle, but still I really liked the way this made my hair feel.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo for natural or color treated blondes. Leaves hair shiny &amp; brings out highlights. Quality product with a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> In combination with the conditioner, this has brightened up my blonde hair and I have even managed to survive a little longer between salon visits to touch up my highlights, because my natural mousy blonde roots have been brightened up as well. My hair is fine and fairly damaged from using my straightening iron, and this was a fairly nice shampoo that didn&#x27;t cause any further dryness, despite me being a daily hair-washer. I will use again.</li>

            <li> I like the way my hair looks and feels when I use this product.  My hair is fine and colored blonde.</li>
            <li> This is great for highlighted hair. I was concerned about it changing my color, or drying it out. It works GREAT. I have very thin and fine hair, and it doesn&#x27;t make it limp. It feels clean and makes my hair look fresh and easy to style. It smells good too which is a plus. I purchased Paul Mitchell Blonde and feel that John Frieda Blonde is more affordable and does a really great job. I don&#x27;t really need to add conditioner with this, but I do as my hair stylist recommends that.</li>

It has a nice smell and the price is very good since the shampoo is concentrated and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Despite the positive reviews, this product did not do the trick for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dark brown, medium hair with bleached blonde ombre. My stylist recommended me using a blonde shampoo and conditioner. To help my hair strengthen back to healthier hair, I chose this produce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did OK for a few days and I noticed my roots were not reacting well to the blonde shampoo. Made my scalp itchy and flakey. My hair never had bad dandruff issues so this really did not fit my needs. I tried John Frieda for darker blondes and that one definitely worked for me better</li>
