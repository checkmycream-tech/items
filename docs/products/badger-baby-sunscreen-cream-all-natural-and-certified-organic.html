            <li>If this is the case, please check the expiration date to ensure that your product is still good.</li>
            <li>This Badger baby sunscreen cream, which we originally bought for our grandchildren, is the one he likes the best.</li>
            <li>Smells great, gives good coverage, and works ok for about an hour- two in the water.</li>
            <li>Best part is that it&#x27;s SAFE, and I&#x27;m confident I&#x27;m not spreading a bunch of chemicals on our skin.</li>
            <li>It works wonderfully and I&#x27;m pleased that it&#x27;s safe for my daughter&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, strong but pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s working great no allergies and  safe ingredients</li>
            <li>I greatly appreciate that it has safe ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Works great, no terrible rash from using the product.</li>
            <li>and I am very satisfied with the sun protection of this product.</li>

            <li>I love Badger&#x27;s sunscreen!</li>
            <li>Love this sunscreen!</li>
            <li>They should be more carefull with baby products!</li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen!  </li>
            <li>The SPF is excellent though and I continue to use it on her legs and arms when out in the hot NC sun.</li>
            <li>on top of that Vitamen Shop refuses to give me a refund on the product!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>Love this sunscreen!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with this product!</li>
            <li>, I love all the badger sunscreens!</li>
            <li>As a bonus, I love the way it smells!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>As a bonus, my baby loves to look at the cute badger on the tube and it keeps him occupied while I apply the sunscreen!</li>
            <li>My kids love it!</li>
            <li>Love this sunscreen for our daughters and ourselves!</li>
            <li>This product impressed me with the amount of information supporting the ingredients in their product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s organic which makes me feel better about slathering it on him and the smell is pleasant and he giggles when we put it on his face.</li>
            <li>This one is the best compromise of less chemicals but effective protection, and is the best value of those with comparable ratings by the EWG.</li>
            <li>It is very effective and has a very mild scent.  </li>
            <li>amazing coverage, but a bit sticky to apply...</li>
            <li>This product is amazing for both my kids and me.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>I have used the Badger 35 SPF Sport sunscreen on myself for many years before I had a baby and have always loved it.</li>
            <li>Nice product.  </li>
            <li>Like it, its all good for babies, but could be more lotion (easier to spread in their skins).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell rubs in nicely on my baby&#x27;s skin.  </li>
            <li>I liked both sunscreens, but this one seems sturdier and I can&#x27;t find the aveeno baby anymore.  </li>
            <li>It rubbed in nicely and was not sticky or smelly.  </li>
            <li>Also, others described a nice scent....</li>
            <li>and now I kind of like the smell</li>
            <li>After much research - this is the BEST sunscreen you can get for your child.</li>
            <li>(she&#x27;s kind of blotchy).</li>
            <li>I researched and continually saw good reviews for Badger and I am so glad we made the switch.</li>
            <li>but it rubs in nicely</li>
            <li>Use on my own face as well.</li>
            <li>I really liked this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen has a pleasant smell and worked great for our babies first summer.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing sunblock I did a lot of research on the sunblock before purchasing if it does not have any harmful chemical additives is very natural and Perfect to use on your newborn child as well as yourself.</li>
            <li>Also I experienced some mild breakouts by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>The sun protection this stuff gives is as good as or better than most sun screens for kids.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and am still searching for the perfect sun screen for my face.</li>
            <li>But also a very strong smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely one of the best choices in sunscreen if you want safe and effective!</li>
            <li>All natural and works great!</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my daughter when she was 4 months old and was very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>I do think the loving naturals gave better protection though this one seems to wear off quicker.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Zinc Oxide for over 30 years on my own skin and love that they have made a product for kids to help protect their skin without all the harmful chemicals out there.</li>
            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>It rubs in fairly well in my son&#x27;s fair skin but on my Colombian skin it doesn&#x27;t - a small price to pay for superb sun protection, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>A mild pleasant fragrance.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen is OK but smells very strong.</li>
            <li>Over all, we loved it, we all used it specially our 9 months baby.</li>
            <li>It has been wonderful on my little boy and I&#x27;m happy it meets the ewg.org top list.</li>
            <li>While it did provide some sun protection and water resistance was good, I did get more sun color than I&#x27;m comfortable with and more than I&#x27;ve gotten with chemical sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Great protection, when on it does feel pretty greasy</li>
            <li>Good seller &amp; quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I like this and though it has a strong smell, you get kind of used to it</li>
            <li>This sunscreen smells good, isn&#x27;t sticky, and I feel good about putting it on my 1 year old!</li>
            <li>15 minutes after applying it my son leaned against a cabinet and it was all over the cabinet, which did not leave me confident that it was still on him.</li>
            <li>or I would for sure return it.</li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Excellent product definitely would order again.</li>
            <li>To date, this is definitely the best organic sunscreen we have ever purchased.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Love this sunscreen and have bought more.  </li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Badger sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen for my baby and want to use it on myself as well.</li>
            <li>I ran out of my favorite sunscreen EVER and this was what I tried using as the replacement.</li>
            <li>It protected my babe&#x27;s precious skin on a Florida beach in June.  </li>
            <li>My favorite sunblock for baby.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a delightful physical blocker sunscreen--</li>
            <li>What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li>/&gt;While it&#x27;s a healthy option for him, it&#x27;s not practical.</li>
            <li>After doing more research on ones they listed I decided on this one.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok for my kids if it is safe.</li>
            <li>I do not know what is safe anymore....</li>
            <li>I could not smell the calendula at all and calendula is one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li>and I couldnt be more pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>I love that this product is made up of minerals that sit on top of the skin deflecting harmful rays as opposed to chemicals that rub into the skin and get into the body.</li>
            <li>It contains one of my favorite ingredient, Calendula (a flower with healing properties ).  </li>
            <li>No sunburn after many days at the pool, but it is SO greasy.</li>
            <li>I love this SPF.</li>
            <li>I love Badger and its dedication to the highest level of quality in the marketplace.  </li>
            <li>I love badger products.</li>
            <li>and i love the fact i am putting something safe on my childe.</li>
            <li>I also like Adorable Baby</li>
            <li>It works well, though, and I use it for mostly their face.</li>
            <li>Some of these sunblocks are stinky, and this one doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming odor.</li>
            <li>I love the ingredients in this</li>
            <li>and I love that Badger is continually working toward improving their formulas.  </li>
            <li>If it is safe for baby it is safe for me.</li>
            <li>I guess you either love it or don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a safe sunscreen for my children when I came across this.  </li>
            <li>Still in search of the perfect sunscreen, if there is such a thing...</li>
            <li>and my daughter was free of sunburn and skin reactions!</li>
            <li>I was glad I did as it worked just as well as Unscented</li>
            <li>Our favorite suntan lotion for the kids.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I tried many sunscreens for my 1.5 y.o.</li>
            <li>We love this in our family.</li>
            <li>We absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I appreciate that it&#x27;s a safe product to put on my baby, but</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how well this would work.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m ok with that if it blocks the sun</li>
            <li>More if on water.</li>
            <li>We are now going to try ThinkSport Kid Safe Sunscreen, which is a 20% zinc oxide formula.</li>
            <li>I love that its organic, however, so I will continue to use it on my child.</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t care because I feel better about this brand than many.</li>
            <li>It smells ok.</li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen for its safe reviews but you have to reapply every hour or so depending on your child&#x27;s skin.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I chose this option because I felt it was safe to put on my 6 month baby</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>I will keep looking for something better.</li>
            <li>Burn and irritation free!</li>
            <li>Safe for kids, does the job protecting from sun.  </li>
            <li>so its dons&#x27;t smell appealing</li>
            <li>I feel confident that I&#x27;m not using any harmful chemicals on his skin.</li>
            <li>Love love love Badger products.  </li>
            <li>The sunscreen stayed on even in chlorine water - NO sunburned babies and NO nasty chemicals in this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m allergic to the ingredients in most sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Love this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>so we are really pleased.  </li>
            <li>I love the safe ingredients, but it is a bit too oily which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>We love this sunscreen for our baby. ..</li>
            <li>There are plenty of equally safe alternatives that go on nice and smoothly.</li>
            <li>Much better than Babo sunscreen, although I&#x27;m still a fan of their sunscreen stick for faces.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something that rubs in better for adults, try the lotion.</li>
            <li>, i love the smell of chamomille and calendula</li>
            <li>But this just goes on better, without a whitening effect, and I feel like it gets rubbed in better. :)</li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen for my baby.</li>
            <li>In most cases, the clumping is caused by the crystallization of Shea and Cocoa Butter.</li>
            <li>I made sure to reapply hourly.</li>
            <li>the money, you can find better.</li>
            <li>I hope this helps  : )</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s because this is a safe product that sits on top of the skin rather than a more toxic product that would leech into your bloodstream.</li>
            <li>In most cases, the clumping is caused by the crystallization of Shea and Cocoa Butter.</li>
            <li>No sunburn, no nasty chemicals, and a sweet smelling, safe baby!</li>
            <li>Badger is one of the most highly recommended baby sunscreens and we will happily recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>But again, the most important thing for us was safe ingredients, so it does the job fine!</li>
            <li>I have also tried Poofy Organics and it is good, with a similar consistency, but I prefer this one because it has a pleasant scent of Chamomile tea.</li>
            <li>I love badger products and love that this a chemical free.  </li>
            <li>We are happy that Badger uses all natural (and mostly organic) ingredients and a zinc oxide formula.</li>
            <li>Really good product, in fact I think we will replace our own adult (read toxic) sunscreens with this also.</li>
            <li>GREAT natural product!  </li>
            <li>First of all, it contains wonderful SAFE ingredients that I can feel good about putting on my kids sensitive, pure skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pleasant smell, but like any strong smell can be a turnoff in large quantities.  </li>
            <li>It has such a pleasant scent of chamomile and calendula that I want to buy a bottle for myself to use this summer as well!</li>
            <li>It definitely works, and my children are very fair skinned and prone to sunburns.  </li>
            <li>Besides the fact that its all natural, the sunscreen smells great.  </li>
            <li>one of the most important deterrents in shielding from environmental damage ).  </li>
            <li>So happy to find a sunscreen that is natural.  </li>
            <li>I was happy to see that her sensitive skin didn&#x27;t break out in a rash from this product but</li>
            <li>However, if that is the price to pay for a chemical free sunscreen, then I&#x27;ll gladly accept those terms.  </li>
            <li>It smells great (and natural)</li>
            <li>Wonderful product, all organic, natural ingredients and really protects from the sun!</li>
            <li>This is a great sun block for our 9 month old.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t mind that at all as the sun protection is more important to me.</li>
            <li>Good for the whole family.</li>
            <li>The cream dries nicely if allowed 15 minutes to be absorbed as the directions state.</li>
            <li>if you compare it to other non-toxic sunscreens it is awesome.</li>
            <li>It is sticky so sand didn&#x27;t brush off easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t have any smell.</li>
            <li>It does not go on as easily as Devita sunscreen, but that is not specifically marketed for babies.</li>
            <li>but it is lightweight so it does rub off easily.  </li>
            <li>It rubs in easily and protects my baby in the sun.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to spread and not too greasy.  </li>
            <li>The baby SPF 30 has worked well on my fair and sensitive skinned boys that love the outdoors.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am happy with this product because I am happy that I can protect my baby not only from the sun, but from the chemicals used in most sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>Super safe ingredients.  </li>
            <li>but  in general it&#x27;s very nice</li>
            <li>Effective, gentle sun screen</li>
            <li>This is great product without additional potentially harmful additives, which is why we use it.</li>
            <li>A bit greasy but works great as in definitely prevents sunburn.</li>
            <li>Our pediatrician recommended no sunscreen, but I did not feel comfortable with that.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s fabulous.  </li>
            <li>We were away from home one day when I had to change his poopy diaper, though, and I discovered that I had no diaper rash ointment of any kind in the diaper bag to put on his still very rashy bottom.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product is biodegradable and tube is BPA free</li>
            <li>I have 4 kids to cover so efficiency is important to us</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s not like regular sunscreen smells great either).</li>
            <li>This sunscreen rates great on the Skin Deep database.  </li>
            <li>enjoy the smell</li>
            <li>Since this is made for babies&#x27; sensitive skin, I assumed it would be good for my face.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I brought this because it claimed to be &amp;#34; all natural&amp;#34; and had a pretty good review on amazon (there wasn&#x27;t alot to choose from if you wanted to pick something &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>I wanted a natural yet effective sunscreen for my baby that is safe and this fits all of those qualifications.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on nicely and love how natural and safe it is - hoping I will be able to use it on my 3 year old!</li>
            <li>As long as my son is getting good, safe protection.</li>
            <li>stuff has a pleasant, light scent from the chamomile and leaves the skin moisturized (not greasy) a short time after applying.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and goes on thick but rubs in easily.</li>
            <li>I am using safe sunscreen on myself and my children, thanks!</li>
            <li>On top of that, I actually think it smells pretty nice!</li>
            <li>Their zinc oxide atomizing process must not be as significant as Neutregena or the like.</li>
            <li>I read through the ingredients and realized that they were exactly the same ones that I would expect to find in a good diaper ointment - and if it&#x27;s safe for baby&#x27;s face, it&#x27;s probably safe for his bum, too, right?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many sunscreens on my kids (both of whom have sensitive skin), and I LOVE this one.  </li>
            <li>We use this on our own personal beach where there won&#x27;t be many people seeing the kids.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my favorite, but this is a more natural sunscreen</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve heard wonderful things about this product, so I was surprised to find that this product was gritty since it&#x27;s designed for babies.</li>
            <li>I was so happily surprised to find that I even adore the badger baby sunscreen even more!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that if I reapply at about 1 1/2 hours she doesn&#x27;t get burned at all, just a little tan (she&#x27;s usually very fair).</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend it and plan to buy more when it runs out.</li>
            <li>getting wet, the protection is not as great I had hoped.</li>
            <li>i like this product as it goes on without being too white and seems like it would offer good protection.</li>
            <li>Full article:  </li>
            <li>We were only in the sun for a couple of hours  had applied well in advance of going out, and range in skin tone from fair to tans-easily, but all of us were charred.  </li>
            <li>and I  finally found a sunscreen I feel good about using.</li>
            <li>My sweet baby girl was protected without my worries.</li>
            <li>We spend full weekends in the sun.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this sunscreen but it is very greasy.  </li>
            <li>No bad smell</li>
            <li>No bad ingredients.</li>
            <li>We looked up the chemical contents of each ingredient and found this to be among the best products, in terms of least damaging to your sweet baby&#x27;s skin, on the market.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Goes on easily, the last type I had (loving naturals??)</li>
            <li>WOW...the strong odor is pretty off-putting.  </li>
            <li>Works well and its Safe for her new skin!</li>
            <li>And yes, it is greasy but that soaks in fairly quickly and has not been a problem for us.  </li>
            <li>After reading the reviews, I was expecting it to be super greasy and pasty.</li>
            <li>This seems to be a decent alternative and has received a respectable rating from the Environmental Working Group guide.</li>
            <li>The main ingredient is zinc oxide which I love.  </li>
            <li>Positive is that it is natural and more healthy than some.  </li>
            <li>As long as youhave an unexpired bottle without the crystals it should workjust fine - we love it!</li>
            <li>all natural ingredients, No chemical preservatives, this physical sunblock is perfect for protecting all summer long&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparing this physical blocker among others with greater zinc oxide %</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy that it&#x27;s more natural than the other brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>this is easier to put on than previous formulas which is great.  </li>
            <li>Goes on easily and really covers.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply and reapply, didn&#x27;t cause eye issues - but didn&#x27;t do much sun protection.</li>
            <li>I used this last summer for the first time and had no issues with burns on my kids - loved it.</li>
            <li>The cream is pretty thick and takes some time to rub in, somewhat oily, but they sun coverage is PERFECT</li>
            <li>This is the only sunscreen that we use, and we love it!  </li>
            <li>Each one I tried I also tried on my face since I have SUPER sensitive skin and most sunscreens make my skin itch or burn.  </li>
            <li>Provides great coverage for my little girl.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product, just a little pricy.  </li>
            <li>I think it rubs in nicely, though a little more rubbing is required to get it all in.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing, it has only one detail</li>
            <li>you or your child have sensitive skin to most sunscreens or skin care products, then this should suit you well.  </li>
            <li>Love it on me and my 18th mo old.</li>
            <li>Blends well, and has a fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>Well worth staying away from chemicals though.</li>
            <li>Well it is a bit greasy but eventually is absorbed.  </li>
            <li>it is not as white on the skin as you would expect from the oxide that was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it to avoid a allergic reaction.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s all the way absorbed.</li>
            <li>and it did not get absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that it&#x27;s FREE of the ingredients that possibly cause cancer!!</li>
            <li>In my opinion, it is worth the effort, since I am not rubbing in toxic chemicals into  my child.  </li>
            <li>The quality in the sunscreen and its effectiveness to protect my children&#x27;s skin naturally is worth the price.</li>
            <li>I wanted to use a sunscreen on my daughter that was safe and all natural, with no harmful chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the $$.</li>
            <li>I also lean towards more natural products.</li>
            <li>While I do love that this is natural, non-nano,</li>
            <li>It might be natural and safe to use</li>
            <li>But worth it to avoid all the chemicals.</li>
            <li>The EWG gives this a rating of a 1, which is rare for sunscreens.</li>
            <li>So natural and safe for my baby.</li>
            <li>I researched safe sunscreens for my 8 month old knowing</li>
            <li>and I love how natural all the ingredients are.  </li>
            <li>Love using all natural sunscreen</li>
            <li>I like that this is safe sunscreen free of all the toxins that the other ones are filled with.  </li>
            <li>Applies easy and stays on in normal, non-swimming use.  </li>
            <li>We live in AZ (#2 for skin cancer in the world) and my little guy has very fair skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it three times and have just come on Amazon right now to order another bottle of the California baby, and figured I&#x27;d take a minute to voice my opinion on this one.</li>
            <li>right in.&lt;br</li>
            <li>right in.&lt;br</li>
            <li>right in.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a very mild smell which my son appreciates :) it&#x27;s definitely worth the money I spent on it</li>
            <li>It is thicker than traditional chemical sunscreens, but it was very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Rubs in well, no super white, and smells delicious.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this sunscreen has been great and it makes me feel secure knowing it doesn&#x27;t contain dangerous chemicals her skin will absorb, but she&#x27;ll still be safe from the sun&#x27;s rays.</li>
            <li>so it takes a certain technique to get it on quickly</li>
            <li>Well we loved it but then found out the lot we received was recalled so marking it down from 5 stars to 2 stars based on that recall and the fact we used it.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and has a nice texture (it isn&#x27;t clumpy or really greasy like other baby-friendly sunblock lotions).  </li>
            <li>As others have said, this sunscreen requires more rubbing in than the typical drugstore sunscreen, but knowing that I&#x27;m putting a safe product on my toddler makes the extra effort worthwhile.</li>
            <li>The sunblock holds up in the water well, and we have found that, as long as we re-apply it after about 2 hours of swimming (in full sun) it continues to offer the protection that our kids need to keep their skin healthy and not get</li>
            <li>I love that this product does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, without any of the harsh ingredients of many of its competitors on the market.  </li>
            <li>Also, because it doesn&#x27;t sink in and my toddler squirms, I worry that she&#x27;s just wiping it off on whatever she&#x27;s wearing or sitting on (nice white streaks on my couch, thanks very much).</li>
            <li>The woman at the all natural store in my town said that the badger brand was very popular and similar to the California baby super sensitive.</li>
            <li>was super thick/sticky and took a long time to rub it in, this brand goes on much better.</li>
            <li>Ilike this product very much.</li>
            <li>Great product, we use this for a 2 year old who breaks out from every other sunscreen we&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>I have a fair freckled little girl</li>
            <li>I wanted a good sunscreen for my little one by the pool.</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way, and it does take a minute to rub in, but we&#x27;ve been very happy with it.</li>
            <li>This is the only sunscreen I have found that doesn&#x27;t cause a rash, and I&#x27;ve tried many.  </li>
            <li>I always am sure that I buy enough bottles before summer starts</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was the greasiness.</li>
            <li>This product was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Badger Baby is comparable to Cetaphil Dermacontrol Moisturizer (a chemical sunscreen which I would also recommend for faces/under make-up) and Mineral Fusion moisturizer (which has a higher spf of 40 and a stronger herby scent).</li>
            <li>my kids, however, couldn&#x27;t stand the smell so it has not been used after the first day.</li>
            <li>Next time I will just be applying more.  </li>
            <li>Smells great, moisturizing, thick and doesn&#x27;t irritate my toddler&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>but my child was out with it on and got burnt to a crisp.  </li>
            <li>We tested this on a hot sunny day at the beach.</li>
            <li>This one was mentioned numerous times, on many websites and blogs.</li>
            <li>It is a bit greasy at first, turns the skin whitish before it is fully rubbed in, and takes longer to rub in than normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent is light and natural.</li>
            <li>and I use adorable baby for daily use (glides on and no weird color).</li>
            <li>It works very well!</li>
            <li>Works great - goes on a bit thick</li>
            <li>This one is much easier to rub in, if it were cheaper, I&#x27;d have given it 5 stars!</li>
            <li>I stopped using it after the first use.  </li>
            <li>I put it in the sun first to &#x27;melt&#x27; it</li>
            <li>Babyganics sunscreen was much better and left no oily residu</li>
            <li>As Dr. Oz said, \\&quot;White is right\\&quot; when it comes to safe sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>While it goes on pretty well and the water beads up showing it&#x27;s still applied</li>
            <li>&quot; smell that my first tube had.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this on myself for a few months -- it probably is safe (I will take the EWG&#x27;s research/word on it) and smells pleasant enough, but it was less effective than I had hoped.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really care for it right when it&#x27;s put on, but then after awhile it kinda smells like iced tea.</li>
            <li>so much so that my daughter who is normally fine with wearing sunscreen whines and nearly cries when we tell her</li>
            <li>After extensive research on the EW Skin Deep database, I purchased this for its good rating as a non-toxic sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it takes slightly more effort but its really not even worth mentioning.  </li>
            <li>It does work well and the easy application on my 1 1/2 year old gets this item a high ranking from me.</li>
            <li>Buy the California baby super sensitive and try that first.</li>
            <li>Love the smell but so chalky it takes too long to put on the kids.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very greasy and rubs off at the slightest touch, which is pretty counterproductive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good sunscreen, thick but not too thick, great for covering the baby and my tattoos.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a small price to pay for good sun protection.</li>
            <li>Feels a little sticky/thick at first, but spreads nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave yucky residue on skin afterwards.</li>
            <li>this summer, most from the top of the list from EWG (think baby, that other australian one with a lizard on it, and neutrogena baby faces).</li>
            <li>my kids happen to be super sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a creamy texture and applies easily without making my skin chalk white</li>
            <li>Then it spreads easily on my face and disappears without a white film  </li>
            <li>Just remember that it is necessary to reapply sunscreen when it has rubbed off (which happens easily with mobile children and towels when swimming) or your child has been in the water for a while.  </li>
            <li>it definitely has a fairly strong chamomile smell.</li>
            <li>This has a strong chamomile scent when initially used that subsides after it&#x27;s been rubbed in.  </li>
            <li>I got a large scrape on my arm from my wetsuit but still needed to put SPF on for the remainder of the triathlon I was in.</li>
            <li>We have removed the Shea and Cocoa Butter from most of our new 2013 sunscreen creams to avoid further clumping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>We have removed the Shea and Cocoa Butter from most of our new 2013 sunscreen creams to avoid further clumping.</li>
            <li>We use just a little bit, rub in in our fingers to warm it up, dot it on area then rub it in.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Additionally this stuff really does not play well with sand, unless you actually want to be covered in a fine layer that cannot be removed even with vigorous scrubbing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very thick and feels like it creates a great barrier on my baby&#x27;s</li>
            <li>The lid is flimsy and has broken on a couple of mine, but this is a great product</li>
            <li>Re-application of the sunscreen occurred every one to two hours, as the kids spent most of their time swimming in the ocean.  </li>
            <li>and I felt this sunscreen really worked for him.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five starts is because it isn&#x27;t tear free.  </li>
            <li>and this works really well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I really like this product.</li>
            <li>We tried Babyganics (which had great reviews on line) and he had a reaction (rash all over face and behind ear), so I lost the 18 dollars I paid for 2 bottles.</li>
            <li>found that the greasiness of the product made it much easier to rub into the skin to reduce the whiteness created by the zinc oxide.</li>
            <li>But keeping your child safe from some of the really yucky chemicals in regular sunscreens is worth the extra effort of rubbing it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Protects skin really well.</li>
            <li>All those things don&#x27;t matter that much</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really tested in water yet, since it claims to be water proof.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is greasy but it felt very greasy on my hands.</li>
            <li>Because you have to reapply the tube goes fast.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it myself too and really like it.</li>
            <li>Our daughter is very fare skinned and melanoma runs in my family, so I am very cautious when it comes to sun.</li>
            <li>It is a very herbal-y scent.</li>
            <li>can&#x27; complain too much</li>
            <li>I suspect it is water resistant if you are setting gently in the water</li>
            <li>We were at a water park and even with reapplication it seems to be rubbed off by touching floats and by the rough water.  </li>
            <li>Did not seem to give him much protection.</li>
            <li>On the plus side you dont need to use much for coverage.</li>
            <li>but I think it is bc there is too much product.  </li>
            <li>Babies really need the cream, though.</li>
            <li>And I actually really like the smell.</li>
            <li>He played in the pool for longer than the recommended 40 minutes, and still didn&#x27;t so much as tan.</li>
            <li>I love the spray version of sunscreens, but so far, no physical sunscreens come in sprays.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I ordered this product after extensive research on natural sunscreens.</li>
            <li>And my baby burned- not terribly (though I&#x27;m sure it would have been worse if we were in the sun longer)</li>
            <li>we only put natural ingredients on and in our body, but we also love to be out in the sun.</li>
            <li>I have somehow come to own several tubes of Badger sunscreens (of different types) and have decided to give them away.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly thick, but it does the job to protect their fair skin.  </li>
            <li>I like that this is all-natural, seems to do the job, and gets good ratings from the Environmental Working Group, but MAN, is it thick and pasty.</li>
            <li>Since the other brands have cancer causing ingredients it is refreshing to find a product we can use .</li>
            <li>It has great ingredients and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>and I feel better about slathering it on my kid than lots of other stuff out there.</li>
            <li>I do like natural sunscreens, but we found this to be very, very greasy.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic and while it is thick, it rubs in easily.</li>
            <li>Not sure if the product is effective.</li>
            <li>We first used this on our 4 month old.</li>
            <li>This is the only sunscreen I will use on my sweet lil&#x27; bubs skin.</li>
            <li>So far it works very well!</li>
            <li>I used this sunscreen for the first time with my 3 year old yesterday at the pool.  </li>
            <li>It is greasy, but it&#x27;s no big deal, and again, it&#x27;s not bad.  </li>
            <li>And I love not having to track it down in a store somehwere.</li>
            <li>I got this product for my 2 year old daughter after a long hard search for a safe and effective sun protection.</li>
            <li>So, yes, it is safe and has a lot of good ingredients and none of the bad, but I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know whether it is something to do with my particular skin chemistry but the promised &amp;#34;it fades away&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;it rubs in&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I purchsed this only because of its safe ingridients but it was way too white for me</li>
            <li>Slathered it on, and lo and behold, it did wonders for that diaper rash, and it&#x27;s been better since than any of the other natural diaper rash ointments we&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more of this in the future.</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s super white, doesn&#x27;t sink in skin and leave traces on car seat, stroller and everywhere, it worked for my son.</li>
            <li>Do not have particular reason not to like this product, after all a sun block is a sun block.  </li>
            <li>i bought this sunscreen because it rated so highly on several websites but it leaves a super oily/greasy feeling</li>
            <li>It does go on whitish, but rubs in quickly and does not tint her skin a white color.  </li>
            <li>I mainly used the EWG skindeep database web site.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little strong smelling and sticky at first</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, our 4 year old has semi-allergic reactions to a good amount of sunscreens and it makes it very hard to find one that not only works-but is comfortable for her.  </li>
            <li>I am giving this a high rating for the natural/no chemical aspect of the product, as well as</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product despite its above-average price.</li>
            <li>its a lot more natural than other sunscreens on the market.</li>
            <li>and I sweat a little more with</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very thick and provides good coverage.</li>
            <li>I know there is a whole line of Badger products and they are rated highly for their natural ingredients and sun protection...</li>
            <li>Overall he really is usually not out for in the heat of the day for more than an hour or so (we live in southern California)  but he hasn&#x27;t had a sunburn yet.  </li>
            <li>Great sun protection, however it&#x27;s difficult to rub in and might have an off-putting scent to some.</li>
            <li>but it is all definitely worth the extra 5 minutes it takes to rub in.</li>
            <li>Not wanting to put just anything on my kid (especially since it would get absorbed into the skin), I did a lot of research on the safest, and gentlest sunblocks for the littlest of littles.</li>
            <li>I did extensive research before selecting a sunscreen that was best for my twins...without a bunch of nasty chemicals and quite effective.</li>
            <li>It does eventually get absorbed into the skin and not so white after</li>
            <li>It does have a different smell, but it&#x27;s not bad (and I have a sensitive sense of smell).  </li>
            <li>Nice and thick.</li>
            <li>I know this sunscreen is supposed to be very good for my son because it&#x27;s all natural amongst other things - but it takes FOREVER to apply because it is so thick.</li>
            <li>The new formula is neither lumpy nor gritty, goes on more easily, and doesn&#x27;t have the weird \\&quot;fresh tobacco leaf\\</li>
            <li>I, like most other people, don&#x27;t love the thick pasty texture.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering my second one right now</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s natural and not full of toxins.</li>
            <li>We live in Florida and we are a beach family.  </li>
            <li>We live in Texas and have a pool in our backyard and this sunscreen is</li>
            <li>I live in Florida</li>
            <li>We live in Hawaii and she is out in the sun a lot</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a new fan of the product.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida</li>
            <li>Bought a new bottle (and there are no crystals in it)</li>
            <li>They mailed a new tube to me with this year&#x27;s updated formula, and I got the new tube literally within two days of contacting customer service.</li>
            <li>It does go on white, but it&#x27;s very creamy and the white fades fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>Since they are not babies anymore and this sunscreen is super thick, I use it more for their face, neck, back of the neck, and ears.</li>
            <li>But I feel really good knowing that it&#x27;s not irritating my kids skin or making his eyes uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>My eldest has very sensitive skin/eczema</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not great for daily use at the office that&#x27;s for sure, but it&#x27;s just fine for the playground and outdoor weekend outings.</li>
            <li>The other product is good, but some how washes off after a little while in the water.</li>
            <li>We have removed the Shea and Cocoa Butter from most of our new 2013 sunscreen creams to avoid further clumping.posed to extreme temperature variations.</li>
            <li>I tried to use it for the first time and the back of the bottle burst apart.</li>
            <li>well, tried mineral chemical-free sunscreen for the first time bc of what i&#x27;ve read recently.</li>
            <li>We haven&#x27;t had a sunburn since using this, and it&#x27;s safe to use on small babies.</li>
            <li>We wish we used this one first at the beach on our baby instead of another one that we did not put enough and her arms and chest got burned.</li>
            <li>while it did provide sun protection, it was pasty white as described by many other reviewers, stained dark swim suits and was thick/hard to smooth on soft children&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>I am so disappointed, and do not recommend using this on anyone with fair skin or in the strong sun, which completely defeats its purpose as sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Based on previous reviews, I wouldn&#x27;t have tried this sunscreen except that I picked it up at Marshall&#x27;s on the cheap.</li>
            <li>It has very lite natural smell that you can barely notice.</li>
            <li>but it sinks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave her skin feeling tacky.</li>
            <li>I feel really good about my decision because I&#x27;m confident that this sunscreen doesn&#x27;t contain a lot of the bad chemicals that a lot of other sunscreens do and it works really well.</li>
            <li>pain with this sunscreen is that it is not the easiest to rub in, so she usually ends up white, streaky, and greasy - but I don&#x27;t care that much given it&#x27;s keeping her safe.</li>
            <li>It does have a smell that I can&#x27;t quite place, but it is not bad per se, and unlike other reviewers have said I don&#x27;t find the smell to stick around.</li>
            <li>I much prefer to keep my kids shaded from the sun whenever possible (sunhats, light, loose clothing, etc), but there are just some situations where sunblock seems necessary.</li>
            <li>It is hard to find sunscreen that is somewhat safe and works.</li>
            <li>Unlike other organic sunscreens, this brand spread easily on our skin and left no trace of white-colored splotches.  </li>
            <li>also bought Babo Botanicals 30 SPF Clear Zinc Sunscreen for times</li>
            <li>But we have to reapply it often when swimming (every 45 minutes at most) and it makes your skin a grayish purple color, which is just kind of annoying.  </li>
            <li>Like all natural sunscreens this makes me look like I slathered myself in chalk.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not harsh and hasn&#x27;t stained any of his clothes.</li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s all natural, as I don&#x27;t use chemicals on my skin anymore.  </li>
            <li>I could not wipe it off fast enough.</li>
            <li>And of course it is natural.  </li>
            <li>The problem being that it is so greasy it never actually rubs in very well.</li>
            <li>I like that it is natural.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural..  </li>
            <li>Protected my 4 month old from the sun in Hawaii.</li>
            <li>I felt confident it was protecting her delicate skin even when she went in the water.</li>
            <li>Used this sunscreen, went out in the sun for 2 hours and got completely burnt.</li>
            <li>I took my 5 month old to the beach.  </li>
            <li>I did research online and found a site that listed organic and natural sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>He got not reaction from it (though he seems to not have sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>almost ready to go back to chemical sunscreen!  </li>
            <li>I have been using this sunblock exclusively since my now 3 year old was 8 months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m over 50 years old</li>
            <li>So far no burns.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>At some point during the fall, my toddler son developed a diaper rash that we were treating with butt paste.</li>
            <li>old son.</li>
            <li>My 6 month old hasn&#x27;t had any reactions.</li>
            <li>, I had no trouble rubbing it in</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s just a trade up for going all natural.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li>However I&#x27;m not in direct sunlight all day, just through a windshield.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like it because it&#x27;s one of the only sunscreens rated a 0-2 by ewg that claims to be water resistant</li>
            <li>I like that the ingredients are natural.</li>
            <li>I do think the amount of sunscreen used has a learning curve, my husband used it as well but used so much he was white from it.</li>
            <li>This is far too greasy and needs to be reapplied too often.</li>
            <li>I thought this sunscreen would work for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an adult using this product.</li>
            <li>I end up not finishing my 2 yr old.</li>
            <li>In addition, a sunburn resulted from the use of Badger (sunburn was on an adult).  </li>
            <li>I like that they are all natural ingredients inside.</li>
            <li>Like any sunscreen, you do need to reapply frequently.</li>
            <li>Mayo clinic recommended the ingredients in sunscreen as an all natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li>This followed those requirements for a 6 month old baby.</li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s done it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li>I had a 6 month old and a 3 year old by that time.</li>
            <li>Our 18-month old doesn&#x27;t even get tan with this stuff on, and it doesn&#x27;t bother his eczema.</li>
            <li>I am a fan of badger and appreciate its natural qualities.</li>
            <li>Used this on my 9 month old at the beach.  </li>
            <li>He wasn&#x27;t really in the sun enough to cause concern, so I cannot comment on the SPF.  </li>
            <li>My son breaks out at any sunscreen (3 years old) except this one.  </li>
            <li>Protected my 10 month old.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s organic and natural</li>
            <li>Spreads nicely on sensitive baby skin.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very creamy, so I have to spread a lot before i can go outside</li>
            <li>I like natural products on my babies.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 2 year old and 7 month old because it was rated a number 1 on the ewg.</li>
            <li>With her being so young</li>
            <li>The ingredients are natural and non-toxic.  </li>
            <li>I wear unscented everything and can&#x27;t even go near the perfume section in Macys.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see that you have to reapply every 40 minutes when they are in the water.  </li>
            <li>No matter how much I try to rub it in it leaves a white film.</li>
            <li>I feel safe putting this on baby and it goes on so thick she won&#x27;t burn</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to bother him in a major way, but if you have a very sensitive kid, maybe don&#x27;t put it on his/her hands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a big fan of the sent but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for a natural, safe product</li>
            <li>I use it daily as my main block ( 80% of aging is photo-aging, so utilizing this block&lt;br</li>
            <li>smells funny, feels heavy, oily, too much....</li>
            <li>I gave 4 stars only because I&#x27;m not certain if my daughters super sensitive skin can handle it quite yet.  </li>
            <li>Downside to physical sunscreens that are highly recommended is that they are all creams or lotions.</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li>Finally, as others have noted, it leaves a noticeable white residue that makes it less suitable for even non-athletic activities, such as driving in a convertible.</li>
            <li>Oh and last but not least the smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Though it&#x27;s thick and can leave a white appearance where applied, it&#x27;s working well and kept her sensitive skin safe from the sun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Tried this sunscreen for my little one after using the environmental working group (Ewg.org) website to find a sunscreen that was as free as possible from harmful chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Because we live in the AZ desert, sunscreen is a daily necessity.</li>
            <li>We live in TX and are outside all the time.</li>
            <li>This is probably what also causes the negative - easy to rub off.  </li>
            <li>But it is easy to apply when on the beach because it is not as thick.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to the smell that makes all sunblock smell like sunblock, especially as I am applying it to my children.</li>
            <li>And if you use it in the humid tropics, it feels really gross and sticky, like you have a sheet of cling film on your skin, and it doesn&#x27;t let you sweat properly to cool down.</li>
            <li>One major concern with sunscreen and babies is that they can over heat with water resistant sunblocks.  </li>
            <li>(well I mean it is after all intended for swimming), but goes on easy.</li>
            <li>According to studies, this is the leading brand in sun block with all the right, less harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li>It gets good coverage, comes out consistently (not separating into oily and goopy mess as some do), but it is pretty thick, so you need to rub it in well to avoid the white streaks.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is ranked very high on goodguide,com which means it is safe to use on babies (and anyone else), but it&#x27;s a little thick and it takes some massaging to spread it evenly.</li>
            <li>Very thick, which is ok.</li>
            <li>My only wish would be that it could go on clear.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually helped clear up our eczema, and I swear my skin has never been softer.</li>
            <li>Barely any color change at all.</li>
            <li>I did a lot of research to find a sunblock that I trust for my baby since I was using it when she was 4 months old - which is earlier than recommended.  </li>
            <li>My 3yo lives at the beach and his 7month old sister is following suit.</li>
            <li>My family loves this natural sunscreen -- thought we&#x27;d try a different scent.</li>
            <li>and it rubbed in completely with no white streaks or pastiness.</li>
            <li>I applied this sunscreen on my 6 month old prior to going in the sun.</li>
            <li>I have tried several natural sunscreens on my kiddos...</li>
            <li>Four stars because it&#x27;s kind of difficult to apply on baby&#x27;s skin</li>
            <li>It is rich, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Many people advise no sunblock before 6 months of age, but we live at the beach and avoiding the sun is difficult.</li>
            <li>It was just *slightly* tacky at first.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick and protects my babies from the sun without using harsh chemicals found in many baby sunscreens!</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is VERY greasy and does not rub in as well as some other Zinc Oxide sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>This has kind of a funny smell and is difficult to completely rub in, other than that, it works as expected for sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and thick so, even though it takes a bit to spread it, a little dollop goes a looong way.</li>
            <li>Probably a safe and effective sunscreen, but it&#x27;s so disgusting</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell weird, rubs in clear, works well, mostly organic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s harder to rub into the skin, but at least I can tell where I&#x27;ve applied the sunscreen :)</li>
            <li>still worth it for the piece of mind when in the sun with a little one!</li>
            <li>My daughter did get a little burned the first time we used it</li>
            <li>Great ingredients, goes on rather thick but smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave that bad of a residue like some of the other natural sunscreens.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit hard to spread and to work in, but I think that is true for all kids sunblock that have zinc dioxide.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does take a little while to rub in but my 3 year old grandson, who is less than patient, is able to stay still long enough to rub in the white</li>
            <li>He says it works, is not uncomfortable in terms of oily or greasy on your skin, and has only a slight scent.</li>
            <li>She wasn&#x27;t happy about that :-(</li>
            <li>but we don&#x27;t have to use it as long on a rash to get it to clear up...)</li>
            <li>We used this on our 7 month old for a week long trip to Mexico.</li>
            <li>It is really thick and greasy but it is a safer formula than many other brands.</li>

            <li>Maybe it&#x60;s not the easiest to put on but a little bit covers large area.</li>
            <li>Certainly the tube we have at home is going to waste in our house.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it doesnt react to this (on my face), but it does give me a rash and very dry skin on my neck.</li>

            <li> I like that it is on EWG&#x27;s list as a good product.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a baby shower gift and she absolutely loved it</li>
            <li> Still good EWG ratings, but WAY easier to work with (and smells nicer too).</li>
            <li> If this is the case, please check the expiration date to ensure that your product is still good.</li>
            <li> If this is the case, please check the expiration date to ensure that your product is still good.</li>
            <li> This Badger baby sunscreen cream, which we originally bought for our grandchildren, is the one he likes the best.</li>
            <li> Smells great, gives good coverage, and works ok for about an hour- two in the water.</li>
            <li> Best part is that it&#x27;s SAFE, and I&#x27;m confident I&#x27;m not spreading a bunch of chemicals on our skin.</li>
            <li> It works wonderfully and I&#x27;m pleased that it&#x27;s safe for my daughter&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, strong but pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s working great no allergies and  safe ingredients</li>
            <li> I greatly appreciate that it has safe ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Works great, no terrible rash from using the product.</li>
            <li> and I am very satisfied with the sun protection of this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this works great and</li>
            <li> Nice smell and good for the skin.</li>
            <li> I love Badger&#x27;s sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen!</li>
            <li> They should be more carefull with baby products!</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen!  </li>
            <li> The SPF is excellent though and I continue to use it on her legs and arms when out in the hot NC sun.</li>
            <li> on top of that Vitamen Shop refuses to give me a refund on the product!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> , I love all the badger sunscreens!</li>
            <li> As a bonus, I love the way it smells!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> As a bonus, my baby loves to look at the cute badger on the tube and it keeps him occupied while I apply the sunscreen!</li>
            <li> My kids love it!</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen for our daughters and ourselves!</li>
            <li> This product impressed me with the amount of information supporting the ingredients in their product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s organic which makes me feel better about slathering it on him and the smell is pleasant and he giggles when we put it on his face.</li>
            <li> This one is the best compromise of less chemicals but effective protection, and is the best value of those with comparable ratings by the EWG.</li>
            <li> It is very effective and has a very mild scent.  </li>
            <li> amazing coverage, but a bit sticky to apply...</li>
            <li> This product is amazing for both my kids and me.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> I have used the Badger 35 SPF Sport sunscreen on myself for many years before I had a baby and have always loved it.</li>
            <li> Nice product.  </li>
            <li> Like it, its all good for babies, but could be more lotion (easier to spread in their skins).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell rubs in nicely on my baby&#x27;s skin.  </li>
            <li> I liked both sunscreens, but this one seems sturdier and I can&#x27;t find the aveeno baby anymore.  </li>
            <li> It rubbed in nicely and was not sticky or smelly.  </li>
            <li> Also, others described a nice scent....</li>
            <li> and now I kind of like the smell</li>
            <li> After much research - this is the BEST sunscreen you can get for your child.</li>
            <li> (she&#x27;s kind of blotchy).</li>
            <li> I researched and continually saw good reviews for Badger and I am so glad we made the switch.</li>
            <li> but it rubs in nicely</li>
            <li> Use on my own face as well.</li>
            <li> I really liked this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen has a pleasant smell and worked great for our babies first summer.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing sunblock I did a lot of research on the sunblock before purchasing if it does not have any harmful chemical additives is very natural and Perfect to use on your newborn child as well as yourself.</li>
            <li> Also I experienced some mild breakouts by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> The sun protection this stuff gives is as good as or better than most sun screens for kids.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and am still searching for the perfect sun screen for my face.</li>
            <li> But also a very strong smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely one of the best choices in sunscreen if you want safe and effective!</li>
            <li> All natural and works great!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my daughter when she was 4 months old and was very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I do think the loving naturals gave better protection though this one seems to wear off quicker.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Zinc Oxide for over 30 years on my own skin and love that they have made a product for kids to help protect their skin without all the harmful chemicals out there.</li>
            <li> Love love love!</li>
            <li> It rubs in fairly well in my son&#x27;s fair skin but on my Colombian skin it doesn&#x27;t - a small price to pay for superb sun protection, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> A mild pleasant fragrance.  </li>
            <li> This sunscreen is OK but smells very strong.</li>
            <li> Over all, we loved it, we all used it specially our 9 months baby.</li>
            <li> It has been wonderful on my little boy and I&#x27;m happy it meets the ewg.org top list.</li>
            <li> While it did provide some sun protection and water resistance was good, I did get more sun color than I&#x27;m comfortable with and more than I&#x27;ve gotten with chemical sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Great protection, when on it does feel pretty greasy</li>
            <li> Good seller &amp; quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I like this and though it has a strong smell, you get kind of used to it</li>
            <li> This sunscreen smells good, isn&#x27;t sticky, and I feel good about putting it on my 1 year old!</li>
            <li> 15 minutes after applying it my son leaned against a cabinet and it was all over the cabinet, which did not leave me confident that it was still on him.</li>
            <li> or I would for sure return it.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Excellent product definitely would order again.</li>
            <li> To date, this is definitely the best organic sunscreen we have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen and have bought more.  </li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Badger sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen for my baby and want to use it on myself as well.</li>
            <li> I ran out of my favorite sunscreen EVER and this was what I tried using as the replacement.</li>
            <li> It protected my babe&#x27;s precious skin on a Florida beach in June.  </li>
            <li> My favorite sunblock for baby.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a delightful physical blocker sunscreen--</li>
            <li> What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> /&gt;While it&#x27;s a healthy option for him, it&#x27;s not practical.</li>
            <li> After doing more research on ones they listed I decided on this one.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s ok for my kids if it is safe.</li>
            <li> I do not know what is safe anymore....</li>
            <li> I could not smell the calendula at all and calendula is one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li> and I couldnt be more pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I love that this product is made up of minerals that sit on top of the skin deflecting harmful rays as opposed to chemicals that rub into the skin and get into the body.</li>
            <li> It contains one of my favorite ingredient, Calendula (a flower with healing properties ).  </li>
            <li> No sunburn after many days at the pool, but it is SO greasy.</li>
            <li> I love this SPF.</li>
            <li> I love Badger and its dedication to the highest level of quality in the marketplace.  </li>
            <li> I love badger products.</li>
            <li> and i love the fact i am putting something safe on my childe.</li>
            <li> I also like Adorable Baby</li>
            <li> It works well, though, and I use it for mostly their face.</li>
            <li> Some of these sunblocks are stinky, and this one doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming odor.</li>
            <li> I love the ingredients in this</li>
            <li> and I love that Badger is continually working toward improving their formulas.  </li>
            <li> If it is safe for baby it is safe for me.</li>
            <li> I guess you either love it or don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a safe sunscreen for my children when I came across this.  </li>
            <li> Still in search of the perfect sunscreen, if there is such a thing...</li>
            <li> and my daughter was free of sunburn and skin reactions!</li>
            <li> I was glad I did as it worked just as well as Unscented</li>
            <li> Our favorite suntan lotion for the kids.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I tried many sunscreens for my 1.5 y.o.</li>
            <li> We love this in our family.</li>
            <li> We absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I appreciate that it&#x27;s a safe product to put on my baby, but</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how well this would work.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m ok with that if it blocks the sun</li>
            <li> More if on water.</li>
            <li> We are now going to try ThinkSport Kid Safe Sunscreen, which is a 20% zinc oxide formula.</li>
            <li> I love that its organic, however, so I will continue to use it on my child.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t care because I feel better about this brand than many.</li>
            <li> It smells ok.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen for its safe reviews but you have to reapply every hour or so depending on your child&#x27;s skin.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I chose this option because I felt it was safe to put on my 6 month baby</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> I will keep looking for something better.</li>
            <li> Burn and irritation free!</li>
            <li> Safe for kids, does the job protecting from sun.  </li>
            <li> so its dons&#x27;t smell appealing</li>
            <li> I feel confident that I&#x27;m not using any harmful chemicals on his skin.</li>
            <li> Love love love Badger products.  </li>
            <li> The sunscreen stayed on even in chlorine water - NO sunburned babies and NO nasty chemicals in this product.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to the ingredients in most sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> so we are really pleased.  </li>
            <li> I love the safe ingredients, but it is a bit too oily which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> We love this sunscreen for our baby. ..</li>
            <li> There are plenty of equally safe alternatives that go on nice and smoothly.</li>
            <li> Much better than Babo sunscreen, although I&#x27;m still a fan of their sunscreen stick for faces.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something that rubs in better for adults, try the lotion.</li>
            <li> , i love the smell of chamomille and calendula</li>
            <li> But this just goes on better, without a whitening effect, and I feel like it gets rubbed in better. :)</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen for my baby.</li>
            <li> In most cases, the clumping is caused by the crystallization of Shea and Cocoa Butter.</li>
            <li> I made sure to reapply hourly.</li>
            <li> the money, you can find better.</li>
            <li> I hope this helps  : )</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s because this is a safe product that sits on top of the skin rather than a more toxic product that would leech into your bloodstream.</li>
            <li> In most cases, the clumping is caused by the crystallization of Shea and Cocoa Butter.</li>
            <li> No sunburn, no nasty chemicals, and a sweet smelling, safe baby!</li>
            <li> Badger is one of the most highly recommended baby sunscreens and we will happily recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> But again, the most important thing for us was safe ingredients, so it does the job fine!</li>
            <li> I have also tried Poofy Organics and it is good, with a similar consistency, but I prefer this one because it has a pleasant scent of Chamomile tea.</li>
            <li> I love badger products and love that this a chemical free.  </li>
            <li> We are happy that Badger uses all natural (and mostly organic) ingredients and a zinc oxide formula.</li>
            <li> Really good product, in fact I think we will replace our own adult (read toxic) sunscreens with this also.</li>
            <li> GREAT natural product!  </li>
            <li> First of all, it contains wonderful SAFE ingredients that I can feel good about putting on my kids sensitive, pure skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pleasant smell, but like any strong smell can be a turnoff in large quantities.  </li>
            <li> It has such a pleasant scent of chamomile and calendula that I want to buy a bottle for myself to use this summer as well!</li>
            <li> It definitely works, and my children are very fair skinned and prone to sunburns.  </li>
            <li> Besides the fact that its all natural, the sunscreen smells great.  </li>
            <li> one of the most important deterrents in shielding from environmental damage ).  </li>
            <li> So happy to find a sunscreen that is natural.  </li>
            <li> I was happy to see that her sensitive skin didn&#x27;t break out in a rash from this product but</li>
            <li> However, if that is the price to pay for a chemical free sunscreen, then I&#x27;ll gladly accept those terms.  </li>
            <li> It smells great (and natural)</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, all organic, natural ingredients and really protects from the sun!</li>
            <li> This is a great sun block for our 9 month old.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t mind that at all as the sun protection is more important to me.</li>
            <li> Good for the whole family.</li>
            <li> The cream dries nicely if allowed 15 minutes to be absorbed as the directions state.</li>
            <li> if you compare it to other non-toxic sunscreens it is awesome.</li>
            <li> It is sticky so sand didn&#x27;t brush off easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t have any smell.</li>
            <li> It does not go on as easily as Devita sunscreen, but that is not specifically marketed for babies.</li>
            <li> but it is lightweight so it does rub off easily.  </li>
            <li> It rubs in easily and protects my baby in the sun.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to spread and not too greasy.  </li>
            <li> The baby SPF 30 has worked well on my fair and sensitive skinned boys that love the outdoors.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am happy with this product because I am happy that I can protect my baby not only from the sun, but from the chemicals used in most sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> Super safe ingredients.  </li>
            <li> but  in general it&#x27;s very nice</li>
            <li> Effective, gentle sun screen</li>
            <li> This is great product without additional potentially harmful additives, which is why we use it.</li>
            <li> A bit greasy but works great as in definitely prevents sunburn.</li>
            <li> Our pediatrician recommended no sunscreen, but I did not feel comfortable with that.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s fabulous.  </li>
            <li> We were away from home one day when I had to change his poopy diaper, though, and I discovered that I had no diaper rash ointment of any kind in the diaper bag to put on his still very rashy bottom.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product is biodegradable and tube is BPA free</li>
            <li> I have 4 kids to cover so efficiency is important to us</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s not like regular sunscreen smells great either).</li>
            <li> This sunscreen rates great on the Skin Deep database.  </li>
            <li> enjoy the smell</li>
            <li> Since this is made for babies&#x27; sensitive skin, I assumed it would be good for my face.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I brought this because it claimed to be &amp;#34; all natural&amp;#34; and had a pretty good review on amazon (there wasn&#x27;t alot to choose from if you wanted to pick something &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I wanted a natural yet effective sunscreen for my baby that is safe and this fits all of those qualifications.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It goes on nicely and love how natural and safe it is - hoping I will be able to use it on my 3 year old!</li>
            <li> As long as my son is getting good, safe protection.</li>
            <li> stuff has a pleasant, light scent from the chamomile and leaves the skin moisturized (not greasy) a short time after applying.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and goes on thick but rubs in easily.</li>
            <li> I am using safe sunscreen on myself and my children, thanks!</li>
            <li> On top of that, I actually think it smells pretty nice!</li>
            <li> Their zinc oxide atomizing process must not be as significant as Neutregena or the like.</li>
            <li> I read through the ingredients and realized that they were exactly the same ones that I would expect to find in a good diaper ointment - and if it&#x27;s safe for baby&#x27;s face, it&#x27;s probably safe for his bum, too, right?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many sunscreens on my kids (both of whom have sensitive skin), and I LOVE this one.  </li>
            <li> We use this on our own personal beach where there won&#x27;t be many people seeing the kids.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not my favorite, but this is a more natural sunscreen</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard wonderful things about this product, so I was surprised to find that this product was gritty since it&#x27;s designed for babies.</li>
            <li> I was so happily surprised to find that I even adore the badger baby sunscreen even more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that if I reapply at about 1 1/2 hours she doesn&#x27;t get burned at all, just a little tan (she&#x27;s usually very fair).</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend it and plan to buy more when it runs out.</li>
            <li> getting wet, the protection is not as great I had hoped.</li>
            <li> i like this product as it goes on without being too white and seems like it would offer good protection.</li>
            <li> Full article:  </li>
            <li> We were only in the sun for a couple of hours  had applied well in advance of going out, and range in skin tone from fair to tans-easily, but all of us were charred.  </li>
            <li> and I  finally found a sunscreen I feel good about using.</li>
            <li> My sweet baby girl was protected without my worries.</li>
            <li> We spend full weekends in the sun.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this sunscreen but it is very greasy.  </li>
            <li> No bad smell</li>
            <li> No bad ingredients.</li>
            <li> We looked up the chemical contents of each ingredient and found this to be among the best products, in terms of least damaging to your sweet baby&#x27;s skin, on the market.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Goes on easily, the last type I had (loving naturals??)</li>
            <li> WOW...the strong odor is pretty off-putting.  </li>
            <li> Works well and its Safe for her new skin!</li>
            <li> And yes, it is greasy but that soaks in fairly quickly and has not been a problem for us.  </li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I was expecting it to be super greasy and pasty.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a decent alternative and has received a respectable rating from the Environmental Working Group guide.</li>
            <li> The main ingredient is zinc oxide which I love.  </li>
            <li> Positive is that it is natural and more healthy than some.  </li>
            <li> As long as youhave an unexpired bottle without the crystals it should workjust fine - we love it!</li>
            <li> all natural ingredients, No chemical preservatives, this physical sunblock is perfect for protecting all summer long&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparing this physical blocker among others with greater zinc oxide %</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy that it&#x27;s more natural than the other brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> this is easier to put on than previous formulas which is great.  </li>
            <li> Goes on easily and really covers.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply and reapply, didn&#x27;t cause eye issues - but didn&#x27;t do much sun protection.</li>
            <li> I used this last summer for the first time and had no issues with burns on my kids - loved it.</li>
            <li> The cream is pretty thick and takes some time to rub in, somewhat oily, but they sun coverage is PERFECT</li>
            <li> This is the only sunscreen that we use, and we love it!  </li>
            <li> Each one I tried I also tried on my face since I have SUPER sensitive skin and most sunscreens make my skin itch or burn.  </li>
            <li> Provides great coverage for my little girl.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product, just a little pricy.  </li>
            <li> I think it rubs in nicely, though a little more rubbing is required to get it all in.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing, it has only one detail</li>
            <li> you or your child have sensitive skin to most sunscreens or skin care products, then this should suit you well.  </li>
            <li> Love it on me and my 18th mo old.</li>
            <li> Blends well, and has a fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> Well worth staying away from chemicals though.</li>
            <li> Well it is a bit greasy but eventually is absorbed.  </li>
            <li> it is not as white on the skin as you would expect from the oxide that was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it to avoid a allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s all the way absorbed.</li>
            <li> and it did not get absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it&#x27;s FREE of the ingredients that possibly cause cancer!!</li>
            <li> In my opinion, it is worth the effort, since I am not rubbing in toxic chemicals into  my child.  </li>
            <li> The quality in the sunscreen and its effectiveness to protect my children&#x27;s skin naturally is worth the price.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use a sunscreen on my daughter that was safe and all natural, with no harmful chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the $$.</li>
            <li> I also lean towards more natural products.</li>
            <li> While I do love that this is natural, non-nano,</li>
            <li> It might be natural and safe to use</li>
            <li> But worth it to avoid all the chemicals.</li>
            <li> The EWG gives this a rating of a 1, which is rare for sunscreens.</li>
            <li> So natural and safe for my baby.</li>
            <li> I researched safe sunscreens for my 8 month old knowing</li>
            <li> and I love how natural all the ingredients are.  </li>
            <li> Love using all natural sunscreen</li>
            <li> I like that this is safe sunscreen free of all the toxins that the other ones are filled with.  </li>
            <li> Applies easy and stays on in normal, non-swimming use.  </li>
            <li> We live in AZ (#2 for skin cancer in the world) and my little guy has very fair skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it three times and have just come on Amazon right now to order another bottle of the California baby, and figured I&#x27;d take a minute to voice my opinion on this one.</li>
            <li> right in.&lt;br</li>
            <li> right in.&lt;br</li>
            <li> right in.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a very mild smell which my son appreciates :) it&#x27;s definitely worth the money I spent on it</li>
            <li> It is thicker than traditional chemical sunscreens, but it was very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Rubs in well, no super white, and smells delicious.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this sunscreen has been great and it makes me feel secure knowing it doesn&#x27;t contain dangerous chemicals her skin will absorb, but she&#x27;ll still be safe from the sun&#x27;s rays.</li>
            <li> so it takes a certain technique to get it on quickly</li>
            <li> Well we loved it but then found out the lot we received was recalled so marking it down from 5 stars to 2 stars based on that recall and the fact we used it.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and has a nice texture (it isn&#x27;t clumpy or really greasy like other baby-friendly sunblock lotions).  </li>
            <li> As others have said, this sunscreen requires more rubbing in than the typical drugstore sunscreen, but knowing that I&#x27;m putting a safe product on my toddler makes the extra effort worthwhile.</li>
            <li> The sunblock holds up in the water well, and we have found that, as long as we re-apply it after about 2 hours of swimming (in full sun) it continues to offer the protection that our kids need to keep their skin healthy and not get</li>
            <li> I love that this product does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, without any of the harsh ingredients of many of its competitors on the market.  </li>
            <li> Also, because it doesn&#x27;t sink in and my toddler squirms, I worry that she&#x27;s just wiping it off on whatever she&#x27;s wearing or sitting on (nice white streaks on my couch, thanks very much).</li>
            <li> The woman at the all natural store in my town said that the badger brand was very popular and similar to the California baby super sensitive.</li>
            <li> was super thick/sticky and took a long time to rub it in, this brand goes on much better.</li>
            <li> Ilike this product very much.</li>
            <li> Great product, we use this for a 2 year old who breaks out from every other sunscreen we&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> I have a fair freckled little girl</li>
            <li> I wanted a good sunscreen for my little one by the pool.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, and it does take a minute to rub in, but we&#x27;ve been very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is the only sunscreen I have found that doesn&#x27;t cause a rash, and I&#x27;ve tried many.  </li>
            <li> I always am sure that I buy enough bottles before summer starts</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was the greasiness.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> Badger Baby is comparable to Cetaphil Dermacontrol Moisturizer (a chemical sunscreen which I would also recommend for faces/under make-up) and Mineral Fusion moisturizer (which has a higher spf of 40 and a stronger herby scent).</li>
            <li> my kids, however, couldn&#x27;t stand the smell so it has not been used after the first day.</li>
            <li> Next time I will just be applying more.  </li>
            <li> Smells great, moisturizing, thick and doesn&#x27;t irritate my toddler&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> but my child was out with it on and got burnt to a crisp.  </li>
            <li> We tested this on a hot sunny day at the beach.</li>
            <li> This one was mentioned numerous times, on many websites and blogs.</li>
            <li> It is a bit greasy at first, turns the skin whitish before it is fully rubbed in, and takes longer to rub in than normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent is light and natural.</li>
            <li> and I use adorable baby for daily use (glides on and no weird color).</li>
            <li> It works very well!</li>
            <li> Works great - goes on a bit thick</li>
            <li> This one is much easier to rub in, if it were cheaper, I&#x27;d have given it 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I stopped using it after the first use.  </li>
            <li> I put it in the sun first to &#x27;melt&#x27; it</li>
            <li> Babyganics sunscreen was much better and left no oily residu</li>
            <li> As Dr. Oz said, \\&quot;White is right\\&quot; when it comes to safe sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> While it goes on pretty well and the water beads up showing it&#x27;s still applied</li>
            <li> &quot; smell that my first tube had.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on myself for a few months -- it probably is safe (I will take the EWG&#x27;s research/word on it) and smells pleasant enough, but it was less effective than I had hoped.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really care for it right when it&#x27;s put on, but then after awhile it kinda smells like iced tea.</li>
            <li> so much so that my daughter who is normally fine with wearing sunscreen whines and nearly cries when we tell her</li>
            <li> After extensive research on the EW Skin Deep database, I purchased this for its good rating as a non-toxic sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it takes slightly more effort but its really not even worth mentioning.  </li>
            <li> It does work well and the easy application on my 1 1/2 year old gets this item a high ranking from me.</li>
            <li> Buy the California baby super sensitive and try that first.</li>
            <li> Love the smell but so chalky it takes too long to put on the kids.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very greasy and rubs off at the slightest touch, which is pretty counterproductive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good sunscreen, thick but not too thick, great for covering the baby and my tattoos.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a small price to pay for good sun protection.</li>
            <li> Feels a little sticky/thick at first, but spreads nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave yucky residue on skin afterwards.</li>
            <li> this summer, most from the top of the list from EWG (think baby, that other australian one with a lizard on it, and neutrogena baby faces).</li>
            <li> my kids happen to be super sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a creamy texture and applies easily without making my skin chalk white</li>
            <li> Then it spreads easily on my face and disappears without a white film  </li>
            <li> Just remember that it is necessary to reapply sunscreen when it has rubbed off (which happens easily with mobile children and towels when swimming) or your child has been in the water for a while.  </li>
            <li> it definitely has a fairly strong chamomile smell.</li>
            <li> This has a strong chamomile scent when initially used that subsides after it&#x27;s been rubbed in.  </li>
            <li> I got a large scrape on my arm from my wetsuit but still needed to put SPF on for the remainder of the triathlon I was in.</li>
            <li> We have removed the Shea and Cocoa Butter from most of our new 2013 sunscreen creams to avoid further clumping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> We have removed the Shea and Cocoa Butter from most of our new 2013 sunscreen creams to avoid further clumping.</li>
            <li> We use just a little bit, rub in in our fingers to warm it up, dot it on area then rub it in.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally this stuff really does not play well with sand, unless you actually want to be covered in a fine layer that cannot be removed even with vigorous scrubbing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and feels like it creates a great barrier on my baby&#x27;s</li>
            <li> The lid is flimsy and has broken on a couple of mine, but this is a great product</li>
            <li> Re-application of the sunscreen occurred every one to two hours, as the kids spent most of their time swimming in the ocean.  </li>
            <li> and I felt this sunscreen really worked for him.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five starts is because it isn&#x27;t tear free.  </li>
            <li> and this works really well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I really like this product.</li>
            <li> We tried Babyganics (which had great reviews on line) and he had a reaction (rash all over face and behind ear), so I lost the 18 dollars I paid for 2 bottles.</li>
            <li> found that the greasiness of the product made it much easier to rub into the skin to reduce the whiteness created by the zinc oxide.</li>
            <li> But keeping your child safe from some of the really yucky chemicals in regular sunscreens is worth the extra effort of rubbing it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Protects skin really well.</li>
            <li> All those things don&#x27;t matter that much</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really tested in water yet, since it claims to be water proof.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is greasy but it felt very greasy on my hands.</li>
            <li> Because you have to reapply the tube goes fast.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it myself too and really like it.</li>
            <li> Our daughter is very fare skinned and melanoma runs in my family, so I am very cautious when it comes to sun.</li>
            <li> It is a very herbal-y scent.</li>
            <li> can&#x27; complain too much</li>
            <li> I suspect it is water resistant if you are setting gently in the water</li>
            <li> We were at a water park and even with reapplication it seems to be rubbed off by touching floats and by the rough water.  </li>
            <li> Did not seem to give him much protection.</li>
            <li> On the plus side you dont need to use much for coverage.</li>
            <li> but I think it is bc there is too much product.  </li>
            <li> Babies really need the cream, though.</li>
            <li> And I actually really like the smell.</li>
            <li> He played in the pool for longer than the recommended 40 minutes, and still didn&#x27;t so much as tan.</li>
            <li> I love the spray version of sunscreens, but so far, no physical sunscreens come in sprays.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I ordered this product after extensive research on natural sunscreens.</li>
            <li> And my baby burned- not terribly (though I&#x27;m sure it would have been worse if we were in the sun longer)</li>
            <li> we only put natural ingredients on and in our body, but we also love to be out in the sun.</li>
            <li> I have somehow come to own several tubes of Badger sunscreens (of different types) and have decided to give them away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly thick, but it does the job to protect their fair skin.  </li>
            <li> I like that this is all-natural, seems to do the job, and gets good ratings from the Environmental Working Group, but MAN, is it thick and pasty.</li>
            <li> Since the other brands have cancer causing ingredients it is refreshing to find a product we can use .</li>
            <li> It has great ingredients and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and I feel better about slathering it on my kid than lots of other stuff out there.</li>
            <li> I do like natural sunscreens, but we found this to be very, very greasy.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic and while it is thick, it rubs in easily.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the product is effective.</li>
            <li> We first used this on our 4 month old.</li>
            <li> This is the only sunscreen I will use on my sweet lil&#x27; bubs skin.</li>
            <li> So far it works very well!</li>
            <li> I used this sunscreen for the first time with my 3 year old yesterday at the pool.  </li>
            <li> It is greasy, but it&#x27;s no big deal, and again, it&#x27;s not bad.  </li>
            <li> And I love not having to track it down in a store somehwere.</li>
            <li> I got this product for my 2 year old daughter after a long hard search for a safe and effective sun protection.</li>
            <li> So, yes, it is safe and has a lot of good ingredients and none of the bad, but I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know whether it is something to do with my particular skin chemistry but the promised &amp;#34;it fades away&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;it rubs in&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I purchsed this only because of its safe ingridients but it was way too white for me</li>
            <li> Slathered it on, and lo and behold, it did wonders for that diaper rash, and it&#x27;s been better since than any of the other natural diaper rash ointments we&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more of this in the future.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s super white, doesn&#x27;t sink in skin and leave traces on car seat, stroller and everywhere, it worked for my son.</li>
            <li> Do not have particular reason not to like this product, after all a sun block is a sun block.  </li>
            <li> i bought this sunscreen because it rated so highly on several websites but it leaves a super oily/greasy feeling</li>
            <li> It does go on whitish, but rubs in quickly and does not tint her skin a white color.  </li>
            <li> I mainly used the EWG skindeep database web site.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little strong smelling and sticky at first</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, our 4 year old has semi-allergic reactions to a good amount of sunscreens and it makes it very hard to find one that not only works-but is comfortable for her.  </li>
            <li> I am giving this a high rating for the natural/no chemical aspect of the product, as well as</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product despite its above-average price.</li>
            <li> its a lot more natural than other sunscreens on the market.</li>
            <li> and I sweat a little more with</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and provides good coverage.</li>
            <li> I know there is a whole line of Badger products and they are rated highly for their natural ingredients and sun protection...</li>
            <li> Overall he really is usually not out for in the heat of the day for more than an hour or so (we live in southern California)  but he hasn&#x27;t had a sunburn yet.  </li>
            <li> Great sun protection, however it&#x27;s difficult to rub in and might have an off-putting scent to some.</li>
            <li> but it is all definitely worth the extra 5 minutes it takes to rub in.</li>
            <li> Not wanting to put just anything on my kid (especially since it would get absorbed into the skin), I did a lot of research on the safest, and gentlest sunblocks for the littlest of littles.</li>
            <li> I did extensive research before selecting a sunscreen that was best for my twins...without a bunch of nasty chemicals and quite effective.</li>
            <li> It does eventually get absorbed into the skin and not so white after</li>
            <li> It does have a different smell, but it&#x27;s not bad (and I have a sensitive sense of smell).  </li>
            <li> Nice and thick.</li>
            <li> I know this sunscreen is supposed to be very good for my son because it&#x27;s all natural amongst other things - but it takes FOREVER to apply because it is so thick.</li>
            <li> The new formula is neither lumpy nor gritty, goes on more easily, and doesn&#x27;t have the weird \\&quot;fresh tobacco leaf\\</li>
            <li> I, like most other people, don&#x27;t love the thick pasty texture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering my second one right now</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s natural and not full of toxins.</li>
            <li> We live in Florida and we are a beach family.  </li>
            <li> We live in Texas and have a pool in our backyard and this sunscreen is</li>
            <li> I live in Florida</li>
            <li> We live in Hawaii and she is out in the sun a lot</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a new fan of the product.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida</li>
            <li> Bought a new bottle (and there are no crystals in it)</li>
            <li> They mailed a new tube to me with this year&#x27;s updated formula, and I got the new tube literally within two days of contacting customer service.</li>
            <li> It does go on white, but it&#x27;s very creamy and the white fades fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> Since they are not babies anymore and this sunscreen is super thick, I use it more for their face, neck, back of the neck, and ears.</li>
            <li> But I feel really good knowing that it&#x27;s not irritating my kids skin or making his eyes uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> My eldest has very sensitive skin/eczema</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not great for daily use at the office that&#x27;s for sure, but it&#x27;s just fine for the playground and outdoor weekend outings.</li>
            <li> The other product is good, but some how washes off after a little while in the water.</li>
            <li> We have removed the Shea and Cocoa Butter from most of our new 2013 sunscreen creams to avoid further clumping.posed to extreme temperature variations.</li>
            <li> I tried to use it for the first time and the back of the bottle burst apart.</li>
            <li> well, tried mineral chemical-free sunscreen for the first time bc of what i&#x27;ve read recently.</li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t had a sunburn since using this, and it&#x27;s safe to use on small babies.</li>
            <li> We wish we used this one first at the beach on our baby instead of another one that we did not put enough and her arms and chest got burned.</li>
            <li> while it did provide sun protection, it was pasty white as described by many other reviewers, stained dark swim suits and was thick/hard to smooth on soft children&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed, and do not recommend using this on anyone with fair skin or in the strong sun, which completely defeats its purpose as sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Based on previous reviews, I wouldn&#x27;t have tried this sunscreen except that I picked it up at Marshall&#x27;s on the cheap.</li>
            <li> It has very lite natural smell that you can barely notice.</li>
            <li> but it sinks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave her skin feeling tacky.</li>
            <li> I feel really good about my decision because I&#x27;m confident that this sunscreen doesn&#x27;t contain a lot of the bad chemicals that a lot of other sunscreens do and it works really well.</li>
            <li> pain with this sunscreen is that it is not the easiest to rub in, so she usually ends up white, streaky, and greasy - but I don&#x27;t care that much given it&#x27;s keeping her safe.</li>
            <li> It does have a smell that I can&#x27;t quite place, but it is not bad per se, and unlike other reviewers have said I don&#x27;t find the smell to stick around.</li>
            <li> I much prefer to keep my kids shaded from the sun whenever possible (sunhats, light, loose clothing, etc), but there are just some situations where sunblock seems necessary.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find sunscreen that is somewhat safe and works.</li>
            <li> Unlike other organic sunscreens, this brand spread easily on our skin and left no trace of white-colored splotches.  </li>
            <li> also bought Babo Botanicals 30 SPF Clear Zinc Sunscreen for times</li>
            <li> But we have to reapply it often when swimming (every 45 minutes at most) and it makes your skin a grayish purple color, which is just kind of annoying.  </li>
            <li> Like all natural sunscreens this makes me look like I slathered myself in chalk.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not harsh and hasn&#x27;t stained any of his clothes.</li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s all natural, as I don&#x27;t use chemicals on my skin anymore.  </li>
            <li> I could not wipe it off fast enough.</li>
            <li> And of course it is natural.  </li>
            <li> The problem being that it is so greasy it never actually rubs in very well.</li>
            <li> I like that it is natural.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural..  </li>
            <li> Protected my 4 month old from the sun in Hawaii.</li>
            <li> I felt confident it was protecting her delicate skin even when she went in the water.</li>
            <li> Used this sunscreen, went out in the sun for 2 hours and got completely burnt.</li>
            <li> I took my 5 month old to the beach.  </li>
            <li> I did research online and found a site that listed organic and natural sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> He got not reaction from it (though he seems to not have sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> almost ready to go back to chemical sunscreen!  </li>
            <li> I have been using this sunblock exclusively since my now 3 year old was 8 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m over 50 years old</li>
            <li> So far no burns.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> At some point during the fall, my toddler son developed a diaper rash that we were treating with butt paste.</li>
            <li> old son.</li>
            <li> My 6 month old hasn&#x27;t had any reactions.</li>
            <li> , I had no trouble rubbing it in</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s just a trade up for going all natural.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li> However I&#x27;m not in direct sunlight all day, just through a windshield.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like it because it&#x27;s one of the only sunscreens rated a 0-2 by ewg that claims to be water resistant</li>
            <li> I like that the ingredients are natural.</li>
            <li> I do think the amount of sunscreen used has a learning curve, my husband used it as well but used so much he was white from it.</li>
            <li> This is far too greasy and needs to be reapplied too often.</li>
            <li> I thought this sunscreen would work for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an adult using this product.</li>
            <li> I end up not finishing my 2 yr old.</li>
            <li> In addition, a sunburn resulted from the use of Badger (sunburn was on an adult).  </li>
            <li> I like that they are all natural ingredients inside.</li>
            <li> Like any sunscreen, you do need to reapply frequently.</li>
            <li> Mayo clinic recommended the ingredients in sunscreen as an all natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This followed those requirements for a 6 month old baby.</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s done it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> I had a 6 month old and a 3 year old by that time.</li>
            <li> Our 18-month old doesn&#x27;t even get tan with this stuff on, and it doesn&#x27;t bother his eczema.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of badger and appreciate its natural qualities.</li>
            <li> Used this on my 9 month old at the beach.  </li>
            <li> He wasn&#x27;t really in the sun enough to cause concern, so I cannot comment on the SPF.  </li>
            <li> My son breaks out at any sunscreen (3 years old) except this one.  </li>
            <li> Protected my 10 month old.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s organic and natural</li>
            <li> Spreads nicely on sensitive baby skin.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very creamy, so I have to spread a lot before i can go outside</li>
            <li> I like natural products on my babies.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 2 year old and 7 month old because it was rated a number 1 on the ewg.</li>
            <li> With her being so young</li>
            <li> The ingredients are natural and non-toxic.  </li>
            <li> I wear unscented everything and can&#x27;t even go near the perfume section in Macys.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see that you have to reapply every 40 minutes when they are in the water.  </li>
            <li> No matter how much I try to rub it in it leaves a white film.</li>
            <li> I feel safe putting this on baby and it goes on so thick she won&#x27;t burn</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to bother him in a major way, but if you have a very sensitive kid, maybe don&#x27;t put it on his/her hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of the sent but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for a natural, safe product</li>
            <li> I use it daily as my main block ( 80% of aging is photo-aging, so utilizing this block&lt;br</li>
            <li> smells funny, feels heavy, oily, too much....</li>
            <li> I gave 4 stars only because I&#x27;m not certain if my daughters super sensitive skin can handle it quite yet.  </li>
            <li> Downside to physical sunscreens that are highly recommended is that they are all creams or lotions.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li> Finally, as others have noted, it leaves a noticeable white residue that makes it less suitable for even non-athletic activities, such as driving in a convertible.</li>
            <li> Oh and last but not least the smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though it&#x27;s thick and can leave a white appearance where applied, it&#x27;s working well and kept her sensitive skin safe from the sun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tried this sunscreen for my little one after using the environmental working group (Ewg.org) website to find a sunscreen that was as free as possible from harmful chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Because we live in the AZ desert, sunscreen is a daily necessity.</li>
            <li> We live in TX and are outside all the time.</li>
            <li> This is probably what also causes the negative - easy to rub off.  </li>
            <li> But it is easy to apply when on the beach because it is not as thick.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to the smell that makes all sunblock smell like sunblock, especially as I am applying it to my children.</li>
            <li> And if you use it in the humid tropics, it feels really gross and sticky, like you have a sheet of cling film on your skin, and it doesn&#x27;t let you sweat properly to cool down.</li>
            <li> One major concern with sunscreen and babies is that they can over heat with water resistant sunblocks.  </li>
            <li> (well I mean it is after all intended for swimming), but goes on easy.</li>
            <li> According to studies, this is the leading brand in sun block with all the right, less harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> It gets good coverage, comes out consistently (not separating into oily and goopy mess as some do), but it is pretty thick, so you need to rub it in well to avoid the white streaks.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is ranked very high on goodguide,com which means it is safe to use on babies (and anyone else), but it&#x27;s a little thick and it takes some massaging to spread it evenly.</li>
            <li> Very thick, which is ok.</li>
            <li> My only wish would be that it could go on clear.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually helped clear up our eczema, and I swear my skin has never been softer.</li>
            <li> Barely any color change at all.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research to find a sunblock that I trust for my baby since I was using it when she was 4 months old - which is earlier than recommended.  </li>
            <li> My 3yo lives at the beach and his 7month old sister is following suit.</li>
            <li> My family loves this natural sunscreen -- thought we&#x27;d try a different scent.</li>
            <li> and it rubbed in completely with no white streaks or pastiness.</li>
            <li> I applied this sunscreen on my 6 month old prior to going in the sun.</li>
            <li> I have tried several natural sunscreens on my kiddos...</li>
            <li> Four stars because it&#x27;s kind of difficult to apply on baby&#x27;s skin</li>
            <li> It is rich, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Many people advise no sunblock before 6 months of age, but we live at the beach and avoiding the sun is difficult.</li>
            <li> It was just *slightly* tacky at first.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and protects my babies from the sun without using harsh chemicals found in many baby sunscreens!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is VERY greasy and does not rub in as well as some other Zinc Oxide sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> This has kind of a funny smell and is difficult to completely rub in, other than that, it works as expected for sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and thick so, even though it takes a bit to spread it, a little dollop goes a looong way.</li>
            <li> Probably a safe and effective sunscreen, but it&#x27;s so disgusting</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell weird, rubs in clear, works well, mostly organic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s harder to rub into the skin, but at least I can tell where I&#x27;ve applied the sunscreen :)</li>
            <li> still worth it for the piece of mind when in the sun with a little one!</li>
            <li> My daughter did get a little burned the first time we used it</li>
            <li> Great ingredients, goes on rather thick but smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave that bad of a residue like some of the other natural sunscreens.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit hard to spread and to work in, but I think that is true for all kids sunblock that have zinc dioxide.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does take a little while to rub in but my 3 year old grandson, who is less than patient, is able to stay still long enough to rub in the white</li>
            <li> He says it works, is not uncomfortable in terms of oily or greasy on your skin, and has only a slight scent.</li>
            <li> She wasn&#x27;t happy about that :-(</li>
            <li> but we don&#x27;t have to use it as long on a rash to get it to clear up...)</li>
            <li> We used this on our 7 month old for a week long trip to Mexico.</li>
            <li> It is really thick and greasy but it is a safer formula than many other brands.</li>

            <li> Maybe it&#x60;s not the easiest to put on but a little bit covers large area.</li>
            <li> Certainly the tube we have at home is going to waste in our house.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it doesnt react to this (on my face), but it does give me a rash and very dry skin on my neck.</li>
            <li> I decided on the Badger product due to its fairly natural ingredient list.</li>
            <li> When compared to other natural sunscreens it applies easier.  </li>
            <li> We had been using Burt&#x27;s Bees natural sunscreen (our first natural sunscreen), but it was difficult to rub in</li>
            <li> really thick, makes skin white, also my kids both burned while in the pool first time they went in, and we had applied it correctly</li>
            <li> Of course, the cream is thick and leaves a whitish layer on the skin, but to me it is worth it to avoid the mainstream sunblocks&#x27; long list of chemicals.</li>
            <li> works great at what it&#x27;s supposed to do, block the sun, but very thick and a little hard to spread on.  </li>
            <li> It looks a little funny when it goes on, our could-be-mistaken-for-British child turns a shade paler due to the consistency of the lotion when he has this on.</li>
            <li> It doest the job, smells nice, and doesn&#x27;t have super horrible junk in its ingredient list.</li>
            <li> This product is very very white and takes a long time to rub in, otherwise you will look like a ghost.  </li>
            <li> Also, you have a white cover for a long time so if you are in the city or at a park, people will know you have sunscreen on.</li>
            <li> Worked well down south for my 7 month old baby.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find a natural sunscreen that is sensitive to your skin and this is both.</li>
            <li> We live on a California beach and our baby has pale skin.</li>
            <li> If you keep them too long, the oil will separate out, and then when you squeeze it out, you either get an oil slick coming out, or a paste that is even more thick and even harder to put on.</li>
            <li> It is thick, but certainly manageable.  </li>
            <li> Overall, costs for these physical sunblocks are more per ounce than the usual retail versions, but these last much longer, at least for me, so I don&#x27;t feel like they are too expensive.</li>
            <li> It leaves my baby a little shiny, but it did not irritate his sensitive skin not once.</li>
            <li> It uses all natural ingredients and has little to no odor.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very greasy and hard to rub in.</li>
            <li> My baby has a nice tan, has not burned, and has not had any bad reactions to the sunscreen on her skin.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t stick around long.</li>
            <li> Just a pity it does not work for me personally.</li>
            <li> She kept whining for a long time after I applied it on.</li>
            <li> I always put a heavy coating on them instead of rubbing it completely in, and they have never burned once while using it</li>
            <li> There was a bit of a grey cast even after you rub it in.</li>
            <li> daughter also likes that it doesn&#x27;t appear to have any strange chemicals and acts as a barrier</li>
            <li> This will be our go to sunscreen for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> I have used it on my 9 month old daughter a few times and have had no sun burns or tans yet.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> (although, I won&#x27;t have to for a long while it seems) and recommend.</li>
            <li> /&gt;He&#x27;s never in the sun that long</li>
            <li> Even my 5 year old becomes impatient.</li>
            <li> I find that it takes a long time for the zinc ozide to penetrate the skin.</li>
            <li> Unless you have a mirror or dont care about white streaks I&#x27;d be careful with even application.</li>
            <li> I love that I didn&#x27;t have to worry about extra chemicals to block our kiddos from the sun, it as a thicker base and acted more like a water repellent, it didn&#x27;t run into their eyes and kept them burn free.</li>
            <li> Very sticky and thick.  </li>
            <li> It goes on a bit thick but doesn&#x27;t take much rubbing for it to even out on baby&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> The only down side is that it doesn&#x27;t soak in so when my daughter plays outside dirt sticks all over her.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times and are fine with the sun protection, however the product stinks...</li>
            <li> He got the lotion all over everything he touched and it has a blue iridescent color to it that got all over his stroller and every other thing he touched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> DD started getting a little red, but I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s sunburn or her skin just turning red</li>
            <li> I originally bought california baby sunblock for my kids but california baby has now become way too expensive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant smell and it is thick enough that you&#x27;ll need a good wipe or wash to get it off your fingers after application.</li>
            <li> This is similar to what might happen in a chocolate bar if it is exposed to extreme temperature variations.</li>
            <li> This is similar to what might happen in a chocolate bar if it is exposed to extreme temperature variations.</li>
            <li> She does look a little pale with the sunscreen on but it doesn&#x27;t really bother me</li>
            <li> After lathering my daughter with a VERY generous amount of this sunscreen, she came home from watching a baseball game with her dad with VERY red arms.  </li>
            <li> It is all natural though, so I&#x27;m not entirely sure of the difference.).</li>
            <li> This is thick just like the other ones, but I find it much easier to apply.</li>
            <li> Some people complain about the white residue or greasy feeling, but I think that is typical for mineral based sunscreens.</li>
            <li> My kid was definitely pink after spending not more than 20 minutes under direct sunlight at the beach.</li>
            <li> Super thick to the point of being hard to rub in.</li>
            <li> It have them both very dry skin, like a rash.</li>
            <li> This cream did not make my child break out into strange rashes like every other cream.</li>
            <li> It does what is intended to do, down side is when applying it&#x27;s white and thick, but has to keep rubbing it until it turns into a clear protective water proof layer.</li>
            <li> They got a little bit red.</li>
            <li> Little bet greasy compare to the regular sunblock.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used this on our little one when going out on sunny days locally, overseas, at the beach, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Little greasy for daily use</li>
            <li> It is a little thick, so tough to be sure it&#x27;s applied everywhere.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that this cream is a tiny bit greasy.</li>
            <li> It is natural, doesn&#x27;t irritate baby&#x27;s delicate skin.</li>
            <li> I think that one should be expected.  </li>
            <li> It has a minimal amount of ingredients and works well.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t bother me that my children look like ghosts while wearing because they have never gotten sunburned or pink while wearing this.</li>
            <li> This is thicker and a bit harder to rub on a squirmy kid.  </li>
            <li> It does feel a bit greasy when applied, but after a few minutes it soaks in so it&#x27;s really a big deal.  </li>
            <li> is to be expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been extremely careful with my kids in the sun</li>
            <li> but it is not very &amp;</li>
            <li> Not really greasy.</li>
            <li> One thing I will say is that the people who burned when they spent all day at the beach may not have been reapplying every 40 minutes as the manufacturer recommends.</li>
            <li> I like that its all natural, but its really thick and greasy.</li>
            <li> Oh how I hate greasy sunscreens, and both of my fair haired children burned the few times I used this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very spreadable, it&#x27;s difficult to apply in all the right spots.</li>
            <li> and she returned home as pale as when we left!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not strong or gross.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way with this stuff and we will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;***Note: If the little clumps are really HARD and GRITTY, they may be the Zinc Oxide particles clumping together, and this could potentially affect the level of protection you are receiving.</li>

            <li> /&gt;***Note: If the little clumps are really HARD and GRITTY, they may be the Zinc Oxide particles clumping together, and this could potentially affect the level of protection you are receiving.</li>
            <li> Tried this sunscreen the other day and found that a little bit can go a long way.</li>
            <li> It is somewhat difficult to apply but I can live with that especially when having in mind that there are no chemicals and harmful substances.</li>
            <li> Then, when you get to the end of the tube, it&#x27;s very very hard to squeeze out the last 15-20% of the tube (because by that time, the stuff inside has become so thick and viscous, and even if the tube is not too old, it&#x27;s still really hard to squeeze out the last bits), that you just give up and throw it away, so you really only get to use 80-85% of what you pay for.</li>
            <li> If you keep your baby in the direct sun for over an hour as some reviewers have mentioned, it&#x27;s not surprising that they burned.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> then we will make due.</li>
            <li> The scent is almost non-existent and won&#x27;t clash with other lotions or perfumes.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> It may be due to its extreme greasiness.</li>
            <li> A little of this sunscreen goes a long way and it does the job!</li>
            <li> The bigger issue, though, is that it is easily rubbed off by a T-shirt collar if you are active at all, so I tended to get a ring of sunburn around the base of my neck, even after applying quite a bit of sunscreen.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unlike other reviews</li>
            <li> So extremely sticky and greasy.</li>
            <li> Not sure it&#x27;s actually working.</li>
            <li> I usually start applying this sunscreen on my two-year-old&#x27;s face because it&#x27;s easier to rub it on his arms and legs at the end when he is getting restless and starting to squirm away.</li>
            <li> some other people are saying, I&#x27;ve had to rub in every brand of sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever had</li>
            <li> it did leave my dons head a little dry.</li>
            <li> Be very careful with kids and babies.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li> I decided to research on sunscreens and I learned that zinc oxide requires a dispersing agent (e.g. non-surface active polymer or a surface-active substance like polyhydroxystearic acid or PEG-#s) to prevent them to clump together or drop at the bottom of the bottle.</li>
            <li> so it last longer but my son is very pale and he will get burnt if you don&#x27;t keep reapplying.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda hard to apply and absorb on the skin, so it requires extra time to apply compared to other sunscreen products(Neutrogena or thinkbaby brands).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little greasy but that&#x27;s to be expected</li>
            <li> and she has not even gotten so much as a little pink when wearing this.</li>
            <li> This one only lasts 40 minutes … which is usually longer than the amount of time our little guy stayed in the water.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i researched extensively the least toxic sunscreen for my baby.</li>
            <li> Goes on a bit white, but at least you know you covered all exposed areas.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that it takes forever to rub in, but I already knew that.  </li>
            <li> At least its healthier than the regular one</li>
            <li> It definitely protects her delicate skin.</li>
            <li> I was very hopeful about this product because I don&#x27;t want to risk harm to my baby with all the chemicals in sunscreen, but unfortunately it did not work at all.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars because its so thick.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love this sunscreen, but I don&#x27;t necessarily hate it either...</li>
            <li> No matter how thick I smear it on, my kids seem to get awfully red.  </li>
            <li> This one is unscented,  a bit thick so it will take a bit extra effort to blend it out onto the skin.  </li>
            <li> After a few minutes the greasy goes away and it absorbs so its really not a problem.</li>
            <li> The reason I now own several tubes is that I was given 2 by someone who couldn&#x27;t use it because she hated that it was too thick and greasy.</li>
            <li> This won the award hands down.</li>
            <li> And then as you sweat it dribbles down in streaks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past 3 months now, and my fair-skinned baby has not had a single rash or sunburn.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it any greasier than conventional sunscreens and it runs less when you get a little sweaty.</li>
            <li> Her slight rash could be coincidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I have to rub it in again about a half an hour after applying.</li>
            <li> I found it to be too greasy and heavy, also my skin is so sensitive there is something in it that I found irritating.  </li>
            <li> I used a much less on myself and the kids and didn&#x27;t have that issue.</li>
            <li> and you use less.</li>
            <li> alone)- if you&#x27;re applying less than that, you&#x27;re risking sun damage.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll take it for less chemicals on my children&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s very hard to rub in, leaves white, chalky appearance.  </li>
            <li> The only (and not really a big deal for everything else it does) is that it is VERY thick, and hard to get off afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Less expensive than other products that are completely natural.</li>
            <li> It was a mess.</li>
            <li> We also have a few other Badger products and they have won me over with their quality!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, but is a little hard to get to spread on a squirming baby.</li>
            <li> The major complaint I have is that it goes on really thick and greasy.</li>
            <li> First, it comes out of the tube in a thick paste that is difficult to apply evenly.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about ordering this after reading some of the reviews but decided to try it anyway since it is all-natural.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They suntan a little bit with the sunscreen but not burnt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather have white-faced children for 10 minutes than put chemicals on their little fair-skinned bodies.  </li>
            <li> It is a little thicker and can look &amp;#34;white&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care if my kid is white from thick sunscreen--he&#x27;s a kid!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little greasy/heavy, and doesn&#x27;t have the longest staying power in the water, but for everyday use</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s tough to get a toddler totally covered.  </li>
            <li> The smell is different, but hardly noticeable, and the texture is thick and pasty and requires some elbow grease to evenly rub in all over the little ones</li>
            <li> Note - it&#x27;s very thick and white.</li>
            <li> Prepare to have very thick white cream all over.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I have it 4 stars is because it is REALLY thick and hard to spread on.  </li>
            <li> It is pasty and can make you a little pale</li>
            <li> Just wish I had tried it sooner so it wouldn&#x27;t have been a waste.</li>
            <li> I have worn this backpacking for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used it a few times and it seems to work well.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done w/o all the harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> After it is on for a few minutes, I no longer notice the scent</li>
            <li> am so relieved to have a product that I can use to protect my daughter from the sun without having to worry about harsh chemicals and ingredients.</li>
            <li> I did not have any trouble applying it, although I had to get a stick sunscreen for my baby&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> I do feel like it&#x27;s heavy on my face</li>
            <li> I use this everyday on face and mech too of hands.  </li>
            <li> I tried other brands but they are so hard to apply.</li>
            <li> Two hours running around the beach and the kid is still pale with no tan lines.  </li>
            <li> If you have a pale skinned kid, I&#x27;d go elsewhere.</li>
            <li> but otherwise she stayed pale as ever.</li>
            <li> Only bad thing is baby&#x27;s eyes seem to hurt a tiny bit if he rubs his eyes with sunscreened hands, even hours after application.</li>
            <li> It can be a little thick</li>
            <li> I little thick</li>
            <li> The closed end opened soon after purchase and it the product is very thick.</li>
            <li> It is very thick and my son does not enjoy being slathered down</li>
            <li> I may just have to deal with some artificial chemicals to avoid the hassle of natural sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I have used it on my 2 kids for the past two years.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this on our 9 month-old son for the past three months</li>
            <li> I used this with both of my small children during the summer and had no problems with sunburn.</li>
            <li> Neither of my kids had a sunburn, although one had a small spot of sunburn where I must have missed applying this.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy Badger Unscented</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about this stuff.</li>
            <li> We usually reapply it after about 45 min of use at the beach.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t get past it.</li>
            <li> It is hard to apply when it is a little bit hard because of the air conditioner.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it&#x27;s just too thick, too oily and leaves a white film.</li>
            <li> So, not suitable for the face.</li>
            <li> With a 6 month old - this is impossible.</li>
            <li> Hard to rub in and don&#x27;t like the consistency</li>
            <li> Yes, it is hard to put on, but after you rub it in for a while, it disappears into the skin.  </li>
            <li> Hard to put on a squirmy child.</li>
            <li> It rubs off easily so it hardly gives you any protection from the sun.</li>
            <li> They are really thick and greasy and hard to spread on the skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s thick at all or hard to rub in like</li>
            <li> Smooths on well for baby&#x27;s delicate skin.</li>
            <li> It is thick, but I don&#x27;t care, my kids don&#x27;t burn or breakout (one has eczema).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kindof thick and pasty</li>
            <li> Thick to spead on their skin</li>
            <li> This is a bit thick</li>
            <li> Zinc oxide a tad thick though.</li>
            <li> As others noted, this stuff is thick.</li>
            <li> Too Thick... doesn&#x27;t absorb at all</li>
            <li> Yes, it is thick.</li>
            <li> It is too thick.</li>
            <li> If you like everything about this sunscreen except for its thick texture, I have a suggestion.  </li>
            <li> but it was so thick and pasty.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit thick to smear on.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so thick and feels greasy.</li>
            <li> Too thick.....</li>
            <li> Too thick for our liking.</li>
            <li> Thick as frosting.</li>
            <li> Thick lotion that covers well and prevents sunburns.  </li>
            <li> It takes very little to go along way!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for every family with small children!</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never experienced any sunburns after using this product for the past 2 years and I feel protected when I am outdoors(feels</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick &amp; creamy (and a little greasy), but it does its job!!!</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned about some of the reviews saying it was difficult to apply.  </li>
            <li> (It almost smelled like natural insect repellent, but not sure if it repelled mosquitoes for us).</li>
            <li> Too thick to rub in!</li>
            <li> This works well for kids as well as adults, it goes on very thick, so you need to rub it in well.</li>
            <li> I said, it is very thick.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s VERY thick.</li>
            <li> Very thick and doesn&#x27;t blend well.</li>
            <li> Very thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasent scent but it is very thick.  </li>
            <li> Not a fan of unnecessary chemicals.  </li>
            <li> However its a thick paste, so a bit difficult to spread on yourself.</li>
            <li> Yes, he is tan on his legs, but I think that might be because I&#x27;m not great about re-applying and his legs stick out from under the stroller sunshade, and let&#x27;s face it</li>
            <li> but this was worse.  </li>
            <li> I covered dd13m in this stuff and went to a ball game.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the ingredients, but this particular one smells terrible.</li>
            <li> Horrible - consistency of balmex diaper cream leaves a yellow film on the face + hard to wash away.  </li>
            <li> The counsellors at my son&#x27;s summer camp hate it, too, so I wonder if he&#x27;s even getting it or if they&#x27;re just using stuff from the other kids.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS NOT SAFE!!!</li>
            <li> This is a bit closer than some of the others I have tried, but it is still difficult to rub in and leaves a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> faint scent is not off putting&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say that I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> All Badger Balm sunscreens are poorly formulated!</li>
            <li> It makes it a bit difficult to spread.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t find this one anymore difficult.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not wonderful smelling</li>
            <li> It smells weird</li>
            <li> I tried it on myself and followed the directions carefully, but I got terribly burned.</li>
            <li> and I was VERY disappointed to find out it didn&#x27;t protect my little girl on a partly sunny Spring day.  </li>
            <li> Sunscreen was useless!</li>
            <li> Very uncomfortable to wear on the face.</li>
            <li> The whiteness and difficulty of rubbing in is characteristic of all zinc oxide sunscreens (the worst I&#x27;ve used is Burt&#x27;s Bees... terrible!</li>
            <li> Does not have a bad odor.</li>
            <li> This smells really bad.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
            <li> Both Baby &amp; Mama got quite the sunburn while using it and reapplying per the suggested timeline. :(</li>
            <li> Very thick!!!</li>
            <li> This product was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing....</li>
            <li> we hate it.</li>
            <li> BAD for the recall!</li>
            <li> Smelly, greasy and nasty.</li>
            <li> It felt so horrible on my skin</li>
            <li> Losing two stars for the bad smell!!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars because its so thick. However, it kept my 10 month olds skin perfectly  not sun kissed while we were in Abu Dhabi. Literally the middle of the desert.</li>
            <li> Takes forever to rub in.  15 minutes after applying it my son leaned against a cabinet and it was all over the cabinet, which did not leave me confident that it was still on him.</li>
            <li> i would not order this again. I tried to use it for the first time and the back of the bottle burst apart. I ordered it in January or I would for sure return it. Just wish I had tried it sooner so it wouldn&#x27;t have been a waste.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very greasy and hard to rub in. It leaves a pasty look on my skin. I&#x27;m not too fond of the smell either.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen. It is somewhat difficult to apply but I can live with that especially when having in mind that there are no chemicals and harmful substances.</li>
            <li> I gave 4 stars only because I&#x27;m not certain if my daughters super sensitive skin can handle it quite yet.  Her slight rash could be coincidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on nicely and love how natural and safe it is - hoping I will be able to use it on my 3 year old!</li>
            <li> Effective, gentle sun screen</li>
            <li> No issues at all when using this on my children&#x27;s faces. They would get hives using everything else. We are so happy to found this product!</li>
            <li> I use this sunscreen on my infant daughter. She used it all summer and never once got burned. It can be a little thick but it sinks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave her skin feeling tacky. There is a tabacco-esque odor to it but it doesn&#x27;t stick around long.</li>
            <li> Works great for my son. I love that it&#x27;s natural and not full of toxins.</li>
            <li> Horrible - consistency of balmex diaper cream leaves a yellow film on the face + hard to wash away.  Had to use make up remover!</li>
            <li> Excellent product definitely would order again.</li>
            <li> I have worn this backpacking for a few years now.  Badger is a great brand and despite being fair skinned, I have not burned while using this product.  The lid is flimsy and has broken on a couple of mine, but this is a great product and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am still searching for the perfect organic sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t go on like sludge. This is a bit closer than some of the others I have tried, but it is still difficult to rub in and leaves a greasy feeling. I may just have to deal with some artificial chemicals to avoid the hassle of natural sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Unlike other organic sunscreens, this brand spread easily on our skin and left no trace of white-colored splotches.  Re-application of the sunscreen occurred every one to two hours, as the kids spent most of their time swimming in the ocean.  To date, this is definitely the best organic sunscreen we have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> Like all natural sunscreens this makes me look like I slathered myself in chalk. I don&#x27;t know whether it is something to do with my particular skin chemistry but the promised &amp;#34;it fades away&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;it rubs in&amp;#34; never happens and I remain pasty white, with the stuff pooling in my elbow creases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally this stuff really does not play well with sand, unless you actually want to be covered in a fine layer that cannot be removed even with vigorous scrubbing.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Excellent choice for my baby and also for me!</li>
            <li> My &#x27;ginger&#x27; son has the fairest skin and I worried about him with the weather changing. This product has been perfect. It&#x27;s organic which makes me feel better about slathering it on him and the smell is pleasant and he giggles when we put it on his face. It&#x27;s not harsh and hasn&#x27;t stained any of his clothes. It&#x27;s a little greasy but that&#x27;s to be expected and I hope to see it work in the water this summer!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing sunblock I did a lot of research on the sunblock before purchasing if it does not have any harmful chemical additives is very natural and Perfect to use on your newborn child as well as yourself. None of the  ingredients are known to cause any cancer.</li>
            <li> I read a ton of reviews before I bought this. And yes, it is greasy but that soaks in fairly quickly and has not been a problem for us.  I actually like that aspect of it.  And yes, it turns you white like a ghost...its zinc oxide people! I think that one should be expected.  It doest the job, smells nice, and doesn&#x27;t have super horrible junk in its ingredient list. What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> i researched extensively the least toxic sunscreen for my baby. This won the award hands down. Your baby will have a layer of white but that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> It works well and I like that its a lot more natural than other sunscreens on the market. It also didnt cause break outs on my son or myself</li>
            <li> Smells great and goes on well!</li>
            <li> A friend asked me to buy it for him.  He says it works, is not uncomfortable in terms of oily or greasy on your skin, and has only a slight scent.</li>
            <li> Good item. Since the other brands have cancer causing ingredients it is refreshing to find a product we can use .</li>
            <li> Great seller. Great product. It&#x27;s thick and protects my babies from the sun without using harsh chemicals found in many baby sunscreens!</li>
            <li> This is the only sunscreen I have found that doesn&#x27;t cause a rash, and I&#x27;ve tried many.  I like that it&#x27;s all natural, as I don&#x27;t use chemicals on my skin anymore.  Applies easy and stays on in normal, non-swimming use.  I do re-apply after an ocean dip, but that needs to be done not matter what sunscreen is used.  I&#x27;ve been using Badger Baby Sunscreen Cream for 2 years now and I haven&#x27;t gotten burned since.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Smelly, greasy and nasty. It felt so horrible on my skin I could not wipe it off fast enough.</li>
            <li> This works well for kids as well as adults, it goes on very thick, so you need to rub it in well. Works great! No bad smell</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen and have bought more.  We live in Florida and we are a beach family.  It has worked well in the water and with sweating.  It is thick, but I don&#x27;t care, my kids don&#x27;t burn or breakout (one has eczema).</li>
            <li> All natural and works great!</li>
            <li> Infant was out all summer and never got burnt. Barely any color change at all.</li>
            <li> We bought this sunscreen after reading up on it for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, our 4 year old has semi-allergic reactions to a good amount of sunscreens and it makes it very hard to find one that not only works-but is comfortable for her.  Badger has made one that works well-even with an SPF rating of only 30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you or your child have sensitive skin to most sunscreens or skin care products, then this should suit you well.  It has a minimal amount of ingredients and works well.  We swim a lot and so my kids are in the sun a good amount of time in the Summer.  The sunblock holds up in the water well, and we have found that, as long as we re-apply it after about 2 hours of swimming (in full sun) it continues to offer the protection that our kids need to keep their skin healthy and not get burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only wish is that it came in a BIGGER size, so that we didn&#x27;t have to re-order so often.  Other than that, I can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and am still searching for the perfect sun screen for my face. Since this is made for babies&#x27; sensitive skin, I assumed it would be good for my face. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s just too thick, too oily and leaves a white film. So, not suitable for the face. Customer service, delivery and packaging were all great though. Just a pity it does not work for me personally. Perfect for babies though!</li>
            <li> This is great product without additional potentially harmful additives, which is why we use it.</li>
            <li> Quality product.  We purchase this every year.</li>
            <li> I got a large scrape on my arm from my wetsuit but still needed to put SPF on for the remainder of the triathlon I was in. I took a chance and slathered the scrape with Badger to help protect it. Braced myself for the &#x27;sting&#x27;...that never came! It helped protect the area so well that I kept putting it on until it was healed just a couple of days later!</li>
            <li> I do like natural sunscreens, but we found this to be very, very greasy. It got on everything--my clothes, my daughters clothes, her hair, the stroller, the car seat. It was a mess. I returned and purchased a different brand.</li>
            <li> Love it on me and my 18th mo old. Great sun protection and safe!</li>
            <li> Blends well, and has a fresh scent.  It is a little thick, so tough to be sure it&#x27;s applied everywhere.</li>
            <li> Goes on a bit white, but at least you know you covered all exposed areas.</li>
            <li> I love Badger&#x27;s sunscreen! It&#x27;s definitely one of the best choices in sunscreen if you want safe and effective!</li>
            <li> It does a very good job of protecting against the sun. And of course it is natural.  The only (and not really a big deal for everything else it does) is that it is VERY thick, and hard to get off afterwards.  Off of you, and the baby!</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen. I have used it on my 2 kids for the past two years. Since they are not babies anymore and this sunscreen is super thick, I use it more for their face, neck, back of the neck, and ears. I have a fair freckled little girl and she has not even gotten so much as a little pink when wearing this. We live in Texas and have a pool in our backyard and this sunscreen is the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, it is very thick. I put a good pea sized drop on my finger and have them close their eyes and rub all over. Even on their eyelids. This is also the one sunscreen my daughter says doesn&#x27;t sting her eyes. A little goes a long way. I had one bottle for an entire summer. Note - it&#x27;s very thick and white. It doesn&#x27;t bother me that my children look like ghosts while wearing because they have never gotten sunburned or pink while wearing this. Love this sunscreen!</li>
            <li> A bit greasy but works great as in definitely prevents sunburn.</li>
            <li> This works great!  I did a lot of research to find a sunblock that I trust for my baby since I was using it when she was 4 months old - which is earlier than recommended.  It is thick, but certainly manageable.  I&#x27;ve been using this for the past 3 months now, and my fair-skinned baby has not had a single rash or sunburn.</li>
            <li> I love badger products and love that this a chemical free.  It works great.  The only down side is that it doesn&#x27;t soak in so when my daughter plays outside dirt sticks all over her.  Well worth staying away from chemicals though.</li>
            <li> This cream did not make my child break out into strange rashes like every other cream. Smells funky but I  it protects properly, like it does then we will make due. Has good ingredients.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Badger sunscreen. I have used the Badger 35 SPF Sport sunscreen on myself for many years before I had a baby and have always loved it. I was so happily surprised to find that I even adore the badger baby sunscreen even more! It has such a pleasant scent of chamomile and calendula that I want to buy a bottle for myself to use this summer as well! It rubs into the skin well and the best part is that it is organic and safe. I always am sure that I buy enough bottles before summer starts so I won&#x27;t ever have to buy a poisonous store brand. I love this sunscreen for my baby and want to use it on myself as well.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my daughter when she was 4 months old and was very happy with the purchase. Many people advise no sunblock before 6 months of age, but we live at the beach and avoiding the sun is difficult. I decided on the Badger product due to its fairly natural ingredient list. Of course, the cream is thick and leaves a whitish layer on the skin, but to me it is worth it to avoid the mainstream sunblocks&#x27; long list of chemicals. We also have a few other Badger products and they have won me over with their quality!</li>
            <li> Well it is a bit greasy but eventually is absorbed.  The white color settles into my wrinkles so I have to rub it in again about a half an hour after applying.</li>
            <li> I ran out of my favorite sunscreen EVER and this was what I tried using as the replacement. The woman at the all natural store in my town said that the badger brand was very popular and similar to the California baby super sensitive. LIES. I&#x27;ve used it three times and have just come on Amazon right now to order another bottle of the California baby, and figured I&#x27;d take a minute to voice my opinion on this one. The first thing I noticed was the greasiness. Oh how I hate greasy sunscreens, and both of my fair haired children burned the few times I used this. The problem being that it is so greasy it never actually rubs in very well. So as soon as your child rubs against something or wipes their face...bye bye sunscreen. If you&#x27;re reading this...trust me. Buy the California baby super sensitive and try that first. You&#x27;ll never need to look for another sunscreen again.</li>
            <li> My baby is very fair. This sunscreen didn&#x27;t irritate her at all, she didn&#x27;t even seem to notice it was on. it is not as white on the skin as you would expect from the oxide that was a nice surprise. -1 star for the smell.  I&#x27;m not a big fan of the sent but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for a natural, safe product</li>
            <li> This product was exactly as described.  We&#x27;ve been using this on our 9 month-old son for the past three months and it&#x27;s great!  It goes on smoothly and has a nice texture (it isn&#x27;t clumpy or really greasy like other baby-friendly sunblock lotions).  We reapplied it every two hours with no sunburn or skin/allergic reactions since it&#x27;s organic.  We would definitely order this product again.</li>
            <li> I like that it is natural. My toddler hates the smell though. She kept whining for a long time after I applied it on.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t smell bad. It protected my babe&#x27;s precious skin on a Florida beach in June.  It is sticky so sand didn&#x27;t brush off easily.</li>
            <li> Nice product.  This sunscreen smells good, isn&#x27;t sticky, and I feel good about putting it on my 1 year old!</li>
            <li> This product does not work... I live in Florida and I tan well. I used this lotion and it was like I didn&#x27;t use sunscreen at all... I am fried!!!</li>
            <li> My favorite sunblock for baby.  Goes on easily and really covers.  Stays on in water.</li>
            <li> Like it, its all good for babies, but could be more lotion (easier to spread in their skins).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TOO BAD for the recall! They should be more carefull with baby products! Always!</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen!  It has a nice smell rubs in nicely on my baby&#x27;s skin.  I would definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is OK but smells very strong. My kids say it smells like pasta. We prefer california baby which isn&#x27;t much more expensive.</li>
            <li> Great product, we use this for a 2 year old who breaks out from every other sunscreen we&#x27;ve ever tried. It&#x27;s kindof thick and pasty but it&#x27;s worth it to avoid a allergic reaction. Arrived in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> Works great! Easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t have any smell. Not greasy and my baby didn&#x27;t get burned even after hours of walking around in the sun.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind the oregano smell but my wife doesn&#x27;t want this on the kids. So, we are sticking with BurnOut.</li>
            <li> I bought this and aveeno baby for my baby.  This is thicker and a bit harder to rub on a squirmy kid.  I don&#x27;t care if my kid is white from thick sunscreen--he&#x27;s a kid!  He doesn&#x27;t care!  Ha!  It does smell a bit hemp-y/herbal-ly, but...it&#x27;s natural..  I don&#x27;t expect it to smell great.  It works great as a sunscreen.  Two hours running around the beach and the kid is still pale with no tan lines.  I liked both sunscreens, but this one seems sturdier and I can&#x27;t find the aveeno baby anymore.  I&#x27;m buying another badger&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> we went to Fort Lauderdale for the week and baby didn&#x27;t burn at all!</li>
            <li> Based on previous reviews, I wouldn&#x27;t have tried this sunscreen except that I picked it up at Marshall&#x27;s on the cheap. It&#x27;s a delightful physical blocker sunscreen--yes, takes a while to rub in, but doesn&#x27;t show up white in my elbow creases later on, and I didn&#x27;t find that it was greasy. It was just *slightly* tacky at first. The scent is almost non-existent and won&#x27;t clash with other lotions or perfumes. Though this is not a moisturizer, I even started using it on my face, and the finish was matte; I didn&#x27;t need powder! I would definitely use it under make-up. Badger Baby is comparable to Cetaphil Dermacontrol Moisturizer (a chemical sunscreen which I would also recommend for faces/under make-up) and Mineral Fusion moisturizer (which has a higher spf of 40 and a stronger herby scent).</li>
            <li> This type of product is the only one that our child can use because of skin reactions to the sunscreens.  Good quality product.</li>
            <li> Four stars because it&#x27;s kind of difficult to apply on baby&#x27;s skin but it&#x27;s working great no allergies and  safe ingredients</li>
            <li> i like this product as it goes on without being too white and seems like it would offer good protection. my kids, however, couldn&#x27;t stand the smell so it has not been used after the first day. my kids happen to be super sensitive to smells. it definitely has a fairly strong chamomile smell.</li>
            <li> Protected my 4 month old from the sun in Hawaii. Some people complain about the white residue or greasy feeling, but I think that is typical for mineral based sunscreens. I felt confident it was protecting her delicate skin even when she went in the water. I would certainly recommend it and plan to buy more when it runs out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many sunscreens on my kids (both of whom have sensitive skin), and I LOVE this one.  I always put a heavy coating on them instead of rubbing it completely in, and they have never burned once while using it (and we play for hours in the water and sun).</li>
            <li> Used this sunscreen, went out in the sun for 2 hours and got completely burnt. Sunscreen was useless!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell weird, rubs in clear, works well, mostly organic. What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> Prepare to have very thick white cream all over.  Too thick to rub in!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good sunscreen, thick but not too thick, great for covering the baby and my tattoos. I recommend this product</li>
            <li> Works well and not too much white on your skin.</li>
            <li> I know this sunscreen is supposed to be very good for my son because it&#x27;s all natural amongst other things - but it takes FOREVER to apply because it is so thick. You are supposed to put it on 15 minutes before going out as well as re-rub it in prior to going out so it&#x27;s all the way absorbed. With a 6 month old - this is impossible. He got the lotion all over everything he touched and it has a blue iridescent color to it that got all over his stroller and every other thing he touched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it&#x27;s a healthy option for him, it&#x27;s not practical.</li>
            <li> I took my 5 month old to the beach.  Our pediatrician recommended no sunscreen, but I did not feel comfortable with that.  I did research online and found a site that listed organic and natural sunscreens.  After doing more research on ones they listed I decided on this one.  I like it because it only lasts 40 minutes.  One major concern with sunscreen and babies is that they can over heat with water resistant sunblocks.  This one only lasts 40 minutes … which is usually longer than the amount of time our little guy stayed in the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend buying a sunhat to also help keep out the sun.  We bought the Zutano Unisex-baby Infant Pastel Solid Sun Hat.&lt;br /&gt;I also bought Babo Botanicals 30 SPF Clear Zinc Sunscreen for times we didn&#x27;t need water resistant sunblock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our baby is fair skinned and I felt this sunscreen really worked for him.  It rubbed in nicely and was not sticky or smelly.  He got not reaction from it (though he seems to not have sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five starts is because it isn&#x27;t tear free.  Other than that, it&#x27;s fabulous.  I was looking for something with a short, benign ingredient list, and this is the one.</li>
            <li> Great ingredients, goes on rather thick but smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave that bad of a residue like some of the other natural sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking it is the safest one out there for my kids. It is pasty and can make you a little pale but it&#x27;s ok for my kids if it is safe. I just found out that zinc oxide nanoparticles cause DNA damage.  I do not know what is safe anymore....I will try to call the company to see what they say about this and update my review.    \\&quot;The Food and Drug Administration does not require manufacturers to test nanoscale additives for a given material if the bulk material has already been shown to be safe.\\&quot;    Full article:  [...]</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen. Spreads easier than others with zinc. Does not have a bad odor.</li>
            <li> well, tried mineral chemical-free sunscreen for the first time bc of what i&#x27;ve read recently. almost ready to go back to chemical sunscreen!  while it did provide sun protection, it was pasty white as described by many other reviewers, stained dark swim suits and was thick/hard to smooth on soft children&#x27;s skin. While it did provide some sun protection and water resistance was good, I did get more sun color than I&#x27;m comfortable with and more than I&#x27;ve gotten with chemical sunscreen. Also, others described a nice scent....I could not smell the calendula at all and calendula is one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li> Probably a safe and effective sunscreen, but it&#x27;s so disgusting we hate it. Like rubbing STINKY, oily candle wax all over your skin. The counsellors at my son&#x27;s summer camp hate it, too, so I wonder if he&#x27;s even getting it or if they&#x27;re just using stuff from the other kids. Certainly the tube we have at home is going to waste in our house. We&#x27;re using Blue Lizard or California Baby instead.</li>
            <li> This has a strong chamomile scent when initially used that subsides after it&#x27;s been rubbed in.  It&#x27;s a pleasant smell, but like any strong smell can be a turnoff in large quantities.  For this reason along with the fact that it comes out yellow I use a different sunscreen for my daughter&#x27;s face.  The SPF is excellent though and I continue to use it on her legs and arms when out in the hot NC sun.</li>
            <li> Less expensive than other products that are completely natural. Smooths on well for baby&#x27;s delicate skin. Good for the whole family. No sunburn!</li>
            <li> Besides the fact that its all natural, the sunscreen smells great.  It is a bit thicker to put on though and she did get a bit of a tan even with it on.  Next time I will just be applying more.  It doesnt rub in well either so your baby will have white marks all over them :P.  Would be perfect in a spray bottle!</li>
            <li> I purchsed this only because of its safe ingridients but it was way too white for me (Chalk white for my asian skin color) and it did not get absorbed into my skin. Also I experienced some mild breakouts by the end of the day. It may be due to its extreme greasiness. I would&#x27;nt recommend it to someone who has darker color skin.</li>
            <li> Great product. It does not include any ingredients I do not want on my children&#x27;s skin. Great product for he money. Thick to spead on their skin but it works well. Good seller &amp; quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I have been using this sunblock exclusively since my now 3 year old was 8 months. I researched a TON before purchasing and I couldnt be more pleased with the product. The smell is different, but hardly noticeable, and the texture is thick and pasty and requires some elbow grease to evenly rub in all over the little ones but it is all definitely worth the extra 5 minutes it takes to rub in. First of all, it contains wonderful SAFE ingredients that I can feel good about putting on my kids sensitive, pure skin. My 3yo lives at the beach and his 7month old sister is following suit. He is in and out of the ocean, building sandcastles and never under the shade. I re apply as I feel necessary and he has NEVER gotten an ounce of redness when using this sunblock. I love that this product is made up of minerals that sit on top of the skin deflecting harmful rays as opposed to chemicals that rub into the skin and get into the body. I couldnt be happier, it is the ONLY sunblock i will use for my family...my husband and I use it for our faces too!</li>
            <li> After extensive research on the EW Skin Deep database, I purchased this for its good rating as a non-toxic sunscreen.  Unfortunately, the first and only time we used it, my entire family burned to a crisp.  We were only in the sun for a couple of hours  had applied well in advance of going out, and range in skin tone from fair to tans-easily, but all of us were charred.  I am so disappointed, and do not recommend using this on anyone with fair skin or in the strong sun, which completely defeats its purpose as sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen out there! Approved on the EWG website with a 1 rating, 1 being the best!</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  Smells great, moisturizing, thick and doesn&#x27;t irritate my toddler&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> Great cream, but leaves stains on clothes, so just apply it on a blanket before you dress up your baby.</li>
            <li> My family loves this natural sunscreen -- thought we&#x27;d try a different scent. Don&#x27;t really care for it right when it&#x27;s put on, but then after awhile it kinda smells like iced tea. Turns out we prefer the tangerine/vanilla that smells like a creamsicle. A little of this sunscreen goes a long way and it does the job!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love this sunscreen, but I don&#x27;t necessarily hate it either... I greatly appreciate that it has safe ingredients.  But we have to reapply it often when swimming (every 45 minutes at most) and it makes your skin a grayish purple color, which is just kind of annoying.  But again, the most important thing for us was safe ingredients, so it does the job fine!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m over 50 years old and I  finally found a sunscreen I feel good about using.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is great, and does not leave your skin greasy.  Not only do my kids use it, but I use it as well.</li>
            <li> Guess it does the job. According to studies, this is the leading brand in sun block with all the right, less harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> I use this sunscreen on my toddler when we go out to the lake. So far no burns. It contains one of my favorite ingredient, Calendula (a flower with healing properties ).  I&#x27;m really happy with it. It also smells great!</li>
            <li> We used this on our 7 month old for a week long trip to Mexico. No sunburn after many days at the pool, but it is SO greasy. It would get everywhere when putting it on ... all over all of our clothes and left a greasy film on both of us.</li>
            <li> Never seems to fully soak into the skin. I am giving this a high rating for the natural/no chemical aspect of the product, as well as, it&#x27;s good protection ability from the sun.</li>
            <li> I love this SPF. It has great ingredients and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I was expecting it to be super greasy and pasty. I was pleasantly surprised. We&#x27;ve used it a few times and it seems to work well. I think it rubs in nicely, though a little more rubbing is required to get it all in.</li>
            <li> Worked well down south for my 7 month old baby. There was a bit of a grey cast even after you rub it in. I didn&#x27;t care since it worked.</li>
            <li> I used this with both of my small children during the summer and had no problems with sunburn. The tube stayed in the diaper bag when summer was over. At some point during the fall, my toddler son developed a diaper rash that we were treating with butt paste. We were away from home one day when I had to change his poopy diaper, though, and I discovered that I had no diaper rash ointment of any kind in the diaper bag to put on his still very rashy bottom. But I did have the tube of Badger sunscreen. I read through the ingredients and realized that they were exactly the same ones that I would expect to find in a good diaper ointment - and if it&#x27;s safe for baby&#x27;s face, it&#x27;s probably safe for his bum, too, right? Slathered it on, and lo and behold, it did wonders for that diaper rash, and it&#x27;s been better since than any of the other natural diaper rash ointments we&#x27;ve tried! (It&#x27;s also more expensive...but we don&#x27;t have to use it as long on a rash to get it to clear up...)</li>
            <li> Tried this sunscreen for my little one after using the environmental working group (Ewg.org) website to find a sunscreen that was as free as possible from harmful chemicals.  It does feel a bit greasy when applied, but after a few minutes it soaks in so it&#x27;s really a big deal.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen! It has been wonderful on my little boy and I&#x27;m happy it meets the ewg.org top list. It gets the job done w/o all the harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I love Badger and its dedication to the highest level of quality in the marketplace.  The organic and soothing blend utilized in their baby formula is a great treatment for the face. I use it daily as my main block ( 80% of aging is photo-aging, so utilizing this block&lt;br /&gt;is one of the most important deterrents in shielding from environmental damage ).  It is rich, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Bought this product because it is organic/natural for my 12 mo. old son. Rubs in well, no super white, and smells delicious. Product works great and my son doesn&#x27;t even mind when I put it on him or his face!</li>
            <li> I love badger products. This works great and i love the fact i am putting something safe on my childe. I also have the bug spray as well</li>
            <li> So happy to find a sunscreen that is natural.  Not a fan of unnecessary chemicals.  My sweet baby girl was protected without my worries.</li>
            <li> 2 beach trips in one month and NO burns!  Smells great too!</li>
            <li> I wanted to like it but my child was out with it on and got burnt to a crisp.  She looked like a lobster.  It didnt work at all.</li>
            <li> Great product! Protects my 9 month and rubs in well.</li>
            <li> I do luv this sunblock from the Badger Company. I hope they NEVER stop making this.&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Uses non nano uncoated zinc oxide 18.75% which provides UVA and UVB coverage&lt;br /&gt;Includes organic ingredients such as sunflower oil, beeswax, and extracts from sea buckthorn, calendula and chamomile essential oil&lt;br /&gt;It has a creamy texture and applies easily without making my skin chalk white&lt;br /&gt;The faint scent is not off putting&lt;br /&gt;The product is biodegradable and tube is BPA free&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never experienced any sunburns after using this product for the past 2 years and I feel protected when I am outdoors(feels good when ur skin isnt burning)&lt;br /&gt;I even use it on my face as a moisturizer/ primer before my make up, makes my skin look dewy&lt;br /&gt;The 2.9 oz tube is great for throwing into any summer bag for reapplying later&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons -None&lt;br /&gt;With all natural ingredients, No chemical preservatives, this physical sunblock is perfect for protecting all summer long&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparing this physical blocker among others with greater zinc oxide %, I prefer Badgers brand formulation. I also like Adorable Baby but this is my goto.&lt;br /&gt;I have to keep in mind, zinc oxide is a physical UV blocker and some whiteness on the skin is to be expected. Personally, the whitened skin doesn&#x27;t bother me...as I&#x27;m not a fan of being tan.</li>
            <li> I wanted a good sunscreen for my little one by the pool. After researching, I decided to give this one a try, and I&#x27;m very happy I did. My 6 month old hasn&#x27;t had any reactions. We reapplied every hour, and was by the pool for 6 hours, and had no burning!</li>
            <li> Because we live in the AZ desert, sunscreen is a daily necessity. I know chemical sunscreens can cause havoc on the endocrine system, so I have been trying to find alternatives (physical sunscreen) for my kids. Downside to physical sunscreens that are highly recommended is that they are all creams or lotions. I love the spray version of sunscreens, but so far, no physical sunscreens come in sprays. This is one of several I have tried, and I like this enough. It gets good coverage, comes out consistently (not separating into oily and goopy mess as some do), but it is pretty thick, so you need to rub it in well to avoid the white streaks. It works well, though, and I use it for mostly their face. Some of these sunblocks are stinky, and this one doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming odor. I have not tried the scented version. Overall, costs for these physical sunblocks are more per ounce than the usual retail versions, but these last much longer, at least for me, so I don&#x27;t feel like they are too expensive. Good reviews of all brands and types of sunscreens can be found on EWG Sunscreen Guide.</li>
            <li> I love the ingredients in this and I love that Badger is continually working toward improving their formulas.  This is a bit thick so it takes a certain technique to get it on quickly but we&#x27;ve worked out a system.  I get a big glob and rub it between my hands then I stipple creams all over my kids skin by patting my hands all over them.  Then I rub it in.  I have 4 kids to cover so efficiency is important to us and this works really well.</li>
            <li> The only con is it doesn&#x27;t run into the skin. It leaves a noticeably white layer.</li>
            <li> Super safe ingredients.  Will buy again. If it is safe for baby it is safe for me. Zinc oxide a tad thick though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on myself for a few months -- it probably is safe (I will take the EWG&#x27;s research/word on it) and smells pleasant enough, but it was less effective than I had hoped. First, it comes out of the tube in a thick paste that is difficult to apply evenly. The bigger issue, though, is that it is easily rubbed off by a T-shirt collar if you are active at all, so I tended to get a ring of sunburn around the base of my neck, even after applying quite a bit of sunscreen. Finally, as others have noted, it leaves a noticeable white residue that makes it less suitable for even non-athletic activities, such as driving in a convertible.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily, the last type I had (loving naturals??) was super thick/sticky and took a long time to rub it in, this brand goes on much better. I do think the loving naturals gave better protection though this one seems to wear off quicker.  It does work well and the easy application on my 1 1/2 year old gets this item a high ranking from me.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it&#x27;s FREE of the ingredients that possibly cause cancer!!</li>
            <li> We have been using this sunscreen for about a year.  Overall he really is usually not out for in the heat of the day for more than an hour or so (we live in southern California)  but he hasn&#x27;t had a sunburn yet.  We haven&#x27;t tried it for swimming yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take a little while to rub in but my 3 year old grandson, who is less than patient, is able to stay still long enough to rub in the white cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He loves the smell.  It definitely has a distinctive scent.  I guess you either love it or don&#x27;t.  After it is on for a few minutes, I no longer notice the scent that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter also likes that it doesn&#x27;t appear to have any strange chemicals and acts as a barrier rather then putting chemicals on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I like this sunscreen.  It is very thick and my son does not enjoy being slathered down but I do feel like he is protected.</li>
            <li> Smells great, gives good coverage, and works ok for about an hour- two in the water. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a safe sunscreen for my children when I came across this.  I was a little concerned about some of the reviews saying it was difficult to apply.  It is thicker than traditional chemical sunscreens, but it was very easy to apply. Yes, it takes slightly more effort but its really not even worth mentioning.  We tested this on a hot sunny day at the beach. Neither of my kids had a sunburn, although one had a small spot of sunburn where I must have missed applying this.  It definitely works, and my children are very fair skinned and prone to sunburns.  I will definitely be purchasing more of this in the future.</li>
            <li> Hard to rub in and don&#x27;t like the consistency</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s super white, doesn&#x27;t sink in skin and leave traces on car seat, stroller and everywhere, it worked for my son. I haven&#x27;t been to the beach yet but he never got sun burns at playgrounds and parks. We tried Babyganics (which had great reviews on line) and he had a reaction (rash all over face and behind ear), so I lost the 18 dollars I paid for 2 bottles. Still in search of the perfect sunscreen, if there is such a thing...</li>
            <li> I much prefer to keep my kids shaded from the sun whenever possible (sunhats, light, loose clothing, etc), but there are just some situations where sunblock seems necessary. Not wanting to put just anything on my kid (especially since it would get absorbed into the skin), I did a lot of research on the safest, and gentlest sunblocks for the littlest of littles. This one was mentioned numerous times, on many websites and blogs. We used it at the beach and my daughter was free of sunburn and skin reactions!</li>
            <li> I found it to be too greasy and heavy, also my skin is so sensitive there is something in it that I found irritating.  The skin around my eyes became very red and flakey.  However the sun protection was very good.</li>
            <li> If you compare this stuff to the toxic sunscreens out there (the &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; stuff), then you find it lacking. It is a bit greasy at first, turns the skin whitish before it is fully rubbed in, and takes longer to rub in than normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you compare it to other non-toxic sunscreens it is awesome. I stood in an all-natural products store and tested out 6 different kinds of baby sunscreen on my baby. This one was the winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that the greasiness of the product made it much easier to rub into the skin to reduce the whiteness created by the zinc oxide. The whiteness and difficulty of rubbing in is characteristic of all zinc oxide sunscreens (the worst I&#x27;ve used is Burt&#x27;s Bees... terrible! It does not go on as easily as Devita sunscreen, but that is not specifically marketed for babies. It is all natural though, so I&#x27;m not entirely sure of the difference.). But keeping your child safe from some of the really yucky chemicals in regular sunscreens is worth the extra effort of rubbing it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff has a pleasant, light scent from the chamomile and leaves the skin moisturized (not greasy) a short time after applying. This will be our go to sunscreen for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Feels a little sticky/thick at first, but spreads nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave yucky residue on skin afterwards. Protects skin really well.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is hard to put on, but after you rub it in for a while, it disappears into the skin.  In my opinion, it is worth the effort, since I am not rubbing in toxic chemicals into  my child.  We have used it for over a year on two children, and are happy with it.</li>
            <li> EWG has a great website for rating and comparing sunscreens by effectiveness and chemicals.  This one is the best compromise of less chemicals but effective protection, and is the best value of those with comparable ratings by the EWG.</li>
            <li> This worked great and I&#x27;m glad I ordered this product after extensive research on natural sunscreens. The only issue I had with it was that it looks very white on the skin, which isn&#x27;t a big deal but some people might find this a problem.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous about ordering this after reading some of the reviews but decided to try it anyway since it is all-natural.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other reviews, I had no trouble rubbing it in and it rubbed in completely with no white streaks or pastiness. I have used it on my 9 month old daughter a few times and have had no sun burns or tans yet.&lt;br /&gt;I am so relieved to have a product that I can use to protect my daughter from the sun without having to worry about harsh chemicals and ingredients. Thank you for a great product Badger!&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Don&#x27;t forget to reapply!</li>
            <li> This product is very very white and takes a long time to rub in, otherwise you will look like a ghost.  Keep that in mind when purchasing and using on yourself and your kids.</li>
            <li> I usually buy Badger Unscented but this one was cheaper at the time so I chanced it.  I was glad I did as it worked just as well as Unscented and the smell did not bother me or my son.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, strong but pleasant smell. (It almost smelled like natural insect repellent, but not sure if it repelled mosquitoes for us). As others noted, this stuff is thick. I did not have any trouble applying it, although I had to get a stick sunscreen for my baby&#x27;s face. It&#x27;s harder to rub into the skin, but at least I can tell where I&#x27;ve applied the sunscreen :) I use this for everyone in the family not just the baby. I will definitely buy it again - it&#x27;s one of the best nontoxic brands I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Too Thick... doesn&#x27;t absorb at all</li>
            <li> Our favorite suntan lotion for the kids. It is really thick and greasy but it is a safer formula than many other brands.</li>
            <li> Great but has a medicine type smell....</li>
            <li> Great product for babies and toddlers!</li>
            <li> Love this product. It is hard to find a natural sunscreen that is sensitive to your skin and this is both. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s just a trade up for going all natural. It&#x27;s not very spreadable, it&#x27;s difficult to apply in all the right spots. I like that it&#x27;s natural but it&#x27;s gunky. Oh well.</li>
            <li> It keeps me from getting sunburnt! However its a thick paste, so a bit difficult to spread on yourself. It also doesn&#x27;t rub in or blend into your skin, so you walk about with a pasty white face. And then as you sweat it dribbles down in streaks. All those things don&#x27;t matter that much I guess. I have sensitive skin and it doesnt react to this (on my face), but it does give me a rash and very dry skin on my neck. It seems to last the 4 hours or so, longer if you don&#x27;t sweat. However I&#x27;m not in direct sunlight all day, just through a windshield.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and reapply, didn&#x27;t cause eye issues - but didn&#x27;t do much sun protection. Both Baby &amp; Mama got quite the sunburn while using it and reapplying per the suggested timeline. :(</li>
            <li> I applied this sunscreen on my 6 month old prior to going in the sun. We were at the pool for only an hour and 15 minutes.  And my baby burned- not terribly (though I&#x27;m sure it would have been worse if we were in the sun longer) but enough where you can see where his swim trunks and rash guard were.  I also didn&#x27;t care for the smell. I really wanted to like it because it&#x27;s one of the only sunscreens rated a 0-2 by ewg that claims to be water resistant</li>
            <li> perfect safe sunscreen</li>
            <li> Badger is a great sunscreen brand! The baby SPF 30 has worked well on my fair and sensitive skinned boys that love the outdoors. The scent is light and natural. It definitely is not &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; as some reviews claim. The cream dries nicely if allowed 15 minutes to be absorbed as the directions state. I highly recommend this product despite its above-average price. The quality in the sunscreen and its effectiveness to protect my children&#x27;s skin naturally is worth the price.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this product.  I wanted to use a sunscreen on my daughter that was safe and all natural, with no harmful chemicals.  However, it does not work!  After lathering my daughter with a VERY generous amount of this sunscreen, she came home from watching a baseball game with her dad with VERY red arms.  This is after reapplying it a couple of hours after being in the sun!  I was happy to see that her sensitive skin didn&#x27;t break out in a rash from this product but what good is it to have around if it doesn&#x27;t block out the harmful rays?? I&#x27;ve always been extremely careful with my kids in the sun and I was VERY disappointed to find out it didn&#x27;t protect my little girl on a partly sunny Spring day.  I&#x27;m sorry to say that I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I like that this is safe sunscreen free of all the toxins that the other ones are filled with.  My only complaint is that it&#x27;s very hard to rub in, leaves white, chalky appearance.  Very sticky and thick.  I use this for water days because it does stay on and I use adorable baby for daily use (glides on and no weird color).</li>
            <li> Tried this sunscreen the other day and found that a little bit can go a long way. There seems to be no scent and this sunscreen has an excellent rating on EWG&#x27;s website! Definitely worth the $$.</li>
            <li> WARNING!!!! WARNING!!! WARNING!!!  THIS PRODUCT IS NOT SAFE!!! I applied the product liberally to my sons back an hour before going out into the sun and he still got 2nd degree burns!!! on top of that Vitamen Shop refuses to give me a refund on the product! Stay away from this product. It just doesn&#x27;t work...period.</li>
            <li> Love this! I did extensive research before selecting a sunscreen that was best for my twins...without a bunch of nasty chemicals and quite effective. It&#x27;s one had the best reviews and with good reason!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to work for us.  No matter how thick I smear it on, my kids seem to get awfully red.  What a choice . . . cancer causing ingredients, or sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen! Works well and I feel better about slathering it on my kid than lots of other stuff out there.</li>
            <li> It does the job, and you prepare for the white faces after.  We use this on our own personal beach where there won&#x27;t be many people seeing the kids.  They complain about the &amp;#34;ghost faces&amp;#34; it makes.</li>
            <li> This smells really bad.  We switched to Babyganics Mineral-Based Sunscreen Spray SPF 30.</li>
            <li> I tried many sunscreens for my 1.5 y.o. this summer, most from the top of the list from EWG (think baby, that other australian one with a lizard on it, and neutrogena baby faces). Each one I tried I also tried on my face since I have SUPER sensitive skin and most sunscreens make my skin itch or burn.  I&#x27;ve often gone with no sunscreen myself rather than deal with the discomfort. This was the **only** one that didn&#x27;t bother my skin and that didn&#x27;t turn my son&#x27;s eyes red by the end of the day when I put it on his face. Yes, it is thick. No, I never manage to get it all rubbed in.  Yes, he ends up with white streaks on his face. Yes, he is tan on his legs, but I think that might be because I&#x27;m not great about re-applying and his legs stick out from under the stroller sunshade, and let&#x27;s face it it&#x27;s tough to get a toddler totally covered.  I do feel like it&#x27;s heavy on my face and I sweat a little more with it&#x27;s on, it&#x27;s not great for daily use at the office that&#x27;s for sure, but it&#x27;s just fine for the playground and outdoor weekend outings. But I feel really good knowing that it&#x27;s not irritating my kids skin or making his eyes uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I like that the ingredients are natural. It is hard to find sunscreen that is somewhat safe and works. Thanks.</li>
            <li> It works great (I guess?) but it&#x27;s VERY thick. A little goes a long way, but is a little hard to get to spread on a squirming baby. It&#x27;s about the consistency of toothpaste.</li>
            <li> A sunscreen I can feel good about applying to baby because of the ingredients. It&#x27;s nice and thick so, even though it takes a bit to spread it, a little dollop goes a looong way. Only bad thing is baby&#x27;s eyes seem to hurt a tiny bit if he rubs his eyes with sunscreened hands, even hours after application. Doesn&#x27;t seem to bother him in a major way, but if you have a very sensitive kid, maybe don&#x27;t put it on his/her hands. Would definitely buy again (although, I won&#x27;t have to for a long while it seems) and recommend.</li>
            <li> It is too thick. Very uncomfortable to wear on the face.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It works very well! It takes very little to go along way! I would recommend this for every family with small children!</li>
            <li> This is a very good sunscreen.  It is very effective and has a very mild scent.  We love this in our family.</li>
            <li> We Are using this sunscreen for years. Since Our son was 4 ( he is 8 now). We absolutely love it. Maybe it&#x60;s not the easiest to put on but a little bit covers large area. It has very lite natural smell that you can barely notice. Doesn&#x60;t leave any marks or stains on clothes.</li>
            <li> Losing two stars for the bad smell!!  I appreciate that it&#x27;s a safe product to put on my baby, but WOW...the strong odor is pretty off-putting.  If they could make it smell more pleasant, it would be perfect!  I limit my 6 month olds sun exposure to 15 minutes, but still always use sunscreen. It says to reapply every 40 minutes. If you keep your baby in the direct sun for over an hour as some reviewers have mentioned, it&#x27;s not surprising that they burned.</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen for water use! I love that I didn&#x27;t have to worry about extra chemicals to block our kiddos from the sun, it as a thicker base and acted more like a water repellent, it didn&#x27;t run into their eyes and kept them burn free. I do think the amount of sunscreen used has a learning curve, my husband used it as well but used so much he was white from it. I used a much less on myself and the kids and didn&#x27;t have that issue. Great smell and protection.</li>
            <li> Works well. However, you have to rub it into the skin until it&#x27;s no longer visible. So far so good.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how well this would work. The sunscreen works great! My son is out on walks with me several times per day. The sunscreen has worked fantastically!</li>
            <li> amazing coverage, but a bit sticky to apply...still worth it for the piece of mind when in the sun with a little one!</li>
            <li> This is far too greasy and needs to be reapplied too often. It also takes a lot of work to rub in.</li>
            <li> we only put natural ingredients on and in our body, but we also love to be out in the sun.</li>
            <li> Do not have particular reason not to like this product, after all a sun block is a sun block.  This one is unscented,  a bit thick so it will take a bit extra effort to blend it out onto the skin.  I brought this because it claimed to be &amp;#34; all natural&amp;#34; and had a pretty good review on amazon (there wasn&#x27;t alot to choose from if you wanted to pick something &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;).  Haven&#x27;t really tested in water yet, since it claims to be water proof. overall, neutral feeling toward this product.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to the smell that makes all sunblock smell like sunblock, especially as I am applying it to my children. I also lean towards more natural products. This product is amazing for both my kids and me. Works great - goes on a bit thick but I like that because I know where I&#x27;ve put it. No sunburns in almost 4 years...Great product, great company!</li>
            <li> While I do love that this is natural, non-nano, etc. I, like most other people, don&#x27;t love the thick pasty texture. However, if that is the price to pay for a chemical free sunscreen, then I&#x27;ll gladly accept those terms.  Overall, I am happy with this product because I am happy that I can protect my baby not only from the sun, but from the chemicals used in most sunscreens.  My baby has never had a problem with this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Does not prevent sunburn on a toddler!  Very thick and doesn&#x27;t blend well.</li>
            <li> I thought this sunscreen would work for my sensitive skin. Felt like I am rubbing my face with diaper cream. So extremely sticky and greasy. It did not prevent sunburns. I decided to research on sunscreens and I learned that zinc oxide requires a dispersing agent (e.g. non-surface active polymer or a surface-active substance like polyhydroxystearic acid or PEG-#s) to prevent them to clump together or drop at the bottom of the bottle. All Badger Balm sunscreens are poorly formulated!</li>
            <li> I have tried several natural sunscreens on my kiddos...if they have zinc in them, it&#x27;s like trying to rub glue onto their skin! This one is much easier to rub in, if it were cheaper, I&#x27;d have given it 5 stars!</li>
            <li> It might be natural and safe to use but boy it&#x27;s chalky and goes on like paste.  I do not like how you look like a white ghost after applying  It does eventually get absorbed into the skin and not so white after but my child&#x27;s teacher puts on a glove before applying it to my child.</li>
            <li> If you like everything about this sunscreen except for its thick texture, I have a suggestion.  I mix the sunscreen with my facial moisturizer in the palm of my hand.  Then it spreads easily on my face and disappears without a white film  For the body, the same can be done with body lotion.  I&#x27;m an adult using this product.</li>
            <li> I like this and though it has a strong smell, you get kind of used to it and now I kind of like the smell (it&#x27;s not like regular sunscreen smells great either).</li>
            <li> So far, so good. It&#x27;s very thick and provides good coverage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and feels like it creates a great barrier on my baby&#x27;s skin.&lt;br /&gt;He&#x27;s never in the sun that long so I don&#x27;t know if that part works well.  But I can tell you that after being in water, it did not sting his eyes.</li>
            <li> Great protection, when on it does feel pretty greasy but I&#x27;m ok with that if it blocks the sun</li>
            <li> Very thick!!! Hard to put on a squirmy child.</li>
            <li> Best sun cream i ave ever used. Very effective</li>
            <li> We live in AZ (#2 for skin cancer in the world) and my little guy has very fair skin.  This is the only sunscreen that we use, and we love it!  A little bit goes a long way, and it does take a minute to rub in, but we&#x27;ve been very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Love the smell but so chalky it takes too long to put on the kids. I end up not finishing my 2 yr old. Even my 5 year old becomes impatient.</li>
            <li> I like how this is safer for the kids but it was so thick and pasty.  I stopped using it after the first use.  My kids looked like ghosts.  I usually use Neutrogena baby and they are pretty pasty too but this was worse.  It didn&#x27;t feel that great on my hands either.  I don&#x27;t think this is greasy but it felt very greasy on my hands.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the product is effective. If you have a pale skinned kid, I&#x27;d go elsewhere. My kid was definitely pink after spending not more than 20 minutes under direct sunlight at the beach.</li>
            <li> I bought this myself after research, worry about chemicals in even the supposed gental products, has sink so you get white face must work in well, then put your make up on.  I use this everyday on face and mech too of hands.  More if on water.</li>
            <li> &#x27;2.5 Stars&#x27;. This sunscreen is VERY greasy and does not rub in as well as some other Zinc Oxide sunscreens.  In addition, a sunburn resulted from the use of Badger (sunburn was on an adult).  We are happy that Badger uses all natural (and mostly organic) ingredients and a zinc oxide formula. This fact led to the &#x27;2.5 star rating&#x27; instead of a 1 star rating. We are now going to try ThinkSport Kid Safe Sunscreen, which is a 20% zinc oxide formula.</li>
            <li> After much research - this is the BEST sunscreen you can get for your child.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about this stuff. Not sure it&#x27;s actually working. DD started getting a little red, but I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s sunburn or her skin just turning red (she&#x27;s kind of blotchy). I like that they are all natural ingredients inside. It&#x27;s a bit thick to smear on.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that this cream is a tiny bit greasy. I love that its organic, however, so I will continue to use it on my child. After a few minutes the greasy goes away and it absorbs so its really not a problem.</li>
            <li> Good product and great EWG rating.</li>
            <li> Works great and lasted all summer!</li>
            <li> I feel safe putting this on baby and it goes on so thick she won&#x27;t burn but she is white after application. And it won&#x27;t rub in. But I don&#x27;t care because I feel better about this brand than many. It smells ok.</li>
            <li> No problems yet with her getting burned but it&#x27;s so thick and feels greasy. Leaves white marks on fabric.</li>
            <li> Great baby sunscreen.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that it takes forever to rub in, but I already knew that.  Good product.</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen. No bad ingredients. Does a good job keeping baby from getting burned.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen for its safe reviews but you have to reapply every hour or so depending on your child&#x27;s skin.  My daughter gets tan so it last longer but my son is very pale and he will get burnt if you don&#x27;t keep reapplying.  Because you have to reapply the tube goes fast.  I put it in the sun first to &#x27;melt&#x27; it so it goes on easier and you use less.</li>
            <li> I feel good knowing I am using safe sunscreen on myself and my children, thanks!</li>
            <li> I decided to make the switch from spray-on sunscreen after hearing of the health concerns, as well as for the fact my children still got burnt even after repeated &amp; often reapplication of the product. I researched and continually saw good reviews for Badger and I am so glad we made the switch. I am happier knowing that what I am applying to their skin is safer, and it actually keeps them from burning. Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> A good sunscreen. The smell isn&#x27;t the best but it&#x27;s a small price to pay for good sun protection.</li>
            <li> The bees loves this product. Be very careful with kids and babies. Also it is very white on the skin.</li>
            <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t like to put sunscreen on, but knows I will nag him until he does. This Badger baby sunscreen cream, which we originally bought for our grandchildren, is the one he likes the best. It does go on white, but it&#x27;s very creamy and the white fades fairly quickly. My only wish would be that it could go on clear.</li>
            <li> I wanted a natural yet effective sunscreen for my baby that is safe and this fits all of those qualifications. It smells fantastic and while it is thick, it rubs in easily. I&#x27;ve used it myself too and really like it. Like any sunscreen, you do need to reapply frequently.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen! The only reason I have it 4 stars is because it is REALLY thick and hard to spread on.  When you&#x27;ve got wiggly kids who just want to go play it would be nicer if it went on easier.  Thay being said neither of my kids got a sunburn when using this product.</li>
            <li> We first used this on our 4 month old. The packaging says for &amp;#34;6 months and up&amp;#34;, but we talked to our pediatrician and she approved it for use on a trip to Palm Springs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We used the sunscreen in combo with plenty of hats and lots of shade. Our daughter is very fare skinned and melanoma runs in my family, so I am very cautious when it comes to sun. The sunscreen did it&#x27;s job and she returned home as pale as when we left! We have since used it over the summer for her (6-8 months), and it has continued to keep her safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pain with this sunscreen is that it is not the easiest to rub in, so she usually ends up white, streaky, and greasy - but I don&#x27;t care that much given it&#x27;s keeping her safe. She&#x27;s still bald, so we even rub it on her scalp! It is a very herbal-y scent. It&#x27;s not my favorite, but this is a more natural sunscreen so I didn&#x27;t expect it to have that &amp;#34;Water Babies&amp;#34; smell we all know and love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this sunscreen has been great and it makes me feel secure knowing it doesn&#x27;t contain dangerous chemicals her skin will absorb, but she&#x27;ll still be safe from the sun&#x27;s rays.</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen for baby. Works well and its Safe for her new skin!</li>
            <li> Too thick.....I only used once. It&#x27;s like wore a mask... I&#x27;m gonna let my son use it</li>
            <li> This is my favorite sunscreen. It leaves my baby a little shiny, but it did not irritate his sensitive skin not once. Plus, I like the shine. It lets me know what spots I&#x27;ve missed.</li>
            <li> This has kind of a funny smell and is difficult to completely rub in, other than that, it works as expected for sunscreen. I chose this option because I felt it was safe to put on my 6 month baby and this was the best priced option for that. Believe me, I did a lot of research, I have a blond haired, blue eyed baby boy. Mayo clinic recommended the ingredients in sunscreen as an all natural sunscreen. This followed those requirements for a 6 month old baby. So far, it&#x27;s done it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> The closed end opened soon after purchase and it the product is very thick. It makes it a bit difficult to spread. My son has not gotten sunburned with it tho.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 of this sunscreen to go to Mexico for a couple of weeks during the summer. I had a 6 month old and a 3 year old by that time. They suntan a little bit with the sunscreen but not burnt. They got a little bit red. It is hard to apply when it is a little bit hard because of the air conditioner. But it is easy to apply when on the beach because it is not as thick. I like it but I don&#x27;t love it. I will keep looking for something better. Also, you have a white cover for a long time so if you are in the city or at a park, people will know you have sunscreen on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great brand and I trust it!</li>
            <li> I originally bought california baby sunblock for my kids but california baby has now become way too expensive. This seems to be a decent alternative and has received a respectable rating from the Environmental Working Group guide. It&#x27;s a bit hard to spread and to work in, but I think that is true for all kids sunblock that have zinc dioxide.</li>
            <li> Awesome sunscreen. Smells really good too!</li>
            <li> Perfect for babies and adults. Cant leave house without it.</li>
            <li> Works great, no terrible rash from using the product.</li>
            <li> My daughter has problems with eczema.  She did not break out from this product and her skin seemed to like it  - no sunburn.  I&#x27;m pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> I like that its all natural, but its really thick and greasy. Seems to work though, every time I remember to put it on my kid, he doesn&#x27;t get sun burnt.</li>
            <li> i bought this sunscreen because it rated so highly on several websites but it leaves a super oily/greasy feeling all over - yuck! Babyganics sunscreen was much better and left no oily residu</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen for my daughter who has fare skin. We live in Hawaii and she is out in the sun a lot and she has never had a sunburn, I love all the badger sunscreens!</li>
            <li> Just survived the beach with this. Burn and irritation free! It&#x27;s not rub proof especially with water but otherwise is great.</li>
            <li> Well we loved it but then found out the lot we received was recalled so marking it down from 5 stars to 2 stars based on that recall and the fact we used it.</li>
            <li> works great at what it&#x27;s supposed to do, block the sun, but very thick and a little hard to spread on.  but like i said, it works and it&#x27;s organic so can&#x27; complain too much</li>
            <li> Very thick, which is ok. But also a very strong smell.</li>
            <li> Safe for kids, does the job protecting from sun.  It does have a whitish sheen on the skin, which adults may not prefer</li>
            <li> Four stars for offering Organic sun screen, used it did it did leave my dons head a little dry. But worth it to avoid all the chemicals.</li>
            <li> Too thick for our liking.</li>
            <li> I got sun burned while using this product.  Like all sunscreens it has positives and negatives.  Positive is that it is natural and more healthy than some.  When compared to other natural sunscreens it applies easier.  This is probably what also causes the negative - easy to rub off.  I suspect it is water resistant if you are setting gently in the water but it is not very &amp;#34;rub&amp;#34; resistant.  We were at a water park and even with reapplication it seems to be rubbed off by touching floats and by the rough water.  It is oily which repels water but it is lightweight so it does rub off easily.  I prefer a heavier product (which would be more difficult to apply) and may resort to a chemical sunscreen (with zinc/titanium overcoat) for water parks in the future.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used this product the last two summers for our boys.  It&#x27;s fairly thick, but it does the job to protect their fair skin.  We also use the same brand for ourselves.</li>
            <li> We live on a California beach and our baby has pale skin. We spend full weekends in the sun. Our 18-month old doesn&#x27;t even get tan with this stuff on, and it doesn&#x27;t bother his eczema. It looks a little funny when it goes on, our could-be-mistaken-for-British child turns a shade paler due to the consistency of the lotion when he has this on.</li>
            <li> Little bet greasy compare to the regular sunblock. At least its healthier than the regular one so I guess its good to go Lol. Theirs no any perfume so its dons&#x27;t smell appealing but it wont smell them when you wear them</li>
            <li> This sunscreen rates great on the Skin Deep database.  It rubs in easily and protects my baby in the sun.  I feel confident that I&#x27;m not using any harmful chemicals on his skin.</li>
            <li> Love love love Badger products.  I used this sunscreen which kept my fair skin from burning and no I&#x27;m not a baby.</li>
            <li> Thick as frosting. &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Very thick and creamy. Used it according to directions out in the sun at a car show all day and nobody was sun burned.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my grandbabies that are visiting in Florida.  The sunscreen stayed on even in chlorine water - NO sunburned babies and NO nasty chemicals in this product.  Big thumbs up!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to spread and not too greasy.  Provides great coverage for my little girl.  A mild pleasant fragrance.  Happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  It uses all natural ingredients and has little to no odor.  What smell there may be is non-chemical in nature.  The main ingredient is zinc oxide which I love.  I have been using Zinc Oxide for over 30 years on my own skin and love that they have made a product for kids to help protect their skin without all the harmful chemicals out there.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen for organic mamas.</li>
            <li> I love that this product does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, without any of the harsh ingredients of many of its competitors on the market.  I find that it takes a long time for the zinc ozide to penetrate the skin. But, it&#x27;s a trade off.  I&#x27;d rather have white-faced children for 10 minutes than put chemicals on their little fair-skinned bodies.  I&#x27;m a new fan of the product.</li>
            <li> I got this product for my 2 year old daughter after a long hard search for a safe and effective sun protection. This product was very disappointing. It is so greasy that oil starts running out of it. It rubs off easily so it hardly gives you any protection from the sun. Very disappointing....</li>
            <li> this is easier to put on than previous formulas which is great.  I am a fan of badger and appreciate its natural qualities.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to the ingredients in most sunscreen.  This was expensive but it&#x27;s healthy, it works, and I&#x27;m not allergic to it.  As a bonus, I love the way it smells!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is ranked very high on goodguide,com which means it is safe to use on babies (and anyone else), but it&#x27;s a little thick and it takes some massaging to spread it evenly.</li>
            <li> Did not seem to give him much protection.</li>
            <li> Super thick to the point of being hard to rub in. On the plus side you dont need to use much for coverage. Unless you have a mirror or dont care about white streaks I&#x27;d be careful with even application.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! And I love not having to track it down in a store somehwere.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen.  Daughter had a reaction to another sunscreen so we tried this one.  No reaction so we are really pleased.  It has a pleasent scent but it is very thick.  It helps to rub it in your fingers before you apply it.  Because of the thickness, it seems to not rub in but I think it is bc there is too much product.  We use just a little bit, rub in in our fingers to warm it up, dot it on area then rub it in.</li>
            <li> I love the safe ingredients, but it is a bit too oily which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> We love this sunscreen for our baby. ..no yucky chemicals here! It&#x27;s a little strong smelling and sticky at first but it rubs in nicely and you get used to the smell.  As a bonus, my baby loves to look at the cute badger on the tube and it keeps him occupied while I apply the sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my toddler.  We had been using Burt&#x27;s Bees natural sunscreen (our first natural sunscreen), but it was difficult to rub in so we decided to branch out.  We opted for this one because it was waterproof, a necessity for pool time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Badger Sunscreen is:&lt;br /&gt;Easy to rub in&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy the smell&lt;br /&gt;Works well</li>
            <li> Used this on my 9 month old at the beach.  He wasn&#x27;t really in the sun enough to cause concern, so I cannot comment on the SPF.  It smells great (and natural) though and I will not mind using this on him in the future.</li>
            <li> I have somehow come to own several tubes of Badger sunscreens (of different types) and have decided to give them away. They are really thick and greasy and hard to spread on the skin. And if you use it in the humid tropics, it feels really gross and sticky, like you have a sheet of cling film on your skin, and it doesn&#x27;t let you sweat properly to cool down. There are plenty of equally safe alternatives that go on nice and smoothly. If you keep them too long, the oil will separate out, and then when you squeeze it out, you either get an oil slick coming out, or a paste that is even more thick and even harder to put on. Then, when you get to the end of the tube, it&#x27;s very very hard to squeeze out the last 15-20% of the tube (because by that time, the stuff inside has become so thick and viscous, and even if the tube is not too old, it&#x27;s still really hard to squeeze out the last bits), that you just give up and throw it away, so you really only get to use 80-85% of what you pay for. The reason I now own several tubes is that I was given 2 by someone who couldn&#x27;t use it because she hated that it was too thick and greasy. So, yes, it is safe and has a lot of good ingredients and none of the bad, but I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> GREAT natural product!  My son breaks out at any sunscreen (3 years old) except this one.  (And a Rodan Fields product, but it&#x27;s $40 for 2 ounces!)  Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the ingredients, but this particular one smells terrible. If I buy it again, I&#x27;ll def. buy an unscented one.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used this on our little one when going out on sunny days locally, overseas, at the beach, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though it&#x27;s thick and can leave a white appearance where applied, it&#x27;s working well and kept her sensitive skin safe from the sun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant smell and it is thick enough that you&#x27;ll need a good wipe or wash to get it off your fingers after application.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, all organic, natural ingredients and really protects from the sun!</li>
            <li> Delivered on time, was as described!</li>
            <li> We live in TX and are outside all the time. This is a great sun block for our 9 month old. Apply liberally and let it soak in and it is very effective. Nice smell and good for the skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and delivery was prompt.</li>
            <li> Good product. Sticky and leaves a white film on skin.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. I&#x27;ve been using this almost exclusively for a year or two, and my kids have never gotten sunburned. It&#x27;s a little greasy/heavy, and doesn&#x27;t have the longest staying power in the water, but for everyday use it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Blended in well. Protected my 10 month old. Use on my own face as well. No stinging of the eyes. No greasiness. No smell. Would recommend.  Would order again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for everyone in the family!  Will never buy another brand again! Great texture and smell! My kids love it!</li>
            <li> This is the only sunscreen I will use on my sweet lil&#x27; bubs skin. It is free of nasty stuff and smells nice. We usually reapply it after about 45 min of use at the beach. So far it works very well!</li>
            <li> Happy it&#x27;s organic and natural , I&#x27;ve been looking for something like this for my son for years. He doesn&#x27;t burn but some days were out in the sun for hours and I know he needs protection. The formula goes on relatively well and stays on for hours while were in the sprinklers I don&#x27;t know about the pool yet. There&#x27;s a very mild smell which my son appreciates :) it&#x27;s definitely worth the money I spent on it</li>
            <li> Thick lotion that covers well and prevents sunburns.  Badger is one of the most highly recommended baby sunscreens and we will happily recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Spreads nicely on sensitive baby skin. Much better than Babo sunscreen, although I&#x27;m still a fan of their sunscreen stick for faces.</li>
            <li> The EWG gives this a rating of a 1, which is rare for sunscreens. That means it&#x27;s one of the safer sunscreens out there. It rubs in fairly well in my son&#x27;s fair skin but on my Colombian skin it doesn&#x27;t - a small price to pay for superb sun protection, in my opinion. We haven&#x27;t had a sunburn since using this, and it&#x27;s safe to use on small babies. This is my fourth summer using Badger Baby Sunscreen Cream and I didn&#x27;t think for a second about going back to it. If you&#x27;re looking for something that rubs in better for adults, try the lotion. Babies really need the cream, though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing, it has only one detail, it&#x27;s very creamy, so I have to spread a lot before i can go outside but  in general it&#x27;s very nice, i love the smell of chamomille and calendula</li>
            <li> really thick, makes skin white, also my kids both burned while in the pool first time they went in, and we had applied it correctly</li>
            <li> I like natural products on my babies. We looked up the chemical contents of each ingredient and found this to be among the best products, in terms of least damaging to your sweet baby&#x27;s skin, on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before this, we used Episcential, which is also a great great product. But this just goes on better, without a whitening effect, and I feel like it gets rubbed in better. :)</li>
            <li> It does what is intended to do, down side is when applying it&#x27;s white and thick, but has to keep rubbing it until it turns into a clear protective water proof layer. Over all, we loved it, we all used it specially our 9 months baby. We wish we used this one first at the beach on our baby instead of another one that we did not put enough and her arms and chest got burned. The other product is good, but some how washes off after a little while in the water. We used this product in and out of the water  and worked great!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen has a good amount of zinc oxide in it. It goes on a bit thick but doesn&#x27;t take much rubbing for it to even out on baby&#x27;s face. Does the job, no skin reactions and it&#x27;s good to know that I&#x27;m not lathering my daughter in a bunch of chemicals.</li>
            <li> One of the best rated sun screens for kids, this is a must for a day at the beach.</li>
            <li> After reading through sunscreen ingredients I couldn&#x27;t believe what&#x27;s in some of them! This sunscreen has a pleasant smell and worked great for our babies first summer. It is a little thicker and can look &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; if it&#x27;s not rubbed in all the way but I don&#x27;t mind that at all as the sun protection is more important to me. A little bit goes a long way with this stuff and we will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen for my baby. It smells wonderful and goes on thick but rubs in easily. It definitely protects her delicate skin. It makes me feel good that I am not putting any harmful chemicals on her too.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 2 year old and 7 month old because it was rated a number 1 on the ewg. It have them both very dry skin, like a rash.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter to use on her babies.  She said she used it and applied it twice, but the girls still got a sunburn.  She wasn&#x27;t happy about that :-(</li>
            <li> Love it!! I live in Florida and I am very satisfied with the sun protection of this product. It has a neutral smell that doesn&#x27;t bother me or the baby. It is natural, doesn&#x27;t irritate baby&#x27;s delicate skin. I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Love love love! So natural and safe for my baby. And I actually really like the smell. It&#x27;s like chamomile tea! No sunburn, no nasty chemicals, and a sweet smelling, safe baby! That&#x27;s a win!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very greasy and rubs off at the slightest touch, which is pretty counterproductive. The skin cancer foundation has stated that there should be 2mg of sunscreen for every square centimeter of skin (about 1/4 teaspoon for the face alone)- if you&#x27;re applying less than that, you&#x27;re risking sun damage. 1/4 of a teaspoon of this sunscreen feels like smearing butter onto your skin.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried literally 3 dozen different sunscreens and this is the only one that my daughters can wear without having a reaction.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this works great and the ingredients are great but I don&#x27;t like the smell and I can&#x27;t get past it.</li>
            <li> I used this last summer for the first time and had no issues with burns on my kids - loved it. But this summer (same bottle) my kids have been burned each time! Then I found this information from the manufacturers wbsite that another reviewer had posted...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If my sunscreen has some clumping, will it still work?&lt;br /&gt;Yes. Temperature variations during shipping occasionally cause CLUMPING in Badger sunscreens and this does not affect the sunscreen&#x27;s safety or level of protection. We tested our sunscreens with and without clumping to ensure protection. In most cases, the clumping is caused by the crystallization of Shea and Cocoa Butter. This is similar to what might happen in a chocolate bar if it is exposed to extreme temperature variations. When you apply the sunscreen to your skin you will feel them melt right in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Note: If the little clumps are really HARD and GRITTY, they may be the Zinc Oxide particles clumping together, and this could potentially affect the level of protection you are receiving. If this is the case, please check the expiration date to ensure that your product is still good. If your product has not expired, but exhibits the hard and gritty clumping, please contact our customer service team for a full refund or to exchange products.***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New Formulas! We have removed the Shea and Cocoa Butter from most of our new 2013 sunscreen creams to avoid further clumping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no crystals last summer, but this summer I did notice them. Found the info above, checked my exp date, and it expired 2 months ago. Bought a new bottle (and there are no crystals in it) and it&#x27;s worked wonders again. It does have a smell that I can&#x27;t quite place, but it is not bad per se, and unlike other reviewers have said I don&#x27;t find the smell to stick around. I don&#x27;t find it any greasier than conventional sunscreens and it runs less when you get a little sweaty. As long as youhave an unexpired bottle without the crystals it should workjust fine - we love it!</li>
            <li> Would recommend. Not really greasy. Even use it on myself. I like that it is on EWG&#x27;s list as a good product.</li>
            <li> Covers well. I little thick but I&#x27;ll take it for less chemicals on my children&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen for our daughters and ourselves! My eldest has very sensitive skin/eczema and this is the only sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t make her break out - and it works SO well. Nice and thick.</li>
            <li> I tried other brands but they are so hard to apply. This is thick just like the other ones, but I find it much easier to apply. On top of that, I actually think it smells pretty nice!</li>
            <li> As others have said, this sunscreen requires more rubbing in than the typical drugstore sunscreen, but knowing that I&#x27;m putting a safe product on my toddler makes the extra effort worthwhile. I usually start applying this sunscreen on my two-year-old&#x27;s face because it&#x27;s easier to rub it on his arms and legs at the end when he is getting restless and starting to squirm away. I have also tried Poofy Organics and it is good, with a similar consistency, but I prefer this one because it has a pleasant scent of Chamomile tea.</li>
            <li> I covered dd13m in this stuff and went to a ball game. I made sure to reapply hourly. I missed one spot where she burnt but otherwise she stayed pale as ever.</li>
            <li> I researched safe sunscreens for my 8 month old knowing I would take her outside a lot for the summer.  With her being so young I worry about what I put on her skin.  This product impressed me with the amount of information supporting the ingredients in their product.  It does have a different smell, but it&#x27;s not bad (and I have a sensitive sense of smell).  It is greasy, but it&#x27;s no big deal, and again, it&#x27;s not bad.  I actually like that it is oily because then I know it is on her skin, and I can see that it makes the water bead on her skin.  It does go on whitish, but rubs in quickly and does not tint her skin a white color.  I wouldn&#x27;t care if it did because I can see where she&#x27;s covered and I know the sunscreen is doing its job.  As Dr. Oz said, \\&quot;White is right\\&quot; when it comes to safe sunscreens.  My baby has a nice tan, has not burned, and has not had any bad reactions to the sunscreen on her skin.  I have liberally applied the sunscreen on my baby about 10 times and still have plenty left in the tube.  Just remember that it is necessary to reapply sunscreen when it has rubbed off (which happens easily with mobile children and towels when swimming) or your child has been in the water for a while.  The sunscreen works beautifully when it&#x27;s used correctly.</li>
            <li> The sun protection this stuff gives is as good as or better than most sun screens for kids. The major complaint I have is that it goes on really thick and greasy. Their zinc oxide atomizing process must not be as significant as Neutregena or the like. For that fact I would recommend something else.</li>
            <li> smells funny, feels heavy, oily, too much....&lt;br /&gt;For the money, you can find better. Like Thinksport, Livestrong, etc. or Alba.</li>
            <li> This brand beats the store brands like coppertone, banana boat, etc. The ingredients are natural and non-toxic.  Great for kids and babies.</li>
            <li> The cream is pretty thick and takes some time to rub in, somewhat oily, but they sun coverage is PERFECT and I love how natural all the ingredients are.  Doesn&#x27;t bother my skin at all.</li>
            <li> While it goes on pretty well and the water beads up showing it&#x27;s still applied&lt;br /&gt;after getting wet, the protection is not as great I had hoped.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. It&#x27;s thick &amp; creamy (and a little greasy), but it does its job!!! I use it on my son, but my husband &amp; I use it as well. Best part is that it&#x27;s SAFE, and I&#x27;m confident I&#x27;m not spreading a bunch of chemicals on our skin.</li>
            <li> I really liked this sunscreen. I&#x27;m happy that it&#x27;s more natural than the other brands I&#x27;ve used. My daughter did get a little burned the first time we used it but that was only one application for about 2 1/2 hours in the sun. I&#x27;ve found that if I reapply at about 1 1/2 hours she doesn&#x27;t get burned at all, just a little tan (she&#x27;s usually very fair). She does look a little pale with the sunscreen on but it doesn&#x27;t really bother me, it&#x27;s not that bad. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s thick at all or hard to rub in like some other people are saying, I&#x27;ve had to rub in every brand of sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever had and I don&#x27;t find this one anymore difficult. Oh and last but not least the smell. I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells. I wear unscented everything and can&#x27;t even go near the perfume section in Macys. I don&#x27;t have any problems with the scent of this sunscreen. It&#x27;s not wonderful smelling but it&#x27;s not strong or gross. I hope this helps  : ) I&#x27;m ordering my second one right now</li>
            <li> I bought this as a baby shower gift and she absolutely loved it</li>
            <li> I like that this is all-natural, seems to do the job, and gets good ratings from the Environmental Working Group, but MAN, is it thick and pasty. Doesn&#x27;t sink in and takes forever to spread, which matters if you&#x27;re trying to smear it on a wiggly kid. Also, because it doesn&#x27;t sink in and my toddler squirms, I worry that she&#x27;s just wiping it off on whatever she&#x27;s wearing or sitting on (nice white streaks on my couch, thanks very much). Go for ThinkBaby instead. Still good EWG ratings, but WAY easier to work with (and smells nicer too).</li>
            <li> **Update to the review below: I&#x27;ve increased the rating from 3 to 5 stars. I contacted Badger Balm&#x27;s customer service, and they were incredibly helpful. They mailed a new tube to me with this year&#x27;s updated formula, and I got the new tube literally within two days of contacting customer service. The new formula is neither lumpy nor gritty, goes on more easily, and doesn&#x27;t have the weird \\&quot;fresh tobacco leaf\\&quot; smell that my first tube had. I&#x27;ve been using this product on my baby and myself. It&#x27;s actually helped clear up our eczema, and I swear my skin has never been softer. He played in the pool for longer than the recommended 40 minutes, and still didn&#x27;t so much as tan. One thing I will say is that the people who burned when they spent all day at the beach may not have been reapplying every 40 minutes as the manufacturer recommends. The minerals that block the sun will rub off with your towel and will start to wash away with sweat and water. That&#x27;s because this is a safe product that sits on top of the skin rather than a more toxic product that would leech into your bloodstream. Logic tells you that, after toweling off or sweating or swimming, you should reapply.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard wonderful things about this product, so I was surprised to find that this product was gritty since it&#x27;s designed for babies. I&#x27;m currently waiting for a response from their customer service regarding an exchange because, in fact, it shouldn&#x27;t be gritty. I went to the manufacturer&#x27;s web site and read the FAQs page, which said this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If my sunscreen has some clumping, will it still work?&lt;br /&gt;Yes. Temperature variations during shipping occasionally cause CLUMPING in Badger sunscreens and this does not affect the sunscreen&#x27;s safety or level of protection.

            <li> Great sun protection, however it&#x27;s difficult to rub in and might have an off-putting scent to some.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t break baby&#x27;s skin out.</li>
            <li> I was very hopeful about this product because I don&#x27;t want to risk harm to my baby with all the chemicals in sunscreen, but unfortunately it did not work at all. I tried it on myself and followed the directions carefully, but I got terribly burned. I don&#x27;t think it provided any protection at all.</li>
            <li> Love using all natural sunscreen</li>
            <li> Really good product, in fact I think we will replace our own adult (read toxic) sunscreens with this also. Little greasy for daily use (well I mean it is after all intended for swimming), but goes on easy. Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 4 yr and 5 yr boys. It smells weird but it serves the purpose well. It&#x27;s kinda hard to apply and absorb on the skin, so it requires extra time to apply compared to other sunscreen products(Neutrogena or thinkbaby brands).</li>
            <li> Does not work, baby and I got sunburned</li>
            <li> Ilike this product very much.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, just a little pricy.  It works wonderfully and I&#x27;m pleased that it&#x27;s safe for my daughter&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> I researched extensively before settling on this sunscreen for my children (two years and 4 mo.).  We&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times and are fine with the sun protection, however the product stinks... so much so that my daughter who is normally fine with wearing sunscreen whines and nearly cries when we tell her it&#x27;s sunscreen time.  She&#x27;s only two but she&#x27;s telling us, &amp;#34;Mommy Daddy use it.  Me use different one.&amp;#34;  I know there is a whole line of Badger products and they are rated highly for their natural ingredients and sun protection... I think we&#x27;ll just probably look for a scented one next time that will mask the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before selecting this sunscreen. I mainly used the EWG skindeep database web site. I feel really good about my decision because I&#x27;m confident that this sunscreen doesn&#x27;t contain a lot of the bad chemicals that a lot of other sunscreens do and it works really well. It does make for some pasty looking skin for a bit, but I don&#x27;t mind that. As long as my son is getting good, safe protection.</li>
            <li> I used this sunscreen for the first time with my 3 year old yesterday at the pool.  I was surprised to see that you have to reapply every 40 minutes when they are in the water.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t have harmful chemicals in it, which is probably why you need to reapply so often.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this sunscreen but it is very greasy.  No matter how much I try to rub it in it leaves a white film.</li>
    </ol>
