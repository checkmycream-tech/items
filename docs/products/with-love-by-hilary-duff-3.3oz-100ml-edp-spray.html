            <li>I officially love Hilary&#x27;s perfumes!!!</li>

            <li>This smells soooo great and stays on your clothes until you wash them.</li>
            <li>I greatly recommend this to anyone that loves this perfume.</li>

            <li>and I immediately fell in love!!</li>
            <li>I love this intoxicating smell!!</li>
            <li>I love this perfume and since they no longer sell it in the stores, I was very happy to see Amazon selling it.</li>
            <li>I get many compliments on it and LOVE IT!!!!!!</li>
            <li>great buy, good price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a great gift!! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>This perfume is not overpowering at all which is perfect since I dislike strong perfumes.</li>
            <li>I have been using this perfume since 2007 when I smelled it on a friend and instantly LOVED it.</li>
            <li>The bottle and packaging look great also :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best to sample something if you can first to see if your body chemistry works with that fragrance.</li>
            <li>Be sure to test out Hilary&#x27;s latest scent, Wrapped With Love.  :D</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this and Hilary Duff!</li>
            <li>So glad I did!</li>
            <li>All of them said it was not that great and way too strong.  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing perfume.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;a a very woody and spicy fragrance that is perfect for anytime wear.</li>
            <li>Some people liked it on me, I just didn&#x27;t like the smell over time</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
            <li>I enjoy it because it is not too strong but has a good feminine scent</li>
            <li>With Love improves on me when layered sandalwood, musk, or vanilla.</li>
            <li>I fall more and more in love with it everday.</li>
            <li>Lock in the love (when you buy this celebrity designer fragrance)</li>
            <li>She loves the smell and it really smells great on her.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I love love love the scent of this perfume.</li>
            <li>I bought this perfume, because the bottle was really cute</li>
            <li>so I figure cute bottle and Hilary Duff?</li>
            <li>Well I&#x27;m not so sure about the smell.</li>
            <li>I also love the lotion if I need a refresher.</li>
            <li>Love this perfume.</li>
            <li>and i fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>but im not 100% pleased ...</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>If you love sweet and elegant, this is the scent for you!</li>
            <li>With Love is a perfectly acceptable sweet oriental for young women who don&#x27;t want to smell like their mothers or grandmothers.</li>
            <li>On my first date with my husband in 2008, I wore this perfume and he kept commenting on how I smelled so good.</li>
            <li>Was very quickly delivered &amp; safely packaged.</li>
            <li>I love all kinds of smells from elegant to fruity smells and have over 50 bottles from cheap to pricey.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very warm scent with elements of spiced wood, amber, and a soft vanilla that sweetens it.</li>
            <li>I got exactly what I wanted at an amazing price.</li>
            <li>So elegant and feminine, it just makes me feel like true lady when ever I put it on.</li>
            <li>most girls I know are into perfumes that smell too strong, and are super fruity or floral.</li>
            <li>It was love at first sniff!</li>
            <li>so you can truly enjoy your days and nights.  </li>
            <li>I have bought many bottles of this through Amazon &amp; this seller has very well satisfied my experience.</li>
            <li>I love soft sexy scents.</li>
            <li>Sweet tomato pizza sauce.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too sweet smelling for my tastes (my mother said it smelled like air freshener), and I think I had an allergic reaction to it.  </li>
            <li>My mother doesn&#x27;t like the scent and say&#x27;s that it&#x27;s way too sweet for her, but</li>
            <li>So I guess if you&#x27;re around people that can&#x27;t stand really sweet smelling perfume, keep away.</li>
            <li>They did give me a full refund.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a favorite since 2010, and I was very upset when stores stopped carrying it.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, WL could be worthy of a full bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bottle is a nice heavy bottle and the scent is lovely!</li>
            <li>Very satisfied - would purchase again, if possible.</li>
            <li>The first time I ever smelled this product was in a Walgreens some years ago when they were handing out free sample sizes.</li>
            <li>Its a strong smell of sandal wood, which I think smells alright for a house...but not so much as a perfume.   </li>
            <li>I received an imitation version of this perfume, and loved it so much, I went looking for more.</li>
            <li>Such a beautiful, classy fragrance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really that nice, sweet, &amp; soft.</li>
            <li>this is such a nice musk.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the splurge, so satisfy your urge and attract the attention you deserve.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet and pungent, and nothing at all like the imitation version I loved so much.</li>
            <li>I purchased my current 3.3 oz bottle from this vendor and it is 100% authentic and they ship very fast.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was what I had eaten (pizza), but</li>
            <li>I feel sexy and womanly when I wear it.</li>
            <li>I made this purchase at macys years ago when the fragrance first came out.</li>
            <li>First, it doesn&#x27;t smell anything like anyone else described.  </li>
            <li>, i wear it all the time, shipped fast!</li>
            <li>mild, pleasant scent, worn at healthcare facility where certain strong odors can be offensive to the ill.</li>
            <li>Compared to her sisters (BS Fantasy, JS Fancy), With Love is young, not juvenile.</li>
            <li>fit pocket brand new in box receiptant never knew it wasnt bought in high end retail store.</li>
            <li>me, WL has something strange going on at the top.</li>
            <li>Second, its way to strong.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light enough to wear every day.     </li>
            <li>It was a very woodsy smell.</li>
            <li>But then when i received this one i tested it out and to me the smell of this perfume was much lighter then</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s exactly right if you like soft musty smells.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d give With Love a try based on other reviews.  </li>
            <li>Now if that isn&#x27;t a good example of how the American fragrance palette has changed in less than a generation, I don&#x27;t know what is.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I hope they always stay this simple &amp; sweet.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s her third full bottle.</li>
            <li>So if your a vanilla and/or black licorice person you&#x27;ll love it and if not maybe this perfume is not for you.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how different the same perfume can smell on different people.</li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite perfume, this is the one that I wear everyday.</li>
            <li>Sorry Hilary I still love your music and movies!!</li>
            <li>It does dry down to a nice powdery musky smell but it took   forever on me.</li>
            <li>He said every time I wear it, it takes him back to when we first met.</li>
            <li>Used to pay around $30-$40 a bottle, so the fact that I&#x27;m willing to pay nearly double that to continue wearing this scent says something.</li>
            <li>She receives so many compliments that I don&#x27;t think she&#x27;ll ever go back to her other fragrances(Prada,Vera Wang,Calvin Klein)</li>
            <li>The vanilla was way too strong and has an after smell of old lady and black licorice.</li>
            <li>My item arrived early and was packaged well.</li>
            <li>Take a look at the reviews here, and there are young women who say WL is too spicy, too mature, and too woody.</li>
            <li>At the time I was 20 years old and am now 26.</li>
            <li>The smell stays with you throughout your busy days of work or play.  </li>
            <li>fragrance is only noticible up close, with a hug or intimate conversation...</li>
            <li>I just purchased a bottle of this for my 16 year old daughter</li>
            <li>It wears well, and has enough scent, but not TOO much that it&#x27;s overpowering.</li>
            <li>She has been wearing this since she was sixteen years old.  </li>
            <li>It has a subtle smell and I&#x27;ve received many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>The name With Love equates with caring and staying in touch with yourself and others, and the thick crystal like bottle has a dimensional look with a closing caplet similar to the handle of a vault.  </li>
            <li>I appreciate WL enough to sample, but not to buy, for is it too sweet, too thin, too young, and not spicy enough to be an oriental imo.</li>
            <li>One possible explanation is maybe my bottle was exposed to extreme temperatures (heat) in shipping, since I do live in Arizona.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> love this perfume!! smells gr8...its getting hard to find!</li>
            <li> My item arrived early and was packaged well. I got exactly what I wanted at an amazing price. I love this perfume and since they no longer sell it in the stores, I was very happy to see Amazon selling it. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is the perfume I usually get so I know what it smells like. I enjoy it because it is not too strong but has a good feminine scent</li>
            <li> With Love is a perfectly acceptable sweet oriental for young women who don&#x27;t want to smell like their mothers or grandmothers. Put me in the mother category. I appreciate WL enough to sample, but not to buy, for is it too sweet, too thin, too young, and not spicy enough to be an oriental imo. Take a look at the reviews here, and there are young women who say WL is too spicy, too mature, and too woody. Now if that isn&#x27;t a good example of how the American fragrance palette has changed in less than a generation, I don&#x27;t know what is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I like WL. Compared to her sisters (BS Fantasy, JS Fancy), With Love is young, not juvenile. With Love improves on me when layered sandalwood, musk, or vanilla. Layering adds a well-roundedness &amp; depth that I think WL lacks. Otherwise, WL could be worthy of a full bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On me, WL has something strange going on at the top. I catch tomato pizza sauce. At first I thought it was what I had eaten (pizza), but no. That&#x27;s what I get as I wear my WL sample day after day. It doesn&#x27;t dominate, it&#x27;s not offensive, it&#x27;s fleeting, but it&#x27;s strange. Sweet tomato pizza sauce.</li>
            <li> This fragarance become my signature scent. I fall more and more in love with it everday. I&#x27;ve been using it since it came out. At the time I was 20 years old and am now 26. This is in NO WAY a teenie bopper fragrance. It&#x27;a a very woody and spicy fragrance that is perfect for anytime wear. I feel sexy and womanly when I wear it. I purchased my current 3.3 oz bottle from this vendor and it is 100% authentic and they ship very fast. Will buy from them again.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite perfume, this is the one that I wear everyday. I get many compliments on it and LOVE IT!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I just received my perfume today, not sure if this item is supposed to be sealed, but it is not in a plastic wrap like all other perfumes I have ever purchased.  Not sure I like the idea, that this perfume could have been used and repacked to sell.  I purchased as a gift, it&#x27;s not really a scent I like, but again was purchased for my friends daughter for her birthday and she loves this scent.</li>
            <li> I received \\&quot;Wrapped with Love\\&quot; last year as a gift and I immediately fell in love!! Then my mom received \\&quot;With Love\\&quot; this year and I wanted to steal her perfume set, lol. It&#x27;s really that nice, sweet, &amp; soft. I love soft sexy scents. So if you&#x27;re looking for that \\&quot;I just swam in a garden\\&quot; scent, this is not it. I officially love Hilary&#x27;s perfumes!!! I hope they always stay this simple &amp; sweet.</li>
            <li> most girls I know are into perfumes that smell too strong, and are super fruity or floral. this is such a nice musk. my boyfriend loves it, and it doesn&#x27;t make my parents sick when they smell it. it&#x27;s exactly right if you like soft musty smells.</li>
            <li> The smell of this fragrance is heavenly, alluring,and not at all fruity but so juicy in it&#x27;s bottle.  The smell stays with you throughout your busy days of work or play.  The name With Love equates with caring and staying in touch with yourself and others, and the thick crystal like bottle has a dimensional look with a closing caplet similar to the handle of a vault.  Lock in the love (when you buy this celebrity designer fragrance) so you can truly enjoy your days and nights.  It&#x27;s worth the splurge, so satisfy your urge and attract the attention you deserve.</li>
            <li> mild, pleasant scent, worn at healthcare facility where certain strong odors can be offensive to the ill. fragrance is only noticible up close, with a hug or intimate conversation...I like it</li>
            <li> This smells soooo great and stays on your clothes until you wash them. The bottle and packaging look great also :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, but this is another pop-star fragrance that I really don&#x27;t care for (another being Britney Spear&#x27;s \\&quot;Curious\\&quot;).    I was given a sample of it at Walgeens the other day. It&#x27;s too sweet smelling for my tastes (my mother said it smelled like air freshener), and I think I had an allergic reaction to it.  I got a rash.  Also, that night I woke up to find my left eye was starting to swell shut (I had not even sprayed it on my skin that time).  After removing contaminated articles of clothing and using hydrocortizone, symptoms vanished within an hour. Take that, Hillary Duff.</li>
            <li> I just purchased a bottle of this for my 16 year old daughter and it&#x27;s her third full bottle. She loves the smell and it really smells great on her. She gets lot&#x27;s of compliments. It&#x27;s best to sample something if you can first to see if your body chemistry works with that fragrance. It&#x27;s amazing how different the same perfume can smell on different people.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing perfume.    If you love sweet and elegant, this is the scent for you! My mother doesn&#x27;t like the scent and say&#x27;s that it&#x27;s way too sweet for her, but whatever. So I guess if you&#x27;re around people that can&#x27;t stand really sweet smelling perfume, keep away. I haven&#x27;t had any other complaints. Actually, I get a lot of compliments and questions on what perfume I have on. I absolutely love it. It&#x27;s light enough to wear every day.     Be sure to test out Hilary&#x27;s latest scent, Wrapped With Love.  :D</li>
            <li> I made this purchase at macys years ago when the fragrance first came out. You can buy it almost anywhere now. Still one of my faves.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if I got a knock off or old product or if this really smells this bad, but I think it stinks.  I immediately contacted Amazon to return it.  They won&#x27;t let you return this type of product.  They did give me a full refund.  I donated it to a thrift store.</li>
            <li> I love love love the scent of this perfume. I will admit that I feel weird buying it though since I am 25+ and it is a teen celeb icon.  The bottle is a nice heavy bottle and the scent is lovely!</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d give With Love a try based on other reviews.  First, it doesn&#x27;t smell anything like anyone else described.  Its a strong smell of sandal wood, which I think smells alright for a house...but not so much as a perfume.   Second, its way to strong.  I didn&#x27;t want to waste it so I tried to pawn it off on the girls I work with.  All of them said it was not that great and way too strong.  So at least I wasn&#x27;t the only one who thought that way about this perfume.  I never write reviews just always read them.  I had to write this review because it was honestly one of the worst, strongest perfumes I&#x27;ve ever had.  It def. wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume, because the bottle was really cute so I figure cute bottle and Hilary Duff? Its got to smell great! Well I&#x27;m not so sure about the smell. I&#x27;m 22 and also a perfume lover. I love all kinds of smells from elegant to fruity smells and have over 50 bottles from cheap to pricey. This perfume I was not impressed by. The vanilla was way too strong and has an after smell of old lady and black licorice. I thought maybe I sprayed too much or was just having a weird smelling day, but I&#x27;ve let a few people smell it and they all say the same thing. One of my friends loves this perfume so I gave it to her so at least in some way it was money well spent! So if your a vanilla and/or black licorice person you&#x27;ll love it and if not maybe this perfume is not for you. Hope this helps. Sorry Hilary I still love your music and movies!!</li>
            <li> I like the smell just not on me. It was a very woodsy smell. It does dry down to a nice powdery musky smell but it took   forever on me. Some people liked it on me, I just didn&#x27;t like the smell over time I would get a headache from it.</li>
            <li> I CANNOT BE WITHOUT THIS PERFUME!!! I have been using this perfume since 2007 when I smelled it on a friend and instantly LOVED it. On my first date with my husband in 2008, I wore this perfume and he kept commenting on how I smelled so good. He said every time I wear it, it takes him back to when we first met. For a while I was able to repurchase in a few different stores, but was SO sad when I found out it had been discontinued. Used to pay around $30-$40 a bottle, so the fact that I&#x27;m willing to pay nearly double that to continue wearing this scent says something. It wears well, and has enough scent, but not TOO much that it&#x27;s overpowering. A spritz on your neck, wrists and ankles does the trick for the day. I also love the lotion if I need a refresher. Love this perfume. LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
            <li> I received an imitation version of this perfume, and loved it so much, I went looking for more. Unable to find it, I forked out the money for \\&quot;the real thing\\&quot; here. Yuck! I don&#x27;t like the scent at all - and looking back wish I had returned it for a refund. It&#x27;s sweet and pungent, and nothing at all like the imitation version I loved so much. One possible explanation is maybe my bottle was exposed to extreme temperatures (heat) in shipping, since I do live in Arizona. If I ever come across a sampler in a store, I will definitely check it out and report back.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this and Hilary Duff! great buy, good price, i wear it all the time, shipped fast!</li>
            <li> Was very quickly delivered &amp; safely packaged. Cant beat the price on this size bottle. I have bought many bottles of this through Amazon &amp; this seller has very well satisfied my experience. I greatly recommend this to anyone that loves this perfume. It&#x27;s also a great gift!! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> i had previously bought a smaller version of this item in a different place and i fell in love with it. But then when i received this one i tested it out and to me the smell of this perfume was much lighter then the previous one as if this one was mix with water or idk... it dnt smell bad but im not 100% pleased ...</li>
            <li> Bought With Love by Hilary Duff on a blind buy. So glad I did! Such a beautiful, classy fragrance. The note of Amber is definitely there but not overbearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Amber-scented fragrance reminds me of a perfume, from when I was little, that my mom used to wear (can&#x27;t remember the name, though). Wonderful job, Hilary &amp; team!  Such a shame that this fragrance is hard to find in stores anymore (possibly discontinued?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Chloe</li>
            <li> Very satisfied - would purchase again, if possible.</li>
            <li> The first time I ever smelled this product was in a Walgreens some years ago when they were handing out free sample sizes. It was love at first sniff! I loved it so much my mom bought me the set that came with the body lotion for Christmas and I&#x27;ve been using it since then. It&#x27;s a very warm scent with elements of spiced wood, amber, and a soft vanilla that sweetens it. It lasts me all day long, and a little goes a long way! This perfume is not overpowering at all which is perfect since I dislike strong perfumes. I also adore the bottle it comes in! So elegant and feminine, it just makes me feel like true lady when ever I put it on.</li>
            <li> After searching shelves forever, I found it!!! I love this intoxicating smell!! It&#x27;s been a favorite since 2010, and I was very upset when stores stopped carrying it.</li>
            <li> was a gift .... receiptant loved.&lt;br /&gt;price fit pocket brand new in box receiptant never knew it wasnt bought in high end retail store.</li>
            <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s signature fragrance.  She has been wearing this since she was sixteen years old.  She receives so many compliments that I don&#x27;t think she&#x27;ll ever go back to her other fragrances(Prada,Vera Wang,Calvin Klein)</li>
            <li> A friend bought this for me some years ago. When I ran out I didn&#x27;t know where it was bought and found here on Amazon. It has a subtle smell and I&#x27;ve received many compliments on it. It doesn&#x27;t wear very long and you have to refresh it. But it&#x27;s never over powering. I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted this so I bought it for her. She absolutely loves it.</li>
