            <li>This Vaseline spray lotion smells absolutely great!</li>

            <li>He also noted that it was a great lotion to use before working out.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff.  </li>
            <li>BUT, I noticed how GREAT this product smelled...</li>
            <li>This is a great option for men who want something lightweight, convenient and doesn&#x27;t leave them smelling like flowers.</li>
            <li>A great product overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&amp; I am writing this review for a chance to win a prize.</li>

            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>We found that having a can of the Vaseline Men Spray and Go Body Lotion in his bag is very handy.</li>
            <li>this has been a very effective product for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This lotion is very nice.</li>
            <li>It absorbs nicely into the skin and the fragrance is nice a manly!!</li>
            <li>Plus it smells amazing!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>I received this in my #JadoreVoxBox as an incentive for testing purposes from Influentser and it came at the most awesome time!</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to try a spray lotion for my stepson, but after trying Vaseline Men Spray and Go body lotion, I&#x27;m glad to report it works great!</li>
            <li>Even though I am, these views are 100% my own!</li>
            <li>If it was scentless or more cologne smelling it would be perfect!</li>
            <li>We both enjoyed how it smelled, which is a great bonus!</li>
            <li>Easy to use, smells great but doesn&#x27;t absorb the best.</li>
            <li>However he decided to take the challenge for me and was pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell and you wouldn&#x27;t even need to wear cologne with it.</li>
            <li>It has a manly perfumed scent and is pleasant.</li>
            <li>Thank you influenster and vaseline for the chance to try it and possibly win more in the brand challenge!</li>
            <li>It sprays on so easy and soaks into the skin very nicely!</li>
            <li>He loved how it was light, and not at all greasy, or in his word, &amp;#34;lotioney.&amp;#34; It smells awesome, and I use it sometimes.</li>
            <li>Smells good and works, just like they said it would.</li>
            <li>So for that, I think it is definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li>However, I am not giving this brand 5 stars across the board to win a prize but to provide my honest opinion.  </li>
            <li>My husband loved this spray</li>
            <li>I recieved this product compliments of Influenster for testing purposes and loved the idea of a spray on lotion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a surprisingly good product that provides convenience and quality, I think we&#x27;d use this one again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li>My son liked it, and thought it smelled great.</li>
            <li>This product does a good job with moisturizing the skin.</li>
            <li>and I LOVED the way it sprayed on and soaked into my skin.  </li>
            <li>But whatever it is, it doesn&#x27;t feel good like lotion</li>
            <li>My husband LOVED this.</li>
            <li>He hasn&#x27;t ever been good about using lotion</li>
            <li>The smell lasted for a good while too, so he didn&#x27;t need to use cologne (that he doesn&#x27;t like using anyway)</li>
            <li>this makes his skin smell good and leave it&#x27;s moisturize his skin without living it greasy</li>
            <li>I am allergic to many scents, especially strong men&#x27;s cologne and lotion</li>
            <li>The lotion is super hydrating, smells awesome, and leaves no residue or greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>well all that has changed this product is wonderful, its lightweight, not greasy, and super hydrating</li>
            <li>he thought it was really innovative and a great concept</li>
            <li>It does a good job keeping my skin moisturized throughout the day, and I think it smells really nice.</li>
            <li>The masculine scent was great, and I think this is an especially great option for people who tend to skip moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It works great for him, leaves his skin soft, anf smells great too!</li>
            <li>and I love it!  </li>
            <li>AND it smells fantastic!!</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it&#x27;s spray!</li>
            <li>Love that the spray isn&#x27;t greasy and sticky!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE the scent!  </li>
            <li>I love this Vaseline Men Spray!</li>
            <li>Once he tried it he was in LOVE!</li>
            <li>I love when my husband uses this lotion!  </li>
            <li>His skin felt smooth and looked beautiful after a shower or in the morning.</li>
            <li>It smells great and goes on so easily.</li>
            <li>But this lotion is easy to use, and it smells great.</li>
            <li>I gave it a 3 as it does work great as a lotion it is just extremely strong scented.</li>
            <li>Non greasy, great smell, and absorbs quickly!</li>
            <li>This stuff smells great (has a light cologne type scent to it) and absorbs IMMEDIATELY.</li>
            <li>Amazing lotion.</li>

            <li>He also mentioned that he liked the smell.</li>
            <li>It would have been nice if it were scentless.</li>
            <li>The scent was nice, not overpowering, but noticeable.</li>
            <li>and he LOVED it, while I was ok with it.</li>
            <li>He ended up LOVING it.</li>
            <li>It rubbed in nicely though without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>The addition of the continuous spray was really nice as well.</li>

            <li>so he thought it might be something he would liked.</li>
            <li>He liked the lotion part but the smell he could do without.</li>
            <li>the lotion was nice on his skin but</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t understand the reviews that say it smells nice unless they are being written by women.  </li>
            <li>and he really liked it.</li>
            <li>and I myself tested it out as well and liked it too.</li>
            <li>Nice scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>

            <li>dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We received this product free for review purposes &amp; are entering the brand challenge to win more prizes</li>
            <li>Honestly, I think it works better that some of the lotions I own ... if it weren&#x27;t so manly smelling, I would be tempted to use it myself.</li>
            <li>He was eager to try it and when he did he loved how easy it was to dispense.</li>
            <li>this still sprays on and a quick fly swatting motion over the skin</li>

            <li>It moisturizes like normal lotion, and your skin absorbs it within seconds, leaving you feeling great, and smelling good too.</li>
            <li>and it said it was easy, fast and had a great scent!</li>
            <li>The can sprays easily and doesn&#x27;t leak!</li>
            <li>He loved the product, loved the ease and fast application it was to use.</li>

            <li>Great smell and very moisturizing!</li>
            <li>He says the it sprays nicely, with the right amount of lotion!!</li>
            <li>Not only is it truly fast-absorbing, it was very easy to apply and it smells great!</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, is easy to spray, and is non-greasy.</li>
            <li>While the scent was nice, it was a bit strong as I have allergies</li>
            <li>My husband liked the product and said it was easy to use.</li>
            <li>I liked the convenience of a spray and it made application easy.</li>
            <li>Received this Spray Lotion compliments of Influenster for testing purposes and it sure is a great product - best of all so easy to use and now i can get lotion on body in less then 1 min.  - thank you Vaseline</li>
            <li>but this solved the problem, light scent and light on skin!!</li>
            <li>but this absorbs super fast, keeps his skin hydrated and it smells really great!</li>
            <li>His skin looked healthy and glowing and felt very smooth.</li>
            <li>Trust me, that&#x27;s a huge compliment!</li>
            <li>As a guy, this is my favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>And I do not mind the smell, I have used it myself many times.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li>but, the most of it soaks in your skin within seconds!&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>I gifted it to my hubby on Valentine&#x27;s Day(the day the box came).</li>
            <li>It had a nice, light, manly scent.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed using this stuff</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>Thanks Influenster for sending us this great product to test.</li>
            <li>Better than anyting else when it comes to lotion.</li>
            <li>My husband and I both love this spray.</li>
            <li>Spray it on, rub it in and just like that, you&#x27;ll have smooth, manly-smelling skin!</li>
            <li>This one is a winner for my husband for sure.</li>
            <li>But most of all, he likes that it smells manly, unlike the girly scented moisturizers I always have on hand.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure what he&#x27;d think of this one.</li>
            <li>It has a nice light stream that covers  well.  </li>
            <li>My husband couldn&#x27;t have received this at a better time.</li>
            <li>They both love it and so do I.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the smell of it.</li>
            <li>Even though it has a musky based smell, i use it as well when i need it, and i love it as well.</li>
            <li>Would definatly recommend to a friend :)</li>
            <li>Most men don&#x27;t use lotion.</li>
            <li>and we have been so pleased with how well it works</li>
            <li>It keeps his elbows and arms smooth without being greasy!</li>
            <li>It stayed smooth and hydrated for hours!</li>
            <li>and I must say I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>and I love the smell.</li>
            <li>and he can spray it on real quick before walking out.  </li>
            <li>and he actually liked it non greasy fast absorvent smells really good</li>
            <li>It absorbs really fast and smells great.</li>
            <li>and this product made him able to smell like Daddy without using the cologne.  </li>
            <li>My husband and my son love the product.  </li>
            <li>It does not leave a sticky residue feeling which he hates most about applying lotion.</li>
            <li>My husband tend to avoid using body moisturizer mostly because he is a man and hates fuss.</li>
            <li>the smell for me was okay</li>
            <li>i hope they make more scents for men because i will buy everyone of them.</li>
            <li>My husband doesn&#x27;t like anything scented, but he is ok with this lotion.  </li>

            <li>i love this lotion.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s not the type to use lotion, so it was challenging to get him to try it.</li>
            <li>I know many men skip on lotions</li>
            <li>So, I may not be able to start hitting things</li>
            <li>he is using it more often.</li>
            <li>It does a better job of sticking around than most colognes or aftershaves I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li>He said this is without doubt his favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>My husband and son seem to really love this spray on lotion.</li>

            <li>I gave this to my husband to try after I received it from Influenster in the latest Vox Box.</li>
            <li>I personally love the way it smells.</li>
            <li>I love the women&#x27;s version but didn&#x27;t know they came out with a men&#x27;s version.</li>

            <li>plus it&#x27;s more easy for him to use</li>
            <li>The container is easy to hold and the close is ok.</li>
            <li>the smell was pleasant and considering it came out of a can its very moisturizing however its not for him.</li>
            <li>Its a super quick spray after he is out of the shower and he is good to go.</li>

            <li>And mine has dry skin, so when we got to try out this Vaseline Men Spray and Go Body Lotion as part of my #JaDoreVoxBox from Influenster, we were thrilled!</li>

            <li>Love the product easy and fast to use, it doesn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s scented; however, the scent I would say is something an older demographic would prefer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it several days in a row and the scent is very appealing.</li>

            <li>Its super easy and fast to keep your skin moisturized.</li>

            <li>I was sent this bottle of Vaseline Men&#x27;s Spray Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster for testing and review purposes, but I was actually really excited to finally get a bottle in my own hands.</li>

            <li>His new favorite thing.</li>
            <li>He really likes how easy it was to apply.</li>
            <li>The good news is that it sprayed cleanly (not all over the place), was easy to rub in, and wasn&#x27;t at all greasy.</li>
            <li>It absorbed quickly</li>
            <li>The bottles do not last as long as I would like, and it can be pricey but its a great product!</li>
            <li>Fast and easy to apply.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s just that it is such a strong perfume smell that strikes me as feminine and not something most guys would want to smell on their skin for an extended period of time.  </li>
            <li>, we both loved the ease of use and my Husband says he&#x27;ll most likely continue to use this in the future since it is so quick and easy when he&#x27;s in a hurry to get ready for work.</li>

            <li>He liked how fast adsorbing it was and how easy and efficient it is to use especially since he is always on the go.</li>
            <li>My husband isn&#x27;t a huge fan of moisturizing, so when I received this spray lotion from influenster, I was really hoping that he&#x27;d like it.  </li>
            <li>and did an amazing job of bringing color back to his tattoos.  </li>

            <li>day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary sample from #Influenster in exchange for my review.</li>
            <li>But it was fun to make him use it.</li>

            <li>My hubby tried the Vaseline Men Spray Lotion that I received complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster (J&#x27;adoreVoxBox) and he loves it.</li>
            <li>I received this lotion complimentary from Influenster.</li>
            <li>wife got it complimentary in her influenster vox box.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product complimentary from Influenster..</li>
            <li>/&gt;received this product complimentary from Influenster and that you are entering the Brand Challenge</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft and smells great and last all day long easy to use spray bottle comes in different scents and price is great</li>
            <li>He really liked the spray on and non-greasy qualities and that it seemed to take care of his dry skin for the full day.  </li>
            <li>You get the perfect amount of lotion everytime and don&#x27;t have to worry about making a mess like you would with a normal lotion when you pour too much into your hands.</li>
            <li>Super easy and no mess!</li>
            <li>And has a nice light scent that wont interfere with your other products.</li>
            <li>Easy to spray, quick drying, soft smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a feeling like no other I&#x27;ve experienced, especially in terms of lotion.  </li>
            <li>I on the other hand loved the scent.</li>
            <li>My husband said he doesn&#x27;t like the idea of lotion being in an aerosol can, even if it is drying faster, he much rather prefer lotion in its original stage of a tube or pump bottle.</li>
            <li>scent that is not overpowering, just the right amount.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>Right away he went to it, putting lotion on elbows, arms, etc.</li>
            <li>I knew that my son would be excited to try it but was surprised of how excited my husband was to try it, too.  </li>
            <li>He also loved the fact that it dried fast, didn&#x27;t leave any greasy feeling and was a continuous easy spray.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very strong and akin to generic underarm deodorant - which lasts for hours.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>He also loves that it is VERY easy to apply to his back.  </li>
            <li>It has a light smell not overly strong and definitely not a girly smell.</li>
            <li>It did, despite not drying as fast as we would have liked, work really well at moisturizing his skin and making it soft and touchable.</li>
            <li>The scent lasted for a long time which is nice, if you want to smell like that.</li>
            <li>so if your guy also doesnt take the time to put on cologne as long as he lotions up he will smelly nice n yummy.  </li>
            <li>product, portable, smells amazing and lasts a LONG time!</li>
            <li>It soaks in quickly and makes moisturizing go so much quicker...</li>
            <li>My husband has dry itchy skin and he liked the convenience of the spray.</li>
            <li>My husband liked it and it helped his dry winter hands</li>
            <li>Goes on fast and absorbes pretty quickly, though you may still need to rub the lotion in a bit.</li>
            <li>I love these new spray lotions as it makes applying lotion so easy and mess free.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for your gym bag or for those of us who don&#x27;t get up early enough to wait for moisturizer to dry before we get dressed.</li>
            <li>Super easy to put on just like the commercial.</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying a spray lotion</li>
            <li>It is great for the mornings that he is running late.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend it to other men for sure!</li>
            <li>My husband is pretty picky when it comes to lotions</li>
            <li>If it was offered scentless or in a different scent I think my husband would like it more and would be more likely to try it again or use it.</li>
            <li>He loves the light, masculine scent of this lotion.  </li>
            <li>We really like this lotion in our house!</li>
            <li>For this price I would expect it to absorb better, I still had to rub it in, but it definitely did not leave a greasy residue</li>
            <li>my husband absolutely loves the mens vaseline spray!</li>
            <li>He liked the idea of a spray lotion, but not really the lotion itself.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more convenient to use than regular lotion.</li>
            <li>And we both really like it!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get him to wear cologne at all, but he will use this lotion since it is actually helping his skin feel smooth!  </li>
            <li>He actually said to me that it made him want to put lotion on more than just his legs and arms because it was so convenient.  </li>
            <li>My Husband likes to take hot showers.</li>
            <li>An unscented formula might be better, especially for dudes.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, we never tried the lotion again</li>
            <li>Thanks influenster!</li>
            <li>Since his first use, he&#x27;s been keeping the can on his table beside his recliner to use whenever.</li>
            <li>my husband received this lotion from the latest influenster vox box and has been using it for the last month or so.  </li>
            <li>I would so try a hammer and many times would even find it as a stress relieving tool, but I have yet to find the company that sets this lady up with such a tool</li>
            <li>I like the concept of this, and when I first tried it</li>
            <li>I has a decent looking container and dries so quickly you can literally snap your fingers within 30 seconds after application.  </li>
            <li>Pretty convenient if you&#x27;re in a hurry.</li>
            <li>I never thought to try a men&#x27;s  lotion, but I really like this one!</li>
            <li>This was the first thing out of the box, snatched up by my hubby.</li>
            <li>In that case, it was a bit thinned and less effective, but still absorbed with only slightly more effort.</li>
            <li>Very fresh and masculine.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin super soft and is absorbed 100%, so there&#x27;s no sticky residue or anything.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>We received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, my husband is setting up our new life in Las Vegas, NV right now while I am here in Alabama</li>
            <li>No heavy greasy feeling left on their skin, Fast absorbing power and leaves their skin smelling good.</li>
            <li>it is a light lotion, non greasy, long lasting, and nicely scented.&lt;br /&gt;the cap locks</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a big plus, on top of that it really does do everything it says, takes about a minute for it to all soak in</li>
            <li>But my Husband does and it leaves his forearms so smooth and his tattoos look so much better when his skin isn&#x27;t dried out.</li>
            <li>I received a bottle of Vaseline Men Spray and Go body lotion fast absorbing spray complimentary from Influenster.</li>
            <li>AND it absorbs really well and moisturizes really well!</li>
            <li>He really likes that he can spray this on and it absorbs fast and doesn&#x27;t leave him feeling greasy!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great idea for guys--so much easier than normal lotion, and my husband prefers this over the smell of the stuff I usually buy.</li>
            <li>The new spray application seems like a foreign idea, but it is very innovative</li>
            <li>The product did exactly what it said it would do, dry up NOT leaving you greasy or sticky, didn&#x27;t over dry the skin, and smells amazing!  </li>
            <li>My husband got this product to try via #influenster #jadorevoxbox, I love the smell and it  helps with this dry skin this winter.</li>
            <li>I tried it out before I gave it to my husband and was pleasantly surprised by the quick spray applicator and immediate moisturizing.</li>
            <li>My husband got this product to try via #influenster #jadorevoxbox, I love the smell and it does seem to be helping with this dry skin this winter.  </li>
            <li>He has dry skin and never is able to use lotion because he hates the feel and smell</li>
            <li>the Vaseline Men&#x27;s lotion is the only one he ever buys so it was easy for me to tell him to try the spray-on version.  </li>
            <li>easy to apply and not oily, my two pet peeves from regular lotion.</li>
            <li>The only issue for me is the strong scent that it has.</li>
            <li>personally felt the sent was a tad strong, however he felt otherwise.  </li>
            <li>my husband instantly thought it was to strong.</li>
            <li>suggest that if you haven&#x27;t experienced this product in person you first look for it in your local drug store and spray a little on, do the rest of your shopping, and then see what you think.  </li>

            <li>I will certainly be purchasing him another bottle when he runs out.</li>
            <li>On the positive side it is convenient and fast drying.  </li>
            <li>Vaseline…You have found a new fan!!</li>
            <li>but it really does absorb quickly and leaves your skin extremely soft.</li>
            <li>there is a non-scented one we would definitely try it again because we did find it easy to use, travel worthy and overall nice but the smell it left behind not at all good for asthmatics.</li>
            <li>For men looking for a good hand and body lotion, this is hard product not to like.</li>
            <li>He had recently mentioned a few times that he wanted a moisturizer that isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34;(his words lol)</li>
            <li>My husband isn&#x27;t a huge fan of lotions only because he hates that greasy feel afterwards (and</li>
            <li>The formula really was &#x27;fast absorbing&#x27; unless he still had water droplets on his skin.</li>
            <li>We was surprised to see how fast it absorbed into his skin...</li>
            <li>He really likes it so fast, each to use &amp; very efficient.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling sticky and absorbs really fast into the skin</li>
            <li>He has the roughest elbows and a touch of eczema and he said that this really helped tons.</li>
            <li>The Vaseline Men&#x27;s Spray and Go Body Lotion really worked wonders on his arms and legs.  </li>
            <li>It dries fast so you can be dressed and on the go in minutes</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I asked my husband to try it on since he has been looking for a fast absorbing lotion that stays moisturized for a longer time.</li>
            <li>My husband really likes this product.  </li>
            <li>However, the scent was a bit much for both my husband and I.</li>
            <li>but I dont think it is too much (then again i like cologne)</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve hit on a few okay products yet most of them leave him feeling greasy or haven&#x27;t managed to have enough staying power.</li>
            <li>He found the Vaseline Spray and Go Lotion to be really convenient.  </li>
            <li>and you can&#x27;t misjudge how much you need.</li>
            <li>He loves the smell, the feel, how fast it absorbs, doesn&#x27;t make his skin feel like he is coated in slim.</li>
            <li>My husband is not one to really use a lotion</li>
            <li>He thought it would take up too much time</li>
            <li>but it really didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It goes on light but brings big moisture.</li>
            <li>thanks to influenster</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This spray and go is really</li>
            <li>My husband absolutely loves this stuff.</li>
            <li>He really enjoys the fact that all he has to do is spray it on and rub it in.</li>
            <li>and it really does keep him moisturized all day.</li>
            <li>Fast Absorbing</li>
            <li>Fast Cooling which cools and hydrates within seconds.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s very choosy when it comes to the lotion he uses and</li>
            <li>I think he really likes that it smells manly and not girly.</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>I received a sample of Vaseline Men Spray Lotion Fast Absorbing compliments of the Influenster J&#x27;adore VoxBox.</li>
            <li>Thankfully it didn&#x27;t really bother my fragrance allergies much.</li>
            <li>Thankfully it didn&#x27;t really bother my fragrance allergies much.</li>
            <li>, my husband doesn&#x27;t need lotion - he&#x27;s got really oily skin</li>
            <li>it was a very manly smell</li>
            <li>Influenster sent a can of the fast absorbing formula for my husband to try.</li>
            <li>however, he really didn&#x27;t care for the intensity of the scent.  </li>
            <li>but no lady wants to see or feel cracked skin……</li>

            <li>My husband and I got to test this product out thanks to influenster</li>
            <li>I got to try this product thanks to influenster.</li>
            <li>We received this product in our JAdoreVoxBox from Influenster and my husband really likes it.</li>
            <li>I got this lotion from influenster like a complimentary product to try and let me tell you this is by far</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve grown to really like the scent and</li>
            <li>I especially like the light scent it has.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to get him to stop and put lotion on, but the Vasoline spray is super easy!</li>
            <li>It was super convenient to spray on, but the sent was a little to strong.  </li>
            <li>It dries quickly, smells nice and is not sticky or thick!</li>
            <li>I blame the invisible troll/gnome that must be one clean smelling guy for the stash of extra deodorants, floss, to even shampoos that just go poof.</li>

            <li>Hubby said it felt a little great sort of like spray on sunblock, but it works wonders for his dry skin.</li>
            <li>He has very dry skin, especially in the winter, so it is more of a summer moisturizer for him, but he will be breaking it out again then!  </li>
            <li>he loved how ypu sprayed it on and took less time than regular lotion to put on!</li>
            <li>5 stars because normally, my husband absolutely loathes lotion.</li>
            <li>Well i liked the smell in a small dose</li>
            <li>The sample sent was a great timing since my husband was fixing the pipes and his hands got exposed to harsh stuff that made his hands very dry.</li>
            <li>We definitely will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>it is not a subtle smell</li>
            <li>After he gets done in the class, he takes a quick shower before heading to his next class.</li>
            <li>I will buy more in other scents if the other scents are as lightly scented.</li>
            <li>It has been great this winter with his usual dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I had high expectations for this product.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I felt moisturized for about half the day and had to put more on, my husband had to put more on after a few hours.</li>
            <li>If you were perhaps working as a programmer, or maybe if you were a gamer, and didn&#x27;t have time to wait for regular lotion to dry on your hands before putting them back on your keyboard/controller this might possibly be a good option for you.  </li>
            <li>chicks probably won&#x27;t like it cuz the application process for them is therapeutic and at times a little sexy.....</li>
            <li>when he first saw it he didn&#x27;t know what to expect, lotion out of a can seems a little bizarre</li>
            <li>I really do think the idea is neat, but I don&#x27;t see it working completely in this product quite yet.</li>
            <li>It dries fast and leaves you soft.  </li>
            <li>I can pretty much guarantee that no matter how long you might spend in the drug store, by the time you&#x27;re ready to check out</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll be thinking, \\&quot;wow, this scent really does linger\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I can pretty much guarantee that no matter how long you might spend in the drug store, by the time you&#x27;re ready to check out</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll be thinking, \\&quot;wow, this scent really does linger\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>He normally hates lotion because he hates the way it feels.</li>
            <li>My husband is not big on lotion use mostly because he can&#x27;t find one that smells masculine enough for him and doesn&#x27;t take forever to rub in.</li>
            <li>He normally hates lotion because it feels greasy to him.</li>
            <li>Instead, it comes out more &amp;#34;squirty&amp;#34; and uneven.</li>
            <li>After he did as such, he was liking the fact that it was easily absorbed and didn&#x27;t leave a greasy after feel.</li>
            <li>I hear claims of it smelling “girly” or the ever popular that the skin will feel “icky”.</li>
            <li>It smells great-but isn&#x27;t my husband&#x27;s favorite scent because he is not a huge fan of Axe spray and he says it smells a lot like it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as thick as the regular lotion and the scent is MUCH lighter (which is good, in my opinion).</li>
            <li>It also didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin more like some high fragrance women&#x27;s brands do, which was already slightly irritated from shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply even to your back or even back of the legs.</li>
            <li>One thing my husband complains about more than having dry skin is that after using lotion he is left smelling &amp;#34;like a chick.&amp;#34;  Not anymore!!  </li>
            <li>The product size was big too, its a very large can once you see it...</li>
            <li>and he says it&#x27;s a new staple for him.</li>
            <li>and he reports that there is a new sheen and softness to that arm.</li>
            <li>So my husband has been trying this new lotion for men</li>
            <li>My husband isn&#x27;t a huge lotion person and only uses it when absolutely necessary.</li>
            <li>Not greasy at all and left his rough hands feeling smooth!</li>
            <li>Looking for a quick, on-the-go solution to your dry, manly skin??</li>
            <li>Vaseline spray lotion is a quick way to moisturize your skin when you don&#x27;t have the time to wait for it to dry.</li>
            <li>I received a free Vaseline Men Spray and Go Body Lotion from Influenster and was excited to pass it on to my husband who has been suffering from dry skin with this extra long Winter.</li>
            <li>Husband is a very busy man.</li>
            <li>it also cause his skin is so soft and the scent lasts all day!</li>
            <li>While this is technically a men&#x27;s product the scent wasn&#x27;t as heavy or masculine that my boys liked this.</li>
            <li>When I got this spray lotion in my J&#x27;Adore Vox Box via Influenster, I was so surprised that a spray lotion even existed!</li>
            <li>husband normally doesn&#x27;t use lotion, but was pleasantly surprised by the product.</li>
            <li>He doesn&#x27;t mind that soft feeling after applying it!</li>
            <li>I would definitely say he would recommend this product to anyone interested in needing softer skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually not a fan of spray products (ex.</li>
            <li>;) I would definitely recommend this and will be purchasing it when my sample bottle runs out.</li>
            <li>I noticed the skin color changed (it’s alive!)</li>
            <li>But, to me, the fragrance is a little too strong.</li>
            <li>He likes how easy it is to use and that it actually helps his dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The application for the other arm was equally as fast despite not being with the dominant (right) hand.</li>
            <li>Teens are known to take long showers right?</li>
            <li>The canister goes empty way too quickly.</li>
            <li>The lotion quickly disappeared as he rubbed it in with only a few quick strokes.</li>
            <li>He did not enjoy the strong smell and it gave me headaches, so he took it to work to share.</li>
            <li>We will definitely be repurchasing, and highly recommend this lotion to any gentlemen who doesn&#x27;t normally like lotion (but still needs to use it!).</li>
            <li>I would like to mention that it absorbs quickly into skin, maybe a little too fast that you can&#x27;t rub it around.</li>
            <li>it kept his hands mess free and not greasy.</li>
            <li>Big thanks to Influenster.com for giving us the product to test</li>
            <li>He likes the soft scent and the moisturizing power.</li>
            <li>It is not heavy or greasy at all.</li>
            <li>It made his skin soft and not oily.</li>
            <li>Our 10 year old son seems to want to use it as well.</li>
            <li>My guy is adamantly against anything that has a scent to it</li>
            <li>My husband didn&#x27;t really notice the product actually moisturizing his skin.</li>
            <li>Place this in the bathroom near the shower</li>
            <li>It leaves his skin really soft and he even puts it on his face.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s not concerned with using skin care products that aren&#x27;t all natural (or almost natural)</li>
            <li>And I can&#x27;t spray it directly on my face.</li>
            <li>He loves it because its not greasy and he doesnt have to reapply it all day, like his old lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>Both have 24 hour moisturization, made to keep your skin soft all</li>
            <li>Also, like the fact that it&#x27;s not messy to apply on my skin.</li>
            <li>But this moisturizer actually surprised me.</li>
            <li>I found the Vaseline Spray comfortable to wear and it was not greasy or slippery when it dried.  </li>
            <li>Using it on his hands alone left are whole house smelling like a mens cologne shop.</li>
            <li>The spray nozzle is direct and doesn&#x27;t get everywhere.  </li>
            <li>but Vaseline always offers coupons, so there is ways to save $1 or even $2 off the reg price of the of the product...</li>
            <li>He is always rushing so something that absorbs fast &amp; is not sticky when he gets dressed was key to get the thumbs up</li>
            <li>how soft it makes his skin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel natural on the skin; it&#x27;s like some chemical stuff that may does harm to your skin.</li>
            <li>His only wish was that it came in a few different scents to choose from, as he wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the way it smelled.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Afterwards it left his skin extremely more soft than without it.&lt;br /&gt;There isnt nothing he disliked about this product.</li>
            <li>The smell was okay, but he likes thick creamy lotions and because this is a spray it is thinner</li>
            <li>Due to the fact that he is in a hurry to get to his next class after gym, he found he can keep his skin soft and keep it from drying out after gym class by quickly spraying on the lotion and heading out!</li>
            <li>this worked right away, wasnt greasy, and dried fast.  </li>
            <li>My truthful complaint is that I can&#x27;t borrow this due to the masculine scent! ;)</li>
            <li>My truthful complaint is that I can&#x27;t borrow this due to the masculine scent! ;)</li>
            <li>no mess</li>
            <li>It has a pretty strong &amp;#34;masculine&amp;#34; (not sure how they decide on such a scent) scent, but otherwise, it&#x27;s a regular lotion.</li>
            <li>He was skeptical at first, because he has his favorite lotion already.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The bottle and application was designed to be quick and thorough just like a typical spray-on sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Not only is it easy to use, it makes my morning routine move a little faster.</li>
            <li>Lastly, it makes my husband&#x27;s skin very soft!</li>
            <li>My husband is normally completely uncaring about lotion, no matter how much i tell him it will help his skin and he won&#x27;t feel as dry.</li>
            <li>my husband has only used it once or twice, rather than our normal vaseline lotion that we use.  </li>
            <li>It did not dry him out even more, as other lotions do, and seemed to last for a long time.  </li>
            <li>I like the spray feature because it makes it easy to get lotion on those hard to reach places.</li>
            <li>Very lightweight so if you have dry skin try something else like curel</li>
            <li>It did dry up quickly and it didn&#x27;t over dry his skin.</li>
            <li>major problem with this is the scent - which others have noted.  </li>
            <li>I definitely would recommend this to any guy (especially if you&#x27;ve got super dry skin)!</li>
            <li>The scent also did not bother my husband&#x27;s skin as many other heavily scented and dyed products have.</li>
            <li>It can be tough for a guy to want to use lotion, as most lotions on the market are made specifically for women.</li>
            <li>He said it was a light scent that wouldn’t interfere with his cologne, and that is really hard to find a man’s lotion that doesn’t do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>Overall, minus his personal dislike, he would definitely recommend this product to other men and would love to seek out a new scent to purchase in the future!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m personally not a fan of th &amp;#34;axe &amp; old spice&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy or that feeling of having much product on and at the same time making my rough skin feel soft.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t take a lot to cover a larger area, but didn&#x27;t dry as fast as we would have thought with the description.</li>
            <li>I made him try this spray, because it smelled good and his skin has been a little dry lately.</li>
            <li>He might enjoy the heat, but such heat causes dry skin during harsh winters.</li>
            <li>wow, my husband usually does not like to wear lotion because he doesn&#x27;t like the greasy feeling of it dispite the fact that he has super dry skin.</li>
            <li>when he first sprayed it, it initially felt greasy (it claims not to be greasy on the bottle) not too greasy but slightly greasy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised spray lotion wasn&#x27;t created a long time ago.</li>
            <li>My husband loves this spray lotion -- it&#x27;s never greasy, it&#x27;s convenient, and it really works on his dry, dry skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;He&#x27;s constantly complaining about dry skin but also has very sensitive skin that does not like perfumes and dyes so finding a product that works well for him has been a problem.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and would look to buy other Vaseline spray lotions.</li>
            <li>You have lotions that dry in seconds but hydrate, leaving your skin feeling non-greasy, but still soft.</li>
            <li>The lotion isn&#x27;t too thick (probably because it is a spray) to it absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>It can be a little cold at first, you don&#x27;t have the lotion in your hands to warm it up.</li>
            <li>The only mark down is that if either of us uses too much, the smell bothers my husband&#x27;s sinuses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this lotion complementary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>It makes his scaly skin feel soft with limited greasy residue.</li>
            <li>My husband and I have moved in the last year and our skin was having a rough time getting use to the new harsher winter conditions.</li>

            <li> My husband used it and said it was really awesome and didn&#x27;t give him that &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; feeling that lotions do after rubbing it in.  </li>
            <li> A chemical feel is perhaps the best way I can describe it.  </li>
            <li> It smells very great.</li>
            <li> This Vaseline spray lotion smells absolutely great!</li>
            <li> I think the best quality is the fact that you can spray a even amount on your body vs. dumping the lotion in your hand and trying to spread the lotion all over the body..</li>
            <li> A great find for men&#x27;s skincare needs!</li>

            <li> He also noted that it was a great lotion to use before working out.  </li>
            <li> Great stuff.  </li>
            <li> BUT, I noticed how GREAT this product smelled...</li>
            <li> This is a great option for men who want something lightweight, convenient and doesn&#x27;t leave them smelling like flowers.</li>
            <li> A great product overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &amp; I am writing this review for a chance to win a prize.</li>
            <li> The smell of the lotion stays with you all day too which is great too.  </li>

            <li> My hubby &amp; I love it!!</li>
            <li> Love it!!</li>
            <li> We found that having a can of the Vaseline Men Spray and Go Body Lotion in his bag is very handy.</li>
            <li> this has been a very effective product for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This lotion is very nice.</li>
            <li> It absorbs nicely into the skin and the fragrance is nice a manly!!</li>
            <li> Plus it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> I received this in my #JadoreVoxBox as an incentive for testing purposes from Influentser and it came at the most awesome time!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try a spray lotion for my stepson, but after trying Vaseline Men Spray and Go body lotion, I&#x27;m glad to report it works great!</li>
            <li> Even though I am, these views are 100% my own!</li>
            <li> If it was scentless or more cologne smelling it would be perfect!</li>
            <li> We both enjoyed how it smelled, which is a great bonus!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, smells great but doesn&#x27;t absorb the best.</li>
            <li> However he decided to take the challenge for me and was pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell and you wouldn&#x27;t even need to wear cologne with it.</li>
            <li> It has a manly perfumed scent and is pleasant.</li>
            <li> Thank you influenster and vaseline for the chance to try it and possibly win more in the brand challenge!</li>
            <li> It sprays on so easy and soaks into the skin very nicely!</li>
            <li> He loved how it was light, and not at all greasy, or in his word, &amp;#34;lotioney.&amp;#34; It smells awesome, and I use it sometimes.</li>
            <li> Smells good and works, just like they said it would.</li>
            <li> So for that, I think it is definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li> However, I am not giving this brand 5 stars across the board to win a prize but to provide my honest opinion.  </li>
            <li> My husband loved this spray</li>
            <li> I recieved this product compliments of Influenster for testing purposes and loved the idea of a spray on lotion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, a surprisingly good product that provides convenience and quality, I think we&#x27;d use this one again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li> My son liked it, and thought it smelled great.</li>
            <li> This product does a good job with moisturizing the skin.</li>
            <li> and I LOVED the way it sprayed on and soaked into my skin.  </li>
            <li> But whatever it is, it doesn&#x27;t feel good like lotion</li>
            <li> My husband LOVED this.</li>
            <li> He hasn&#x27;t ever been good about using lotion</li>
            <li> The smell lasted for a good while too, so he didn&#x27;t need to use cologne (that he doesn&#x27;t like using anyway)</li>
            <li> this makes his skin smell good and leave it&#x27;s moisturize his skin without living it greasy</li>
            <li> I am allergic to many scents, especially strong men&#x27;s cologne and lotion</li>
            <li> The lotion is super hydrating, smells awesome, and leaves no residue or greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> well all that has changed this product is wonderful, its lightweight, not greasy, and super hydrating</li>
            <li> he thought it was really innovative and a great concept</li>
            <li> It does a good job keeping my skin moisturized throughout the day, and I think it smells really nice.</li>
            <li> The masculine scent was great, and I think this is an especially great option for people who tend to skip moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It works great for him, leaves his skin soft, anf smells great too!</li>
            <li> and I love it!  </li>
            <li> AND it smells fantastic!!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it&#x27;s spray!</li>
            <li> Love that the spray isn&#x27;t greasy and sticky!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE the scent!  </li>
            <li> I love this Vaseline Men Spray!</li>
            <li> Once he tried it he was in LOVE!</li>
            <li> I love when my husband uses this lotion!  </li>
            <li> His skin felt smooth and looked beautiful after a shower or in the morning.</li>
            <li> It smells great and goes on so easily.</li>
            <li> But this lotion is easy to use, and it smells great.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 3 as it does work great as a lotion it is just extremely strong scented.</li>
            <li> Non greasy, great smell, and absorbs quickly!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great (has a light cologne type scent to it) and absorbs IMMEDIATELY.</li>
            <li> Amazing lotion.</li>
            <li> This spray on lotion for men was amazing.  </li>
            <li> He really liked this product and says he likes that it doesn&#x27;t leave his skin feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> He also mentioned that he liked the smell.</li>
            <li> It would have been nice if it were scentless.</li>
            <li> The scent was nice, not overpowering, but noticeable.</li>
            <li> and he LOVED it, while I was ok with it.</li>
            <li> He ended up LOVING it.</li>
            <li> It rubbed in nicely though without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> The addition of the continuous spray was really nice as well.</li>
            <li> My review is a 100% honest opinion about how I feel about the product.</li>
            <li> He also liked how the lotion made his skin feel.</li>
            <li> How ever my opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> My man liked it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Notes: I received this product for through Influenster for testing and honest review without compensation.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too greasy and has a nice scent.  </li>
            <li> The opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> This really is the greatest ever!</li>
            <li> All opinions my own.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this lotion from Influenster, but these are my honest thoughts on it.</li>
            <li> great!!It just glide on nicely.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy, which I liked</li>
            <li> so he thought it might be something he would liked.</li>
            <li> He liked the lotion part but the smell he could do without.</li>
            <li> the lotion was nice on his skin but</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t understand the reviews that say it smells nice unless they are being written by women.  </li>
            <li> and he really liked it.</li>
            <li> and I myself tested it out as well and liked it too.</li>
            <li> Nice scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li> Not greasy, goes on nice and even.  </li>
            <li> Even though this review is 100% my own thoughts and opinion..</li>
            <li> This lotion has a really nice smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering and is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> and we both liked it.</li>

            <li> Honestly, I think it works better that some of the lotions I own ... if it weren&#x27;t so manly smelling, I would be tempted to use it myself.</li>
            <li> He was eager to try it and when he did he loved how easy it was to dispense.</li>
            <li> this still sprays on and a quick fly swatting motion over the skin</li>

            <li> Spray it on, rub it in and just like that, you&#x27;ll have smooth, manly-smelling skin!</li>
            <li> This one is a winner for my husband for sure.</li>
            <li> But most of all, he likes that it smells manly, unlike the girly scented moisturizers I always have on hand.</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t sure what he&#x27;d think of this one.</li>
            <li> It has a nice light stream that covers  well.  </li>
            <li> My husband couldn&#x27;t have received this at a better time.</li>
            <li> They both love it and so do I.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell of it.</li>
            <li> Even though it has a musky based smell, i use it as well when i need it, and i love it as well.</li>
            <li> Would definatly recommend to a friend :)</li>
            <li> Most men don&#x27;t use lotion.</li>
            <li> and we have been so pleased with how well it works</li>
            <li> It keeps his elbows and arms smooth without being greasy!</li>
            <li> It stayed smooth and hydrated for hours!</li>
            <li> and I must say I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> and he can spray it on real quick before walking out.  </li>
            <li> and he actually liked it non greasy fast absorvent smells really good</li>
            <li> It absorbs really fast and smells great.</li>
            <li> and this product made him able to smell like Daddy without using the cologne.  </li>
            <li> My husband and my son love the product.  </li>
            <li> It does not leave a sticky residue feeling which he hates most about applying lotion.</li>
            <li> My husband tend to avoid using body moisturizer mostly because he is a man and hates fuss.</li>
            <li> the smell for me was okay</li>
            <li> i hope they make more scents for men because i will buy everyone of them.</li>
            <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t like anything scented, but he is ok with this lotion.  </li>
            <li> we love it my hubby and and of course me i love the way my husband smells</li>
            <li> and he feel great thanks</li>
            <li> If you turn the sprayer at the top, it closes the spray hole, so makes it safe to take when traveling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Got this Body Spray in my latest Influenster VoxBox.  </li>
            <li> love the smell of it, but he wishes that it was fragrance free.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Love the fact you just spray without having to rub it in.</li>

            <li> i love this lotion.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s not the type to use lotion, so it was challenging to get him to try it.</li>
            <li> I know many men skip on lotions</li>
            <li> So, I may not be able to start hitting things</li>
            <li> he is using it more often.</li>
            <li> It does a better job of sticking around than most colognes or aftershaves I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li> He said this is without doubt his favorite lotion.</li>
            <li> My husband and son seem to really love this spray on lotion.</li>
            <li> My hubby and I love this.</li>
            <li> It has a manly smell so women wouldn&#x27;t be able to use their guy&#x27;s lotion.</li>
            <li> It is healing the cracks on his fingers and makes the skin on his face feel better almost immediately after applying.  </li>
            <li> Thank you for the free sample and also for the product that is helping heal his skin!</li>
            <li> My husband really enjoyed the Vaseline Men&#x27;s Spray and Go Body Lotion...</li>
            <li> He also liked the fact that it had a nice fresh smell to it...</li>
            <li> , we love it &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> He finally has a lotion that&#x27;s not greasy and smells great that works on his knees!</li>
            <li> I gave this to my husband to try after I received it from Influenster in the latest Vox Box.</li>
            <li> I personally love the way it smells.</li>
            <li> I love the women&#x27;s version but didn&#x27;t know they came out with a men&#x27;s version.</li>

            <li> The first thing he said is that it was so light and smelled great.</li>
            <li> I nice, clean &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> He loved how fast and easy it was to apply and that it wasn&#x27;t overly greasy!</li>

            <li> plus it&#x27;s more easy for him to use</li>
            <li> The container is easy to hold and the close is ok.</li>

            <li> loved how easy it was to use and how fast it was to apply.  </li>

            <li> Plus its really quick and easy!</li>

            <li> i got this as a full sized sample from #influenster and</li>
            <li> I received a full sized sample of this produce in my #JAdoreVoxBox from Influenster.</li>
            <li> My husband is a full time student, and one of his classes this semester is gym.</li>
            <li> I received a full sized sample in my #JAdoreVoxBox from Influenster.</li>
            <li> Loves that he doesn&#x27;t have to get his hands all full of stuff.  </li>
            <li> but it also smells good definitely a mans scent.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and cleanly.</li>
            <li> The coloring of the can is really cool.</li>
            <li> Pros: Easy to use, smells good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: doesn&#x27;t absorb very fast</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and rubs in quickly not greasy at all and smells great though the scent is a manly one</li>
            <li> He liked the simplicity of the product, that it was easy to use, the amount of lotion dispensed in one spray was enough and it didn&#x27;t leave him feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So for him, to try a new lotion product that was designed to be fast, easy and effective - he was curious.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And mine has dry skin, so when we got to try out this Vaseline Men Spray and Go Body Lotion as part of my #JaDoreVoxBox from Influenster, we were thrilled!</li>
            <li> Too &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; for me, but other than that its a great product.</li>
            <li> The spray did not clog, which is something that I&#x27;ve experienced in other brands of this nature.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> it goes on fast, absorbs fast, and leaves your skin nice and moisturized.</li>
            <li> It sprays evenly and does absorb quick.</li>
            <li> While we are posting this as an entry submission, the opinions are our own and not influenced by the free product or possible prize winnings.</li>

            <li> sprays on and dries quick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hydrating, absorbs quickly, and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;He uses it daily -- I know because he smells great, thanks to the lotion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and is non-greasy.</li>
            <li> Husband took the bottle in his hand and with one quick motion had sprayed his arm.</li>
            <li> My teenager uses it int he morning after his shower before he gets dressed - it&#x27;s got a pleasant smell, dries quickly and helps him avoid dry itchy skin.</li>
            <li> In the end, I am glad for the hygiene and finally a lotion that is “non-icky” and feels like nothing happened, but thankfully is working :)</li>

            <li> I honestly love this product and believe it&#x27;s simple, affordable and innovative..</li>
            <li> my favorite lotion for my husband mainly because the scent and he says that absorbs quickly after application, moisturize and is not greasy</li>
            <li> This spray goes on and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use and not messy at all.  </li>
            <li> I received this complimentary in a VoxBox via Influenster JUST at the right time!</li>
            <li> both enjoyed the fact that it doesn&#x27;t leave that greasy feeling that normal lotions do.</li>
            <li> Love the product easy and fast to use, it doesn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s scented; however, the scent I would say is something an older demographic would prefer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it several days in a row and the scent is very appealing.</li>
            <li> He loves that he doesn&#x27;t have to rub it in, it lasts all day long and it smells good too.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product easy to use and last all day, not greasy and smells good too, I highly recommend</li>
            <li> Its super easy and fast to keep your skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> The can is a little tall for most shaving kits, and a smaller travel size would be useful, but this is a product most men would use and welcome regardless of can size.</li>
            <li> I was sent this bottle of Vaseline Men&#x27;s Spray Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster for testing and review purposes, but I was actually really excited to finally get a bottle in my own hands.</li>
            <li> I live with 3 handsome growing boys.</li>
            <li> His new favorite thing.</li>
            <li> He really likes how easy it was to apply.</li>
            <li> The good news is that it sprayed cleanly (not all over the place), was easy to rub in, and wasn&#x27;t at all greasy.</li>
            <li> It absorbed quickly</li>
            <li> The bottles do not last as long as I would like, and it can be pricey but its a great product!</li>
            <li> Fast and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Although the family agreed that the spray part of this packaging was cool, the actual lotion was nice too.</li>
            <li> it is fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast and easy to use and moisturizes well without being greasy.</li>
            <li> We have already recommended this lotion to several friends, who have said they love it also!</li>
            <li> this runs out, we&#x27;ll definitely go buy more!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just that it is such a strong perfume smell that strikes me as feminine and not something most guys would want to smell on their skin for an extended period of time.  </li>
            <li> , we both loved the ease of use and my Husband says he&#x27;ll most likely continue to use this in the future since it is so quick and easy when he&#x27;s in a hurry to get ready for work.</li>

            <li> When I received the spray lotion as an item in my complimentary J&#x27;Adore VoxBox, I was pretty excited to have him try</li>
            <li> He liked how fast adsorbing it was and how easy and efficient it is to use especially since he is always on the go.</li>
            <li> My husband isn&#x27;t a huge fan of moisturizing, so when I received this spray lotion from influenster, I was really hoping that he&#x27;d like it.  </li>
            <li> and did an amazing job of bringing color back to his tattoos.  </li>

            <li> But it was fun to make him use it.</li>

            <li> wife got it complimentary in her influenster vox box.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product complimentary from Influenster..</li>
            <li> /&gt;received this product complimentary from Influenster and that you are entering the Brand Challenge</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft and smells great and last all day long easy to use spray bottle comes in different scents and price is great</li>
            <li> He really liked the spray on and non-greasy qualities and that it seemed to take care of his dry skin for the full day.  </li>
            <li> You get the perfect amount of lotion everytime and don&#x27;t have to worry about making a mess like you would with a normal lotion when you pour too much into your hands.</li>
            <li> Super easy and no mess!</li>
            <li> And has a nice light scent that wont interfere with your other products.</li>
            <li> Easy to spray, quick drying, soft smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a feeling like no other I&#x27;ve experienced, especially in terms of lotion.  </li>
            <li> I on the other hand loved the scent.</li>
            <li> My husband said he doesn&#x27;t like the idea of lotion being in an aerosol can, even if it is drying faster, he much rather prefer lotion in its original stage of a tube or pump bottle.</li>
            <li> scent that is not overpowering, just the right amount.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> Right away he went to it, putting lotion on elbows, arms, etc.</li>
            <li> I knew that my son would be excited to try it but was surprised of how excited my husband was to try it, too.  </li>
            <li> He also loved the fact that it dried fast, didn&#x27;t leave any greasy feeling and was a continuous easy spray.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s very strong and akin to generic underarm deodorant - which lasts for hours.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> He also loves that it is VERY easy to apply to his back.  </li>
            <li> It has a light smell not overly strong and definitely not a girly smell.</li>
            <li> It did, despite not drying as fast as we would have liked, work really well at moisturizing his skin and making it soft and touchable.</li>
            <li> The scent lasted for a long time which is nice, if you want to smell like that.</li>
            <li> so if your guy also doesnt take the time to put on cologne as long as he lotions up he will smelly nice n yummy.  </li>
            <li> product, portable, smells amazing and lasts a LONG time!</li>
            <li> It soaks in quickly and makes moisturizing go so much quicker...</li>
            <li> My husband has dry itchy skin and he liked the convenience of the spray.</li>
            <li> My husband liked it and it helped his dry winter hands</li>
            <li> Goes on fast and absorbes pretty quickly, though you may still need to rub the lotion in a bit.</li>
            <li> I love these new spray lotions as it makes applying lotion so easy and mess free.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for your gym bag or for those of us who don&#x27;t get up early enough to wait for moisturizer to dry before we get dressed.</li>
            <li> Super easy to put on just like the commercial.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying a spray lotion</li>
            <li> It is great for the mornings that he is running late.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it to other men for sure!</li>
            <li> My husband is pretty picky when it comes to lotions</li>
            <li> If it was offered scentless or in a different scent I think my husband would like it more and would be more likely to try it again or use it.</li>
            <li> He loves the light, masculine scent of this lotion.  </li>
            <li> We really like this lotion in our house!</li>
            <li> For this price I would expect it to absorb better, I still had to rub it in, but it definitely did not leave a greasy residue</li>
            <li> my husband absolutely loves the mens vaseline spray!</li>
            <li> He liked the idea of a spray lotion, but not really the lotion itself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more convenient to use than regular lotion.</li>
            <li> And we both really like it!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get him to wear cologne at all, but he will use this lotion since it is actually helping his skin feel smooth!  </li>
            <li> He actually said to me that it made him want to put lotion on more than just his legs and arms because it was so convenient.  </li>
            <li> My Husband likes to take hot showers.</li>
            <li> An unscented formula might be better, especially for dudes.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, we never tried the lotion again</li>
            <li> Thanks influenster!</li>
            <li> Since his first use, he&#x27;s been keeping the can on his table beside his recliner to use whenever.</li>
            <li> my husband received this lotion from the latest influenster vox box and has been using it for the last month or so.  </li>
            <li> I would so try a hammer and many times would even find it as a stress relieving tool, but I have yet to find the company that sets this lady up with such a tool</li>
            <li> I like the concept of this, and when I first tried it</li>
            <li> I has a decent looking container and dries so quickly you can literally snap your fingers within 30 seconds after application.  </li>
            <li> Pretty convenient if you&#x27;re in a hurry.</li>
            <li> I never thought to try a men&#x27;s  lotion, but I really like this one!</li>
            <li> This was the first thing out of the box, snatched up by my hubby.</li>
            <li> In that case, it was a bit thinned and less effective, but still absorbed with only slightly more effort.</li>
            <li> Very fresh and masculine.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin super soft and is absorbed 100%, so there&#x27;s no sticky residue or anything.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> We received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, my husband is setting up our new life in Las Vegas, NV right now while I am here in Alabama</li>
            <li> No heavy greasy feeling left on their skin, Fast absorbing power and leaves their skin smelling good.</li>
            <li> it is a light lotion, non greasy, long lasting, and nicely scented.&lt;br /&gt;the cap locks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a big plus, on top of that it really does do everything it says, takes about a minute for it to all soak in</li>
            <li> But my Husband does and it leaves his forearms so smooth and his tattoos look so much better when his skin isn&#x27;t dried out.</li>
            <li> I received a bottle of Vaseline Men Spray and Go body lotion fast absorbing spray complimentary from Influenster.</li>
            <li> AND it absorbs really well and moisturizes really well!</li>
            <li> He really likes that he can spray this on and it absorbs fast and doesn&#x27;t leave him feeling greasy!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great idea for guys--so much easier than normal lotion, and my husband prefers this over the smell of the stuff I usually buy.</li>
            <li> The new spray application seems like a foreign idea, but it is very innovative</li>
            <li> The product did exactly what it said it would do, dry up NOT leaving you greasy or sticky, didn&#x27;t over dry the skin, and smells amazing!  </li>
            <li> My husband got this product to try via #influenster #jadorevoxbox, I love the smell and it  helps with this dry skin this winter.</li>
            <li> I tried it out before I gave it to my husband and was pleasantly surprised by the quick spray applicator and immediate moisturizing.</li>
            <li> My husband got this product to try via #influenster #jadorevoxbox, I love the smell and it does seem to be helping with this dry skin this winter.  </li>
            <li> He has dry skin and never is able to use lotion because he hates the feel and smell</li>
            <li> the Vaseline Men&#x27;s lotion is the only one he ever buys so it was easy for me to tell him to try the spray-on version.  </li>
            <li> easy to apply and not oily, my two pet peeves from regular lotion.</li>
            <li> The only issue for me is the strong scent that it has.</li>
            <li> personally felt the sent was a tad strong, however he felt otherwise.  </li>
            <li> my husband instantly thought it was to strong.</li>
            <li> suggest that if you haven&#x27;t experienced this product in person you first look for it in your local drug store and spray a little on, do the rest of your shopping, and then see what you think.  </li>

            <li> I will certainly be purchasing him another bottle when he runs out.</li>
            <li> On the positive side it is convenient and fast drying.  </li>
            <li> Vaseline…You have found a new fan!!</li>
            <li> but it really does absorb quickly and leaves your skin extremely soft.</li>
            <li> there is a non-scented one we would definitely try it again because we did find it easy to use, travel worthy and overall nice but the smell it left behind not at all good for asthmatics.</li>
            <li> For men looking for a good hand and body lotion, this is hard product not to like.</li>
            <li> He had recently mentioned a few times that he wanted a moisturizer that isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34;(his words lol)</li>
            <li> My husband isn&#x27;t a huge fan of lotions only because he hates that greasy feel afterwards (and</li>
            <li> The formula really was &#x27;fast absorbing&#x27; unless he still had water droplets on his skin.</li>
            <li> We was surprised to see how fast it absorbed into his skin...</li>
            <li> He really likes it so fast, each to use &amp; very efficient.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling sticky and absorbs really fast into the skin</li>
            <li> He has the roughest elbows and a touch of eczema and he said that this really helped tons.</li>
            <li> The Vaseline Men&#x27;s Spray and Go Body Lotion really worked wonders on his arms and legs.  </li>
            <li> It dries fast so you can be dressed and on the go in minutes</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I asked my husband to try it on since he has been looking for a fast absorbing lotion that stays moisturized for a longer time.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this product.  </li>
            <li> However, the scent was a bit much for both my husband and I.</li>
            <li> but I dont think it is too much (then again i like cologne)</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve hit on a few okay products yet most of them leave him feeling greasy or haven&#x27;t managed to have enough staying power.</li>
            <li> He found the Vaseline Spray and Go Lotion to be really convenient.  </li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t misjudge how much you need.</li>
            <li> He loves the smell, the feel, how fast it absorbs, doesn&#x27;t make his skin feel like he is coated in slim.</li>
            <li> My husband is not one to really use a lotion</li>
            <li> He thought it would take up too much time</li>
            <li> but it really didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It goes on light but brings big moisture.</li>
            <li> thanks to influenster</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This spray and go is really</li>
            <li> My husband absolutely loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> He really enjoys the fact that all he has to do is spray it on and rub it in.</li>
            <li> and it really does keep him moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> Fast Absorbing</li>
            <li> Fast Cooling which cools and hydrates within seconds.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s very choosy when it comes to the lotion he uses and</li>
            <li> I think he really likes that it smells manly and not girly.</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of Vaseline Men Spray Lotion Fast Absorbing compliments of the Influenster J&#x27;adore VoxBox.</li>
            <li> Thankfully it didn&#x27;t really bother my fragrance allergies much.</li>
            <li> Thankfully it didn&#x27;t really bother my fragrance allergies much.</li>
            <li> , my husband doesn&#x27;t need lotion - he&#x27;s got really oily skin</li>
            <li> it was a very manly smell</li>
            <li> Influenster sent a can of the fast absorbing formula for my husband to try.</li>
            <li> however, he really didn&#x27;t care for the intensity of the scent.  </li>
            <li> but no lady wants to see or feel cracked skin……</li>
            <li> received the above product free of charge from Influenster &amp; Vaseline.</li>
            <li> received the above product free of charge from Influenster &amp; Vaseline.</li>
            <li> My husband and I got to test this product out thanks to influenster</li>
            <li> I got to try this product thanks to influenster.</li>
            <li> We received this product in our JAdoreVoxBox from Influenster and my husband really likes it.</li>
            <li> I got this lotion from influenster like a complimentary product to try and let me tell you this is by far</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve grown to really like the scent and</li>
            <li> I especially like the light scent it has.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get him to stop and put lotion on, but the Vasoline spray is super easy!</li>
            <li> It was super convenient to spray on, but the sent was a little to strong.  </li>
            <li> It dries quickly, smells nice and is not sticky or thick!</li>
            <li> I blame the invisible troll/gnome that must be one clean smelling guy for the stash of extra deodorants, floss, to even shampoos that just go poof.</li>

            <li> Hubby said it felt a little great sort of like spray on sunblock, but it works wonders for his dry skin.</li>
            <li> He has very dry skin, especially in the winter, so it is more of a summer moisturizer for him, but he will be breaking it out again then!  </li>
            <li> he loved how ypu sprayed it on and took less time than regular lotion to put on!</li>
            <li> 5 stars because normally, my husband absolutely loathes lotion.</li>
            <li> Well i liked the smell in a small dose</li>
            <li> The sample sent was a great timing since my husband was fixing the pipes and his hands got exposed to harsh stuff that made his hands very dry.</li>
            <li> We definitely will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> it is not a subtle smell</li>
            <li> After he gets done in the class, he takes a quick shower before heading to his next class.</li>
            <li> I will buy more in other scents if the other scents are as lightly scented.</li>
            <li> It has been great this winter with his usual dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this product.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I felt moisturized for about half the day and had to put more on, my husband had to put more on after a few hours.</li>
            <li> If you were perhaps working as a programmer, or maybe if you were a gamer, and didn&#x27;t have time to wait for regular lotion to dry on your hands before putting them back on your keyboard/controller this might possibly be a good option for you.  </li>
            <li> chicks probably won&#x27;t like it cuz the application process for them is therapeutic and at times a little sexy.....</li>
            <li> when he first saw it he didn&#x27;t know what to expect, lotion out of a can seems a little bizarre</li>
            <li> I really do think the idea is neat, but I don&#x27;t see it working completely in this product quite yet.</li>
            <li> It dries fast and leaves you soft.  </li>
            <li> I can pretty much guarantee that no matter how long you might spend in the drug store, by the time you&#x27;re ready to check out</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll be thinking, \\&quot;wow, this scent really does linger\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I can pretty much guarantee that no matter how long you might spend in the drug store, by the time you&#x27;re ready to check out</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll be thinking, \\&quot;wow, this scent really does linger\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> He normally hates lotion because he hates the way it feels.</li>
            <li> My husband is not big on lotion use mostly because he can&#x27;t find one that smells masculine enough for him and doesn&#x27;t take forever to rub in.</li>
            <li> He normally hates lotion because it feels greasy to him.</li>
            <li> Instead, it comes out more &amp;#34;squirty&amp;#34; and uneven.</li>
            <li> After he did as such, he was liking the fact that it was easily absorbed and didn&#x27;t leave a greasy after feel.</li>
            <li> I hear claims of it smelling “girly” or the ever popular that the skin will feel “icky”.</li>
            <li> It smells great-but isn&#x27;t my husband&#x27;s favorite scent because he is not a huge fan of Axe spray and he says it smells a lot like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as thick as the regular lotion and the scent is MUCH lighter (which is good, in my opinion).</li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin more like some high fragrance women&#x27;s brands do, which was already slightly irritated from shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply even to your back or even back of the legs.</li>
            <li> One thing my husband complains about more than having dry skin is that after using lotion he is left smelling &amp;#34;like a chick.&amp;#34;  Not anymore!!  </li>
            <li> The product size was big too, its a very large can once you see it...</li>
            <li> and he says it&#x27;s a new staple for him.</li>
            <li> and he reports that there is a new sheen and softness to that arm.</li>
            <li> So my husband has been trying this new lotion for men</li>
            <li> My husband isn&#x27;t a huge lotion person and only uses it when absolutely necessary.</li>
            <li> Not greasy at all and left his rough hands feeling smooth!</li>
            <li> Looking for a quick, on-the-go solution to your dry, manly skin??</li>
            <li> Vaseline spray lotion is a quick way to moisturize your skin when you don&#x27;t have the time to wait for it to dry.</li>
            <li> I received a free Vaseline Men Spray and Go Body Lotion from Influenster and was excited to pass it on to my husband who has been suffering from dry skin with this extra long Winter.</li>
            <li> Husband is a very busy man.</li>
            <li> it also cause his skin is so soft and the scent lasts all day!</li>
            <li> While this is technically a men&#x27;s product the scent wasn&#x27;t as heavy or masculine that my boys liked this.</li>
            <li> When I got this spray lotion in my J&#x27;Adore Vox Box via Influenster, I was so surprised that a spray lotion even existed!</li>
            <li> husband normally doesn&#x27;t use lotion, but was pleasantly surprised by the product.</li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t mind that soft feeling after applying it!</li>
            <li> I would definitely say he would recommend this product to anyone interested in needing softer skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually not a fan of spray products (ex.</li>
            <li> ;) I would definitely recommend this and will be purchasing it when my sample bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> I noticed the skin color changed (it’s alive!)</li>
            <li> But, to me, the fragrance is a little too strong.</li>
            <li> He likes how easy it is to use and that it actually helps his dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The application for the other arm was equally as fast despite not being with the dominant (right) hand.</li>
            <li> Teens are known to take long showers right?</li>
            <li> The canister goes empty way too quickly.</li>
            <li> The lotion quickly disappeared as he rubbed it in with only a few quick strokes.</li>
            <li> He did not enjoy the strong smell and it gave me headaches, so he took it to work to share.</li>
            <li> We will definitely be repurchasing, and highly recommend this lotion to any gentlemen who doesn&#x27;t normally like lotion (but still needs to use it!).</li>
            <li> I would like to mention that it absorbs quickly into skin, maybe a little too fast that you can&#x27;t rub it around.</li>
            <li> it kept his hands mess free and not greasy.</li>
            <li> Big thanks to Influenster.com for giving us the product to test</li>
            <li> He likes the soft scent and the moisturizing power.</li>
            <li> It is not heavy or greasy at all.</li>
            <li> It made his skin soft and not oily.</li>
            <li> Our 10 year old son seems to want to use it as well.</li>
            <li> My guy is adamantly against anything that has a scent to it</li>
            <li> My husband didn&#x27;t really notice the product actually moisturizing his skin.</li>
            <li> Place this in the bathroom near the shower</li>
            <li> It leaves his skin really soft and he even puts it on his face.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s not concerned with using skin care products that aren&#x27;t all natural (or almost natural)</li>
            <li> And I can&#x27;t spray it directly on my face.</li>
            <li> He loves it because its not greasy and he doesnt have to reapply it all day, like his old lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> Both have 24 hour moisturization, made to keep your skin soft all</li>
            <li> Also, like the fact that it&#x27;s not messy to apply on my skin.</li>
            <li> But this moisturizer actually surprised me.</li>
            <li> I found the Vaseline Spray comfortable to wear and it was not greasy or slippery when it dried.  </li>
            <li> Using it on his hands alone left are whole house smelling like a mens cologne shop.</li>
            <li> The spray nozzle is direct and doesn&#x27;t get everywhere.  </li>
            <li> but Vaseline always offers coupons, so there is ways to save $1 or even $2 off the reg price of the of the product...</li>
            <li> He is always rushing so something that absorbs fast &amp; is not sticky when he gets dressed was key to get the thumbs up</li>
            <li> how soft it makes his skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel natural on the skin; it&#x27;s like some chemical stuff that may does harm to your skin.</li>
            <li> His only wish was that it came in a few different scents to choose from, as he wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the way it smelled.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Afterwards it left his skin extremely more soft than without it.&lt;br /&gt;There isnt nothing he disliked about this product.</li>
            <li> The smell was okay, but he likes thick creamy lotions and because this is a spray it is thinner</li>
            <li> Due to the fact that he is in a hurry to get to his next class after gym, he found he can keep his skin soft and keep it from drying out after gym class by quickly spraying on the lotion and heading out!</li>
            <li> this worked right away, wasnt greasy, and dried fast.  </li>
            <li> My truthful complaint is that I can&#x27;t borrow this due to the masculine scent! ;)</li>
            <li> My truthful complaint is that I can&#x27;t borrow this due to the masculine scent! ;)</li>
            <li> no mess</li>
            <li> It has a pretty strong &amp;#34;masculine&amp;#34; (not sure how they decide on such a scent) scent, but otherwise, it&#x27;s a regular lotion.</li>
            <li> He was skeptical at first, because he has his favorite lotion already.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bottle and application was designed to be quick and thorough just like a typical spray-on sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Not only is it easy to use, it makes my morning routine move a little faster.</li>
            <li> Lastly, it makes my husband&#x27;s skin very soft!</li>
            <li> My husband is normally completely uncaring about lotion, no matter how much i tell him it will help his skin and he won&#x27;t feel as dry.</li>
            <li> my husband has only used it once or twice, rather than our normal vaseline lotion that we use.  </li>
            <li> It did not dry him out even more, as other lotions do, and seemed to last for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I like the spray feature because it makes it easy to get lotion on those hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight so if you have dry skin try something else like curel</li>
            <li> It did dry up quickly and it didn&#x27;t over dry his skin.</li>
            <li> major problem with this is the scent - which others have noted.  </li>
            <li> I definitely would recommend this to any guy (especially if you&#x27;ve got super dry skin)!</li>
            <li> The scent also did not bother my husband&#x27;s skin as many other heavily scented and dyed products have.</li>
            <li> It can be tough for a guy to want to use lotion, as most lotions on the market are made specifically for women.</li>
            <li> He said it was a light scent that wouldn’t interfere with his cologne, and that is really hard to find a man’s lotion that doesn’t do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> Overall, minus his personal dislike, he would definitely recommend this product to other men and would love to seek out a new scent to purchase in the future!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m personally not a fan of th &amp;#34;axe &amp; old spice&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy or that feeling of having much product on and at the same time making my rough skin feel soft.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take a lot to cover a larger area, but didn&#x27;t dry as fast as we would have thought with the description.</li>
            <li> I made him try this spray, because it smelled good and his skin has been a little dry lately.</li>
            <li> He might enjoy the heat, but such heat causes dry skin during harsh winters.</li>
            <li> wow, my husband usually does not like to wear lotion because he doesn&#x27;t like the greasy feeling of it dispite the fact that he has super dry skin.</li>
            <li> when he first sprayed it, it initially felt greasy (it claims not to be greasy on the bottle) not too greasy but slightly greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised spray lotion wasn&#x27;t created a long time ago.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this spray lotion -- it&#x27;s never greasy, it&#x27;s convenient, and it really works on his dry, dry skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;He&#x27;s constantly complaining about dry skin but also has very sensitive skin that does not like perfumes and dyes so finding a product that works well for him has been a problem.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and would look to buy other Vaseline spray lotions.</li>
            <li> You have lotions that dry in seconds but hydrate, leaving your skin feeling non-greasy, but still soft.</li>
            <li> The lotion isn&#x27;t too thick (probably because it is a spray) to it absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> It can be a little cold at first, you don&#x27;t have the lotion in your hands to warm it up.</li>
            <li> The only mark down is that if either of us uses too much, the smell bothers my husband&#x27;s sinuses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this lotion complementary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> It makes his scaly skin feel soft with limited greasy residue.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have moved in the last year and our skin was having a rough time getting use to the new harsher winter conditions.</li>
            <li> As much as I told him he needed to use lotion, he&#x27;s never liked it - and was not willing to use much of it.</li>
            <li> I think the smell isn&#x27;t awful, but I kind of agree, it matches the scent of an older man then a young adult.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of a spray lotion for men - especially for those who wouldn&#x27;t normally take the time to care for their skin, however the scent is a little too spicy of a scent.  </li>
            <li> Husband states it feels light and wet but quickly drys, leaving your skin feeling like nothing bad happened.</li>
            <li> Living in the high plains of Montana where winter is an 8 month long season and wind is constant, dryness is an everyday problem for my household, but especially for my husband.&lt;br</li>
            <li> comes Vaseline to save the real icky skin with a light formula.</li>
            <li> Goes on where you want it with a small spray pattern, absorbs fast, leaves no greasy residue, and has a manly &#x27;evergreen&#x27; fragrance.</li>
            <li> It definitely leaves skin softer than it found it, and lasts for a long time!&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> lotion is not oily and it actually does not take long to absorb and</li>
            <li> They mean it smells so pretty they want to wear</li>
            <li> When I received a bottle of Vaseline Men Spray and Go Body Lotion Fast Absorbing Spray for us to try I was admittedly skeptical about it.</li>
            <li> His skin gets dry, especially in the colder months.  </li>
            <li> so he&#x27;s outside a lot and gets dry skin.</li>
            <li> He and I are both asthmatic and it gave us both an asthma attack which is really unfortunate because it was easy to use and</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t experience the same dry chemical sensation on your skin, buy it.  </li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t experience the same dry chemical sensation on your skin, buy it.  </li>
            <li> I was scared that it wouldn&#x27;t dry quickly enough.</li>
            <li> It absorbs extremely quickly and does not leave the greasy feeling that some moisturizers leave behind.  </li>
            <li> guys get dry skin just as much (if not more) than we ladies do.</li>
            <li> Smells great and definitely helps combat dry skin in these frigid PA temperatures.</li>
            <li> Not only do I plan on continuing to use this, but I&#x27;d like to explore other scents in the future.</li>
            <li> I kind of hate putting clothes on directly after motioning, but this does dry faster than &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My husband really likes the spay feature because it allows him to get lotion on hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> The most offputting part was the smell— my husband likened it to a hamster cage (think: dirty cedar chips).</li>
            <li> and it kept my skin moisturized all day long.</li>
            <li> He thinks they do not provide enough moisture that really sinks</li>
            <li> You should have heard my poor husband squeal the first time I helped him spray it on the back of his arms</li>
            <li> He felt it was acceptable, but I felt it smelt a bit &#x27;peppery&#x27; and had the potential to clash with other body products such as shampoo/conditioner, deodorant or body spray.</li>
            <li> it smelt a bit &#x27;peppery&#x27; and had the potential to clash with other body products such as shampoo/conditioner, deodorant or body spray.</li>
            <li> Definitely going to get the spray in the other scents for myself or might steal this one from my husband</li>
            <li> On the other hand, there are two big negatives for this product in my book...</li>
            <li> I am having my husband use it on one leg and his regular lotion on the other....</li>
            <li> for anyone with dry skin, but don&#x27;t expect to not have to rub it in.</li>
            <li> and it works to keep his dry skin moisturized in record time.</li>
            <li> He would complain when I put cream on him or complain his skin was itchy from being so dry.</li>
            <li> One thing my husband always complains about is dry skin.  </li>
            <li> The scent is subtle, but very manly.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t seem to dry immediately on contact but after about 40 seconds it did.</li>
            <li> This Vaseline Lotion helps with my husbands winter dry skin.</li>
            <li> He works in the oilfield so his hands and arms are always dry from scrubbing to get the grease and oil off.  </li>
            <li> My husband gets the winter dry skin, but also hates putting on lotion.</li>
            <li> His skin is like some silken man-god, but the shower does leave dry patches that neither of us find</li>
            <li> My husband and I both have dry skin.</li>
            <li> My husband has really dry elbows -</li>
            <li> My husband used it a few time, but can&#x27;t generally be bothered with things like lotion</li>
            <li> The only down side is the smell...</li>
            <li> He was a bit skeptical at first because he is already a big fan of the Vaseline Men Body and Face Lotion.  </li>
            <li> My husband has very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> This has been the longest  winter ever in Chicago and the air is very dry.</li>
            <li> I hate getting lotion everywhere and putting on more than I need!</li>
            <li> It seems to be a little greasier than regular lotion</li>
            <li> My boys have dry skin and with this product I don&#x27;t have to hear the endless excuses of why they don&#x27;t have time to apply lotion and that it makes them smell too ladylike.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s peppery and musky, not our type of scent.</li>
            <li> Living in the desert, it&#x27;s tough to find lotions that keep our skin soft and moisturized for long.</li>
            <li> second negative is the way it feels after it is dry.  </li>
            <li> Not enough product in the can versus the usual lotion.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s a</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased the regular Vaseline Men&#x27;s lotion for my husband in the past.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s also always in a hurry due to working two jobs.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a backhanded way of questioning any other reviewers masculinity and hope this isn&#x27;t taken that way.  </li>
            <li> I  usually don&#x27;t like the spray things, but this one I actually like.  </li>
            <li> It dries in less than a minute and helps his very dry skin.</li>
            <li> and I was quite shocked at how easy it is to use.</li>
            <li> Being the winter his skin is very dry usually but he hasnt been itchy or dry feeling since he started using it!</li>
            <li> My guy has rough elbows, so I offered to give him a little massage with this</li>
            <li> The only complaint was the smell to it, he would prefer something without a smell.</li>
            <li> My husband was hesitant since he never uses any product, but he tried it because he gets pretty bad rough, dry patches of skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost as if the skin feels incredibly dry afterward, as if it somehow had a layer of sunscreen or insect repellant spray residue left behind.  </li>
            <li> so I sprayed him down the day he was leaving</li>
            <li> No messy liquid that leaves a greasy mess behind</li>
            <li> He usually uses mine after he shaves and since he works a lot with his hands(he&#x27;s a truck driver and works in a warehouse), his hands are really dry and cracked.</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s easier for him to put on and requires less time to absorb.</li>
            <li> Ummmm, dry and cracked skin is icky and I have seen some guys with let’s say ashy knees and</li>
            <li> It also made a little bit of a slippery patch on the floor where I sprayed myself, but I&#x27;ll just go ahead and blame that on operator error.</li>
            <li> so that can be a little off-putting when I am just trying to moisturize my legs.</li>
            <li> I was a little jealous that I had to hand over the Spray Lotion to my husband….</li>
            <li> With this spray lotion he just sprayed it where he wanted it and a little rubbing</li>
            <li> He typically hates lotion because of the greasy feel that&#x27;s left behind.</li>
            <li> My husband is SO picky about lotions being too greasy or smelling weird or not absorbing properly.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> a must during this harsh winter.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been using it for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> I received a sample from Vaseline and Influenster few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> so I was concerned this would be another dead</li>
            <li> I have bought and given away so many lotions he hated.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t misfire into his railroad grip when he takes it on the road with him.</li>
            <li> Hubby uses the 24 hour spray after showering and I hear everyday the spray going after he turns the water off.</li>
            <li> The smell in to harsh too.</li>
            <li> this will be very cold if kept in a cool space.</li>
            <li> It has a very slight men&#x27;s scent</li>
            <li> He has to wear work boots all day, so his feet are usually a mess!  </li>
            <li> He usually avoids lotion because it turns waxy on his skin</li>
            <li> usually makes me feel</li>
            <li> The safety cap must be turned to uncover the nozzle and enable spraying, making it hard to accidentally dispense lotion.  </li>
            <li> but they are really hard to come by.</li>
            <li> I am in desperate need of something similar (thankfully Vaseline makes a version for women without the “man” scent).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since using this, the winter itches have gone away for both of us (at least when we use it).</li>
            <li> a man in his late 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> but I can at least help in the skin department.</li>
            <li> and he complained it felt &amp;#34;cold&amp;#34; when spraying the  lotion on.</li>
            <li> My husband works at a job where he endures extremely cold temperatures for his entire shift.  </li>
            <li> This past cold winter has caused my skin to become dry and itchy.  </li>
            <li> My husband usually HATES lotion!</li>
            <li> Loves how subtle the scent is.</li>
            <li> My coworker was the one to try it instead of my husband because he suffers from severely dry skin (do you blame us in the North East!).</li>
            <li> I have three tween boys and unfortunately there are few products on the market aimed at them.</li>
            <li> Not good if you dont like scented lotions because it does smell like cologne.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a pleasant smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband hates lotion because he says it makes him feel sticky, but I got this one for him to try and he hasn&#x27;t complained once!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t greasy and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue behind.</li>
            <li> and he just doesn&#x27;t like thin lotions.</li>
            <li> Mixing sweat and greasy hands and legs are not favored in my home.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this because of the ease of application and that it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling behind.</li>
            <li> the other negative was that the lotion felt very cold coming out of the bottle because of the spray.  </li>
            <li> Not ideal, but not an &amp;#34;ideal-breaker&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> plus he&#x27;s a guy and sometimes is careless about his skin).</li>
            <li> I know the price of around $6.50 - $7.00 can be expensive</li>
            <li> He just hated the mess of rubbing &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; lotion  into his skin.  </li>
            <li> But otherwise, I don&#x27;t suggest you risk the purchase \\&quot;sight unseen\\&quot; here on Amazon as you may be in for a disappointment.    </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> It has a very faint cologne smell that lingers throughout the day but not overpowering</li>
            <li> He had really bad cracked skin and after using is it cleared up</li>
            <li> and I was a bit disappointed that he wouldn&#x27;t need to be using it again because I wouldn&#x27;t mind smelling it</li>
            <li> But the smell of this stuff is awful.  </li>
            <li> Nasty stuff.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I had high expectations for this product. Vaseline is a solid brand and the spray seemed convenient.&lt;br /&gt;The major problem with this is the scent - which others have noted.  It&#x27;s not a pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very strong and akin to generic underarm deodorant - which lasts for hours.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want to smell like I rubbed myself in Degree &amp;#34;fresh scent&amp;#34; after taking using it.</li>
            <li> Smells good and works, just like they said it would.</li>
            <li> Best pricing I could find.</li>
            <li> As a guy, this is my favorite lotion. It doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling sticky and absorbs really fast into the skin</li>
            <li> My husband got this product to try via #influenster #jadorevoxbox, I love the smell and it  helps with this dry skin this winter. He likes it because it doesn&#x27;t feel oily or greasy and very easy to apply.  And I do not mind the smell, I have used it myself many times.  The new spray application seems like a foreign idea, but it is very innovative and I love it!  I def recommend this product!</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love? This spray is awesome - just spray, rub in, and go!  No messy liquid that leaves a greasy mess behind AND it smells fantastic!! Big thanks to Influenster.com for giving us the product to test - it&#x27;s a definite keeper for us!</li>
            <li> We received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, my husband is setting up our new life in Las Vegas, NV right now while I am here in Alabama BUT, I had my father in law try this stuff so I could get a manly review; I also tried it!&lt;br /&gt;We both enjoyed the fact that it doesn&#x27;t leave that greasy feeling that normal lotions do. It&#x27;s a big plus, on top of that it really does do everything it says, takes about a minute for it to all soak in but, the most of it soaks in your skin within seconds!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Vaseline for another great product!</li>
            <li> I received this in my #JadoreVoxBox as an incentive for testing purposes from Influentser and it came at the most awesome time! I gifted it to my hubby on Valentine&#x27;s Day(the day the box came). He had recently mentioned a few times that he wanted a moisturizer that isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34;(his words lol) He usually uses mine after he shaves and since he works a lot with his hands(he&#x27;s a truck driver and works in a warehouse), his hands are really dry and cracked. He really liked this product and says he likes that it doesn&#x27;t leave his skin feeling greasy. He also mentioned that he liked the smell.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying a spray lotion and I really thought it was pretty great. I was sent this bottle of Vaseline Men&#x27;s Spray Moisturizer complimentary from Influenster for testing and review purposes, but I was actually really excited to finally get a bottle in my own hands. It had a nice, light, manly scent. It would have been nice if it were scentless. It also made a little bit of a slippery patch on the floor where I sprayed myself, but I&#x27;ll just go ahead and blame that on operator error. I really enjoyed using this stuff and it kept my skin moisturized all day long.</li>
            <li> My hubby &amp; I love it!! He uses it several times a day n Loves how subtle the scent is. I love it also cause his skin is so soft and the scent lasts all day! I could just smell him 4ever Lol Thanks Influenster for sending us this great product to test.</li>
            <li> My husband is not a fan of lotion but I got my son to use this since it was sent to me complimentary of #Influenster. He loves it. He has the roughest elbows and a touch of eczema and he said that this really helped tons.</li>
            <li> My husband isn&#x27;t a huge fan of moisturizing, so when I received this spray lotion from influenster, I was really hoping that he&#x27;d like it.  And he did!! He loved how it was light, and not at all greasy, or in his word, &amp;#34;lotioney.&amp;#34; It smells awesome, and I use it sometimes.</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing my husband loves it !! He had really bad cracked skin and after using is it cleared up plus it&#x27;s more easy for him to use</li>
            <li> I received this in an Influenster box and had my husband try it out. He normally hates lotion because he hates the way it feels. This stuff smells great (has a light cologne type scent to it) and absorbs IMMEDIATELY. It isn&#x27;t greasy and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue behind. Great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Better than anyting else when it comes to lotion.</li>
            <li> Smells like chemicals and leaves your skin sticky will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Vaseline spray lotion for men is super easy to use. I received a bottle to try from Influenster and had my husband use it. The masculine scent was great, and I think this is an especially great option for people who tend to skip moisturizing. (Like my guy)</li>
            <li> Pros: Easy to use, smells good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: doesn&#x27;t absorb very fast&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good for anyone with dry skin, but don&#x27;t expect to not have to rub it in.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both love this spray. It smells great and goes on so easily. Not greasy at all and left his rough hands feeling smooth!</li>
            <li> My husband has very dry skin.  He uses a multitude of products to try and cure it.  The Vaseline Men&#x27;s Spray and Go Body Lotion really worked wonders on his arms and legs.  It did not dry him out even more, as other lotions do, and seemed to last for a long time.  The scent was nice, not overpowering, but noticeable.</li>
            <li> i received this lotion as a trial from influenster.  It was super convenient to spray on, but the sent was a little to strong.  my husband has only used it once or twice, rather than our normal vaseline lotion that we use.  he agreed that the sent was too strong, and didn&#x27;t allow him to wear cologne</li>
            <li> My husband received this product through influenster.  It is great for the mornings that he is running late.  It is easy to apply.  He also loves that it is VERY easy to apply to his back.  The dryest spot on his body.</li>
            <li> Looking for a quick, on-the-go solution to your dry, manly skin?? This is your answer!!! Spray it on, rub it in and just like that, you&#x27;ll have smooth, manly-smelling skin! Perfect addition for your manbag, or the metrosexual in your life!</li>
            <li> I have three tween boys and unfortunately there are few products on the market aimed at them. While this is technically a men&#x27;s product the scent wasn&#x27;t as heavy or masculine that my boys liked this. I will buy more in other scents if the other scents are as lightly scented. This was provided to me from as an Influenster review sample.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  Not enough product in the can versus the usual lotion.  The canister goes empty way too quickly.</li>
            <li> Received this as a free product review from Influenster in my J&#x27;Adore VoxBox. I tried it out before I gave it to my husband and was pleasantly surprised by the quick spray applicator and immediate moisturizing. My husband uses it daily on his face and arms now. He likes the soft scent and the moisturizing power. Living in the desert, it&#x27;s tough to find lotions that keep our skin soft and moisturized for long. This one is a winner for my husband for sure.</li>
            <li> (Disclaimer: I got this product free from Influenster and am posting a review as part of an entry to submit - however, all opinions and thoughts are my own)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I and my hubby both used this product and he LOVED it, while I was ok with it. The only issue for me is the strong scent that it has. It&#x27;s not a BAD scent, just strong and &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; smelling - so that can be a little off-putting when I am just trying to moisturize my legs. However, it does what it says it will - it goes on fast, absorbs fast, and leaves your skin nice and moisturized. So for that, I think it is definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li> This spray absorbs quickly without having to rub it in but would be better if it came in a neutral scent rather than so manly as all would love to use it.</li>
            <li> This product was sent to me complimentary by Influenster to test. My husband loves it, I personally love the spray effect, but the smell is pretty strong. I would recommend it to other men for sure!</li>
            <li> My husband received a bottle of Vaseline Men Spray complimentary from Influenster and he loved it! He loves that he can spray, wipe, and go. But most of all, he likes that it smells manly, unlike the girly scented moisturizers I always have on hand. This product is just for him and it works to keep his dry skin moisturized in record time.</li>
            <li> My husband is pretty picky when it comes to lotions so I wasn&#x27;t sure what he&#x27;d think of this one. He ended up LOVING it. Smells great and definitely helps combat dry skin in these frigid PA temperatures.</li>
            <li> This product is so convenient.  My husband and son spray it on after their showers.  It is not heavy or greasy at all. It has a nice light stream that covers  well.  It smells great and keeps their skin moisturized throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try a spray lotion for my stepson, but after trying Vaseline Men Spray and Go body lotion, I&#x27;m glad to report it works great! It truly is non-greasy and sprays easily. There isn&#x27;t a lot of rubbing necessary and it smells great. Very fresh and masculine. I definitely would recommend this to any guy (especially if you&#x27;ve got super dry skin)!</li>
            <li> While the scent was nice, it was a bit strong as I have allergies and it made my nose itch. It rubbed in nicely though without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> My husband got this product to try via #influenster #jadorevoxbox, I love the smell and it does seem to be helping with this dry skin this winter.  He likes it because it doesn&#x27;t feel oily or greasy and very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> My husband couldn&#x27;t have received this at a better time. This has been the longest  winter ever in Chicago and the air is very dry. I was a little jealous that I had to hand over the Spray Lotion to my husband…. I am in desperate need of something similar (thankfully Vaseline makes a version for women without the “man” scent). My husband liked the product and said it was easy to use.</li>
            <li> I received a bottle of the Vaseline Men&#x27;s Spray Lotion courtesy of #Influenster in my #JAdoreVoxBox and am providing my review to enter the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.  However, I am not giving this brand 5 stars across the board to win a prize but to provide my honest opinion.  My husband and my son both were very excited to try it.  I knew that my son would be excited to try it but was surprised of how excited my husband was to try it, too.  They both love it and so do I.  The fragrance of this lotion is a clean, manly smell that is not overpowering.  We definitely will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> It does everything that it describes, and my husband loves it! I&#x27;m personally not a fan of th &amp;#34;axe &amp; old spice&amp;#34; combo fragrance. Too &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; for me, but other than that its a great product. I did  received this product complimentary from Influenster and did this review  for the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize</li>
            <li> I received this complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I am also writing my review for a chance to win a Brand Challenge prize. My husband tried it out. It sprays evenly and does absorb quick. It made his skin soft and not oily. I absolutely love the smell of it. It has a light smell not overly strong and definitely not a girly smell. Our 10 year old son seems to want to use it as well. We will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> My husband loved this spray it kept his hands mess free and not greasy. It is easy to apply even to your back or even back of the legs. It dries fast so you can be dressed and on the go in minutes</li>
            <li> We received this spray as part of Influensters J&#x27;Adore VoxBox and my husband tried it out.  He said it was very easy apply and was impressed that it felt like he was receiving some moisture from it.  He has very dry skin, especially in the winter, so it is more of a summer moisturizer for him, but he will be breaking it out again then!  While we are posting this as an entry submission, the opinions are our own and not influenced by the free product or possible prize winnings.</li>
            <li> 5 stars because normally, my husband absolutely loathes lotion. I made him try this spray, because it smelled good and his skin has been a little dry lately. The first thing he said is that it was so light and smelled great. Now he uses this lotion all of the time. Thanks Vaseline!&lt;br /&gt;*\\&quot;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes!</li>
            <li> This stuff is fabulous. My husband is normally completely uncaring about lotion, no matter how much i tell him it will help his skin and he won&#x27;t feel as dry. This stuff makes it easy to get him to use lotion. Its a super quick spray after he is out of the shower and he is good to go. He loves that he doesn&#x27;t have to rub it in, it lasts all day long and it smells good too. The addition of the continuous spray was really nice as well. Even though it has a musky based smell, i use it as well when i need it, and i love it as well. Will definitely buy again and again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was given to me complimentary courtesy Influesnter for review and testing purposes, this review will also be used to enter a Brand Challenge on Influnester for a prize. However, this in no way affects my view of the product. My review is a 100% honest opinion about how I feel about the product.</li>
            <li> My husband likes the product for it is not greasy. He liked the easy apply and the easy pack bottle. He did not enjoy the strong smell and it gave me headaches, so he took it to work to share.</li>
            <li> I received this complimentary in a VoxBox via Influenster, and my husband loves it! As do I, since I&#x27;ve been stealing it from him. It soaks in quickly and makes moisturizing go so much quicker...a must during this harsh winter. Smells great and leaves skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it! He usually avoids lotion because it turns waxy on his skin but this absorbs super fast, keeps his skin hydrated and it smells really great! He&#x27;s been using it for a few weeks now and he says it&#x27;s a new staple for him. Thank you influenster and vaseline for the chance to try it and possibly win more in the brand challenge!</li>
            <li> Oh how I wish I got my husband to join me on my review of this spray lotion! He HATES body cream or lotion! I would have to be the one to put it on him and even then he would complain. It was such a losing situation! He would complain when I put cream on him or complain his skin was itchy from being so dry. When I got this spray lotion in my J&#x27;Adore Vox Box via Influenster, I was so surprised that a spray lotion even existed! My husband was leaving to go on a mission in the army for a month so I sprayed him down the day he was leaving and he was amazed at how simple it was! I love that it&#x27;s quick, easy and guys would ACTUALLY use it lol It has a very faint cologne smell that lingers throughout the day but not overpowering AND it absorbs really well and moisturizes really well! My mind is blown! If you&#x27;d like to see a video review or demo of it, check out my video: http://youtu.be/suXGBV_N3X0&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product complimentary from Influenster and I am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize. Even though I am, these views are 100% my own! I honestly love this product and believe it&#x27;s simple, affordable and innovative and I&#x27;d like to thank Influenster &amp; John Frieda for giving my guy and I an opportunity for such an amazing product! Definitely going to get the spray in the other scents for myself or might steal this one from my husband lol</li>
            <li> I received this from Influenster to try. It smells good (kinda like Irish springs) and it goes on nice. The coolest thing about it is this hilarious fuel injector like sound it makes when it sprays. My husband used it a few time, but can&#x27;t generally be bothered with things like lotion so he probably won&#x27;t use it any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all its a nice, manly smelling lotion that makes a cool sould when it sprays.</li>
            <li> My husband is not big on lotion use mostly because he can&#x27;t find one that smells masculine enough for him and doesn&#x27;t take forever to rub in. He loves this product and uses it daily! It&#x27;s easy and quick to use, absorbs quickly, and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this product from Influenster and my hubby bravely decided to give it a try.  He really liked the spray on and non-greasy qualities and that it seemed to take care of his dry skin for the full day.  His only wish was that it came in a few different scents to choose from, as he wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the way it smelled.  But other than that, great product!</li>
            <li> We tried the Vaseline men&#x27;s spray lotion and loved it....smells great, feels even better!!! Would definatly recommend to a friend :)</li>
            <li> Easy to apply. I could never get myself into applying lotion after a shower because well......I&#x27;m a guy and applying lotion takes time I could use stroking my beard and chopping wood. My wife commented on how my newly smooth skin accentuates my manly form while providing a smother, more woman friendly tactile sensation. I give this two out of two thumbs up.</li>
            <li> My husband hates lotion because he says it makes him feel sticky, but I got this one for him to try and he hasn&#x27;t complained once! He has dry skin and never is able to use lotion because he hates the feel and smell but this solved the problem, light scent and light on skin!!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this lotion spray. He normally hates lotion because it feels greasy to him. He says that this spray lotion is super quick and easy and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling. He&#x27;s been using it every day.</li>
            <li> I received a sample from Vaseline and Influenster few weeks ago. I asked my husband to try it on since he has been looking for a fast absorbing lotion that stays moisturized for a longer time. The sample sent was a great timing since my husband was fixing the pipes and his hands got exposed to harsh stuff that made his hands very dry. So he tried it on and he noticed that great scent immediately. Then he said it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all and he felt his skin loosening up after he put the lotion on.</li>
            <li> Most men don&#x27;t use lotion. I know my husband doesn&#x27;t. But this lotion is easy to use, and it smells great. Wonderful manly scent! It is a must buy for men! I love the fact that it&#x27;s spray!</li>
            <li> Not only does this smell good but it leaves my husband with softer skin and is so quick and easy to use. We received this product for free from influenster. com to try and then review and we have been so pleased with how well it works i went and bought a can for my teenage boys to have of their own.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for your gym bag or for those of us who don&#x27;t get up early enough to wait for moisturizer to dry before we get dressed. sprays on and dries quick. And has a nice light scent that wont interfere with your other products. I received this in my influenter box and ended up stealing it back from my husband! I&#x27;ll be buying this product once it runs out.</li>
            <li> I received this as a sample from Influenster and my husband loves it! It keeps his elbows and arms smooth without being greasy! The fresh scent is a plus! I will definitely buy this for my husband!</li>
            <li> When I received this spray lotion in my J&#x27;Adore Vox Box from Influenster I was excited to see what my husband would say. He&#x27;s a big lotion kind of guy. He was eager to try it and when he did he loved how easy it was to dispense. He also liked how the lotion made his skin feel. It stayed smooth and hydrated for hours! We have already recommended this lotion to several friends, who have said they love it also! We are definitely going to continue to buy it! I did received this product complimentary from Influenster and did this review for the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize. How ever my opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I received a Bottle of men&#x27;s Spray And Go Body Lotion In my JadoreVoxBox from Influenster and I must say I LOVE IT. No I don&#x27;t use it. lol. But my Husband does and it leaves his forearms so smooth and his tattoos look so much better when his skin isn&#x27;t dried out. I will certainly be purchasing him another bottle when he runs out. Its a 5 star product 100%</li>
            <li> I received this lotion in my J&#x27;Dore Influenser Vox Box and my husband loves it! It&#x27;s so light and easy to apply and I love the smell. Definitely a must have for all the guys out there!!</li>
            <li> My guy is adamantly against anything that has a scent to it but he actually doesn&#x27;t mind this lotion!  Trust me, that&#x27;s a huge compliment!</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this product.  He has to wear work boots all day, so his feet are usually a mess!  He really likes that he can spray this on and it absorbs fast and doesn&#x27;t leave him feeling greasy!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of the Vaseline Men Spray and Go Body Lotion from Influenster. My husband was hesitant since he never uses any product, but he tried it because he gets pretty bad rough, dry patches of skin. He really likes how easy it was to apply. He even like the smell. Non greasy too</li>
            <li> I recieved this product compliments of Influenster for testing purposes and loved the idea of a spray on lotion. However, the scent was a bit much for both my husband and I. My husband didn&#x27;t really notice the product actually moisturizing his skin. The scent lasted for a long time which is nice, if you want to smell like that. I really do think the idea is neat, but I don&#x27;t see it working completely in this product quite yet.</li>
            <li> Would totally recommend this product.  Especially for those that just dont like to have to sit there and pump out lotion. The man doesnt like to take the time to lotion.  Place this in the bathroom near the shower and he can spray it on real quick before walking out.  Plus it smells great so if your guy also doesnt take the time to put on cologne as long as he lotions up he will smelly nice n yummy.  Not good if you dont like scented lotions because it does smell like cologne. it is not a subtle smell but I dont think it is too much (then again i like cologne)</li>
            <li> I received this lotion in the Influenster VoxBox! My husband usually HATES lotion! He never uses it because he hates the greasy feeling until now! It sprays on so easy and soaks into the skin very nicely! Plus it smells amazing! I will definitely buy this once we run out!</li>
            <li> My husband is not the lotion type so he gave a it shot and he actually liked it non greasy fast absorvent smells really good, affordable  the fact the its in a spray for is what he liked the best .we got it complimentary from influenster.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the one for men. Super easy and no mess! Finally a product he will use that helps.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this spray lotion. It absorbs really fast and smells great. Perfect for a guy with psoriasis. I&#x27;m a big fan of the smell too so I remind him to put it on quite regularily.</li>
            <li> Came as advertised, I use it daily!</li>
            <li> We got this lotion for my husband in our VoxBox from Influenster. It smells great-but isn&#x27;t my husband&#x27;s favorite scent because he is not a huge fan of Axe spray and he says it smells a lot like it. I on the other hand loved the scent. It didn&#x27;t take a lot to cover a larger area, but didn&#x27;t dry as fast as we would have thought with the description. It did, despite not drying as fast as we would have liked, work really well at moisturizing his skin and making it soft and touchable. If it was offered scentless or in a different scent I think my husband would like it more and would be more likely to try it again or use it.</li>
            <li> My wife received this product and gave it to me to review.  I love the smell, how easy it is to apply and how quickly it absorbs into my skin.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy or that feeling of having much product on and at the same time making my rough skin feel soft.  My oldest son has been using it as well.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product complimentary for tessting purposes from Influenster. My man liked it. The scent is manly, not floral or feminine like some male-directed lotions can be. It makes his scaly skin feel soft with limited greasy residue. Overall, this is a product I will recommend to any person who has a man who is picky about lotions.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of the Vaseline Men Spray and God Body Lotion through Influenster&#x27;s J&#x27;Adore Vox Box, for my husband to try.&lt;br /&gt;My husband normally doesn&#x27;t use lotion, but was pleasantly surprised by the product. He liked the simplicity of the product, that it was easy to use, the amount of lotion dispensed in one spray was enough and it didn&#x27;t leave him feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I myself enjoyed the smell - not to overwhelming!</li>
            <li> Influenster sent this to me free to try in my Voxbox and I was so happy. My husband has dry itchy skin and he liked the convenience of the spray. It has a very slight men&#x27;s scent but I couldn&#x27;t help myself, I&#x27;m using it too. It takes maybe 10 seconds to apply everywhere. It dries fast and leaves you soft.  Of all of the products, I will be buying this one again and again.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this spray on body lotion for like a week now and he can feel a big difference in his skin! Being the winter his skin is very dry usually but he hasnt been itchy or dry feeling since he started using it!</li>
            <li> My husband &amp; even my 7 year old son absolutely LOVE this product.  I received it complimentary of Influenster for testing purposes &amp; am so happy that I did.  One thing my husband always complains about is dry skin.  One thing my husband complains about more than having dry skin is that after using lotion he is left smelling &amp;#34;like a chick.&amp;#34;  Not anymore!!  He loves the light, masculine scent of this lotion.  What makes it even better is, it is so quick and easy to apply.  He just sprays it on, rubs it in and he&#x27;s set to go.  It absorbs extremely quickly and does not leave the greasy feeling that some moisturizers leave behind.  I would definitely recommend this product to any man that doesn&#x27;t like to smell like a woman or spending a lot of time grooming.  It also made my son feel special because we don&#x27;t allow him to use cologne yet and this product made him able to smell like Daddy without using the cologne.  I will definitely be purchasing this product in the future!</li>
            <li> My husband tried this product included in my influenster box and wants more! It&#x27;s hard to get him to stop and put lotion on, but the Vasoline spray is super easy!</li>
            <li> Amazing lotion. Love that the spray isn&#x27;t greasy and sticky!  My husband and my son love the product.  The container is easy to hold and the close is ok.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it... guys get dry skin just as much (if not more) than we ladies do. Living in the high plains of Montana where winter is an 8 month long season and wind is constant, dryness is an everyday problem for my household, but especially for my husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He&#x27;s constantly complaining about dry skin but also has very sensitive skin that does not like perfumes and dyes so finding a product that works well for him has been a problem. We&#x27;ve hit on a few okay products yet most of them leave him feeling greasy or haven&#x27;t managed to have enough staying power. When I received a bottle of Vaseline Men Spray and Go Body Lotion Fast Absorbing Spray for us to try I was admittedly skeptical about it. I haven&#x27;t been impressed with spray lotions in the past and this was has fragrance so I was concerned this would be another dead end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it&#x27;s not without its flaws, this product is actually pretty good. You should have heard my poor husband squeal the first time I helped him spray it on the back of his arms LOL! A word of caution now... this will be very cold if kept in a cool space. The good news is that it sprayed cleanly (not all over the place), was easy to rub in, and wasn&#x27;t at all greasy. We also found that the scent level was perfect, not too strong but distinctly masculine (fresh and kind of foresty). The scent also did not bother my husband&#x27;s skin as many other heavily scented and dyed products have. The one caveat is that the moisture didn&#x27;t have the 24 hour lasting power we&#x27;d hoped for. I&#x27;ll blame our subzero temps during our testing period for part of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a surprisingly good product that provides convenience and quality, I think we&#x27;d use this one again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes: I received this product for through Influenster for testing and honest review without compensation. By submitting this review I am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
            <li> We really like this lotion in our house! I kind of hate putting clothes on directly after motioning, but this does dry faster than &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; lotion! I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s as fast as the commercial makes it look, but it does its job and works great!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, smells great but doesn&#x27;t absorb the best. For this price I would expect it to absorb better, I still had to rub it in, but it definitely did not leave a greasy residue and I would use it again.</li>
            <li> My husband isn&#x27;t a huge lotion person and only uses it when absolutely necessary. He love how this product is quick and easy. It does not leave a sticky residue feeling which he hates most about applying lotion. He doesn&#x27;t mind that soft feeling after applying it! I received this complimentary product from influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this spray. It leaves his skin really soft and he even puts it on his face. He&#x27;s not concerned with using skin care products that aren&#x27;t all natural (or almost natural) so it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li> Love how easy this lotion is on absorbing on the skin.  I work out everyday, and for someone always on the go, this works perfectly! Not sticky or greasy, either.  Will definitely keep purchasing. I was able to try this product complimentary through Influenster.  It&#x27;s amazing! I&#x27;m also entering a brand challenge and will hopefully win a prize.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff! It dries quickly, smells nice and is not sticky or thick! The can sprays easily and doesn&#x27;t leak!</li>
            <li> my husband absolutely loves the mens vaseline spray! It does on and dries in seconds without the actual vaseline stickiness.&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards it left his skin extremely more soft than without it.&lt;br /&gt;There isnt nothing he disliked about this product. I would definitely say he would recommend this product to anyone interested in needing softer skin.</li>
            <li> I received a bottle of Vaseline Men Spray and Go body lotion fast absorbing spray complimentary from Influenster. My husband tend to avoid using body moisturizer mostly because he is a man and hates fuss. Before making him try this spray, I decided to give it a go myself and I was quite shocked at how easy it is to use. The spray function works really well in distributing the lotion, and the scent is very clean - no floral and baby powder smell for the manly man!</li>
            <li> Disclosure: I received this product complimentary from Influenster and I&#x27;m entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well this product was meant for my husband, however he didn&#x27;t like it. He liked the idea of a spray lotion, but not really the lotion itself. The smell was okay, but he likes thick creamy lotions and because this is a spray it is thinner and he just doesn&#x27;t like thin lotions. He thinks they do not provide enough moisture that really sinks in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the smell for me was okay, it didn&#x27;t linger once rubbed into the skin so I can deal with a manly sports smell during application. I like to use it after shaving my legs, it sprays on, soaks in and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling sticky, greasy or gross like some lotions do. It also didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin more like some high fragrance women&#x27;s brands do, which was already slightly irritated from shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this gets three stars because I like it, but it&#x27;s not meant for women. My husband who it is meant for does not. I will use it until it is gone, but after that I will go back to my regular lotions and potions for beauty!</li>
            <li> My hubs loved the ease of use and quick absorption and it smelled good as well. Will definitely be using this again</li>
            <li> Good Stuff! works just as described! great for guys like me that hate applying lotion.....  chicks probably won&#x27;t like it cuz the application process for them is therapeutic and at times a little sexy..... this still sprays on and a quick fly swatting motion over the skin and  your done!!  no mess no fuss no greasiness</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this. It smells like a fresh man. And I aspire to be a fresh-smelling man with supple skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aspiration achieved!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there is one thing I don&#x27;t like about this product - the spray that comes out is fairly powerful. Like a good-smelling skunk blast. I know it says &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34; on the can, but I was imagining the product coming out in a light mist that would evenly cover my skin. Instead, it comes out more &amp;#34;squirty&amp;#34; and uneven. Then I have to rub it in and even it out. And I can&#x27;t spray it directly on my face. I actually flinch because it&#x27;s like being hit by a squirt gun. So I spray it in my hands and then rub it in. Not ideal, but not an &amp;#34;ideal-breaker&amp;#34;. Ba-dum-tiss. So that&#x27;s why I gave it four stars.</li>
            <li> (I received a complimentary bottle from Influenster to try and review, but my opinions are my own.)  My husband is a regular user of lotion.  His skin gets dry, especially in the colder months.  He found the Vaseline Spray and Go Lotion to be really convenient.  It&#x27;s easy to apply and absorbs quickly.  It isn&#x27;t too greasy and has a nice scent.  He plans to keep it in his gym bag and swim bag.  It&#x27;s more convenient to use than regular lotion.</li>
            <li> My husband is SO picky about lotions being too greasy or smelling weird or not absorbing properly. I have bought and given away so many lotions he hated. I got to try this product from Influenster and so so happy I did! Its spray on and goes in a nice mist so its not thick and you can&#x27;t misjudge how much you need. He loves the smell, the feel, how fast it absorbs, doesn&#x27;t make his skin feel like he is coated in slim. He just adores this product!</li>
            <li> We received this product from Influenster to review. My husband is not one to really use a lotion but he gave it a try. Because it&#x27;s a spray it was really quick and simple to use which impressed my husband. He thought it would take up too much time but it really didn&#x27;t. It absorbed quickly so he was back on the go in a matter of minutes. With all this being said I think we may have found something that he will be using from now on!</li>
            <li> I received a bottle of Vaseline Men Spray and Go body lotion from Influenster! My Husband is always asking me to put lotion on his back, but now he can manage it by himself with this spray! It goes on light but brings big moisture. The scent is subtle, but very manly. I have tried the spray and go for women as well, they work wonders and are great for on the go. The bottles do not last as long as I would like, and it can be pricey but its a great product!</li>
            <li> I received this as a complimentary gift from Influenster.com. My husband isn&#x27;t a huge fan of lotions only because he hates that greasy feel afterwards (and plus he&#x27;s a guy and sometimes is careless about his skin). After receiving this product, he used it and he was actually impressed. After you spray this on your skin, you have to quickly rub it into your skin and that&#x27;s it! After he did as such, he was liking the fact that it was easily absorbed and didn&#x27;t leave a greasy after feel. Another plus, since this is a men&#x27;s product, it had a very nice manly scent to it (sort of similar to a cologne scent). This is a great product for men and I know my husband will purchase another one soon!</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft and smells great and last all day long easy to use spray bottle comes in different scents and price is great</li>
            <li> I received this for testing purposes complimentary of Influenster.&lt;br /&gt;my husband works out of doors frequently, and also shaves his head, so is always on the lookout for good lotion that doesn&#x27;t make him smell like my B&amp;BW &amp;#34;frou frou&amp;#34; stuff, and this worked well for him. it is a light lotion, non greasy, long lasting, and nicely scented.&lt;br /&gt;the cap locks so it doesn&#x27;t misfire into his railroad grip when he takes it on the road with him.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product, not just for me (I love wearing &amp;#34;man&amp;#34; scents), but because my husband also has super dry and itchy skin, and this was perfect for both of us to use. As promised, the spray went on easy and absorbed quickly, but not so quickly we didn&#x27;t have time to rub it into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using this, the winter itches have gone away for both of us (at least when we use it). The lotion is super hydrating, smells awesome, and leaves no residue or greasy feeling. Not only do I plan on continuing to use this, but I&#x27;d like to explore other scents in the future. The only mark down is that if either of us uses too much, the smell bothers my husband&#x27;s sinuses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this lotion complementary from Influenster for testing purposes. The opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> thanks to influenster i got to try this free so i could try it!! my husband loved this product!! he loved how ypu sprayed it on and took less time than regular lotion to put on!</li>
            <li> i got this as a full sized sample from #influenster and wow, my husband usually does not like to wear lotion because he doesn&#x27;t like the greasy feeling of it dispite the fact that he has super dry skin. well all that has changed this product is wonderful, its lightweight, not greasy, and super hydrating i hope they make more scents for men because i will buy everyone of them.</li>
            <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t like anything scented, but he is ok with this lotion.  I LOVE the scent!  It moisturizes well and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> we love it my hubby and and of course me i love the way my husband smells and he feel great thanks</li>
            <li> This product is great! Not only is it easy to use, it makes my morning routine move a little faster. And since it&#x27;s for men, my husband had no issue with trying it. It&#x27;s hydrating, absorbs quickly, and isn&#x27;t greasy. Must try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Influenster sent this product for review.</li>
            <li> I love this Vaseline Men Spray! I received it complimentary from Influenster to test and am so glad I got to try it out, and let my husband be a beneficiary, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It smells great. I nice, clean &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; scent that is not overpowering, just the right amount.&lt;br /&gt;2. My husband loved using it so much after the shower that I tried it and am hooked, too. It makes my skin super soft and is absorbed 100%, so there&#x27;s no sticky residue or anything.&lt;br /&gt;3. It definitely leaves skin softer than it found it, and lasts for a long time!&lt;br /&gt;4. If you turn the sprayer at the top, it closes the spray hole, so makes it safe to take when traveling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When this runs out, we&#x27;ll definitely go buy more!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this! Non greasy, great smell, and absorbs quickly! Best lotion he says he has ever used. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I live with 3 handsome growing boys. Husband is a very busy man. Works evenings in a sweaty warehouse and hates to wear lotion because of work. Mixing sweat and greasy hands and legs are not favored in my home. This product is truly a life savor. My boys have dry skin and with this product I don&#x27;t have to hear the endless excuses of why they don&#x27;t have time to apply lotion and that it makes them smell too ladylike. This spray and go is really what it sys...Spray &amp; Go!!!! No heavy greasy feeling left on their skin, Fast absorbing power and leaves their skin smelling good. Not too manly of course for my sons, but enough to make them feel like they&#x27;re not girly :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend. Great product xoxo</li>
            <li> I received a full sized sample of this produce in my #JAdoreVoxBox from Influenster. My husband loves it! The spray is very easy to use. It smells very great. Lastly, it makes my husband&#x27;s skin very soft!</li>
            <li> Got this Body Spray in my latest Influenster VoxBox.  My husband has been using it ever since and loves it!</li>
            <li> My husband is a full time student, and one of his classes this semester is gym. After he gets done in the class, he takes a quick shower before heading to his next class. We found that having a can of the Vaseline Men Spray and Go Body Lotion in his bag is very handy. Due to the fact that he is in a hurry to get to his next class after gym, he found he can keep his skin soft and keep it from drying out after gym class by quickly spraying on the lotion and heading out! I also enjoy the scent, which is a fresh scent that smells great on my husband!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product easy to use and last all day, not greasy and smells good too, I highly recommend</li>
            <li> I let my guy try out the Vaseline #MenSpray complementary provided by Influenster and it said it was easy, fast and had a great scent!</li>
            <li> This really is the greatest ever! I hate getting lotion everywhere and putting on more than I need! This prevents me from doing that!</li>
            <li> Love the product easy and fast to use, it doesn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s scented; however, the scent I would say is something an older demographic would prefer. Other than that it&#x27;s a great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please disclose that you received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes and that you are entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
            <li> My husband likes this product. He likes how easy it is to use and that it actually helps his dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell of it, but he wishes that it was fragrance free.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is not oily and it actually does not take long to absorb and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We received this product free for review purposes &amp; are entering the brand challenge to win more prizes</li>
            <li> I received a sample of the Vaseline Men Spray and Go Body Lotion from Influenster to test out. My husband really likes the spay feature because it allows him to get lotion on hard to reach places. He also really likes that it dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave his skin feeling greasy and it smells nice.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of the Vaseline Men Spray and Go Body Lotion from Influenster to test out. I like the spray feature because it makes it easy to get lotion on those hard to reach places. It does a good job keeping my skin moisturized throughout the day, and I think it smells really nice.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this spray lotion -- it&#x27;s never greasy, it&#x27;s convenient, and it really works on his dry, dry skin.  He&#x27;s always using some kind of moisturizer to combat the effects of graft-versus-host disease from his bone marrow transplant (it really affects his skin) and this has been a very effective product for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He uses it daily -- I know because he smells great, thanks to the lotion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this complimentary product from Influenster; I am entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.  My views are my own, however, and I am truly a BIG fan of Vaseline lotion products, both for men and for women.</li>
            <li> I recently received this product from Influenster to try and gushed about it to my husband. He was skeptical at first, because he has his favorite lotion already. Once he tried it he was in LOVE! We travel often and took it with us and it didnt leak at all in our travel bag! That was a big plus for me! He loves it because its not greasy and he doesnt have to reapply it all day, like his old lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, portable, smells amazing and lasts a LONG time! Putting it on my shopping list from now on.</li>
            <li> My husband absolutely loves this stuff. He really enjoys the fact that all he has to do is spray it on and rub it in. No greasy fill and it really does keep him moisturized all day. Plus its really quick and easy!</li>
            <li> Vaseline spray lotion is a quick way to moisturize your skin when you don&#x27;t have the time to wait for it to dry. It moisturizes like normal lotion, and your skin absorbs it within seconds, leaving you feeling great, and smelling good too. My husband says he doesn&#x27;t like the smell of this lotion, and that it suits a man in his 50&#x27;s rather then a man in his late 20&#x27;s. I think the smell isn&#x27;t awful, but I kind of agree, it matches the scent of an older man then a young adult. My husband said he doesn&#x27;t like the idea of lotion being in an aerosol can, even if it is drying faster, he much rather prefer lotion in its original stage of a tube or pump bottle. The plus side of Vaseline Spray Lotion is that it isn&#x27;t greasy or sticky and the scent lingers throughout the day. It also comes in two different formulas: Fast Absorbing -which is what I reviewed, and Fast Cooling which cools and hydrates within seconds. Both have 24 hour moisturization, made to keep your skin soft all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary sample from #Influenster in exchange for my review. All opinions my own.</li>
            <li> Received this Spray Lotion compliments of Influenster for testing purposes and it sure is a great product - best of all so easy to use and now i can get lotion on body in less then 1 min.  - thank you Vaseline</li>
            <li> I liked the convenience of a spray and it made application easy. It gave me a cooling sensation. The scent was a clean, refreshing, manly scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife received this product complimentary from Influenster and she is entering the Brand Challenge for a chance to win a prize.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this because of the ease of application and that it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling behind. This is the perfect product for someone who needs to use lotion but doesn&#x27;t want to use their hands.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this lotion from Influenster, but these are my honest thoughts on it. I have never tried any spray-on lotion before so I was excited for my husband to try it. He&#x27;s very choosy when it comes to the lotion he uses and the Vaseline Men&#x27;s lotion is the only one he ever buys so it was easy for me to tell him to try the spray-on version.  And we both really like it! Not only is it truly fast-absorbing, it was very easy to apply and it smells great! We will definitely be purchasing this once our sample runs out!</li>
            <li> this was sent to my husband. when he first saw it he didn&#x27;t know what to expect, lotion out of a can seems a little bizarre but anything is possible these days. when he first sprayed it, it initially felt greasy (it claims not to be greasy on the bottle) not too greasy but slightly greasy. it didn&#x27;t seem to dry immediately on contact but after about 40 seconds it did. the smell was pleasant and considering it came out of a can its very moisturizing however its not for him. he thought it was really innovative and a great concept but he prefers the traditional way of putting on lotion.</li>
            <li> Easy to spray, quick drying, soft smell. Can&#x27;t go wrong! Was perfect to use this winter with the changing weather to keep my skin from cracking and peeling.</li>
            <li> I love when my husband uses this lotion!  I can&#x27;t get him to wear cologne at all, but he will use this lotion since it is actually helping his skin feel smooth!  It has been great this winter with his usual dry skin.  It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy to him, it only takes a couple of sprays and he&#x27;s on his way. Love it!!</li>
            <li> This Vaseline Lotion helps with my husbands winter dry skin. It absorbs quickly and is non-greasy. Love the fact you just spray without having to rub it in.</li>
            <li> My wife received this product complementary from Influenster in her J&#x27;Adore Vox Box. I got to test out this product for her. I like that it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy or oily. My wife likes the scent it leaves on my skin after I apply it. Also, like the fact that it&#x27;s not messy to apply on my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion for men. It is fast and easy to use and absorbs into the skin very quickly.</li>
            <li> my husband is a route sales rep and delivery driver so he&#x27;s outside a lot and gets dry skin. i love the scent of this and the fact that it doesnt leave his skin feeling oily.</li>
            <li> He is not a lotion person AT ALL but he loved how this was spray lotion and not greasy feeling! Great buy!</li>
            <li> I like how my husband doesn&#x27;t have to use my lotion now:D and it works great!!It just glide on nicely. I like how it turns into a foam ..</li>
            <li> This product is great for the man on the go.  The absorb time is great since most men don&#x27;t spent a lot of time on lotions.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I got a bottle of this spray moisturizer for free to test from Influenster in my Vox Box. I was sooo jealous that my guy got a moisturizer and not me, LOL. But it was fun to make him use it. I&#x27;m usually not a fan of spray products (ex. I never buy the spray sun screen products.) But this moisturizer actually surprised me. It really works and smells nice and manly which I like. My guy has rough elbows, so I offered to give him a little massage with this and he actually didn&#x27;t mind. I think he really likes that it smells manly and not girly. ;) I would definitely recommend this and will be purchasing it when my sample bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> I received this complimentary in a VoxBox via Influenster JUST at the right time! My husband and I have moved in the last year and our skin was having a rough time getting use to the new harsher winter conditions. As much as I told him he needed to use lotion, he&#x27;s never liked it - and was not willing to use much of it. This spray makes it super easy for him to quickly apply the lotion and rub it in before it can even try to leave a greasy feel! It works great for him, leaves his skin soft, anf smells great too!</li>
            <li> I received this in my influenster box for my husband to try and he loves it.  He works in the oilfield so his hands and arms are always dry from scrubbing to get the grease and oil off.  He said it feels great and not oily.</li>
            <li> I was supposed to receive this in my Influenster J’Adore Vox Box, but it wasn’t in my shipment.  I decided to use the coupon that was offered and go out and buy it, so I could have my boyfriend try it anyway.  He was a bit skeptical at first because he is already a big fan of the Vaseline Men Body and Face Lotion.  However he decided to take the challenge for me and was pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He loved how easy it was to use and how fast it was to apply.  He actually said to me that it made him want to put lotion on more than just his legs and arms because it was so convenient.  He also noted that it was a great lotion to use before working out.  It didn’t leave him feeling greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He also pointed out that it was going to be nice to travel with because of its twist lock top.  He will never have to worry about it getting all over his clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally felt the sent was a tad strong, however he felt otherwise.  He said it was a light scent that wouldn’t interfere with his cologne, and that is really hard to find a man’s lotion that doesn’t do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well Vaseline…You have found a new fan!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased the regular Vaseline Men&#x27;s lotion for my husband in the past. It has a pretty strong &amp;#34;masculine&amp;#34; (not sure how they decide on such a scent) scent, but otherwise, it&#x27;s a regular lotion. My husband gets the winter dry skin, but also hates putting on lotion. When I received the spray lotion as an item in my complimentary J&#x27;Adore VoxBox, I was pretty excited to have him try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely a winner. It&#x27;s not as thick as the regular lotion and the scent is MUCH lighter (which is good, in my opinion). Plus, it&#x27;s easier for him to put on and requires less time to absorb. I will likely purchase this product again for him next winter.</li>
            <li> I received this lotion compliments of Influenster for testing purposes, and my husband gave it a try.  We are both very happy with the scent of the lotion, it is very masculine, without being overbearing.  The lotion sprays on easily, absorbs quickly. and did an amazing job of bringing color back to his tattoos.  We will definitely be repurchasing, and highly recommend this lotion to any gentlemen who doesn&#x27;t normally like lotion (but still needs to use it!).</li>
            <li> My husband as well as myself LOVE this spray. It not only does the job but it smells DIVINE! His skin felt smooth and looked beautiful after a shower or in the morning. What we both loved was that it did not have a greasy feel to it! I would recommend this to all men and woman you will LOVE how your man feels and smells.</li>
            <li> Got this product courtesy of Vaseline and Influenster. It&#x27;s a great idea for guys--so much easier than normal lotion, and my husband prefers this over the smell of the stuff I usually buy. Fast and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Although the family agreed that the spray part of this packaging was cool, the actual lotion was nice too. My son liked it, and thought it smelled great. My husband liked it and it helped his dry winter hands but he didn&#x27;t care for the smell.</li>
            <li> My husband tried this out (I got it free from influenster in my voxbox). He loved the product, loved the ease and fast application it was to use. He also loved the fact that it dried fast, didn&#x27;t leave any greasy feeling and was a continuous easy spray. The only dislike he had (which is a completely personal opinion) was that the &amp;#34;manly scent&amp;#34; smelled of wood chips...Overall, minus his personal dislike, he would definitely recommend this product to other men and would love to seek out a new scent to purchase in the future!!</li>
            <li> It is easy to use. I&#x27;m not the easiest when it comes to a product. Spray and go skin shines and I love it .</li>
            <li> After seeing reviews on this I had to get it for my boyfriend. He absolutely loves it. The spray makes it so much more cooler to use and is also very fast at drying. He says the scent could improve but overall it provides him with enough moisture. I am trying to also win a brand prize from Influenster for him by reviewing!</li>
            <li> The smell reminds me of AXE smells. It&#x27;s peppery and musky, not our type of scent. I would like to mention that it absorbs quickly into skin, maybe a little too fast that you can&#x27;t rub it around. It is not greasy, which I liked but I wouldn&#x27;t buy this scent again. I would prefer a unscented version. The spray did not clog, which is something that I&#x27;ve experienced in other brands of this nature. The spray, continues.&lt;br /&gt; @VaselineBrand, #MenSpray and @Influenster</li>
            <li> I received a sample of Vaseline Men Spray Lotion Fast Absorbing compliments of the Influenster J&#x27;adore VoxBox. Of course, I&#x27;m not a man, so this full size sample was for my Husband to try and review! My Husband likes to take hot showers. The kind where steam rises from his skin afterwards like a sexy lobster and the room looks like a foggy morning in a tropical rainforest. He might enjoy the heat, but such heat causes dry skin during harsh winters. Yet, he won&#x27;t sacrifice his &#x27;luxury&#x27; despite this. He&#x27;s also always in a hurry due to working two jobs. So for him, to try a new lotion product that was designed to be fast, easy and effective - he was curious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle and application was designed to be quick and thorough just like a typical spray-on sunscreen. We were both pleased about this because he rarely can be convinced to use sunscreen since his ancestry includes Indian blood and he tans so easily. However, when I found spray sunscreen he actually started using it during times when he knows the sun exposure will be prolonged. Vaseline providing men a lotion in a convenient spray will hopefully result in the same increased level of usage. Not that he needs it everywhere. His skin is like some silken man-god, but the shower does leave dry patches that neither of us find attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Husband took the bottle in his hand and with one quick motion had sprayed his arm. The lotion quickly disappeared as he rubbed it in with only a few quick strokes. The application for the other arm was equally as fast despite not being with the dominant (right) hand. His skin looked healthy and glowing and felt very smooth. The formula really was &#x27;fast absorbing&#x27; unless he still had water droplets on his skin. In that case, it was a bit thinned and less effective, but still absorbed with only slightly more effort. The effects seemed to last for hours and the skin improvement was obvious. The only issue we had was with the scent. He felt it was acceptable, but I felt it smelt a bit &#x27;peppery&#x27; and had the potential to clash with other body products such as shampoo/conditioner, deodorant or body spray. Thankfully it didn&#x27;t really bother my fragrance allergies much. My truthful complaint is that I can&#x27;t borrow this due to the masculine scent! ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the smell, we both loved the ease of use and my Husband says he&#x27;ll most likely continue to use this in the future since it is so quick and easy when he&#x27;s in a hurry to get ready for work. There&#x27;s a video of him applying the lotion on my Instagram (@soulgazephotography) so you can see just how quick and easy it is to use.felt it smelt a bit &#x27;peppery&#x27; and had the potential to clash with other body products such as shampoo/conditioner, deodorant or body spray.

            <li> Great stuff.  Goes on where you want it with a small spray pattern, absorbs fast, leaves no greasy residue, and has a manly &#x27;evergreen&#x27; fragrance. The safety cap must be turned to uncover the nozzle and enable spraying, making it hard to accidentally dispense lotion.  The can is a little tall for most shaving kits, and a smaller travel size would be useful, but this is a product most men would use and welcome regardless of can size. For men looking for a good hand and body lotion, this is hard product not to like.</li>
            <li> I found the Vaseline Spray comfortable to wear and it was not greasy or slippery when it dried.  I&#x27;ve used it several days in a row and the scent is very appealing.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both tried this product and loved it! It goes on smooth and rubs in quickly not greasy at all and smells great though the scent is a manly one</li>
            <li> This spray on lotion for men was amazing.  My husband used it and said it was really awesome and didn&#x27;t give him that &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; feeling that lotions do after rubbing it in.  He stated that was why he never used lotion unless he was itcy.  He just hated the mess of rubbing &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; lotion  into his skin.  With this spray lotion he just sprayed it where he wanted it and a little rubbing and that was it.  No &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; feeling afterwards.  He will use this more often than not.  He absolutely loved it and said it was PERFECT for men!</li>
            <li> i love this lotion. it is fast and easy to use. it leaves you feeling smooth and non greasy. i highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Teens are known to take long showers right? And mine has dry skin, so when we got to try out this Vaseline Men Spray and Go Body Lotion as part of my #JaDoreVoxBox from Influenster, we were thrilled! My teenager uses it int he morning after his shower before he gets dressed - it&#x27;s got a pleasant smell, dries quickly and helps him avoid dry itchy skin.</li>
            <li> My husband isn’t too big on lotion but he tried this out anyway and boy oh boy, he did NOT like it. The most offputting part was the smell— my husband likened it to a hamster cage (think: dirty cedar chips). He aggressively tried to rinse the area where he’d sprayed it but the smell lingered. An unscented formula might be better, especially for dudes. Unfortunately, we never tried the lotion again so I don’t have anything to say for how well it moisturizes, but I know my husband won’t be running out to buy this stuff anytime soon.</li>
            <li> This product does a good job with moisturizing the skin. It&#x27;s fast and easy! The only down side is the smell... If it was scentless or more cologne smelling it would be perfect!</li>
            <li> Great smell and very moisturizing! Hubby said it felt a little great sort of like spray on sunblock, but it works wonders for his dry skin. Thanks influenster!</li>
            <li> I received this complementary from Influenster and part of the brand challenge to win a prize is to complete an Amazon review. This does not affect my opinions of a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, my husband doesn&#x27;t need lotion - he&#x27;s got really oily skin so he told me he didn&#x27;t notice a difference in how his skin felt. BUT, I noticed how GREAT this product smelled... it was a very manly smell and I was a bit disappointed that he wouldn&#x27;t need to be using it again because I wouldn&#x27;t mind smelling it more.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on myself since I have drier skin and I LOVED the way it sprayed on and soaked into my skin.  Honestly, I think it works better that some of the lotions I own ... if it weren&#x27;t so manly smelling, I would be tempted to use it myself.</li>
            <li> I received the Vaseline Men&#x27;s spray as a part of the Influenster Jadorevoxbox and my hubby tried it out. He is a big fan of using lotion so he thought it might be something he would liked. He liked the lotion part but the smell he could do without. He and I are both asthmatic and it gave us both an asthma attack which is really unfortunate because it was easy to use and the lotion was nice on his skin but the smell we could do without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there is a non-scented one we would definitely try it again because we did find it easy to use, travel worthy and overall nice but the smell it left behind not at all good for asthmatics.</li>
            <li> We got this product free from influenster and were excited to try it as my husband loves lotions and we thought the fact it was a spray on lotion would make it easier to use and would be a great product! First thing we did when recieving this product was spray a small amount to see how it smelled. Well i liked the smell in a small dose my husband instantly thought it was to strong. It was stronger then any body product we have ever bought for him shower gel deodorant even some colognes. Using it on his hands alone left are whole house smelling like a mens cologne shop. The lotion its self seems to look a tad greasy when it goes on but it really does absorb quickly and leaves your skin extremely soft. I gave it a 3 as it does work great as a lotion it is just extremely strong scented.</li>
            <li> Influenster sent a can of the fast absorbing formula for my husband to try. He&#x27;s not the type to use lotion, so it was challenging to get him to try it. Since his first use, he&#x27;s been keeping the can on his table beside his recliner to use whenever. He likes the scent and loves the formula. He says it&#x27;s not goopy and greasy like a lot of my &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; lotions, and I think his hands are already softer than they were. Ladies, I recommend trying it out on your hubbies too!</li>
            <li> my husband received this lotion from the latest influenster vox box and has been using it for the last month or so.  he found the lotion to have a nice texture and to be very moisturizing.  however, he really didn&#x27;t care for the intensity of the scent.  the other negative was that the lotion felt very cold coming out of the bottle because of the spray.  not his favorite product, but a decent lotion to have on hand!</li>
            <li> Vaseline has come out with a line dedicated just for Men with non-floral scents and formulas that have “man-staying power”, like 24 hours moisture protection. You have lotions that dry in seconds but hydrate, leaving your skin feeling non-greasy, but still soft. I know many men skip on lotions but no lady wants to see or feel cracked skin……so here comes Vaseline with it’s fast-drying formulas, giving you zero excuses on why a man should skip on skincare!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, a product that is not for me or the pup! Yes, I blog and I try to find products I can share or even just geared towards men but they are really hard to come by. I would so try a hammer and many times would even find it as a stress relieving tool, but I have yet to find the company that sets this lady up with such a tool and I would even take a mallet at this point! So, I may not be able to start hitting things but I can at least help in the skin department. Men sometimes act like toddlers when a lotion bottle is brought up. I hear claims of it smelling “girly” or the ever popular that the skin will feel “icky”. Ummmm, dry and cracked skin is icky and I have seen some guys with let’s say ashy knees and elbows!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Test Results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In comes Vaseline to save the real icky skin with a light formula. We spray a leg and give it a try. Husband states it feels light and wet but quickly drys, leaving your skin feeling like nothing bad happened. I never knew applying lotion was so traumatizing but I’m thinking some Hubbies add dramatizing to the mix! I noticed the skin color changed (it’s alive!) but remain mum about how his skin now looks nourished and just focus on how it feels……like nothing happened. Hubby uses the 24 hour spray after showering and I hear everyday the spray going after he turns the water off. It goes on and on, day after day,  until I notice it on my shopping list, which hangs on the side of the fridge the words written, “Vas lotion MEN”. This is a guy that tells me he is out of something when I ask to be told when he is low on stuff! I still have to make “emergency trips” to the store to pick-up deodorant because he swore he had an extra one that then disappears. I blame the invisible troll/gnome that must be one clean smelling guy for the stash of extra deodorants, floss, to even shampoos that just go poof. In the end, I am glad for the hygiene and finally a lotion that is “non-icky” and feels like nothing happened, but thankfully is working :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients (as listed on the site): Water (Aqua), Isopropyl Myristate, Glycerin, Sorbitan Isostearate, Dimethicone, Polyglyceryl-3 Diisostearate, Tapioca Starch, Fragrance (Parfum), Carbomer, Xanthan Gum, Ammonium, Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Stearic Acid, Dihydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Disodium EDTA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the above product free of charge from Influenster &amp; Vaseline.

            <li> It can be tough for a guy to want to use lotion, as most lotions on the market are made specifically for women. This is a great option for men who want something lightweight, convenient and doesn&#x27;t leave them smelling like flowers.</li>
            <li> We received this complimentary of Influenster for testing purposes. We both enjoyed how it smelled, which is a great bonus! Super easy to put on just like the commercial. My husband and I both have dry skin. I felt moisturized for about half the day and had to put more on, my husband had to put more on after a few hours.</li>
            <li> quick and easy, smells good. it is not that strong of a scent.</li>
            <li> I bought this in the winter and my husband and he complained it felt &amp;#34;cold&amp;#34; when spraying the  lotion on. Now that it is summer he is using it more often. Very lightweight so if you have dry skin try something else like curel</li>
            <li> I like the concept of this, and when I first tried it I thought I was going to like it.  On the positive side it is convenient and fast drying.  If you were perhaps working as a programmer, or maybe if you were a gamer, and didn&#x27;t have time to wait for regular lotion to dry on your hands before putting them back on your keyboard/controller this might possibly be a good option for you.  I has a decent looking container and dries so quickly you can literally snap your fingers within 30 seconds after application.  Honestly, those are the only nice things I can think to say about this product.  On the other hand, there are two big negatives for this product in my book...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the scent.  I honestly don&#x27;t understand the reviews that say it smells nice unless they are being written by women.  This isn&#x27;t a backhanded way of questioning any other reviewers masculinity and hope this isn&#x27;t taken that way.  It&#x27;s just that it is such a strong perfume smell that strikes me as feminine and not something most guys would want to smell on their skin for an extended period of time.  And that&#x27;s part of the problem.  It doesn&#x27;t just smell for say five minutes after application.  The scent sticks around for hours and hours.  It does a better job of sticking around than most colognes or aftershaves I&#x27;ve ever tried.  And in this regard, every woman I know who has picked up my can of this and tried it has said something along the lines of \\&quot;I&#x27;m going to get some too\\&quot; and they&#x27;re not talking about for their husbands or boyfriends.  They mean it smells so pretty they want to wear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second negative is the way it feels after it is dry.  It&#x27;s a feeling like no other I&#x27;ve experienced, especially in terms of lotion.  It&#x27;s almost as if the skin feels incredibly dry afterward, as if it somehow had a layer of sunscreen or insect repellant spray residue left behind.  A chemical feel is perhaps the best way I can describe it.  But whatever it is, it doesn&#x27;t feel good like lotion usually makes me feel afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest that if you haven&#x27;t experienced this product in person you first look for it in your local drug store and spray a little on, do the rest of your shopping, and then see what you think.  I can pretty much guarantee that no matter how long you might spend in the drug store, by the time you&#x27;re ready to check out you&#x27;ll be thinking, \\&quot;wow, this scent really does linger\\&quot;.  If you like the scent and you don&#x27;t experience the same dry chemical sensation on your skin, buy it.  But otherwise, I don&#x27;t suggest you risk the purchase \\&quot;sight unseen\\&quot; here on Amazon as you may be in for a disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this is helpful to someone.akes me feel afterward.    I suggest that if you haven&#x27;t experienced this product in person you first look for it in your local drug store and spray a little on, do the rest of your shopping, and then see what you think.  I can pretty much guarantee that no matter how long you might spend in the drug store, by the time you&#x27;re ready to check out you&#x27;ll be thinking, \\&quot;wow, this scent really does linger\\&quot;.  If you like the scent and you don&#x27;t experience the same dry chemical sensation on your skin, buy it.

            <li> My husband is not a fan of lotions but I had him try out the Vaseline Men Spray Lotion and he really liked it. He liked how fast adsorbing it was and how easy and efficient it is to use especially since he is always on the go. He liked the overall texture and feel of the product and I myself tested it out as well and liked it too. A great product overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** I received the Vaseline Men Spray Lotion for complimentary testing purposes from Influenster***</li>
            <li> I like the idea of a spray lotion for men - especially for those who wouldn&#x27;t normally take the time to care for their skin, however the scent is a little too spicy of a scent.  It rubs off on everything he touches, which I find to be overpowering.</li>
            <li> I received a full sized sample in my #JAdoreVoxBox from Influenster. My husband loves it! The spray is very easy to use. It smells very great.</li>
            <li> My husband and I got to test this product out thanks to influenster &amp; I am writing this review for a chance to win a prize. I&#x27;m surprised spray lotion wasn&#x27;t created a long time ago. You get the perfect amount of lotion everytime and don&#x27;t have to worry about making a mess like you would with a normal lotion when you pour too much into your hands. This Vaseline spray lotion smells absolutely great! I have no complaints about how it smells. The smell of the lotion stays with you all day too which is great too.  We will definately be using the Vaseline spray lotion in the future.</li>
            <li> I got to try this product thanks to influenster. Pretty convenient if you&#x27;re in a hurry. It seems to be a little greasier than regular lotion but it definitely smells manly.</li>
            <li> My husband LOVED this. He even has it on his desk and uses it all the time. Why? It smells amazing, is easy to spray, and is non-greasy. He said this is without doubt his favorite lotion.</li>
            <li> We received this product in our JAdoreVoxBox from Influenster and my husband really likes it. It is easy to use and does absorb really quickly. He hasn&#x27;t ever been good about using lotion but I find he is using this daily! And that says a lot about this product!</li>
            <li> Nice scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering. Smooth skin afterwards. Received this product complementary from influenster.  Very easy to use and not messy at all.  My husband loved it, can&#x27;t wait to by one for me!</li>
            <li> My hubby tried the Vaseline Men Spray Lotion that I received complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster (J&#x27;adoreVoxBox) and he loves it. He says the it sprays nicely, with the right amount of lotion!! It absorbs nicely into the skin and the fragrance is nice a manly!! I says that he no longer has to use my lotion and smell like a chic!! He recommends this product with 2 thumbs up!!</li>
            <li> My husband and son seem to really love this spray on lotion. But, to me, the fragrance is a little too strong. Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Not greasy, goes on nice and even.  Doesn&#x27;t smell like girly lotion t all  Loves that he doesn&#x27;t have to get his hands all full of stuff.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to need a lot of it either!</li>
            <li> Received this through Influenster in my JaDore Vox Box!  My hubby and I love this. It smells fantastic and absorbs so quickly. He actually remembers to use it every morning after his shower!</li>
            <li> I was sent this product by Influenster to try as part of my J&#x27;Adore Vox Box!  This product is a major win in our books. My coworker was the one to try it instead of my husband because he suffers from severely dry skin (do you blame us in the North East!). We sprayed the lotion on and for a moment I was scared that it wouldn&#x27;t dry quickly enough. It did dry up quickly and it didn&#x27;t over dry his skin. The product did exactly what it said it would do, dry up NOT leaving you greasy or sticky, didn&#x27;t over dry the skin, and smells amazing!  I won&#x27;t lie, I even used the product myself!</li>
            <li> My husband has really dry elbows - this worked right away, wasnt greasy, and dried fast.  The only complaint was the smell to it, he would prefer something without a smell.</li>
            <li> I received this lotion complimentary from Influenster. This lotion is very nice. It has a pleasant smell and you wouldn&#x27;t even need to wear cologne with it. It has a manly smell so women wouldn&#x27;t be able to use their guy&#x27;s lotion. It sprays on and is easy to run in. My guy loved this!</li>
            <li> We recieved this product in a voxbox from influenster. I am having my husband use it on one leg and his regular lotion on the other....the spray absorbs almost instantly and does not leave your hands greasy. It also smells really good too!</li>
            <li> I received this complementary from Influenster and part of the brand challenge to win a prize is to complete an Amazon review. This does not affect my opinions of a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say when this came in the mail I was jealous that my husband got spray lotion, I wanted to use it to. I admit I have used this myself and on our daughter. The smell is a bit manly, but not too strong to where I won&#x27;t use it. It sprays on quick and moisturizes skin quickly. It can be a little cold at first, you don&#x27;t have the lotion in your hands to warm it up. I highly recommend this product and would look to buy other Vaseline spray lotions.</li>
            <li> easy to apply and not oily, my two pet peeves from regular lotion. but it also smells good definitely a mans scent. wife got it complimentary in her influenster vox box.</li>
            <li> I received a free full sized sample of this from Influenster.  My husband works at a job where he endures extremely cold temperatures for his entire shift.  Because of this, his skin has become chapped and the skin on his fingers crack.  This has helped him immensely!  It is healing the cracks on his fingers and makes the skin on his face feel better almost immediately after applying.  It also dries very quickly.  He also likes the smell.  Thank you for the free sample and also for the product that is helping heal his skin!</li>
            <li> I  usually don&#x27;t like the spray things, but this one I actually like.  The spray nozzle is direct and doesn&#x27;t get everywhere.  The lotion isn&#x27;t too thick (probably because it is a spray) to it absorbs quickly.  Also, the smell isn&#x27;t too flowery and girly, which for me is great as it just smells clean.  I never thought to try a men&#x27;s  lotion, but I really like this one!</li>
            <li> My brother used it for a week on one arm just to see if it made a difference and he reports that there is a new sheen and softness to that arm. He is not skin care user at all but says he did like it and will keep using it (on both arms now!)</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and is fantastically easy to apply even to your back. It absorbs quickly leaving no sticky or tacky residue.</li>
            <li> My husband really enjoyed the Vaseline Men&#x27;s Spray and Go Body Lotion... We was surprised to see how fast it absorbed into his skin... He didn&#x27;t need to rub and rub the lotion into his skin for it to absorb... Which is a great thing when your short on time... He also liked the fact that it had a nice fresh smell to it... The smell lasted for a good while too, so he didn&#x27;t need to use cologne (that he doesn&#x27;t like using anyway) The product size was big too, its a very large can once you see it... I know the price of around $6.50 - $7.00 can be expensive but Vaseline always offers coupons, so there is ways to save $1 or even $2 off the reg price of the of the product... Overall I would recommend this product, you skin will feel refreshed &amp; moisturized... I think the best quality is the fact that you can spray a even amount on your body vs. dumping the lotion in your hand and trying to spread the lotion all over the body.. I would definitely purchase and recommend you purchasing...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this product complimentary from Influenster.. Even though this review is 100% my own thoughts and opinion.. I honestly love this product and believe it&#x27;s simple, affordable and innovative..</li>
            <li> Finally there is a lotion that is made for men! My fiance never decicates enough time to himself &amp; moisturizing is out of the question. Whe we received this product he was excited to try it out. He really likes it so fast, each to use &amp; very efficient. He is always rushing so something that absorbs fast &amp; is not sticky when he gets dressed was key to get the thumbs up</li>
            <li> I got this lotion from influenster like a complimentary product to try and let me tell you this is by far my favorite lotion for my husband mainly because the scent and he says that absorbs quickly after application, moisturize and is not greasy, we love it &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> My husband just loves his Vaseline men spray! He finally has a lotion that&#x27;s not greasy and smells great that works on his knees! He also just loves the fact he can spray it right on and rub it in! Great product for men.</li>
            <li> I received this complimentary from Influenster and hubs is glad I did. This lotion has a really nice smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering and is not greasy at all. It absorbs quickly and cleanly.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my husband to try after I received it from Influenster in the latest Vox Box. He typically hates lotion because of the greasy feel that&#x27;s left behind. He is also a lover of short-cuts. He loves this product. It&#x27;s fast and easy to use and moisturizes well without being greasy. I personally love the way it smells. A great find for men&#x27;s skincare needs!</li>
            <li> So my husband has been trying this new lotion for men and he&#x27;s been loving it very moisturizers skin and the smell is amazing makes not want to get your hands off&lt;br /&gt;Ladies must get this for Thierry men in their life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;received this product complimentary from Influenster and that you are entering the Brand Challenge</li>
            <li> I used it as well as my husband and we both liked it.He liked that it didnt leave his skin greasy like normal lotion does and how convienient it is to spray it on.I agreed and liked how it smelled!I got this from influenster to test out.</li>
            <li> I got the opportunity to try this through Influenster. This was the first thing out of the box, snatched up by my hubby. His new favorite thing. Right away he went to it, putting lotion on elbows, arms, etc. It sprays on, but you do need to rub it in by hand. It has a manly perfumed scent and is pleasant. Of course, he doused himself in lotion, so it was strong right away but evened out. He has been using regularly, especially on elbows and feet and I&#x27;ve grown to really like the scent and how soft it makes his skin. It doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy residue at all.</li>
            <li> We received a bottle of Vaseline Spray and Go for Men from Influenster for free in order to try it out. I love the women&#x27;s version but didn&#x27;t know they came out with a men&#x27;s version. I love this product because it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue on my husband&#x27;s skin. I especially like the light scent it has. I am allergic to many scents, especially strong men&#x27;s cologne and lotion scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband loves it because it is non-greasy and easy to apply. It dries in less than a minute and helps his very dry skin.</li>
            <li> so I got this spray for men to try out  and my husband so loving this makes his skin smell good and leave it&#x27;s moisturize his skin without living it greasy would but this again for him.</li>
            <li> I received a free Vaseline Men Spray and Go Body Lotion from Influenster and was excited to pass it on to my husband who has been suffering from dry skin with this extra long Winter. He loved how fast and easy it was to apply and that it wasn&#x27;t overly greasy!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome spray. I love these new spray lotions as it makes applying lotion so easy and mess free. Its super easy and fast to keep your skin moisturized. The coloring of the can is really cool. The smell is manly without being overwhelming. My hubby was never a lotion person and since trying this product out he now applies lotion!</li>
            <li> This past cold winter has caused my skin to become dry and itchy.  This spray goes on and dries quickly.  Has a mild pleasant smell too.  This lotion does definitely relieve the dryness and itch.</li>
            <li> I like the concept of a spray lotion for men, and use the aloe scented version of this product.  But the smell of this stuff is awful.  This may be just a personal preference, but it doesn&#x27;t smell like any &amp;#34;men&#x27;s&amp;#34; product I&#x27;ve ever used.  Nasty stuff.</li>
            <li> Goes on fast and absorbes pretty quickly, though you may still need to rub the lotion in a bit.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel natural on the skin; it&#x27;s like some chemical stuff that may does harm to your skin. The smell in to harsh too.</li>
