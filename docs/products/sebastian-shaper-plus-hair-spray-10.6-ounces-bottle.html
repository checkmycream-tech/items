            <li>The scent is fair and shouldn&#x27;t interfere with perfume or colognes.</li>

            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE SEBASTIAN!!</li>
            <li>This is good hairspray in that it holds without stiffness/sticky-ness and can be combed through easily for re-dos.</li>
            <li>have used it for many years</li>
            <li>Love this product, my hair doesn&#x27;t get sticky, but stays in place.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hairspray on the market.  </li>
            <li>I order this hairspray all the time because I love how it works.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, body and the texture it gives my hair.</li>
            <li>I love it, I will order again.</li>
            <li>I love this spray.</li>
            <li>love the way it smells</li>
            <li>I love their Mousse Whipped Cream.</li>
            <li>but I do love this product</li>
            <li>I love Sebastian Shaper Plus Hair Spray.  </li>
            <li>It is totally the best ever.</li>
            <li>Was very excited when finding it for the price.  </li>
            <li>Its not heavy, and is a great styling tool.</li>
            <li>The best part is that it lasts me way longer than the cheap hairspray brands I&#x27;ve tried because I can use so much less and get better hold.</li>
            <li>Works great, good hold and no static in my hair.  </li>
            <li>I HAVE FINE HAIR</li>
            <li>This provides a firmer hold on my fine hair without feeling glued together.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t need a lot of hold, this paticular hair spray should be fine.</li>
            <li>cheap</li>
            <li>Light, yet holds.</li>
            <li>Worth the money in my opinion!</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Ive used Sebastians products all my life, specially the Sharper Plus Hair Spray...</li>
            <li>love this product, couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere but here, thanks</li>
            <li>I like it better than their new product, Re-Shaper too.</li>
            <li>This is the greatest hair spray you can buy,if you don&#x27;t want the stiff look and want to be able to comb it right out the next day this is the spray you want.</li>
            <li>Has refreshing soft smell.</li>
            <li>I love this product,,,,,,,I am sensitive to every hair spray I have used.  </li>
            <li>ok and my hair looks natural</li>
            <li>but you are worth it.</li>
            <li>The bottle looks legit and it says right in the description &amp;#34;new</li>
            <li>it did not smell right at all and the sprayer keeps clogging</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hairspray for soft waves or straight hair.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and very well packaged.  </li>
            <li>I have very straight hair that couldn&#x27;t  hold a curl until I started using this spray.</li>
            <li>No false advertising here!</li>
            <li>have allergys, scent very inoffensive &amp; fresh.</li>
            <li>Works well if you spray some in your hairbrush first.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>IT JUST GOES TO SHOW IT PAYS TO SPEND A LITTLE MORE TO GET A FANTASTIC PRODUCT</li>
            <li>Hair still feels clean and soft.</li>
            <li>If I only purchased individual cans I cannot remember if the price was good</li>
            <li>The spray is too long which distributes more product than I need</li>
            <li>then I would try to fine Sabastain Hair Srapy for extra hold.</li>
            <li>But this paicular hair spray is fine for those who do not need extra hold.</li>
            <li>in order to really hold your hair in place, you have to put a lot on.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend hair spray!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Not as much control now.</li>
            <li>Ordering it was much easier</li>
            <li>It is the only fragrance I enjoy.</li>
            <li>i dont think tihs is the real thing.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li>but I really like it.</li>
            <li>RIGHT???You really won&#x27;t know until you try it.</li>
            <li>I love this gentle spray - never weighs down my hair</li>
            <li>I am aware that Sebastian changed the formula, so I wanted the old version (THE ONE</li>
            <li>look same great formula&amp;#34; but it is certainly not the same.</li>
            <li>and I live where he humidity is very high)</li>
            <li>I will forever buy this spray holds curls and doesn&#x27;t make your hair hard what more can a girl ask for it works on all types of hair and weaves so worth it</li>
            <li>Light, distributes evenly, and lasts long!</li>
            <li>The hairspray really allows you to reshape fringe without getting the heavy or crunchy bangs most hairsprays cause.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Again you pay a little more</li>
            <li>Shaper Plus works much better for me than plain Shaper.  </li>
            <li>Love the way it holds my set without being stiff.</li>
            <li>when I get my order is the NEW formula, NOT THE ONE IN THE PICTURE.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I use the regular Shaper first for styling and then finish off with the Plus.</li>
            <li>but all you need is run your fingers through for a very soft natural feel.  </li>
            <li>I know that sometimes ordering from private vendors from Amazon you get knock off products and I am positive I got that.</li>
            <li>holds, soft, brushable, shine.  </li>
            <li>Still love Shaper...always have but not loving the way it sprays.</li>
            <li>IT ALSO FEELS NATURAL.</li>
            <li>No build up, washes out completely and hold up in humidity.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft and shinny.</li>
            <li>Also makes me hair soft and shinny.</li>
            <li>If you need extra hold like I do, ( I have very fine thin hair</li>
            <li>Does not make your hair stiff and hard, plus it holds your hair nicely when curling (not sticky).  </li>

            <li> would recommend this product for anyone that is sensitive to other hair sprays.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different less expensive sprays, but none of them compare.</li>
            <li> It is more expensive than other hairsprays</li>
            <li> last couple that I have bought we &amp;#34;different&amp;#34; from what I was use to.&lt;br /&gt;Too bad they had to mess with a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> This product is expensive like many cosmetics, but like only a few, this one works as it is supposed to.  </li>
            <li> It is expensive, but worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other similar products but nothing compares!  </li>
            <li> Then your hair feels sort of wet.</li>
            <li> A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY.</li>
            <li> KEEPS MY HAIR IN PLACE AND GIVES I SHINE AND VOLUME WITHOUT MAKING IT LOOK STICKY OR WET!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely disappointed since I usually love Sebastian hair products.</li>
            <li> I should of checked out the other hair sprays Sabastian sells.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve been using this same spray for at least 20 years...</li>
            <li> and it is not at all sticky or stiff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what happened here.</li>
            <li> I spent nearly $20 on this crap.</li>
            <li> No sticky residue all over you and the floor, it is just to hard to explain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m truly disappointed in this not cheap hair</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s been totally useless.</li>
            <li> DUH!!!</li>
            <li> disappointed in the product, not in the distributor.</li>
            <li> I like it, doesn&#x27;t seem like hair spray which I hate.</li>

            <li> best hair spray ever. holds, soft, brushable, shine.  have allergys, scent very inoffensive &amp; fresh. you will love it.!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Have been using forever.  Keeps you hair beautifully but all you need is run your fingers through for a very soft natural feel.  Time to reorder!</li>
            <li> Does not hold the hair just makes it sticky. Will not purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;Will not recommend it to any of my friends.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hairspray for soft waves or straight hair. The smell is a bit liek a fog machine, so dont expect anything wonderful there unless you like that scent as I do. The hairspray really allows you to reshape fringe without getting the heavy or crunchy bangs most hairsprays cause. Light, distributes evenly, and lasts long!</li>

            <li> This is by fear the best hairspray around.  You get the hold without the crusty feeling.  Hair still feels clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I have used Shaper Plus for years.  It&#x27;s not sticky to the touch and it holds well, even in humidity.  Shaper Plus works much better for me than plain Shaper.  I like it better than their new product, Re-Shaper too.</li>
            <li> love this product, couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere but here, thanks</li>
            <li> this is really great  have used it for many years</li>
            <li> This spray is great! Perfect! Holds and yet not sticky. Has refreshing soft smell. Highly recommend hair spray!</li>
            <li> This is good hairspray in that it holds without stiffness/sticky-ness and can be combed through easily for re-dos. The scent is fair and shouldn&#x27;t interfere with perfume or colognes.</li>
            <li> The hairspray is just like what you buy at the beauty supply.  The quality is the same. It was convenient to have it shipped rather than driving .  The price was good too.</li>
            <li> Have used this hair spray for years.  Holds without leaving your hair needing to be washed every time you use it.  Worth the money in my opinion! I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Still love Shaper...always have but not loving the way it sprays. It&#x27;s not like it used to be. I was used to the short sprays. Not as much control now. The spray is too long which distributes more product than I need</li>
            <li> Recommended by a friend who said it works for her.  Did not for me.  Does not last or hold style.</li>
            <li> I buy Sebastian ALL THE TIME from beauty stores and shops and it&#x27;s ALWAYS wonderful.  Why then, did I order this on line with the SAME name and bottle, etc., and get a product that doesn&#x27;t work!  It&#x27;s so inferior to Sebastian, I don&#x27;t believe that&#x27;s what&#x27;s in the bottle. Will never order again, NOR trust this vendor!</li>
            <li> This is the only hairspray that does not damage my hair.  But I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars, because it doesn&#x27;t hold as well as I would like.  So that means I go through it quicker than I would like.</li>
            <li> I will forever buy this spray holds curls and doesn&#x27;t make your hair hard what more can a girl ask for it works on all types of hair and weaves so worth it</li>
            <li> Works great, good hold and no static in my hair.  Works well if you spray some in your hairbrush first.</li>
            <li> KEEPS MY HAIR IN PLACE AND GIVES I SHINE AND VOLUME WITHOUT MAKING IT LOOK STICKY OR WET! WOW! I HAVE FINE HAIR AND THIS IS INCREDIBLE! I CAN ENEN RUN MY FINGERS THROUGH IT AND STILL HAVE CONTROL. IT LOOKS LIKE  I HAVE NO SPRAY IN MY HAIR. IT DOES NOT DAMAGE MY HAIR OR PULL WHEN I RUN MY BRUSH THROUGH. IT ALSO FEELS NATURAL. IT JUST GOES TO SHOW IT PAYS TO SPEND A LITTLE MORE TO GET A FANTASTIC PRODUCT AND A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY. I WOULD HIGHLE RECOMEND.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it might actually do something but it&#x27;s been totally useless. I&#x27;m extremely disappointed since I usually love Sebastian hair products.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I bought this hairspray, used it a handful of times and the pump does not work.&lt;br /&gt;I tried everything....including their suggestions and even replacing the head of the pump.&lt;br /&gt;It is inside the mechanism.&lt;br /&gt;I called several times and sent in a letter as they requested and they are not replacing it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m truly disappointed in this not cheap hair spray.&lt;br /&gt;DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;Very cheap</li>
            <li> could not always find this product.  Ordering it was much easier</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hairspray! It is expensive, but worth it! It gives you hold with movement. I have tried many different less expensive sprays, but none of them compare.</li>
            <li> I have used this hairspray for years. Love the way it holds my set without being stiff.</li>
            <li> This product is the best hair spray I have ever used.  Was very excited when finding it for the price.  Great buy.</li>
            <li> Love this product, my hair doesn&#x27;t get sticky, but stays in place.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hairspray on the market.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and was worried that with the packaging change there may have been a formula change, but that was not the case.  I have very straight hair that couldn&#x27;t  hold a curl until I started using this spray. The best part is that it lasts me way longer than the cheap hairspray brands I&#x27;ve tried because I can use so much less and get better hold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what happened here. The bottle looks legit and it says right in the description &amp;#34;new look same great formula&amp;#34; but it is certainly not the same. This does not hold AT ALL! I know that sometimes ordering from private vendors from Amazon you get knock off products and I am positive I got that. I&#x27;m not happy I spent nearly $20 on this crap.</li>
            <li> I order this hairspray all the time because I love how it works. Its not heavy, and is a great styling tool.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use anything else, ever.  I&#x27;ve been using it for decades. No build up, washes out completely and hold up in humidity.</li>
            <li> This product is expensive like many cosmetics, but like only a few, this one works as it is supposed to.  No false advertising here!</li>
            <li> I have been using this hair spray, for years. I love the smell, body and the texture it gives my hair.</li>
            <li> I am used pleasure for 25 years. It is the only fragrance I enjoy. I love it, I will order again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other similar products but nothing compares!  It&#x27;s great and I&#x27;d recommend it to everyone! Sebastian is a dependable name..</li>
            <li> I love this product,,,,,,,I am sensitive to every hair spray I have used.  Only Sebastian Shaper Plus Hair Spray&lt;br /&gt;leaves my scalp unaffected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product for anyone that is sensitive to other hair sprays.</li>
            <li> Ordered this hair spray based on a review in Southern Living.  I like it, doesn&#x27;t seem like hair spray which I hate.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what they have done to the formula but it is definitely not the same hair spray that I have used for years.&lt;br /&gt;The last couple that I have bought we &amp;#34;different&amp;#34; from what I was use to.&lt;br /&gt;Too bad they had to mess with a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed in the product, not in the distributor.</li>
            <li> I love this gentle spray - never weighs down my hair - I can comb through it - a great find</li>
            <li> I use when I go to parties and do babyliss and my hair lasts all night..&lt;br /&gt;smells ok and my hair looks natural</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve been using this same spray for at least 20 years... When I try anything else, I always go back to this one. Light, yet holds.</li>
            <li> i dont think tihs is the real thing. it did not smell right at all and the sprayer keeps clogging</li>
            <li> Have been using Sebastian products for years.  I use the regular Shaper first for styling and then finish off with the Plus. This provides a firmer hold on my fine hair without feeling glued together.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE SEBASTIAN!!</li>
            <li> I love this spray. It holds well without being overly sticky. The fragrance is very pleasant as well. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Ive used Sebastians products all my life, specially the Sharper Plus Hair Spray... I am aware that Sebastian changed the formula, so I wanted the old version (THE ONE THE SELLER HAS ON THE DESCRIPTION OF THE ITEM) and guess what? when I get my order is the NEW formula, NOT THE ONE IN THE PICTURE. Contacted seller and the reply was Sebastian changed the look of the product almost a year ago DUH!!!</li>
            <li> I have used Sebastian Shaper Plus hair spray for years now&lt;br /&gt;I love the way it smells and it is not at all sticky or stiff&lt;br /&gt;You can comb through it if needed</li>
            <li> I should of checked out the other hair sprays Sabastian sells. It didn&#x27;t even occur to me at the time. I need extra hold just on my bangs. This doesn&#x27;t help my bangs stay in one place.  But.......... Sabastain products are the best to use in my  opinion. I love their Mousse Whipped Cream. It makes my hair so soft and shinny. I also use their shampoo and conditioner. Also makes me hair soft and shinny. If you don&#x27;t need a lot of hold, this paticular hair spray should be fine. If you need extra hold like I do, ( I have very fine thin hair and I live where he humidity is very high) then I would try to fine Sabastain Hair Srapy for extra hold. But this paicular hair spray is fine for those who do not need extra hold.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair spray.  Holds well even in the rain. Shipped quickly and very well packaged.  Keep up the good work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Great stuff, gives hair and good shine.  Does not make your hair stiff and hard, plus it holds your hair nicely when curling (not sticky).  Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li> If I only purchased individual cans I cannot remember if the price was good but I do love this product</li>
            <li> I love Sebastian Shaper Plus Hair Spray.  it keeps my hair in place without getting too plastered looking.  It is more expensive than other hairsprays but I really like it.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest hair spray you can buy,if you don&#x27;t want the stiff look and want to be able to comb it right out the next day this is the spray you want. It is totally the best ever. No sticky residue all over you and the floor, it is just to hard to explain. But that being said, it is the best of the best. Again you pay a little more but you are worth it. RIGHT???You really won&#x27;t know until you try it.</li>
