            <li>this kind of power</li>
            <li>Neutrogena&#x27;s Naturals Acne Spot Treatment is effective, but I am going to have to discontinue use of it because it burns my skin.</li>
            <li>Effective cream for Acne.</li>
            <li>the company use their own stuff?&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>so I was looking for something better to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using acne products all along with the okay of my doctor.</li>
            <li>this is magic</li>
            <li>Love how this product treats my acne without drying out my face.  </li>
            <li>Tee tree oil works much better.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li>I really love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I just ordered 2 more</li>
            <li>nice and light fragrance.</li>
            <li>top of that, its effectiveness is dubious.</li>
            <li>It was ok</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>It smells WONDERFUL and doesn&#x27;t dry out my face like a lot of other spot treatment does, and the best part?!</li>
            <li>they would not disappoint and I was right, Thankfully!!</li>
            <li>was easy to lift out.</li>
            <li>skin is smooth.</li>
            <li>I always thought these spot treatments were a waste of money but the beauty consultant at Target said that this was the best thing for blackheads since the medication needs time to sit on your face and work</li>
            <li>so I watched it work, nothing short of amazing!</li>
            <li>It mostly just sits on top and sometimes it even leaves a white film on top...</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this product is very safe.</li>
            <li>There are no instant results but I&#x60;ve found this to be, by far, the best spot treatment I&#x60;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product but it ended up breaking me out.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it 2 stars is that it smells really good, hehe.</li>
            <li>I have trouble areas and this stuff works incredibly well.  </li>
            <li>It works better than the Dermalogica and is much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I am pregnant</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t run out THAT quickly.</li>
            <li>It smells good, doesn&#x27;t dry out my face or leave a residue.</li>
            <li>But if you have oily, acne-prone spots on your face, 1 application per day on those parts is actually exactly what it needs to keep the level of oil balanced!</li>
            <li>I am in my mid forties and have acne more than I ever did as a teenager!  </li>
            <li>This product leaves a while film on your face and it makes your face really tight, it kind of okay for overnight use, but wouldn&#x27;t recommend for daysuse/wear.</li>
            <li>This is great for those who are not prone to acne but get a few here and there.</li>
            <li>swelling may be rare coincidence, but the power of this stuff scares me a bit.&lt;br /&gt;also, this was not a zit after all.  </li>
            <li>Neutrogena, please make this product safe for use on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have had acne for most of my life and as an adult</li>
            <li>, this is the first product I tried and purchased of their new line and the results are phenomenal.</li>
            <li>but they are quickly chased away with consistent application of this product.</li>
            <li>right in my sweat zone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of other brands of spot treatments and this is by far the most effective in my opinion.</li>
            <li>pimple&#x27; would not have gone away, just get bigger and more irritated.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this cream, and it&#x27;s definitely helped with my breakouts, but could be a little better....</li>
            <li>This is moisturizing and gentle.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to purchase another tube of it.</li>
            <li>Really works on the spot.</li>
            <li>This stuff absolutely works.</li>
            <li>Really white.&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li>I started using Dermalogica overnight clearing gel which worked really well.</li>
            <li>When I first got it I had a huge lump between my eyes that was about to turn into a huge zit, and I put 1 thick layer on and</li>
            <li>and I noticed a significant difference in the size of the pimples the next morning.</li>
            <li>This works better than the one prescribed by my doctor and cost much less.  </li>
            <li>I also purchased the Naturals Acne Foaming Scrub to use in conjunction with this spot treatment, I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Also, make sure you exfoliate in the morning to get all the dry white residue off because it tends to really cling to the skin.</li>
            <li>This acne treatment is so gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m always trying new things.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to someone who wants to go a little more natural without being total hippie.</li>
            <li>but it completely started to clear up my skin in a matter of days!</li>
            <li>I well certainly be using this product on a regular basis!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find products with salicylic acid, I found this, decided to give it a try and am glad I did.</li>
            <li>My skin is totally clear.</li>
            <li>I wanted to buy something that was more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and did not have a lot of negative ingredients.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use any natural products/foods on my face so maybe since I am not use to</li>
            <li>It smells almost like a natural perfume.</li>
            <li>By day three, the pimples were completely gone.</li>
            <li>works on adult acne breakouts as soon as it comes out</li>
            <li>at night, and really take some time to continue to massage in until it finally stops being white.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>I used this on some problem area&#x27;s and in a few days&#x27; time I saw a significant decrease in my pesky pimple&#x27;s sizes and redness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena Products since I was 16 and just recently stumbled upon their new naturals line</li>
            <li>I have struggled with acne my whole life and after using countless skin care products I finally stumbled on this product.</li>
            <li>area where zit was still somewhat red and sensitive.  </li>
            <li>now that it is back to flat normal skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a small bottle but with the work it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> area where zit was still somewhat red and sensitive.  </li>
            <li> now that it is back to flat normal skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small bottle but with the work it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> Other products clear up acne as well but leave my face peeling and scaly.  </li>
            <li> I am a 43 year old gal who is extremely athletic.</li>
            <li> For those with sensitive skin, I would recommend Aveeno Active Naturals Ultra Calming Foaming Cleanser along with this product.</li>
            <li> would never have known sliver was there or why a zit persisted in such a strange place if I had not used nutrogena naturals.</li>
            <li> -after note:  notice swelling an inch or 2 near wrist, down from where zit was.</li>
            <li> It definitely dries out your skin, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for people with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I am a long time sufferer of hormonal acne (PCOS)</li>
            <li> but it will help you in the long run.</li>
            <li> It does not dry clear and you will look silly with white spots on your face but use it before you go to bed and you will be surprised at the results in the morning.</li>
            <li> And If you have dry skin as well, I would recommend Olay Active Hydrating Beauty Fluid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that applying 1 thin layer per day on the oily/acne prone areas of your face (for me its the T zone) is exactly the amount of drying my face needs to prevent acne from forming.</li>
            <li> only a little redness remains, and the sting is subsiding.</li>
            <li> I still get tiny little bumps here</li>
            <li> Gets rid of acne and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like other salicylic acid products do.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding it and decided to try neutrogena rapid clear acne spot treatment.</li>
            <li> I recommend other Neutrogena customers to try this product for their acne problems.</li>
            <li> It is working well to manage my acne, some of my small pimples it has cleared up and my bigger ones are decreasing in size.</li>
            <li> Not especially effective.</li>
            <li> I should get a good 2-3 months out of it unless something terrible breaks out on my face!</li>
            <li> I can see a sliver embedded down under skin.</li>
            <li> In just a few days all of my active blemishes have either started to heal and have gone way down in size or have disappeared.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d say I have about 80% less acne.</li>
            <li> but my it seemed to irritate my face a little and</li>
            <li> The big painful zits are completely gone.</li>
            <li> Before bed I treat it like a facial mask and coat my face with a thin layer and leave it on over night.</li>
            <li> However, the first three times I used this spot treatment my skin burned and itched really bad for a minute.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really too bad.</li>
            <li> I tend to get painful chin and jawline/neck acne as a result of hormonal imbalances and this stuff really does the trick.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with being total hippie, but it just doesn&#x27;t work for some of us!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m growing out of puberty or</li>
            <li> Not really sure it works all that well.</li>
            <li> A lot of the times, even in my mid twenties, I get an annoying pimple that just pops up from no where.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this product.</li>
            <li> I have been having a terrible time with my back acne</li>
            <li> Cant go wrong with Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel any weird tingling or burning sensation.</li>
            <li> it is caused a bad reaction?</li>
            <li> I was sick of it.</li>
            <li> Annoying, unsightly and sometimes downright painful.</li>
            <li> I also hate the consistency.</li>
            <li> the area and allow the nasty stuff inside to come to the surface.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> AMAZING RESULTS! I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena Products since I was 16 and just recently stumbled upon their new naturals line, this is the first product I tried and purchased of their new line and the results are phenomenal. I also purchased the Naturals Acne Foaming Scrub to use in conjunction with this spot treatment, I highly recommend this. I purchased two of these, I had a feeling they would not disappoint and I was right, Thankfully!!</li>
            <li> I am a long time sufferer of hormonal acne (PCOS) so I&#x27;m always trying new things. I picked up some of this along with their facial scrub from the same line. I am pregnant so I was looking for something better to use. I&#x27;ve been using acne products all along with the okay of my doctor. I ran out of stuff and was breaking out so I picked this up at CVS. It smells WONDERFUL and doesn&#x27;t dry out my face like a lot of other spot treatment does, and the best part?! In just a few days all of my active blemishes have either started to heal and have gone way down in size or have disappeared. I would highly recommend this to someone who wants to go a little more natural without being total hippie. Nothing wrong with being total hippie, but it just doesn&#x27;t work for some of us!</li>
            <li> Not a miracle worker for me. I&#x27;ve been treating acne on my face with this for two weeks - nothing. Won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> Not especially effective.</li>
            <li> Yes. This product works miracles on my face. My skin shouts yes to this brand. I recommend other Neutrogena customers to try this product for their acne problems. If you&#x27;re not a current Neutrogena fan, try this product to help with your acne. It won&#x27;t give you overnight acne-free face but it will help you in the long run.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this product. It smells good, doesn&#x27;t dry out my face or leave a residue. Works awesome.</li>
            <li> the zit I treated was on my forearm so I watched it work, nothing short of amazing! med.size zit is now(3 hrs later)completely gone. skin is smooth. only a little redness remains, and the sting is subsiding. (yes it stings).&lt;br /&gt;if you want a zit gone immediately, this is what you need.&lt;br /&gt;with this kind of power, I am thinking it could also make a wart disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;day-after note:  notice swelling an inch or 2 near wrist, down from where zit was. area where zit was still somewhat red and sensitive.  swelling may be rare coincidence, but the power of this stuff scares me a bit.&lt;br /&gt;also, this was not a zit after all.  now that it is back to flat normal skin I can see a sliver embedded down under skin. was easy to lift out. would never have known sliver was there or why a zit persisted in such a strange place if I had not used nutrogena naturals. &#x27;pimple&#x27; would not have gone away, just get bigger and more irritated.</li>
            <li> I am a 43 year old gal who is extremely athletic. I have been having a terrible time with my back acne right in my sweat zone. Annoying, unsightly and sometimes downright painful. Got this stuff 2 weeks ago. Apply it every day. The big painful zits are completely gone. The smaller ones are still there but I am hopeful that as I continue using those will diminish too. Now if only it got rid of the acne scars.</li>
            <li> This product leaves a while film on your face and it makes your face really tight, it kind of okay for overnight use, but wouldn&#x27;t recommend for daysuse/wear.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m growing out of puberty or this this is magic but I love it! After I started using it pimples cleared up overnight or within a day. It&#x27;s a small bottle but with the work it&#x27;s worth the price. It doesn&#x27;t run out THAT quickly. I should get a good 2-3 months out of it unless something terrible breaks out on my face!</li>
            <li> Neutrogena&#x27;s Naturals Acne Spot Treatment is effective, but I am going to have to discontinue use of it because it burns my skin. It is working well to manage my acne, some of my small pimples it has cleared up and my bigger ones are decreasing in size. However, the first three times I used this spot treatment my skin burned and itched really bad for a minute. After a minute the irritation subsided. I have used it about seven times now and it continues to tingle, burn, and itch with varying intensity. It&#x27;s really too bad. Neutrogena, please make this product safe for use on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I wanted to buy something that was more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and did not have a lot of negative ingredients. But maybe my skin is to acne prone to use this because I do not see and difference with using this product.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product but it ended up breaking me out. I don&#x27;t use any natural products/foods on my face so maybe since I am not use to it is caused a bad reaction?</li>
            <li> Love how this product treats my acne without drying out my face.  Other products clear up acne as well but leave my face peeling and scaly.  This is moisturizing and gentle.</li>
            <li> This works better than the one prescribed by my doctor and cost much less.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Effective cream for Acne.</li>
            <li> Love, love this product!!! I have struggled with acne my whole life and after using countless skin care products I finally stumbled on this product. Not only did it do wonders on my acne but it completely started to clear up my skin in a matter of days! I well certainly be using this product on a regular basis!! I usually only apply twice a day, in the mornings and at night. Before bed I treat it like a facial mask and coat my face with a thin layer and leave it on over night.</li>
            <li> Gets rid of acne and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like other salicylic acid products do.</li>
            <li> Tee tree oil works much better.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t Work AT ALL, not as a spot treatment or anything...I also hate the consistency. It doesn&#x27;t absorb into the skin at all. It mostly just sits on top and sometimes it even leaves a white film on top...yuck! The only reason I gave it 2 stars is that it smells really good, hehe. It smells almost like a natural perfume. But as a spot treatment, I do not recommend! Instead I recommend Desert Essence Tea Tree Oil Ointment.</li>
            <li> A lot of the times, even in my mid twenties, I get an annoying pimple that just pops up from no where. I was sick of it. So I wanted a spot treatment cure. I used this on some problem area&#x27;s and in a few days&#x27; time I saw a significant decrease in my pesky pimple&#x27;s sizes and redness. This is great for those who are not prone to acne but get a few here and there. Definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that worked for my blackheads. I love it. My skin is totally clear. I put it on at night after washing my face when I thought of it. I always thought these spot treatments were a waste of money but the beauty consultant at Target said that this was the best thing for blackheads since the medication needs time to sit on your face and work it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find products with salicylic acid, I found this, decided to give it a try and am glad I did.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff. There are no instant results but I&#x60;ve found this to be, by far, the best spot treatment I&#x60;ve ever used. I tend to get painful chin and jawline/neck acne as a result of hormonal imbalances and this stuff really does the trick. I can tell after just a couple of days of using this stuff on a zit(those gnarly under the skin ones) that it will flatten out and start to &amp;#34;soften&amp;#34; the area and allow the nasty stuff inside to come to the surface. I&#x27;ve used a lot of other brands of spot treatments and this is by far the most effective in my opinion. I picked this up on a whim at Walmart and I&#x27;m ready to purchase another tube of it. It does not dry clear and you will look silly with white spots on your face but use it before you go to bed and you will be surprised at the results in the morning. Also, make sure you exfoliate in the morning to get all the dry white residue off because it tends to really cling to the skin. No biggie. This stuff is awesome! Give it a try!</li>
            <li> Works awesome for me.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Have been using it for awhile. Feels like it soothes and conditions your skin as well as doing a great job clearing up pimples.</li>
            <li> I have had acne for most of my life and as an adult I have trouble areas and this stuff works incredibly well.  I just ordered 2 more&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x60; Chad</li>
            <li> Really works on the spot. Cant go wrong with Neutrogena. I have sensitive skin and this product is very safe.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some flare ups on the T-zone of my face for quite some time. I applied this product to the area at night and I noticed a significant difference in the size of the pimples the next morning. By day three, the pimples were completely gone. This acne treatment is so gentle on my sensitive skin. I don&#x27;t feel any weird tingling or burning sensation. I would recommend this to anyone. For those with sensitive skin, I would recommend Aveeno Active Naturals Ultra Calming Foaming Cleanser along with this product. They work wonderfully together. And If you have dry skin as well, I would recommend Olay Active Hydrating Beauty Fluid.</li>
            <li> Bought this with the hope that it would help reduce 10 years of acne that just never went away since I hit puberty. This stuff absolutely works. When I first got it I had a huge lump between my eyes that was about to turn into a huge zit, and I put 1 thick layer on and then after doing this once a day for 3-4 days the lump was GONE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have oily areas that constantly just reproduce acne and it never seems like you can get a break, this stuff is for you. I&#x27;ve found that applying 1 thin layer per day on the oily/acne prone areas of your face (for me its the T zone) is exactly the amount of drying my face needs to prevent acne from forming. It definitely dries out your skin, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for people with dry skin. But if you have oily, acne-prone spots on your face, 1 application per day on those parts is actually exactly what it needs to keep the level of oil balanced! I&#x27;ve been doing this for 3 weeks now and I&#x27;d say I have about 80% less acne. I still get tiny little bumps here and there but they are quickly chased away with consistent application of this product.</li>
            <li> nice and light fragrance. works on adult acne breakouts as soon as it comes out I put this treatment on and it disappears.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this cream, and it&#x27;s definitely helped with my breakouts, but could be a little better....</li>
            <li> Great for use as clown makeup. Just apply, rub it in and watch in turn white. Really white.&lt;br /&gt;Use at night, and really take some time to continue to massage in until it finally stops being white.&lt;br /&gt;Does the company use their own stuff?&lt;br /&gt;On top of that, its effectiveness is dubious. Not really sure it works all that well.</li>
            <li> Clears up pimples over night!  Great product!</li>
            <li> I am in my mid forties and have acne more than I ever did as a teenager!  After almost my entire face broke out several years ago I started using Dermalogica overnight clearing gel which worked really well. I have a hard time finding it and decided to try neutrogena rapid clear acne spot treatment. It was ok but my it seemed to irritate my face a little and whereever I applied it turned really red. I saw the naturals spot treatment and decided to try it and I LOVE it. It works better than the Dermalogica and is much cheaper.</li>
