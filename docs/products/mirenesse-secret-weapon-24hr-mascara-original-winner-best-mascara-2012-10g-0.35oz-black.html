            <li>However, I was impressed with this product.</li>
            <li>It is the best, No raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li>not the best I use to use this 7 years ago it was wonderful.</li>
            <li>Loved it!  </li>
            <li>I Love it!!</li>
            <li>the color was good, did not flake nor smudge.</li>
            <li>Nothing Special!!!</li>
            <li>glad I bought it, and will continue too!</li>
            <li>I  love the fact you don&#x27;t need anything but warm water to remove, yet is water proof..  </li>
            <li>This product was just OK.</li>
            <li>My lashes looked thicker and more defined when wearing this product.</li>
            <li>Can apply more than one coat.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s really nice to be able to buy from Amazon with free shipping.</li>
            <li>Award winning my butt, 24hrs</li>
            <li>It is also very easy to remove, just use warm water and soap and it comes right off.</li>
            <li>The best mascara ever-puts all other mascaras to shame.  </li>
            <li>It is so easy to use and stays smooth and creamy when applying..</li>
            <li>Most mascaras make my eyes water and turn bright red, this item did not.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this because of its awards as well as being cruelty free.</li>
            <li>It is extremely comfortable to wear, the lashes are still flexible and it doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li>Great mascara for daily use.</li>
            <li>Amazing coverage,  with thick  and amazing looking lashes!  </li>
            <li>A true no smudge/flake mascara that holds it&#x27;s shape.</li>
            <li>yeah right.</li>
            <li>;  I can actually use this mascara on top and bottom lashes and I get no smudging.  </li>
            <li>dissappointing  too much clumping</li>
            <li>a whole day&#x27;s wear</li>
            <li>Stayed on long, and easy to remove---</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and makes your lashes look extremely long.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not just colo,r but little tubules that cover the lash which you can see when you remove, yet comes off easily with soap and water and a washcloth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good but it still smudges a little  after a few hours of wear.</li>
            <li>not irritate my sensitive eyes.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>I used to buy directly from Mirenesse and have to pay shipping from Australia</li>
            <li>I have been using Mirenesse for many years except for a few years in between  and have gone back to it</li>
            <li>Washing off is clean too, no charcoal mess.</li>
            <li>No black raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li>You can only add one coat because it dries so fast and because it&#x27;s some type of silicone, that attempts to latch itself to your lashes, you cannot add a second coat for more dramatic effects.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see much difference from other massacres.</li>

            <li> little clumpier than other brands I have used, but worth the trade off.</li>
            <li> I expected so much more, too expensive, as well</li>
            <li> Just the same as any other mascara i have purchased.</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s a bit expensive but worth every penny!  </li>
            <li> I wanted a waterproof mascara (which it says it is) to quickly dry and hold my eyelashes after I curl them.</li>
            <li> love it and i will buy it again but very expensive shipping....</li>
            <li> Your lucky if you get one application on before your lashes start sticking together and feel uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money, I only give it 1 star</li>
            <li> smudging and &amp;#34;panda eyes&amp;#34; than other</li>
            <li> I have oily under eyes as every other mascara (waterproof, smudgeproof, etc) always leave &amp;#34;raccoon eyes.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> The other thing, when I reached out to mirenesse and told them of my experience, the deleted my comment off their site.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Secret Weapon for several years now because it&#x27;s the ONLY mascara that doesn&#x27;t smudge.  </li>
            <li> Although, it does stay on for an extended period of time and doesn&#x27;t flake it didn&#x27;t hold the curl at all and honestly is not worth the price.</li>
            <li> The only mascara I have had for at least three years.  </li>
            <li> I did have to wait about a week and a half to get it because it came all the way from Australia.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-smudges slightly</li>
            <li> My lashes are typically very long and thick but this stuff broke them, layer after layer, and thinned them out until I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> , it makes my eyes a little itchy, however I haven&#x27;t had an allergic reaction</li>
            <li> , after about a few hours wear, I will get small smudges&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I felt that it was hard to remove.</li>
            <li> Maybe not if you like thick looking lashes.</li>
            <li> Was not impressed.  </li>
            <li> there is moisture in the air, but if it gets in your eye, it burns hella bad.</li>
            <li> This is not mascara, this is some crappy silicone crap that rips your eyelashes, or pulls at them.</li>
            <li> Turned out to be VERY Expensive!</li>

            <li> dissappointing  too much clumping</li>
            <li> This product was just OK. I wanted a waterproof mascara (which it says it is) to quickly dry and hold my eyelashes after I curl them. Although, it does stay on for an extended period of time and doesn&#x27;t flake it didn&#x27;t hold the curl at all and honestly is not worth the price. Won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much difference from other massacres. It doesn&#x27;t clump that is a bonus.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand exclusively for several years.&lt;br /&gt;Less smudging and &amp;#34;panda eyes&amp;#34; than other brands.&lt;br /&gt;Does not irritate my sensitive eyes.&lt;br /&gt;A little clumpier than other brands I have used, but worth the trade off.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this because of its awards as well as being cruelty free. I did have to wait about a week and a half to get it because it came all the way from Australia. However, I was impressed with this product. Most mascaras make my eyes water and turn bright red, this item did not. It is extremely comfortable to wear, the lashes are still flexible and it doesn&#x27;t clump. No watery or red eyes when I wore this. It is also very easy to remove, just use warm water and soap and it comes right off. My lashes looked thicker and more defined when wearing this product.</li>
            <li> Just the same as any other mascara i have purchased. Nothing Special!!! I expected so much more, too expensive, as well</li>
            <li> I like it.  Goes on well.  Can apply more than one coat.  Can use on lower lash with no smudge at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> VeryEasy to apply and remove without rubbing eyelashes. No black raccoon eyes. Will be my mascara of choice.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
            <li> Great mascara for daily use. Maybe not if you like thick looking lashes.</li>
            <li> The only mascara I have had for at least three years.  I  love the fact you don&#x27;t need anything but warm water to remove, yet is water proof..  Amazing coverage,  with thick  and amazing looking lashes!  I Love it!!</li>
            <li> Was not impressed.  Wished I&#x27;l listen to my friend and ordered the &amp;#34;SEX&#x27; one and not this.  That one instantly volumilized,  This one didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-makes lashes fuller and longer&lt;br /&gt;-doesn&#x27;t flake&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-smudges slightly, after about a few hours wear, I will get small smudges&lt;br /&gt;-I felt that it was hard to remove. It does remove in one piece if you &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; it from your lashes, but when I do this I end up removing some lashes as well. If you try to wash it off, it comes off in pieces and gets in my eyes&lt;br /&gt;-After a whole day&#x27;s wear, it makes my eyes a little itchy, however I haven&#x27;t had an allergic reaction&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am no makeup expert, but I feel this is overpriced and regular drugstore brands work just as well.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use and stays smooth and creamy when applying.. glad I bought it, and will continue too!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only mascara I&#x27;ll ever use.</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s a bit expensive but worth every penny!  I&#x27;ve been using Secret Weapon for several years now because it&#x27;s the ONLY mascara that doesn&#x27;t smudge.  I have oily under eyes as every other mascara (waterproof, smudgeproof, etc) always leave &amp;#34;raccoon eyes.&amp;#34;  I can actually use this mascara on top and bottom lashes and I get no smudging.

            <li> I have been using Mirenesse for many years except for a few years in between  and have gone back to it and I won&#x27;t change again.  It is the best, No raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li> not the best I use to use this 7 years ago it was wonderful.</li>
            <li> Loved it!  Stayed on long, and easy to remove--- the color was good, did not flake nor smudge. I ordered express shipping by mistake, and I could not change it!  Turned out to be VERY Expensive!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but it still smudges a little  after a few hours of wear.</li>
            <li> Award winning my butt, 24hrs yeah right. This is not mascara, this is some crappy silicone crap that rips your eyelashes, or pulls at them. You can only add one coat because it dries so fast and because it&#x27;s some type of silicone, that attempts to latch itself to your lashes, you cannot add a second coat for more dramatic effects. Your lucky if you get one application on before your lashes start sticking together and feel uncomfortable. If your eyes water, or you sweating and it melts off the second there is moisture in the air, but if it gets in your eye, it burns hella bad. My lashes are typically very long and thick but this stuff broke them, layer after layer, and thinned them out until I stopped using it. What a waste of money, I only give it 1 star cuz you can&#x27;t select 0 stars. The other thing, when I reached out to mirenesse and told them of my experience, the deleted my comment off their site. They weren&#x27;t hearing my request for refund, all in all this product was a nightmare.</li>
            <li> love it and i will buy it again but very expensive shipping....</li>
            <li> A true no smudge/flake mascara that holds it&#x27;s shape. Washing off is clean too, no charcoal mess. Lover price would be HELPFUL!!!!</li>
            <li> The best mascara ever-puts all other mascaras to shame.  Goes on smoothly and makes your lashes look extremely long.  I will never use a different mascara.</li>
            <li> Adds length and comes off well.</li>
