            <li>WITH, I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>I originally found Cortex at Marshalls and  TJMaxx and immediately fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>It works into your hair easily, letting you just run your fingers through your hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m going to try \\&quot;ENJOY Hair Care HAIR</li>
            <li>Cortex is a great deep conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really feel it was as amazing as others were saying about it.</li>
            <li>One of the main ingredients is vitamin b5 which is great however this product has  sodium laureth sulfate which is a detergent found in soaps and shampoos which know to remove the natural oils from the hair</li>
            <li>I like it very much because it keep my hair shiny and kept it nice and straight.</li>
            <li>anyone has any suggestions for something within the same price range and good quality please share.</li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>I love this mask - makes hair smooth and repairs at the same time.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair soft and its easy to use.</li>
            <li>This product made my hair feel so soft smooth and silky without and greasy feel.</li>
            <li>Please don&#x27;t buy this, so will be more left for me.</li>
            <li>I have 4b to 4c hair that gets dry very easily and as a result I experience a lot of breakage.</li>
            <li>So cheap it has what appears to be granulated plastic included in the consistency of cheap watered down hand lotion.</li>
            <li>It really works to help repair damaged hair.</li>
            <li>This stuff leaves my hair feeling very silky.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky about my hair</li>
            <li>Works really well with Cortex hair serum.</li>
            <li>I have tried other hair mask repair products all costing more than Cortex but end up throwing it out and reordering this product.</li>
            <li>Penetrates hair shaft from within not just coating externally like most conditions.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this Cortex international hair products for 5 years.</li>
            <li>I use it as a normal conditioner every 2 days.</li>
            <li>This stuff makes you feel like you have a new head of hair.</li>
            <li>unless the ingredients that I am trying to steer clear off are removed chances are I will not repurchase.</li>
            <li>but now that I been using it a while, it only really works for that day only.&lt;br</li>
            <li>that my natural hair like</li>

            <li> Just tried the Cortex mask as soon as. It was delivered. This product made my hair feel so soft smooth and silky without and greasy feel. It left no funky residue and it made my hair shine. I can&#x27;t wait to get my hair cut and use Cortex again.</li>
            <li> Love this brand. Penetrates hair shaft from within not just coating externally like most conditions.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this Cortex international hair products for 5 years. I&#x27;m hooked</li>
            <li> i need it for my wavy/curly hair now that I&#x27;m growing it. I use it 2 times a week and softens my hair nicely, cheapest one I found with great quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update: seems like they upped the price... it was $12.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update 2: i was very enthusiastic at first but now that I been using it a while, it only really works for that day only.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to try \\&quot;ENJOY Hair Care HAIR MASK\\&quot; and will review there once I use it.&lt;br /&gt;if anyone has any suggestions for something within the same price range and good quality please share.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I have tried other hair mask repair products all costing more than Cortex but end up throwing it out and reordering this product. I love it so much I have some sent to my Son&#x27;s home in Michigan so I will have it there when I visit. My daughter-in-law and granddaughter started using it now I have to make sure they still have some for my visit.</li>
            <li> This product change my hair after i destroy it with breach... Use use use I love it just both 4 more today love love love. :)</li>
            <li> I originally found Cortex at Marshalls and  TJMaxx and immediately fell in love with it.  I have very dry coarse hair that I color and chemically straighten.  Cortex is a great deep conditioner.  Sometimes, i put it on and leave for an hour then rinse and in between shampoos, I wet my hair in the shower and add a little conditioner and rinse.  It really works to help repair damaged hair.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT!!!! MADE MY HAIR FEEL AMAZING!!!! I HAVE DYED AND STRIPPED MY HAIR NUMEROUS TIMES....THIS PRODUCT HAS MADE MY HAIR SILKING AND SMOOTH! LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t buy this, so will be more left for me.</li>
            <li> This once a week mask helps hydrate and fortify damaged or color/heat treated hair. It smells fantastic and  has a wonderful feel. It works into your hair easily, letting you just run your fingers through your hair. I have curly hair and it&#x27;s hard to find a treatment where I can just run my fingers through to untangle the knots. Cortex Hair mask let&#x27;s you do just that. I recommend this product for all hair types.</li>
            <li> I like it very much because it keep my hair shiny and kept it nice and straight. I do recommend it. thank you</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair...a combination of under active thyroid, bleaching my hair, and living in the unrelenting sun of southern California. This stuff leaves my hair feeling very silky.</li>
            <li> i love the smell and the size. it is a good amount for the price. it does make my hair smoother and better.</li>
            <li> Yeah! Finally!!! I love this- This a quality product- I&#x27;m very picky about my hair products- this is my absolute all time favorite-!!!</li>
            <li> Great stuff.This stuff makes you feel like you have a new head of hair. Makes your hair behave beautifully. You must try!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this product and bought it thinking it would be something fabulous! It&#x27;s just a typical hair mask. My hair seemed a bit &amp;#34;Fly Away&amp;#34; after using it too. I didn&#x27;t really feel it was as amazing as others were saying about it.</li>
            <li> Best hair mask I&#x27;ve ever tried! Love the price too! You see the difference in your hair after just one use!</li>
            <li> Wife loves this product for her hair</li>
            <li> Awesome product, quick delivery</li>
            <li> I initially found this at Marshalls and later bought it on Amazon. I have 4b to 4c hair that gets dry very easily and as a result I experience a lot of breakage. After using this hair mask my breakage has significantly been reduced to maybe a few broken hairs here and there. So the product does what it says it would. One of the main ingredients is vitamin b5 which is great however this product has  sodium laureth sulfate which is a detergent found in soaps and shampoos which know to remove the natural oils from the hair an can leave the hair dry. To counter this I pre poo so that my hair does not get to dry then moisturize soon after using this product. This product also has 4 different parabens which is listed at the end of the ingredients list. Parabens are preservatives have been suspended to cause cancer. If these ingredients were not present in this hair mask I would give it 5 stars!!!! There are not many products that my natural hair like but it likes this but unless the ingredients that I am trying to steer clear off are removed chances are I will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> I love this more then the conditioner, my hair goes perfect every time I use it. I recommend this to everyone!!</li>
            <li> I bought it at TJ maxx and then I founf it here. I love this mask - makes hair smooth and repairs at the same time.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for five years, it&#x27;s wonderful. Makes your hair feel like cotton.</li>
            <li> I am OBSESSED with this stuff!!! Makes my hair sooooo soft. Like others that posted, I have also colored my hair a million times. I use it as a normal conditioner every 2 days. I also use the shampoo and conditioner. love &amp;lt;33</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE TRIED BIG BRAND NAMES, OVER THE COUNTER AND THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST IF NOT THE BEST, IT DOESN&#x27;T ONLY FEELS SILKY WHEN YOUR IN THE SHOWER, EVEN IF YOU RINSE AND RINSE, YOUR HAIR FEEL REPAIRED IN UNE USE, WITHOUT MAKING YOUR HAIR GO DOWN LIKE OTHERS REPAIR FORMULA. AND TO MY SURPRISE THE SHINE IT LEAVES YOU WITH, I LOVE IT, I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Makes your hair soft and its easy to use. I like to leave mine on longer but super great product. Feels very healthy and no frizz.  Works really well with Cortex hair serum. Its a must have product for me.</li>
            <li> Terrible product.  Do not order.  So cheap it has what appears to be granulated plastic included in the consistency of cheap watered down hand lotion.</li>
            <li> I use the cortex shampoo and conditioner as well as the hair mask. If you are looking for volume this product should be your choice. I have used other shampoos in the past that will give my hair volume, but they will dry my hair out used on a daily basis. I totally recommend this product.</li>
