            <li>I use to use the powder product but switched to this particular cleanser because, for the money, this lasts much longer!</li>

            <li>Also promotes new cell growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>(Male, 21) I have pretty sensitive skin and even if I were to use my Old Spice body wash to clean my face two days in a row, I would get very dry</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used so many different facial cleansers and this one wins, hands down!</li>
            <li>You can truly feel your entire body being nurtured by natural ingredients even after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For starters, the foam is made with natural ingredients (Water, Rice Bran, Collagen, Glycyrrhzia, Aloe, Seaweed, Chamomile, Coconut Oil, Honey, and Shikon Extract).  </li>
            <li>your hair and leave it silky soft.</li>
            <li>I use Retin-A, so my face can be sensitive to some cleansers, but not with this one.</li>

            <li>My skin feels completely clean and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I was a little turned off by the price, but when I realized that I am using half a pea size drop twice a day, it is totally worth the money!</li>

            <li> These products also have emotional aspects unlike the effects of harsh chemicals.</li>

            <li> A little does go a long way.  </li>
            <li> And, as other reviewers have commented, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m six months into my bottle and it has only gone down to about half way!</li>
            <li> I think I have found something after countless failed choices that finally works!</li>
            <li> Only thing is it sort of smells like oatmeal, which is not pleasant to me.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive and difficult skin.</li>
            <li> They tucked a little sample in with another product I ordered from them</li>
            <li> After just a few days, my skin cleared up and started glowing.  </li>
            <li> Half a pea size makes a handful (I have man hands...) of soap!    </li>
            <li> Their Facial Cleansing Foam doesn&#x27;t fail to disappoint.  </li>
            <li> but I was wrong.  </li>

            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!!! You need just a little tear drop to clean your face... it lathers up soooo well and leaves your skin smooth!  Has no fragrance at all (you could barely smell white rice) for those who are sensitive to smells.  Would highly recomend!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Komenuka Bijin makes some of the best beauty products I have ever tried.  Their Facial Cleansing Foam doesn&#x27;t fail to disappoint.  They tucked a little sample in with another product I ordered from them and my skin is still thanking me, all of these weeks later, after I used it.  For starters, the foam is made with natural ingredients (Water, Rice Bran, Collagen, Glycyrrhzia, Aloe, Seaweed, Chamomile, Coconut Oil, Honey, and Shikon Extract).  A little goes a long way and it is so creamy.  You just feel it cleansing and nurturing your skin.</li>
            <li> Superb quality: I think this tube will last at least 6 month, leathers so easily and you don&#x27;t need much to get skin soooo clean. It s not drying at all. Has no smell. Very natural ingredients. I think it has even out a bit the complexion.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.  After just a few days, my skin cleared up and started glowing.  I highly recommend Komenuka Bijin!</li>
            <li> This product is so soothing.  Removes make up easily, you don&#x27;t need too much to great a great lather. I really like Komenuka products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a week but already my skin looks better than it ever has! My face is clear and soft and the difference is definitely noticeable. I use this product with an exfoliating face brush once a day to remove my make-up at night. It cleans my skin really well but is extremely gentle, which is great for my sensitive skin. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell either, which I prefer. It basically smells like rice and even that scent disappears after rinsing. You really do only need a pea size amount (or less!) so don&#x27;t let the price deter you because it will last a really long time. Think of it as an investment for your face! It is soooo worth it.  UPDATE: I&#x27;ve been using this face wash daily since my initial review four years ago and I&#x27;m still in love with it. It is definitely on my can&#x27;t-live-without list!</li>
            <li> So Silky and Foamy you will want to use it all over! This is supposed to be a facial cleansing foam, but who is looking? If you run out of the body wash, this can be used and it only takes a small amount to deep cleanse and soothe the skin. The body wash doesn&#x27;t contain honey and this does, which makes it very appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are especially intriguing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fountain Water&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rice Bran&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Collagen&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Licorice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aloe&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seaweed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chamomile&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coconut Oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honey&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shikon Extract - herb with healing properties&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natural Vitamin E&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Squalene - natural oil absorbed easily by the skin and leaves no residue. Also promotes new cell growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frankly this is yummy! The scent is pleasant and mild. Using this all over makes you feel like a Japanese princess. Suddenly I was in the mood to read Japanese poetry. You know how it is with all the pressures of royal life. Sometimes you just need to get away and soothe your soul. Follow with the extraordinary Skin Care Cream and feel comforted and healed. These products also have emotional aspects unlike the effects of harsh chemicals. You can truly feel your entire body being nurtured by natural ingredients even after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. The shampoo and conditioner are also fabulous. They&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thicken your hair and leave it silky soft.</li>
            <li> I love Komenuka Bijin! I use this foaming cleanser with a soft facial cleansing brush and I am amazed at the results. My face just glows. Every single day whether I&#x27;m wearing makeup or not, I have someone compliment me at my work on how beautiful my skin is. I would (and do) recommend this product to anyone who wants beautiful skin. I was a little turned off by the price, but when I realized that I am using half a pea size drop twice a day, it is totally worth the money! I&#x27;m six months into my bottle and it has only gone down to about half way! A tiny bit goes a long way, so make sure that you don&#x27;t throw your money and this wonderful product down the drain. I&#x27;m telling you, BUY THIS STUFF! You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial cleanser I ever bought, this is great for all ages of skin and acne prones skin.</li>
            <li> Very natural, clean, gentle, doesn&#x27;t hurt the skin at all. I like it a lot!!! it&#x27;s about the best quality facial cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this face wash for years and it is the only thing my skin will tolerate. Highly recommend as it lasts forever</li>
            <li> I like the gentleness and quality of this product. It literally only takes half of a pearl size to do the job.  Even though it is exfoliating, it somehow moisturizers and does not strip my skin.</li>
            <li> A little does go a long way.  Nice and foamy, and does not dry out my (dry) skin.</li>
            <li> affordable and great for my skin</li>
            <li> Good cleansing cream. Just a dab is all that is needed.Foams up nicely ,cleans skin without feeling sticky like some cleansers</li>
            <li> I was somewhat hesitant to order this product but after reading the positive reviews decided to go for it.&lt;br /&gt;Throughout the years I have purchased many different face cleansers and figured this one wouldn&#x27;t be&lt;br /&gt;any better than the rest but I was wrong.  I love this product as it makes my face feel super soft and it&lt;br /&gt;has absolutely no fragrance which is extremely important to me.  I will definitely be ordering it again!</li>
            <li> Oh, my gosh! This stuff is SO good to your face! Really nice Ph balance to it!</li>
            <li> i love it. the only face wash that didn&#x27;t give me breakouts.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way and really cleanses the skin</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know. I think I have found something after countless failed choices that finally works! Very gentle and clean. Face becomes soft and smooth after using it. I have very sensitive and difficult skin. This thing does the trick. I&#x27;m grateful of it. And I&#x27;m proud that I made this good choice. :D</li>
            <li> Best face scrub I&#x27;ve ever used. Will definitely reorder!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Komenuka Bijin Facial Cleansing Foam for about a month now and am a fan. It&#x27;s very creamy and light and gives my face a nice silky feel, in a good way, without being too heavy. I use Retin-A, so my face can be sensitive to some cleansers, but not with this one. It&#x27;s very gentle. And, as other reviewers have commented, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Bubbles beautifully with a foaming net!  Smooth feeling while cleaning face, thoroughly cleansed feeling after usage!  I would highly recommend this product.  Half a pea size makes a handful (I have man hands...) of soap!    Only thing is it sort of smells like oatmeal, which is not pleasant to me.  That&#x27;s probably the rice bran; it isn&#x27;t a big deal though because if it doesn&#x27;t smell like a chemically created fragrance it&#x27;s most definitely better for your skin.    UPDATE:  After using this product twice a day for two weeks with DHC&#x27;s oil cleanser once a day my (combination skin) face is so dry it&#x27;s peeling.  Definitely use a moisturizer with this product.  Still love it and will buy it again-just have to use a moisturizer with it.    UPDATE:  Bottle lasted 7 months with use 2x a day.</li>
            <li> great for sensitive skin, great for acne-prone skin.  can be used year around, not very heavy or oily.  This is  not my last purchase.</li>
            <li> I love Komenuka Bijin!  Their facial cleansing products clean my skin better than any other product I have tried.  I use to use the powder product but switched to this particular cleanser because, for the money, this lasts much longer!</li>
            <li> I can feel that my face is really clean.</li>
            <li> (Male, 21) I have pretty sensitive skin and even if I were to use my Old Spice body wash to clean my face two days in a row, I would get very dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff only needs the tiniest squirt to lather completely and you can feel your skin is expholiated (whatever haha) after you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had consistent medium acne and this has absolutley helped clear it up (not 100% but i&#x27;ll take it for now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been using for almost a month i guess and have barely dented the bottle with use twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my sensitive skin i have yet to find a suuitable alternative.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me. I got breakout the next few days.</li>
            <li> Best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used.  Only one that makes my skin happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many different facial cleansers and this one wins, hands down! My skin feels completely clean and a little bit goes a long way. Well worth the price and the tube lasts for months, even using it 2-3 times a day! Excellent product! I will never buy a different cleanser again.</li>
