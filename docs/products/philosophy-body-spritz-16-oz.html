            <li> I love the smell of Amazing Grace. This does have a relatively strong alcohol scent to it, but I always get compliments when I wear it. Since it is not the actual perfume that is designed to stay on forever, I use either A LOT at one time, or carry it around with me and reapply it through out the day. Definitely a very clean smell.</li>
            <li> Great value!!! Came in a very timely matter!! It is my favorite scent for everydayðŸ˜ƒClean smelling!! Many compliments from othersðŸ’›</li>
            <li> I spray this on my back after my daily shower and this wonderful mist keeps my back from itching!  Beautiful fragrance too!</li>
            <li> I love  amazing grace, it smells so good. Great to use right after a shower. What a bargain at this price.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this!!!!!! Will be using it forever. I hope it stays. Everyone asks me what I am wearing all the time.</li>
            <li> It is NOT the Amazing Grace I know and love. I am so disappointed.  I had hoped the reviewers who said it had a chemical smell had different perceptions than I do, but they are absolutely right. Do not buy this. Total waste of money.  If I could give it 0 stars, I would.</li>
            <li> This product showed up on my mail box waaay faster than expected! I was very pleased and satisfied to find the product and pump in the box as described! I would definitely order from this vender in a heart beat!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for an east transaction!!</li>
            <li> love it......had some as a gift and wanted more....thanks for being there to help!!</li>
            <li> A great value and I would order from this seller again. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> My wife likes ,, so 5 stars...</li>
            <li> All I can say is, &amp;#34;where have you been all my life?!&amp;#34; I so pleased with how fast this came to my house. It is the biggest bottle I have ever seen and will last forever!! It smells great and would totally purchase this again!!!</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite perfume and body scent products come from this company.  She can&#x27;t stand most perfumes.  They make her sick.  But Philosophy Amazing Grace she tolerates very well.</li>
            <li> I know that others say the scent does not last. I believe this is a case where your sense of smell becomes immune (you cannot smell yourself, but other can). I have even had someone tell me my cell phone smells good! I constantly get comments about this scent and I have bought 3 of these in the last two years. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Perfect, just as advertised, arrived in a timely manner.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Love this product - such a gentle scent!</li>
            <li> This is my every day go to scent and I really live it. It is light- fresh and clean smelling like soap and water. It reminds me of fresh linen, spring breezes and its a pick-me-up scent too. It lasts quite awhile, especially if you spray both under and over clothes. A little pricey but that&#x27;s Philosophy for ya!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this bath spray... this is my second batch of it and I will buy again.  Very clean light floral scent that anyone would love!</li>
            <li> Great product &amp; price!</li>
            <li> Smells like Egyptian cotton.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Amazing Grace fragrance is lovely . However , I was disappointed with the strength of the body spritz . Not very long lasting . Will go for perfume next time , probably .</li>
