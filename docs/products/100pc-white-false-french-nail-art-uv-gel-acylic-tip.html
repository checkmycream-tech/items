            <li>The top just snaps of or you can just use a nail clipper.</li>
            <li>In order to get it off all you have to do its clip the top</li>
            <li>Hopefully I will be able to get the ones I wanted.</li>
            <li>these just sit on top.</li>
            <li>but i was able to do acrylics on my daughter so it worked out</li>

            <li>Looks like the picture, came on time, quality looks ok,</li>
            <li>love them  great easy way to have white tips</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure these are great, but for me they were just too short</li>
            <li>It is easy to hold and easy clean break.</li>
            <li>These are really cheap.</li>
            <li>All you do is put some Nail glue on it and put it on your nail, then just put on your regular top coat and your done!!</li>

            <li>simple for quick short nails to work with, specially when woking on rough stuff.  </li>
            <li>While I have never used these before, I found them simple and easy to use after watching a few youtube videos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can not use these to extend from your natural nail as they are not sturdy enough and will bend and break off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I received tips that were long flimsy clear and stiletto shaped.</li>

            <li> I do my own nails at home and save a ton. I but the tips, and the glue and acrylic powder. Takes me about an hour and lasts 2-3 weeks depending on how diligent I am with wearing my gloves when doing housework.</li>
            <li> these are tiny little tips, i had a very hard time applying them, one drop of glue and id be stuck to my nail and the tip stuck on my finger....not the nail</li>
            <li> I used with my gel polish and maybe the glue I used wasn&#x27;t strong enough but they started lifting about about the second day.  I used a brush on glue.  May try with a different glue next time.  Was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> These are really cheap. You Def get what you pay for. I can&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li> Love them. I don&#x27;t have to cut them at all perfect length. They are a little thick but lasted two weeks with acrylics.</li>
            <li> Personally, I am pretty new to the nail world.  I bought these on a whim after seeing they retail for $18 in a beauty store.  How can you beat $3 with shipping even if you have a wait a month?  While I have never used these before, I found them simple and easy to use after watching a few youtube videos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does not come with glue so I bought a dollar tube of nail glue.  Overall, these were super easy to apply.  I did have a few pop off due to not having enough glue right in the beginning.  After trying again, no problems.  Of course after I applied them, I was informed that you should file where you are gluing the tip on to rough up the surface.  This helps the tip last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After applying the tip, I painted the rest of my nail with multiple clear gel top coats.  This lasted for just over two weeks with no problems.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! It works so good and is easy to apply. All you do is put some Nail glue on it and put it on your nail, then just put on your regular top coat and your done!! The top just snaps of or you can just use a nail clipper. In order to get it off all you have to do its clip the top and it will fall off!it is also very cheap for very good quality.. Only $3.00!!</li>
            <li> I ordered these a month ago. It took forever for this item to arrive....which is understandable because it came from the other side of the world. I was so excited to get these tips only to open it and be disappointed because it was not the item in the picture shown. I received tips that were long flimsy clear and stiletto shaped. Very disappointed. Emailed the seller. Hopefully I will be able to get the ones I wanted. Only then will I change how many stars this deserves.</li>
            <li> not real nail tips. . its just the white part. tips are supposed to make ur nails longer. these just sit on top.</li>
            <li> These are not very sturdy.  They only last when you place them on already existing nails that have grown out.  You can not use these to extend from your natural nail as they are not sturdy enough and will bend and break off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the tab concept.  It is easy to hold and easy clean break.</li>
            <li> Arrived as stated. Good quality and easy to use. Recommend this seller. Will purchase again! Box helps maintain this product for storage.</li>
            <li> Didnt know it was for kids but i was able to do acrylics on my daughter so it worked out</li>
            <li> love them  great easy way to have white tips a cheaper less in  time consuming way</li>
            <li> These tips are way too thin. They break super easy. Guess I got to stick to buying acrylics in person. I will never buy these again. Also they are very short. Not what I was expecting at all.</li>
            <li> simple for quick short nails to work with, specially when woking on rough stuff.  and special request.  glad i&#x27;ve found these.</li>
            <li> Looks like the picture, came on time, quality looks ok, I haven&#x27;t used it as yet so I don&#x27;t know how durable they are if it splits or anything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure these are great, but for me they were just too short but they seemed good quality. Didn&#x27;t work for me though</li>
            <li> they r very small and r not what i thought they were. i can not use them at all. was not happy with product</li>
