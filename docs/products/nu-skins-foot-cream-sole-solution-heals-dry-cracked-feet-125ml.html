            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>one of the better foot cream products I have used.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products that claimed to cure this.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I wasn &#x27;t quite sure if the foot cream would work as well as the reviews had indicated</li>
            <li>CANT SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THIS WONDERFUL PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it does not have a greasy feel to it, more like a motion.</li>
            <li>It works better than my prescription cream.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Over the years, I&#x27;ve used many products such as this, and this is the best non-oily/non-greasy one I&#x27;ve found yet.</li>
            <li>However the cream I&#x27;ve been using for years is much better and cheaper.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but it isn&#x27;t a miracle lotion</li>
            <li>This product was recommended by my nail salon, but for much more money.</li>
            <li>Did not help any more than lotion.</li>
            <li>Will order more.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS CREAM.</li>
            <li>According to him Flexitol Heel Balm works a lot better.</li>
            <li>I first tried this from a nail shop and loved it</li>
            <li>If you have dry feet, cracked heels, or calluses, then this is the PERFECT lotion for you.  </li>
            <li>This is the best cream for dry and cracked heals.</li>
            <li>It clears rough skin and makes your feet look wonderful.  </li>
            <li>This is a great cream for your feet, my feet feel so soft and silky when I use it.</li>
            <li>Love this foot cream....makes my feet feel smooth</li>
            <li>Good price and fast shipping, will buy again.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much</li>
            <li>Honestly, this stuff was such a pleasant change - a product that actually works, and works GREAT.</li>
            <li>The cream is ok, pretty good, I gave it a try as my nail place recommended it but sells at a higher price.  </li>
            <li>Love the price and quick shipment</li>
            <li>I gave it 3 stars and not lower as the cream is pretty good and overall a good product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing to go to bed feeling your feet so soft and smooth unlike a sand paper!</li>
            <li>After two applications I saw a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>It is awesome and works in a few days -</li>
            <li>This product works great for my heals, it has been one of the only ones that has and would recommend it to anyone with sore cracked heals.</li>
            <li>Non-greasy or shiny, you don&#x27;t have to wear socks with this treatment, and can enjoy sandals immediately.</li>
            <li>I went from wood chipper, cavernous cracked heels to smooth, healing heels.  </li>
            <li>Wife uses it all the time and work fantastic</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for a month, and my heels feel so smooth.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Rubs on smoothly.</li>
            <li>The texture is smooth but not greasy.</li>
            <li>My feet were so smooth.  </li>
            <li>This really does work amazingly.  </li>
            <li>After using this product for a week, my feet are so smooth.  </li>
            <li>The foot cream feels light going on......not sticky and gooey like some foot creams.  </li>
            <li>This cream is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>I have used it daily for about 2 years now and have had great results.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works!!!</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s just the first night!!</li>
            <li>My feet look and feel great as long as I remember to use it every night (no socks needed).</li>
            <li>Love this product, and it does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li>This lotion is worth the money!</li>
            <li>For the first time in years I was able to skip a week at the pedicurist.</li>
            <li>my beautician by buying it at her shop, but the savings buying on Amazon are significant.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for less than a week and the difference is incredible.  </li>
            <li>Non-greasy formula, absorbs quickly and leaves my feet smooth - as if I&#x27;ve just had a luxurious pedicure.</li>
            <li>great for dry hands.</li>
            <li>This is definitely one of the best and comes at a very reasonable price considering that you don&#x27;t need to apply much each time.</li>
            <li>Try AHAVA from the Dead Sea minerals, foot cream &amp;#34;mud&amp;#34; very intense moisturizer, in fact all AHAVA products are superb, I will continue with my products and will not buy this cream again, and will not buy from this seller again.  </li>
            <li>Amazing makes your feet extremely soft.</li>
            <li>This is amazing, after I get a pedicure I rub this in every night to keep my feet feeling soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in the pool most of the day and this product really makes your feet feel soooo silky.</li>
            <li>Only tried it once, but it makes my feet feel good.</li>
            <li>It has a refreshing scent and is very moisturizing without being greasy.  </li>
            <li>Love it and it REALLY works well.</li>
            <li>I wear sandals 90% of the time and my feet are now soft and look nice.</li>
            <li>Leaves your feet feeling nice and soft without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>Its good and works for my skin better than others though expensive but really good.</li>
            <li>Works good to start, but does not last.</li>
            <li>This is by FAR the best thing on the market for dry cracked feet.</li>
            <li>Best I have found...but necessary to use daily...</li>
            <li>Awesome product, fantastic on all dry skin but especially calloused feet.</li>
            <li>Super foot cream...can use for hands too.</li>
            <li>I live in az and walk around barefoot most of the time..</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s absorbed quickly with no greasy residue.  </li>
            <li>The wonderful thing is - my dry, slightly cracked heels got better after 2 days and now they look marvellous for strappy sandals.</li>
            <li>I saw amazing result after only 3 DAYS!</li>
            <li>He charged me $25.00, but felt it was worth $100.00 if it helped my feet.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny</li>
            <li>Well worth it.  </li>
            <li>Love it so far.</li>
            <li>I figured it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li>It is completely worth the cost.  </li>
            <li>Worth the $$.</li>
            <li>Does not leave a greasy feeling and is absorbed by the skin.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>and YES I was pleasantly surprised and love the product.</li>
            <li>It is worth the money.  </li>
            <li>The lines are fading my feet feel soft :) I use as directed.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use it every day like the others, so it is economical also.</li>
            <li>I began using this product right after getting a pedicure</li>
            <li>The comments were right...</li>
            <li>I will not buy from this seller again, it is offered at a lower price from a different seller who states the true weight, I ordered from this one because I thought I was getting a lot more cream.</li>
            <li>After using this product, my feet are very smooth and not a single crack.  </li>
            <li>My feet are  super soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Cream got my feet smooth and soft quite quickly after being cracked.  </li>
            <li>It came super fast and the cream does not leave</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping</li>
            <li>This is a good tip, because you don&#x27;t get a lot in the first place, so you don&#x27;t want to waste it.</li>
            <li>Just try it, literally the first moment you use it</li>
            <li>when I get a pedicure, that is a first.</li>
            <li>this product really works!</li>
            <li>After just the first time using it</li>
            <li>They are smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>My feet are so smooth and soft now.</li>
            <li>Really helps keeping calloused feet in check!</li>
            <li>Slimy at first</li>
            <li>It did take me almost 3 weeks to see the first difference since I didn&#x27;t want to use sox.</li>
            <li>so my feet were pretty well exfoliated.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only thing that keeps my heels healthy and uncracked.</li>
            <li>and if when it was gone, if my feet weren&#x27;t better, he&#x27;d give me my money back.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>I first tried it when I had a pedicure and had to find it.  </li>
            <li>My feet, including my heels are smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t remember the last time I was so pleased with a beauty product.</li>
            <li>First exposure was when I received a pedicure at a salon.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I finally tried the product.  </li>
            <li>I first bought this product at my nail salon but found it on line cheaper.  </li>
            <li>I use it every night, keeps my feet feeling smooth and soft instead of like sand paper.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what my feet were needing.</li>
            <li>I normally try each new product with skepticism since so many did nothing but make my feet greasy without absorbing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice for any type of dry skin as it hydrates fast and well.</li>
            <li>Just plain Petroleum Jelly/Vaseline on your soles perform equally good.</li>
            <li>it is a nice change from the other creams i have tried</li>
            <li>I love this product, I have severely dry heels and have tried every product out there, this is the first one that does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I tried olive oil, Vaseline, and pretty much any remedy I could buy in the store or order on line.</li>
            <li>I garden in sandals, and love walking around with either sandals on or barefoot, so my heels were always cracked and dry and sore...</li>
            <li>Most of the cracking has disappeared, and what&#x27;s left look like normal skin.</li>
            <li>Even the toughest dry skin around the tops of my toenails were moisturized and healthy.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m not sure that feet in the state that the &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; picture depicted would actually attain a really soft, smooth state, but I CAN vouch for it KEEPING my feet in GREAT condition.  </li>
            <li>When used regularly, it makes dry, rough, cracked heels soft, supple and much more attractive.  </li>
            <li>Smooth and supple sole skin, no longer a tendency to split or crack.</li>
            <li>This really works.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>This is one product that really works.  </li>
            <li>Very moisturizing cream for feet, and</li>
            <li>This foot cream really does work when used as directed.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>Thanks for making this.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>This cream really works.</li>
            <li>This cream really does help keep feet</li>
            <li>Its very soothing and keeps my feet hydrated all day.</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable as well.</li>
            <li>Within a couple of days of putting on this cream, my heels have become much softer.</li>
            <li>This product really delivered.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>but this really works.</li>
            <li>Works really well on hands also.</li>
            <li>Nu Skin&#x27;s Foot Cream really works.  </li>
            <li>I really like this cream.</li>
            <li>It absolutely Works</li>
            <li>Shipping arrived fast.  </li>
            <li>That really helps.</li>
            <li>This time, after two weeks of using Epoch Sole Solution, my heels were still smooth, almost as if I had just had a pedicure.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li>It is a non-sticky foot cream which doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent.</li>
            <li>I really like the moisturizing power of this product.  </li>
            <li>It really changed my life.</li>
            <li>I really need something that works, I am on my feet a lot.</li>
            <li>My heels of my feet are very calloused and this cream is very helpful.</li>
            <li>I love how fast it sinks in and stays put.</li>
            <li>and my feet are soft!!!</li>
            <li>I highly highly recommend to anyone with the slightest to the most severe dry feet!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really almost magic compared with all the other products that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>The lack of 5 stars is only because the price is a bit high but after a few weeks my heels look great and the pain is gone.  </li>
            <li>I have used many, many, foot lotions, creams and products over the past ten years.</li>
            <li>Better than any other product I have tried.</li>
            <li>let it sink in a bit....and then put on clean white socks.  </li>
            <li>This product was non-greasy, yet still able to absorb down to the real problem.</li>
            <li>I would have never believed how fast it would smooth my dry cracked heels if I didn&#x27;t see it myself.  </li>
            <li>I live in the south where flip flop season is about 8 - 9 months out of the year!</li>
            <li>They are like new feet for me!</li>
            <li>you have new feet in three days!</li>
            <li>Nothing I tried worked very well - I&#x27;d have mild relief, but no major change.</li>
            <li>I was introduced to Sole Solution last year and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>ONE APPLICATION WAS ENOUGH TO GET MY FEET SMOOTH AND SOFT.</li>
            <li>I have tried many foot creams and this is the only one that actually heals the cracks in my feet.  </li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this foot cream.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>but the cost was high.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>The cream itself was highly effective.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I add a little more to my hands and rub in.</li>
            <li>If you use it morning and night (a little dab will do you), you will love the results.</li>
            <li>He was skeptical about this cream even with all the great reviews.</li>
            <li>It really makes your feet feel soft if you use it twice a day, morning and night.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different foot creams and balms over the years to address my dry skin issue particularly on my heels.</li>
            <li>So thick and creamy, dries nice, no greasy residue.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten into my 30&#x27;s, my heels dry out a lot more now, even with regular pedicures.  </li>
            <li>Only a small amount is needed and your feet will become smooth and STAY SMOOTH.</li>
            <li>I live in Arizona where we wear sandals 12 months a year</li>
            <li>I live in Chicago, IL, and the weather varies.</li>
            <li>my heels are super smooth and the trouble callous, with a deep crack is almost gone!</li>
            <li>I have tried various creams that claim to heal and smooth cracked heels but this one actually works.  </li>
            <li>Soft feet!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend getting a pedi first, then using this daily for maintenance.</li>
            <li>His feet are now soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom!</li>
            <li>Was testing other ones at the same time and found two that worked better.</li>
            <li>I love the Nu Skins Foot Cream Sole Solution - it really works on dried, cracked skin on soles of feet</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a number of foot creams and this one is clearly a winner.</li>
            <li>I applied it every day after my shower and it really does keep my feet soft and it keeps the white scaly stuff at bay.</li>
            <li>This foot cream had her feet as soft as I&#x27;ve seen them in the 18 years of marriage, in a matter of a week.  </li>
            <li>When I use this cream, my heels immediately become soft.  </li>
            <li>Really does work,I use it after I pumus my feet!Finally getting my feet back to</li>
            <li>It leaves your feet feeling Baby Soft.</li>
            <li>I actually use it as a night cream which works really well.</li>
            <li>I have salons comment on how soft my feet are</li>
            <li>no they are much smoother, especially if I use consistantly</li>
            <li>It completely healed my cracked soles.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My feet feel so soft.</li>
            <li>My cracked heels have healed and my feet remain soft day and night.</li>
            <li>but so far no cracked heels.  </li>
            <li>this cream has made my heals of my feet and all over my feet feel soft again.  </li>
            <li>My heels are getting soft and the cracks are healing.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t go that far.</li>
            <li>Finally, something that really works on my feet.</li>
            <li>so I decided to buy it directly from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Really, I haven&#x27;t had to go back for one since.</li>
            <li>It has made my feet so silky soft.  </li>
            <li>Maybe not so good for his business to tell his secret!</li>
            <li>I am usually skeptical of company or product names that are intentionally misspelled (Nu vs. New), but I am very glad that I gave this one a shot.</li>
            <li>lol no more cracked heels with dirt trapped in the middle.  </li>
            <li>I usually try to put this on twice a day, but once is perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>It has a very subtle smell, goes on nicely and immediately penetrates the skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll order online, and I feel a little badly not &amp;#34;supporting&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>No cheese grater, and she hardly had to scrub at all, my skin was that soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It really works to soften dry and or cracked feet and is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>My pedicurist started carrying this in her salon, and the marketing materials had &amp;#34;before and after&amp;#34; photos of someone with really horrid cracked and dry heels (before)</li>
            <li>Not only are my feet soft but my 63 year old hands are too.</li>
            <li>but it dries well into the skin and really moisturizes rough feet into soft kissable feet.</li>
            <li>I want to point out that before I started to use it, I had a pedicure that day, so I can only vouch that it KEPT my heels soft, not that it MADE them soft.  </li>
            <li>major results already.</li>
            <li>After less than a week of consistent use my skin was almost completely healed.</li>
            <li>Use just a small amount of this on your heels at night and NO more dry heels, also great for hands.  </li>
            <li>This is the first lotion I have ever found that took my dried cracked heels and made them baby soft!</li>
            <li>My wife has tried everything under the sun with little success.  </li>
            <li>Its a little  pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other, less pricey, products, but this one is worth the money and really works.</li>
            <li>It really works - as long as one uses it regularly.  </li>
            <li>Barely any smell or odor</li>
            <li>I would rub in the extra after treating my feet and after a couple days noticed how soft and supple the backs of my hands had become.  </li>
            <li>My heals were very cracked and rough.  </li>
            <li>it has really helped with calluses and rough spots.  </li>
            <li>I am just using regular foot lotion now, but that was not working for me until I used this product every night to get my feet back to normal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using sole solutions for 9 months and will continue to use it since I&#x27;ve found that no other product works as well.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone with dry, cracked heels (or elbows, who says you can only use it on feet?).</li>
            <li>Put on soles of feet and feet stay soft all day long.  </li>
            <li>I had a really dry foot, just the left one, and this stuff brought it back to normal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had dry, cracked heels all my adult life - until I found this.  </li>
            <li>She suffered from dry feet but these made her feet baby soft.</li>
            <li>still some dry skin, but a marked improvement.</li>
            <li>it make my feet sooooo soft that I can belive that my feet are like these after have my feet soo dry</li>
            <li>soft and dry skin on feet is repaired almost overnight.  </li>
            <li>just put a small amount on evening and morning and the dried, cracking, hurting heels are gone and replaced by lovely skin.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> I love this foot cream.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many creams and this one beats them all.</li>
            <li> You will love it.</li>
            <li> After a month, I can&#x27;t squeeze any more out of the container.</li>
            <li> Will buy more.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> one of the better foot cream products I have used.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products that claimed to cure this.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I wasn &#x27;t quite sure if the foot cream would work as well as the reviews had indicated</li>
            <li> CANT SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THIS WONDERFUL PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it does not have a greasy feel to it, more like a motion.</li>
            <li> It works better than my prescription cream.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Over the years, I&#x27;ve used many products such as this, and this is the best non-oily/non-greasy one I&#x27;ve found yet.</li>
            <li> However the cream I&#x27;ve been using for years is much better and cheaper.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but it isn&#x27;t a miracle lotion</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my nail salon, but for much more money.</li>
            <li> Did not help any more than lotion.</li>
            <li> Will order more.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS CREAM.</li>
            <li> According to him Flexitol Heel Balm works a lot better.</li>
            <li> I first tried this from a nail shop and loved it</li>
            <li> If you have dry feet, cracked heels, or calluses, then this is the PERFECT lotion for you.  </li>
            <li> This is the best cream for dry and cracked heals.</li>
            <li> It clears rough skin and makes your feet look wonderful.  </li>
            <li> This is a great cream for your feet, my feet feel so soft and silky when I use it.</li>
            <li> Love this foot cream....makes my feet feel smooth</li>
            <li> Good price and fast shipping, will buy again.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much</li>
            <li> Honestly, this stuff was such a pleasant change - a product that actually works, and works GREAT.</li>
            <li> The cream is ok, pretty good, I gave it a try as my nail place recommended it but sells at a higher price.  </li>
            <li> Love the price and quick shipment</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars and not lower as the cream is pretty good and overall a good product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing to go to bed feeling your feet so soft and smooth unlike a sand paper!</li>
            <li> After two applications I saw a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> It is awesome and works in a few days -</li>
            <li> This product works great for my heals, it has been one of the only ones that has and would recommend it to anyone with sore cracked heals.</li>
            <li> Non-greasy or shiny, you don&#x27;t have to wear socks with this treatment, and can enjoy sandals immediately.</li>
            <li> I went from wood chipper, cavernous cracked heels to smooth, healing heels.  </li>
            <li> Wife uses it all the time and work fantastic</li>
            <li> Fantastic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a month, and my heels feel so smooth.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Rubs on smoothly.</li>
            <li> The texture is smooth but not greasy.</li>
            <li> My feet were so smooth.  </li>
            <li> This really does work amazingly.  </li>
            <li> After using this product for a week, my feet are so smooth.  </li>
            <li> The foot cream feels light going on......not sticky and gooey like some foot creams.  </li>
            <li> This cream is fabulous.  </li>
            <li> I have used it daily for about 2 years now and have had great results.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really works!!!</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s just the first night!!</li>
            <li> My feet look and feel great as long as I remember to use it every night (no socks needed).</li>
            <li> Love this product, and it does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li> This lotion is worth the money!</li>
            <li> For the first time in years I was able to skip a week at the pedicurist.</li>
            <li> my beautician by buying it at her shop, but the savings buying on Amazon are significant.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for less than a week and the difference is incredible.  </li>
            <li> Non-greasy formula, absorbs quickly and leaves my feet smooth - as if I&#x27;ve just had a luxurious pedicure.</li>
            <li> great for dry hands.</li>
            <li> This is definitely one of the best and comes at a very reasonable price considering that you don&#x27;t need to apply much each time.</li>
            <li> Try AHAVA from the Dead Sea minerals, foot cream &amp;#34;mud&amp;#34; very intense moisturizer, in fact all AHAVA products are superb, I will continue with my products and will not buy this cream again, and will not buy from this seller again.  </li>
            <li> Amazing makes your feet extremely soft.</li>
            <li> This is amazing, after I get a pedicure I rub this in every night to keep my feet feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the pool most of the day and this product really makes your feet feel soooo silky.</li>
            <li> Only tried it once, but it makes my feet feel good.</li>
            <li> It has a refreshing scent and is very moisturizing without being greasy.  </li>
            <li> Love it and it REALLY works well.</li>
            <li> I wear sandals 90% of the time and my feet are now soft and look nice.</li>
            <li> Leaves your feet feeling nice and soft without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> Its good and works for my skin better than others though expensive but really good.</li>
            <li> Works good to start, but does not last.</li>
            <li> This is by FAR the best thing on the market for dry cracked feet.</li>
            <li> Best I have found...but necessary to use daily...</li>
            <li> Awesome product, fantastic on all dry skin but especially calloused feet.</li>
            <li> Super foot cream...can use for hands too.</li>
            <li> I live in az and walk around barefoot most of the time..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s absorbed quickly with no greasy residue.  </li>
            <li> The wonderful thing is - my dry, slightly cracked heels got better after 2 days and now they look marvellous for strappy sandals.</li>
            <li> I saw amazing result after only 3 DAYS!</li>
            <li> He charged me $25.00, but felt it was worth $100.00 if it helped my feet.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny</li>
            <li> Well worth it.  </li>
            <li> Love it so far.</li>
            <li> I figured it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li> It is completely worth the cost.  </li>
            <li> Worth the $$.</li>
            <li> Does not leave a greasy feeling and is absorbed by the skin.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> and YES I was pleasantly surprised and love the product.</li>
            <li> It is worth the money.  </li>
            <li> The lines are fading my feet feel soft :) I use as directed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use it every day like the others, so it is economical also.</li>
            <li> I began using this product right after getting a pedicure</li>
            <li> The comments were right...</li>
            <li> I will not buy from this seller again, it is offered at a lower price from a different seller who states the true weight, I ordered from this one because I thought I was getting a lot more cream.</li>
            <li> After using this product, my feet are very smooth and not a single crack.  </li>
            <li> My feet are  super soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Cream got my feet smooth and soft quite quickly after being cracked.  </li>
            <li> It came super fast and the cream does not leave</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping</li>
            <li> This is a good tip, because you don&#x27;t get a lot in the first place, so you don&#x27;t want to waste it.</li>
            <li> Just try it, literally the first moment you use it</li>
            <li> when I get a pedicure, that is a first.</li>
            <li> this product really works!</li>
            <li> After just the first time using it</li>
            <li> They are smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> My feet are so smooth and soft now.</li>
            <li> Really helps keeping calloused feet in check!</li>
            <li> Slimy at first</li>
            <li> It did take me almost 3 weeks to see the first difference since I didn&#x27;t want to use sox.</li>
            <li> so my feet were pretty well exfoliated.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only thing that keeps my heels healthy and uncracked.</li>
            <li> and if when it was gone, if my feet weren&#x27;t better, he&#x27;d give me my money back.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I first tried it when I had a pedicure and had to find it.  </li>
            <li> My feet, including my heels are smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t remember the last time I was so pleased with a beauty product.</li>
            <li> First exposure was when I received a pedicure at a salon.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I finally tried the product.  </li>
            <li> I first bought this product at my nail salon but found it on line cheaper.  </li>
            <li> I use it every night, keeps my feet feeling smooth and soft instead of like sand paper.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what my feet were needing.</li>
            <li> I normally try each new product with skepticism since so many did nothing but make my feet greasy without absorbing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also nice for any type of dry skin as it hydrates fast and well.</li>
            <li> Just plain Petroleum Jelly/Vaseline on your soles perform equally good.</li>
            <li> it is a nice change from the other creams i have tried</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have severely dry heels and have tried every product out there, this is the first one that does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I tried olive oil, Vaseline, and pretty much any remedy I could buy in the store or order on line.</li>
            <li> I garden in sandals, and love walking around with either sandals on or barefoot, so my heels were always cracked and dry and sore...</li>
            <li> Most of the cracking has disappeared, and what&#x27;s left look like normal skin.</li>
            <li> Even the toughest dry skin around the tops of my toenails were moisturized and healthy.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not sure that feet in the state that the &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; picture depicted would actually attain a really soft, smooth state, but I CAN vouch for it KEEPING my feet in GREAT condition.  </li>
            <li> When used regularly, it makes dry, rough, cracked heels soft, supple and much more attractive.  </li>
            <li> Smooth and supple sole skin, no longer a tendency to split or crack.</li>
            <li> This really works.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> This is one product that really works.  </li>
            <li> Very moisturizing cream for feet, and</li>
            <li> This foot cream really does work when used as directed.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Thanks for making this.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> This cream really works.</li>
            <li> This cream really does help keep feet</li>
            <li> Its very soothing and keeps my feet hydrated all day.</li>
            <li> The price was reasonable as well.</li>
            <li> Within a couple of days of putting on this cream, my heels have become much softer.</li>
            <li> This product really delivered.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> but this really works.</li>
            <li> Works really well on hands also.</li>
            <li> Nu Skin&#x27;s Foot Cream really works.  </li>
            <li> I really like this cream.</li>
            <li> It absolutely Works</li>
            <li> Shipping arrived fast.  </li>
            <li> That really helps.</li>
            <li> This time, after two weeks of using Epoch Sole Solution, my heels were still smooth, almost as if I had just had a pedicure.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li> It is a non-sticky foot cream which doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent.</li>
            <li> I really like the moisturizing power of this product.  </li>
            <li> It really changed my life.</li>
            <li> I really need something that works, I am on my feet a lot.</li>
            <li> My heels of my feet are very calloused and this cream is very helpful.</li>
            <li> I love how fast it sinks in and stays put.</li>
            <li> and my feet are soft!!!</li>
            <li> I highly highly recommend to anyone with the slightest to the most severe dry feet!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really almost magic compared with all the other products that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The lack of 5 stars is only because the price is a bit high but after a few weeks my heels look great and the pain is gone.  </li>
            <li> I have used many, many, foot lotions, creams and products over the past ten years.</li>
            <li> Better than any other product I have tried.</li>
            <li> let it sink in a bit....and then put on clean white socks.  </li>
            <li> This product was non-greasy, yet still able to absorb down to the real problem.</li>
            <li> I would have never believed how fast it would smooth my dry cracked heels if I didn&#x27;t see it myself.  </li>
            <li> I live in the south where flip flop season is about 8 - 9 months out of the year!</li>
            <li> They are like new feet for me!</li>
            <li> you have new feet in three days!</li>
            <li> Nothing I tried worked very well - I&#x27;d have mild relief, but no major change.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to Sole Solution last year and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> ONE APPLICATION WAS ENOUGH TO GET MY FEET SMOOTH AND SOFT.</li>
            <li> I have tried many foot creams and this is the only one that actually heals the cracks in my feet.  </li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this foot cream.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> but the cost was high.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> The cream itself was highly effective.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I add a little more to my hands and rub in.</li>
            <li> If you use it morning and night (a little dab will do you), you will love the results.</li>
            <li> He was skeptical about this cream even with all the great reviews.</li>
            <li> It really makes your feet feel soft if you use it twice a day, morning and night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different foot creams and balms over the years to address my dry skin issue particularly on my heels.</li>
            <li> So thick and creamy, dries nice, no greasy residue.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten into my 30&#x27;s, my heels dry out a lot more now, even with regular pedicures.  </li>
            <li> Only a small amount is needed and your feet will become smooth and STAY SMOOTH.</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona where we wear sandals 12 months a year</li>
            <li> I live in Chicago, IL, and the weather varies.</li>
            <li> my heels are super smooth and the trouble callous, with a deep crack is almost gone!</li>
            <li> I have tried various creams that claim to heal and smooth cracked heels but this one actually works.  </li>
            <li> Soft feet!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend getting a pedi first, then using this daily for maintenance.</li>
            <li> His feet are now soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom!</li>
            <li> Was testing other ones at the same time and found two that worked better.</li>
            <li> I love the Nu Skins Foot Cream Sole Solution - it really works on dried, cracked skin on soles of feet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of foot creams and this one is clearly a winner.</li>
            <li> I applied it every day after my shower and it really does keep my feet soft and it keeps the white scaly stuff at bay.</li>
            <li> This foot cream had her feet as soft as I&#x27;ve seen them in the 18 years of marriage, in a matter of a week.  </li>
            <li> When I use this cream, my heels immediately become soft.  </li>
            <li> Really does work,I use it after I pumus my feet!Finally getting my feet back to</li>
            <li> It leaves your feet feeling Baby Soft.</li>
            <li> I actually use it as a night cream which works really well.</li>
            <li> I have salons comment on how soft my feet are</li>
            <li> no they are much smoother, especially if I use consistantly</li>
            <li> It completely healed my cracked soles.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My feet feel so soft.</li>
            <li> My cracked heels have healed and my feet remain soft day and night.</li>
            <li> but so far no cracked heels.  </li>
            <li> this cream has made my heals of my feet and all over my feet feel soft again.  </li>
            <li> My heels are getting soft and the cracks are healing.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t go that far.</li>
            <li> Finally, something that really works on my feet.</li>
            <li> so I decided to buy it directly from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Really, I haven&#x27;t had to go back for one since.</li>
            <li> It has made my feet so silky soft.  </li>
            <li> Maybe not so good for his business to tell his secret!</li>
            <li> I am usually skeptical of company or product names that are intentionally misspelled (Nu vs. New), but I am very glad that I gave this one a shot.</li>
            <li> lol no more cracked heels with dirt trapped in the middle.  </li>
            <li> I usually try to put this on twice a day, but once is perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> It has a very subtle smell, goes on nicely and immediately penetrates the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll order online, and I feel a little badly not &amp;#34;supporting&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> No cheese grater, and she hardly had to scrub at all, my skin was that soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It really works to soften dry and or cracked feet and is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> My pedicurist started carrying this in her salon, and the marketing materials had &amp;#34;before and after&amp;#34; photos of someone with really horrid cracked and dry heels (before)</li>
            <li> Not only are my feet soft but my 63 year old hands are too.</li>
            <li> but it dries well into the skin and really moisturizes rough feet into soft kissable feet.</li>
            <li> I want to point out that before I started to use it, I had a pedicure that day, so I can only vouch that it KEPT my heels soft, not that it MADE them soft.  </li>
            <li> major results already.</li>
            <li> After less than a week of consistent use my skin was almost completely healed.</li>
            <li> Use just a small amount of this on your heels at night and NO more dry heels, also great for hands.  </li>
            <li> This is the first lotion I have ever found that took my dried cracked heels and made them baby soft!</li>
            <li> My wife has tried everything under the sun with little success.  </li>
            <li> Its a little  pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other, less pricey, products, but this one is worth the money and really works.</li>
            <li> It really works - as long as one uses it regularly.  </li>
            <li> Barely any smell or odor</li>
            <li> I would rub in the extra after treating my feet and after a couple days noticed how soft and supple the backs of my hands had become.  </li>
            <li> My heals were very cracked and rough.  </li>
            <li> it has really helped with calluses and rough spots.  </li>
            <li> I am just using regular foot lotion now, but that was not working for me until I used this product every night to get my feet back to normal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using sole solutions for 9 months and will continue to use it since I&#x27;ve found that no other product works as well.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone with dry, cracked heels (or elbows, who says you can only use it on feet?).</li>
            <li> Put on soles of feet and feet stay soft all day long.  </li>
            <li> I had a really dry foot, just the left one, and this stuff brought it back to normal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dry, cracked heels all my adult life - until I found this.  </li>
            <li> She suffered from dry feet but these made her feet baby soft.</li>
            <li> still some dry skin, but a marked improvement.</li>
            <li> it make my feet sooooo soft that I can belive that my feet are like these after have my feet soo dry</li>
            <li> soft and dry skin on feet is repaired almost overnight.  </li>
            <li> just put a small amount on evening and morning and the dried, cracking, hurting heels are gone and replaced by lovely skin.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the investment  into soft subtle feet!</li>
            <li> Just use a small amount every night, and feet are always sandal ready.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough</li>
            <li> The results from this far exceed ANY other product by a mile!</li>

            <li> The skin on my heels start drying up and cracking as soon as winter weather is near, and by the time I started looking for a foot cream, some parts of my foot were bleeding due to extreme dryness.</li>

            <li> I use it every other night, probably should use it nightly</li>
            <li> The other day my manicurist recommended this cream, she was selling it</li>
            <li> I wear sandals nearly year round, so my feet get very dry and my heels get so cracked that despite a pedicure every two weeks, she usually has to break out the \\&quot;cheese grater\\&quot; to get all the dead skin in addition to the scrubbing block.</li>

            <li> Only thing negative...</li>
            <li> This cream is thick enough but soaks in well.  </li>
            <li> i bought gadgets to sand down my heels.</li>

            <li> No more dry craked feet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey but you only have to use a little bit as it is so thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> Due to medications my feet were dried and cracked.  </li>
            <li> The price was $5 less than the salon.</li>
            <li> Paid less than half what these would cost at a nail salon.  </li>
            <li> I wish it cost less though.</li>
            <li> I use to have to get a pedicure at least once a month, but since I&#x27;ve been using this product, it&#x27;s been once every few months and what&#x27;s only if I want to feel pampered.</li>
            <li> After using it twice a day for less than a week, I saw immediate improvement in my feet.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a looooooong way, I can do both feet, rub some on my elbows and into my hands with about a quarter sized dollop.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone needing a little help with their feet.  </li>
            <li> I am on many medications that really dry out the skin, and my feet were horrible.</li>
            <li> I had thick, rough callouses</li>
            <li> is that the tube wasn&#x27;t completely full :(</li>
            <li> and then my heels were dried out again.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis on my feet making my feet flakey and not smooth but using this in the morning and at night, my feet have smoothed out to almost normal!&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> I saw a lot of improvement in just a few days</li>
            <li> A waste of money, not pleased at all</li>
            <li> A little pricey for the ounces received!</li>
            <li> wonders on taking off and reducing the buildup of dead skin on your heels!  </li>
            <li> Absolutely unbelievable..</li>

            <li> It smoothened my carlus heels, no more cracked heels.</li>
            <li> This cream is unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> This has not been my experience in the past.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used a wide range of different moisturizers to prevent painful cracking on my heels.</li>
            <li> After having my child my feet have been so hard on the bottom, even after monthly pedicures.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s hard on your feet.</li>
            <li> It has lessened the hard cracked areas a lot.</li>
            <li> She gave it to me when I complained of cracked heals.</li>
            <li> use the cream at least once a day to maintain.  </li>
            <li> Not many people can have feet as tough, cracked and calloused as mine.  </li>
            <li> I am using it (a very small pea size dab) on the heels</li>
            <li> Twice a day, a very small amount on each heel and around my toes.</li>
            <li> and you get a ridiculous amount in the tube for the price.</li>
            <li> I have been using and can definitely see a difference I don&#x27;t feel bad rubbing my feet on my husband without him making me feel like I scratched him with a brillo pad..</li>
            <li> I was shocked that it actually works.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend who had painfully cracked feet, especially her heels.  </li>
            <li> It really does help heal very painful, cracked heels.  </li>
            <li> Even though I got a pedicure every 2 weeks and put cream on my feet twice a day, my heels and the edges of my feet were dry and cracked and ugly.</li>
            <li> I did use it up fast though (used every night before bed) but it did soften my horrible heels.</li>
            <li> In 2 weeks there is some improvement, some softening of the hardness of her skin,  but not great results, yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried approximately 26 foot creams and lotions.</li>
            <li> Painful heel cracks gone in less than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very serious.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Does the job. Soft feet!</li>
            <li> Nu Skin&#x27;s Foot Cream is amazing.  My wife has tried everything under the sun with little success.  This foot cream had her feet as soft as I&#x27;ve seen them in the 18 years of marriage, in a matter of a week.  Will definitely re-order when we get low.</li>
            <li> It really works - as long as one uses it regularly.  My heels have been dry and cracked for years.  My sister-in-law recommended that I try it.  When used regularly, it makes dry, rough, cracked heels soft, supple and much more attractive.  This product works because it contains urea.</li>
            <li> This cream is AMAZING!  It clears rough skin and makes your feet look wonderful.  I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of top expensive brands.  This one works the best by FAR!</li>
            <li> Great product would recommend.  I&#x27;m in the pool most of the day and this product really makes your feet feel soooo silky.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to Sole Solution last year and absolutely love it.  I garden in sandals, and love walking around with either sandals on or barefoot, so my heels were always cracked and dry and sore...that is until I found this stuff by Nu Skin.  It is awesome and works in a few days - just put a small amount on evening and morning and the dried, cracking, hurting heels are gone and replaced by lovely skin.  I do not know what is in this cream, but it definitely works like a charm for me.</li>
            <li> When I use this cream, my heels immediately become soft.  Love, love, love the product.  Does what it says it will do!</li>
            <li> This product works great for my heals, it has been one of the only ones that has and would recommend it to anyone with sore cracked heals.</li>
            <li> My heals crack all the time!  This cream is wonderful! I put it on AM and PM with white socks.  My feet are in wonderful shape now.</li>
            <li> Uuuujnj[[ASIN:B003K2IF4I Nu Skin&#x27;s Foot Cream Sole Solution heals dry cracked feet]]Works wonders on taking off and reducing the buildup of dead skin on your heels!  Love this product.....will keep buying&lt;br /&gt;This one</li>
            <li> Learned of this from my pedi lady. I have very dry heels and they crack. Use just a small amount of this on your heels at night and NO more dry heels, also great for hands.  Good price and fast shipping, will buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different foot creams and balms over the years to address my dry skin issue particularly on my heels. The results from this far exceed ANY other product by a mile! The results are lasting even when I don&#x27;t use the product for up to five days, and I seldom use it twice a day as recommended. Smooth and supple sole skin, no longer a tendency to split or crack. Non-greasy or shiny, you don&#x27;t have to wear socks with this treatment, and can enjoy sandals immediately.</li>
            <li> What is in this miracle creme? This stuff is amazing and wonderful. Barely any smell or odor and you get a ridiculous amount in the tube for the price. A little goes a looooooong way, I can do both feet, rub some on my elbows and into my hands with about a quarter sized dollop. I love how fast it sinks in and stays put. I usually put it on with socks and sleep in it to help get all the benefits possible.</li>
            <li> This did nothing for my feet</li>
            <li> Really does work,I use it after I pumus my feet!Finally getting my feet back to were they use to be!Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing product!  I have been using this for less than a week and the difference is incredible.  I went from wood chipper, cavernous cracked heels to smooth, healing heels.  I use this in combination with a foot rasp and callous remover and my feet have never looked or felt better!</li>
            <li> This product is really GOOD. It leaves your feet feeling Baby Soft.</li>
            <li> Nothing has ever worked until this!!  Absolutely unbelievable.. I live in az and walk around barefoot most of the time.. if I wore socks they would rip.. not anymore! The very best</li>
            <li> It really does help heal very painful, cracked heels.  I just apply it and put on a pair of socks before going to bed at night, and it heals the cracks in just a day or two.</li>
            <li> This cream is the best! It got rid of my rough dry skin on my feet in about 3 days.</li>
            <li> Worked great when I was using it. I had a really dry foot, just the left one, and this stuff brought it back to normal. Its a little  pricey but worth it. I am just using regular foot lotion now, but that was not working for me until I used this product every night to get my feet back to normal.</li>
            <li> This product came highly recommended for my poor dry, cracked feet, and it is well deserved.  I put it on at night and its greasy/soft for only a few moments before it dries, however it really does help my heal dryness.  I find that if I keep up with Monthly pedi&#x27;s, and this stuff every night, I don&#x27;t suffer from dry and cracked heals at all.  Definitely my &amp;#34;Go To&amp;#34; lotion for my feet!</li>
            <li> Love it. It does wonders. I never want to be without this cream.</li>
            <li> I like the way that this glides on and it seems to add a layer of protection to my feet. It feels heavy enough but not too heavy, so you don&#x27;t need a lot. This is a good tip, because you don&#x27;t get a lot in the first place, so you don&#x27;t want to waste it. The price was $5 less than the salon.</li>
            <li> Amazing. My husband loves that I tried this product-my feet had become weapons.  Not only are my feet soft but my 63 year old hands are too. I would rub in the extra after treating my feet and after a couple days noticed how soft and supple the backs of my hands had become.  Now, when done with my feet I add a little more to my hands and rub in. I will be buying more for me and Christmas presents.</li>
            <li> This really works. I bought it for a friend that had a real problem with dry broken skin on the bottom of his feet and between toes. I used this on him twice daily for a few weeks then only once a day then several times a week. His feet stay soft and almost never has any dry broken skin when using this product.</li>
            <li> The one and only foot cream I will ever use.</li>
            <li> Really enjoy the smell and has been a great moisturizer. I actually use it as a night cream which works really well.</li>
            <li> This is the very best cream for feet, on the market!  It is pricey, but effective.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!!! In under two weeks I have no more pain from dry cracks on my feet. So happy!!!!!</li>
            <li> Wife uses it all the time and work fantastic</li>
            <li> Great love it will order more</li>
            <li> This one is definitely working. Best product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Believe the hype, this is the BEST heel cream available, your search is over. I can say this confidently because I understand the search, and I understand being disappointed again and again. This cream works, and works so much better than anything else, it&#x27;s just shocking. If you have terribly cracked heels (like I used to have) this will change your life. Just try it, literally the first moment you use it you can feel that it&#x27;s different than anything you&#x27;ve tried before, and the next morning you won&#x27;t believe what you&#x27;re seeing. And that&#x27;s just the first night!! I have no connection to this company and no incentive to push their product, but I know what it&#x27;s like to have painful cracked heels and nothing works. Please trust what I&#x27;ve written here (not to mention the 200+ other 5 star reviews!). If I can help even one person end their cracked heel life I will be happy :)</li>
            <li> this is a nice cream.  it&#x27;s absorbed quickly with no greasy residue.  it worked well but for the price it should have worked miracles!</li>
            <li> Bought this at my nail salon figured I would give it a try cause my feet were really dry and getting pretty hard and ever since ive been using it feet way softer ...I recommend it</li>
            <li> This is the best foot cream I&#x27;ve ever used. I learned about it at my nail salon. It really works.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my Wife who initially gave it rave reviews but then her feet cracked again. Jury is still out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dry, cracked heels all my adult life - until I found this.  It is amazing.  If you use it morning and night (a little dab will do you), you will love the results. I suggest you start using it immediately after a pedicure. I tried many products and scrubs and nothing worked until I tried this.</li>
            <li> This is the best foot product I have ever used! I&#x27;ve tried numerous options, and even without a pedicure all summer, and wearing sandals every day, my feet aren&#x27;t dry at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream where I get my pedicures. Every time I went to have a pedicure I was so embarrassed of my feet. They were always cracked and sometimes bleeding. I have tried everything and nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;The guy that did my feet recommended this product. I was amazed at the difference in just 2 days. He charged me $25.00, but felt it was worth $100.00 if it helped my feet. The tube is just about empty so I went on Amazon to see if I could find it cheaper and found it for $11.99 a tube! I bought 2 tubes! You will not regret buying this, it is the best! Thank you Nu Skin for such a great product, now I am no longer embarrassed of my feet! My feet now doesn&#x27;t have any cracks and smooth! You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have severely dry heels and have tried every product out there, this is the first one that does what it is supposed to do. It is worth every penny and I would highly recommend it</li>
            <li> It only works. If u use it day and night</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom, she loved it.</li>
            <li> it is a nice change from the other creams i have tried</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product, it is amazing.  I have salons comment on how soft my feet are when I get a pedicure, that is a first.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Paid less than half what these would cost at a nail salon.  Super value, excellent shipping.</li>
            <li> this product really works!</li>
            <li> This cream is amazing it makes your feet so smooth I apply it at night and put on old socks because it&#x27;s messy.</li>
            <li> Great  product I&#x27;m  in love with this it has only been 4 days  but major results already. callus softened &amp; my feet look better &amp; feel 100% better. Well worth it.  Truly works</li>
            <li> Received in time and in great condition. Great product! I would order this again! Only tried it once, but it makes my feet feel good.</li>
            <li> So thick and creamy, dries nice, no greasy residue. I did use it up fast though (used every night before bed) but it did soften my horrible heels. I wish it cost less though.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this lotion on her feet.  Works great!!!!  She suffered from dry feet but these made her feet baby soft. I was shocked that it actually works.  I told her to buy more :)</li>
            <li> This is one product that really works.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> The only heel cream that has ever worked!</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing cream for feet, and the scent is very light.</li>
            <li> After 3 days, I&#x27;m already noticing a difference. Still have cracks in my heals but I knew it would take a while to fix. Love it so far.</li>
            <li> I have used many, many, foot lotions, creams and products over the past ten years. This definitely worked in healing my dry cracked heels. In only days I might add. Miracle for me.</li>
            <li> This is amazing! My feet were so bad, they were so dried and cracked I was embarrased to wear sandals. I was even putting chucks of cocoa butter and putting socks on at night and that didn&#x27;t even make a difference. My pedicurist suggested this, the steep price made me cringed but all these ratings made me cave and buy it. Wow! Am I happy I bought this. It&#x27;s been 5 days and my feet a literally world&#x27;s apart from how they were before. I put it on morning and night. No more cocoa butter, no more socks. Just this simple fix. I highly highly recommend to anyone with the slightest to the most severe dry feet! Hello flip flops!</li>
            <li> My feet are so much better.  I had thick, rough callouses no they are much smoother, especially if I use consistantly</li>
            <li> This item was recommend to me by a friend on instagram. I figured it was worth a try.  After just the first time using it I could tell a difference in the softness of my heals. still some dry skin, but a marked improvement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of foot creams and this one is clearly a winner. Non-greasy formula, absorbs quickly and leaves my feet smooth - as if I&#x27;ve just had a luxurious pedicure. I have a couple trouble spots (prickly heels and a deep callous on one foot). After just a few weeks of moderate use (I only remember to use it a few times a week) my heels are super smooth and the trouble callous, with a deep crack is almost gone! I highly recommend this foot cream. It will be the only one I buy from now on.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST foot cream out there. It&#x27;s pricey but you only have to use a little bit as it is so thick and creamy. It completely healed my cracked soles.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried lots of others that have been alright but this one is absolutely the greatest!</li>
            <li> Definitely works! Must put on every night then you&#x27;ll see a difference in just a matter of days. Soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom!</li>
            <li> This foot cream really does work when used as directed. I am so glad I found this. Really great product.</li>
            <li> Fantastic. My feet feel so soft.</li>
            <li> Best foot cream I&#x27;ve ever used. If you have dry or cracked heals &amp; feet this is the cream for you!</li>
            <li> Best I have found...but necessary to use daily...</li>
            <li> I love these cream it make my feet sooooo soft that I can belive that my feet are like these after have my feet soo dry finaly something Miracle. Very fast shipping</li>
            <li> This stuff works really good!!!</li>
            <li> On advice of my pedicurist, I used this product on my rough dry heels every night for two weeks and, I swear, this stuff worked like  magic.  My heels have always been problematic, but no more.  They are smooth and soft.  I continue to use it nightly all over my feet and on the callused places on my hands.  I am a believer!</li>
            <li> Great product. Silky smooth...nice texture.</li>
            <li> Amazing makes your feet extremely soft.</li>
            <li> This is the first lotion I have ever found that took my dried cracked heels and made them baby soft! Just use a small amount every night, and feet are always sandal ready. I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Very good product for cracked heels. I&#x27;ve been to three salons from Vegas, NV and Alexandria, VA and they recommend and use this product as well.</li>
            <li> Love it...Will purchase again..</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible! I&#x27;ve tried numerous products. After having my child my feet have been so hard on the bottom, even after monthly pedicures. This helps immensely!</li>
            <li> Thanks for making this. My parents have cracks for years after using for 2-3 months they are gone. Buying more for others.</li>
            <li> Absolutly love this product.. it works, my feet were horrible and nithing else worked including regular pedi&#x27;s and the newest electric pwdi products. 2 weeks in and my feet are soft!!!</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona where we wear sandals 12 months a year so my feet have to look good. Even though I got a pedicure every 2 weeks and put cream on my feet twice a day, my heels and the edges of my feet were dry and cracked and ugly. I tried olive oil, Vaseline, and pretty much any remedy I could buy in the store or order on line. After spending a small fortune, I&#x27;d given up when I found Nu Skin foot cream. My feet look and feel great as long as I remember to use it every night (no socks needed). It took some time for the cracks to heal but now I get a pedicure only once a month (so I&#x27;m saving money). I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Product does an excellent job.  So glad to have found out about iti.</li>
            <li> This product is remarkable.  I&#x27;ve used it for a month, and my heels feel so smooth. I&#x27;ve been searching for a product that works, and it&#x27;s been found.</li>
            <li> I tried everything under the sun for the dry skin on the bottom of my feet. I ate virgin coconut oil. I went to the manicurist once a week. I slept with Vaseline and socks. I can go on. Nu Skin worked ASAP.  I&#x27;m very serious. I will never be without it. Rub it on your feet after a shower. Do the same before bed,,,also if you&#x27;re going to wear shoes that need socks do it also.  It has a great texture and doesn&#x27;t feel yucky. I love it!!! 😄 great for dry hands.</li>
            <li> Amazon saves the day and your wallet. My nail shop is charging $30 for this product, when in DOUBT ALWAYS CHECK AMAZON IT WILL AMAZE U!! I&#x27;M TRULY HAPPY,THIS PRODUCT DOES WHAT IT PROMISES AND PROMOTES!!!</li>
            <li> I seen this cream at a nail salon and it was about 30 bucks so I came here to check. I&#x27;m so glad I got it. My feet are so smooth and soft now. They weren&#x27;t terrible before, but I&#x27;m on my feet a lot and that&#x27;s hard on your feet.</li>
            <li> Within two nights of using this cream, I saw a difference in the heels of my feet.  Bring on summer sandals!</li>
            <li> Great product.  I was introduced to it at the Salon where I get a pedicure.  I bought some through them but the cost was high. When it was time to re-order ordered it through Amazon and saved 10.00 off the salon price.  If you have dry cracked heels you will immediately notice the difference.  Initially I used it twice a day but now I only use it each night before I go to bed.  No more dry/cracked heels.</li>
            <li> Really helps keeping calloused feet in check!</li>
            <li> Awesome product, fantastic on all dry skin but especially calloused feet.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> If you have dry feet, cracked heels, or calluses, then this is the PERFECT lotion for you.  I swear by this stuff and have bought for all my family members</li>
            <li> My sister bought some of this lotion and gave it to me.  She bought it at a pedicure salon.  Works very well.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this lotion by my nail technican. After just a few short days of treatment I started to see the results of this lotion, and ordered another bottle. I don&#x27;t want to go a day w/o it.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything for dry, cracked feet for about 20 years. This stuff is fantastic. I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I first tried this from a nail shop and loved it but they quit carrying it.  Glad to find it on Amazon and less expensive.  It works&lt;br /&gt;great on dry feet, especially heels!</li>
            <li> Slimy at first but it dries well into the skin and really moisturizes rough feet into soft kissable feet.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this foot cream; I had never heard of it. I have dry skin and my feet get really dry. This cream really works. I&#x27;d recommend getting a pedi first, then using this daily for maintenance. As an added bonus, once I rub the cream into my feet, the leftover cream moisturizes my dry hands. No scent (which I appreciate).</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  I would have never believed how fast it would smooth my dry cracked heels if I didn&#x27;t see it myself.  It is completely worth the cost.  Miracle!</li>
            <li> Only thing I have found that will reverse my cracked heels. Wonderful.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend who had painfully cracked feet, especially her heels.  In 2 weeks there is some improvement, some softening of the hardness of her skin,  but not great results, yet.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. works on the worst of cracked heals.Got some for my daughter and it worked for her as well.</li>
            <li> Best foot cream ever, my feet are really smoth and I dont need a pedicure every week anymore. Im done trying other creams, this is my one and only foot cream.</li>
            <li> this is the best foot cream EVER!! Works wonders!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best foot lotion I&#x27;ve ever used! I use to have to get a pedicure at least once a month, but since I&#x27;ve been using this product, it&#x27;s been once every few months and what&#x27;s only if I want to feel pampered. It&#x27;s amazing to go to bed feeling your feet so soft and smooth unlike a sand paper! It did take me almost 3 weeks to see the first difference since I didn&#x27;t want to use sox. It did a better faster job when I put sox on after appliaing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use rubber hand gloves to apply product on your feet or your hands will start exfoliating too. I had to stop using it when I&#x27;m wearing my expensive leather slip ons since it started scruff ung the color of the leather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall- if you use it and apply it to just your feet, it&#x27;s wonderful!!!</li>
            <li> I began using this product right after getting a pedicure so my feet were pretty well exfoliated. I applied it every day after my shower and it really does keep my feet soft and it keeps the white scaly stuff at bay. I&#x27;ve been using sole solutions for 9 months and will continue to use it since I&#x27;ve found that no other product works as well.</li>
            <li> This is the best heel crack moisturizer we have found so far.</li>
            <li> My sister in law owns a salon. She&#x27;s a nail tech and aesthetician. She gave it to me when I complained of cracked heals. I followed her instructions: soaked feet, scrubbed with a very rough pumice, to get off the dead skin; then a less rough one to smooth and buff heels and then started applying the creme. After showers, at night and in the morning. Anytime before putting on shoes for a long period. Works great. On my second tube of it. Worth the $$. Shipping was prompt arrived before time.</li>
            <li> This cream really does help keep feet soft and dry skin on feet is repaired almost overnight.  Better than any other product I have tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with the results in one week. My heals were very cracked and rough.  Smoother now and cracks are diminishing. Buy it! Nothing I&#x27;ve used before worked! I&#x27;m sold!</li>
            <li> Awesome product at a great price</li>
            <li> One of the best foot creams that I have used.</li>
            <li> Her feet were so disgusting and cracked it made me sick to my stomach.  She would ask me to rub her feet and it was like petting an Iguana.  So disgusting.  Now I can do it and not have to choke back vomit.</li>
            <li> The cream feels like silk on your feet. Its very soothing and keeps my feet hydrated all day. My cracked heels have healed and my feet remain soft day and night.</li>
            <li> My feet now rival those of my infant grandaughter inspite of wearing sandles!  Thank you Nu Skin!</li>
            <li> My sister had told me about this product.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough but so far no cracked heels.  Rubs on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!  Put on soles of feet and feet stay soft all day long.  it has really helped with calluses and rough spots.  Will definitely buy again.  Love it!</li>
            <li> All I need to add to the review section is that all the excellent reviews are true. I love this lotion!! I live in the south where flip flop season is about 8 - 9 months out of the year! My heels need to look good, and this lotion is absolutely the best and does job. It is perfect maintenance lotion for between pedicures.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item after it was recommended by one of the nail salon technicians and seeing a brochure in my nail salon, in which it was one of several items featured by the company Nu Skin.  It has a refreshing scent and is very moisturizing without being greasy.  My feet absorbs most moisturizers quickly, but this foot cream has been very effective in keeping my feet moisturized and helping to heal my cracked feet. I do plan on purchasing this again. The price was reasonable as well.</li>
            <li> I am usually skeptical of company or product names that are intentionally misspelled (Nu vs. New), but I am very glad that I gave this one a shot. The skin on my heels start drying up and cracking as soon as winter weather is near, and by the time I started looking for a foot cream, some parts of my foot were bleeding due to extreme dryness. Within a couple of days of putting on this cream, my heels have become much softer. Most of the cracking has disappeared, and what&#x27;s left look like normal skin. I usually try to put this on twice a day, but once is perfectly fine. The smell is also not overpowering like some lotions. The texture is smooth but not greasy.</li>
            <li> I totally love Nu Skin&#x27;s Foot Cream.  It literally softens and heals dry skin on heals and other areas on feet as well as dry skin around cuticles.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream from my nail salon at $25.00 yesterday.  I live in Chicago, IL, and the weather varies. I have very dry and cracked heels year long. It has been day two, and I see the difference.  My fat toes are smoother, and the cracks on my heel look better. This product does work.  I will buy it from Amazon, since it is cheaper than the nail salon.</li>
            <li> this cream has made my heals of my feet and all over my feet feel soft again.  It has lessened the hard cracked areas a lot.</li>
            <li> I like the product - it does what it says it will do - only problem is that the tube wasn&#x27;t completely full :(</li>
            <li> I ordered this based on reviews.  As I&#x27;ve gotten into my 30&#x27;s, my heels dry out a lot more now, even with regular pedicures.  It makes it impossible in the summer to feel comfortable wearing backless shoes or sandals.  Tried this product and with in two days my heels were so much better.  After a week, the dryness was gone.  It may take longer for more severe cases but it does work.  I loved it so much I just ordered some for my Mom too.</li>
            <li> Great product, work like magic. It smoothened my carlus heels, no more cracked heels. It is a must try product</li>
            <li> Works great but leaves an oily spot on sheets until you wash them.&lt;br /&gt;My heels are great and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Hubby&#x27;s feet get dry and cracked, even during the summer. I&#x27;ve bought several products, but none worked. He was skeptical about this cream even with all the great reviews. After using it a few days, he told me *not* to run out of the cream because the dry, cracked skin had disappeared! His feet are now soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom! Excellent product!</li>
            <li> Amazing!! I have extremely dry/cracked heels. This product does wonders for them. I like to apply it after using my Emjoi Micro-Pedi Electric Callus Remover. The pair performs miracles.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried it you need too.  Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> This cream is awesome.  It really works to soften dry and or cracked feet and is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I HAD NO PROBLEM WITH THE SELLER AND RCVD MY PRODUCT WITHIN 3 DAYS.  ONE APPLICATION WAS ENOUGH TO GET MY FEET SMOOTH AND SOFT. PRODUCT MEET MY EXPECTATIONS.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I had chronic chapped heels, to the point where they would crack and bleed and walking was painful. I tried a number of things, including all the stuff you can find at Wal-Mart and the like. They&#x27;d work, but only for a few hours and then my heels were dried out again. This product was recommended to me during a pedicure, and it works great. It&#x27;s the only thing that keeps my heels healthy and uncracked. I&#x27;ve tried other, less pricey, products, but this one is worth the money and really works. The tube goes a fairly long way, too, if you use the product sparingly.</li>
            <li> Love it. It does everything it says. My heels were very dry and cracked use it every night before bed. My heels are getting soft and the cracks are healing. Will I get more yes.  Thank You, Elizabeth</li>
            <li> This product really delivered.  I used it twice a day as directed and in two weeks time I could not believe the difference in my feet.  You do need to exfoliate to remove the dry skin about once a week then use the cream at least once a day to maintain.  I absolutely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> After years of dealing with cracked heels, I finally found something that works.  This stuff is amazing !  I am not one for sales hipe but this really works.</li>
            <li> I have the worst dry, cracked feet!  I have tried every possible solution you can imagine..every cream sold in stores, pedegg, even bought my own foot file like they use at the salon...and nothing works! Monday, when having a pedicure, the man doing it was grossed out by my feet, and after explaining to him that I work on them daily and have tried everything, he sold me a tube of this cream, told me to use it twice a day and if when it was gone, if my feet weren&#x27;t better, he&#x27;d give me my money back.  He did stress to use it twice a day.  That I have done for 2 days and already my feet feel and look so much better.  Nothing has ever done what this cream has done it 2 days.  I&#x27;m sold!!!  No more embarrassing feet!!!!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do what I expected. Still using it while I have it but would not re-order. Was testing other ones at the same time and found two that worked better.</li>
            <li> Love it and it REALLY works well.</li>
            <li> This is amazing, after I get a pedicure I rub this in every night to keep my feet feeling soft. It keeps any dryness away till the next pedicure. My nail salon sells it and they got me started on it, then I found it here a lot cheaper. Well worth the investment  into soft subtle feet!, extra added bonus it&#x27;s amazing on your hands</li>
            <li> This is a great product- it works! I am using it (a very small pea size dab) on the heels&lt;br /&gt;after the shower.</li>
            <li> Have the worst heals.When I went for a spa pedicure, they used this. Love it and ordered it.</li>
            <li> The product came two days before delivery date. It&#x27;s amazing product.</li>
            <li> I like Mr biil and  the foot cream is amazing, C.E.T is ok</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Works really well on hands also.</li>
            <li> Love this product, and it does exactly what it says it does. It arrived on time which was great since flip flop season is now here.</li>
            <li> Cream got my feet smooth and soft quite quickly after being cracked.  Does not leave a greasy feeling and is absorbed by the skin.</li>
            <li> This product works so well on my feet.  Love the price and quick shipment</li>
            <li> Wonderful product at a great price!</li>
            <li> Love this.  After using it twice a day for less than a week, I saw immediate improvement in my feet.  I wear sandals 90% of the time and my feet are now soft and look nice.</li>
            <li> This foot cream is wonderful.  My feet are  super soft and smooth.  Also use it on my dry elbows.  I will order more!!</li>
            <li> I love this foot cream.  I have tried various creams that claim to heal and smooth cracked heels but this one actually works.  Try it you wont be dissapointed.</li>
            <li> This is the best cream for dry and cracked heals. I&#x27;ve tried many creams and this one beats them all.</li>
            <li> This is a great cream for your feet, my feet feel so soft and silky when I use it.</li>
            <li> This cream is unbelievable.  Due to medications my feet were dried and cracked.  It was very painful.  After two applications I saw a huge difference.  No cracks or calluses.  You will love it.</li>
            <li> I had to give this 5 stars.  I have used all kinds of foot creams - Amlactin, Philosophy, Neutrogena, etc. with minor results. This is the ONLY foot cream I&#x27;ve found that does the job!  It has a very subtle smell, goes on nicely and immediately penetrates the skin. Even the toughest dry skin around the tops of my toenails were moisturized and healthy.  I use it every other day, and I used to have extremely dry skin on my feet. Now, for the first time in 20 years, they look AND feel great!  Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Nu Skin&#x27;s Foot Cream really works.  It was recommended to me by a physician who specializes in wound care. It is easy to apply and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> Super foot cream...can use for hands too.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream. I suffer from severely cracked heels and it is unbearable in the winter. This cream is thick enough but soaks in well.  I use it twice a day and throw on a pair of socks to aid in keeping the cream on. The lack of 5 stars is only because the price is a bit high but after a few weeks my heels look great and the pain is gone.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Works! Nothing ever came close to how good this product works on my feet. They are like new feet for me!</li>
            <li> The comments were right...you have new feet in three days! Great cream. I mix Lavender oil in it and rub on my husband&#x27;s feet each night. Only thing negative...it doesn&#x27;t go that far. After a month, I can&#x27;t squeeze any more out of the container.</li>
            <li> Not as expected.  Regular lotion does just as well.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by a friend who said it was great, and she is right!  It absolutely Works</li>
            <li> Finally, something that really works on my feet. It&#x27;s really almost magic compared with all the other products that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This lotion is worth the money! I first tried it when I had a pedicure and had to find it.  It makes your feet very smooth and not greasy or slippery. It helps with cracking and does not irratate. A great find!</li>
            <li> Finally a product that works for dry and fissured feet. Worth the price. A great solution for my problems that not even a podiatrist could handle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a foot creme ever since Beauticonrol stopped making the one I loved. This is it!  My feet, including my heels are smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> My regular nail salon recommended this for my cracked heels.  I think it definitely has helped soften the skin.  The salon was selling it for $30 compared to Amazon&#x27;s price of under $20.  I appreciate Amazon&#x27;s prices!  Shipping arrived fast.  I&#x27;m a happy customer.</li>
            <li> I love the Nu Skins Foot Cream Sole Solution - it really works on dried, cracked skin on soles of feet</li>
            <li> Amazing!  Will buy more.</li>
            <li> Makes my heels soft and less peeling. Used it nightly and put over a pair of socks. That really helps.</li>
            <li> I love it. It &#x27;s very good</li>
            <li> Works great right after a pedicure..</li>
            <li> one of the better foot cream products I have used.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from my pedicurist and began to use it that night. I put it on just before climbing into bed and then again in the morning after my shower and just before putting on my shoes. Twice a day, a very small amount on each heel and around my toes. I wear sandals nearly year round, so my feet get very dry and my heels get so cracked that despite a pedicure every two weeks, she usually has to break out the \\&quot;cheese grater\\&quot; to get all the dead skin in addition to the scrubbing block. This time, after two weeks of using Epoch Sole Solution, my heels were still smooth, almost as if I had just had a pedicure. No cheese grater, and she hardly had to scrub at all, my skin was that soft and smooth. It feels great going on, does not feel greasy and absorbs very quickly. I would highly recommend this product to anyone with dry, cracked heels (or elbows, who says you can only use it on feet?). I&#x27;ve tried lots of other creams and NONE have matched the quality and results of this one.</li>
            <li> It was recommended by my pedicurist at $25.00 so I decided to buy it directly from Amazon. I have used this product every day and no results.  A waste of money, not pleased at all</li>
            <li> I cannot rave enough about this cream! i have tried EVERYTHING for my dry, cracked heels. I am on many medications that really dry out the skin, and my feet were horrible. Rough, cracked and dry. Sometimes to the point of being painful. I have tried so many products that claimed to cure this. I even order the acid gel that they put on you when you get a pedicure. i bought gadgets to sand down my heels. I tried the Ped-Egg. I tried Heel-tastic, Dr. Scholl&#x27;s, every foot cream in Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond. Nothing I tried worked very well - I&#x27;d have mild relief, but no major change.My feet were an embarrassment.  Until Nu Skin. A friend recommended this to me, so I figured I would try it - what&#x27;s one more thing to add to my collection of useless foot solutions? Well, I was amazed. I saw amazing result after only 3 DAYS! I have been using it a couple weeks now, and my heels look great! I only put it on, sparingly, at bedtime. In morning shower, I use a pumice stone on heels. My feet look &amp;#34;new&#x27;. I am proud to wear sandals once again! Honestly, this stuff was such a pleasant change - a product that actually works, and works GREAT. I am recommending to my friends, and I will never be without it. i know this review sounds too good to be true (and NO, I don&#x27;t sell the stuff) but I can&#x27;t remember the last time I was so pleased with a beauty product. AND it is relatively inexpensive too! HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li> First exposure was when I received a pedicure at a salon.  My feet were so smooth.  Decided to try it at home and have used it everday.  My feet are no longer cracked or rough.  Well worth the price.  I can go longer between pedicures.</li>
            <li> Rough spots on heels are gone.  Need to find same things for hands.  I use it every other night, probably should use it nightly</li>
            <li> This product works beautifully and quickly. I would recommend this to anyone needing a little help with their feet.  Awesome!</li>
            <li> This is a miracle product.  Not many people can have feet as tough, cracked and calloused as mine.  I would ruin socks because my feet were so bad.  After using this product, my feet are very smooth and not a single crack.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> My feet never felt soooo good!!!</li>
            <li> I have incredibly unsightly skin on my feet. Despite weekly trips to have the built up dry, cracked, callused skin shaved off with the razor device it always returns by the end of the week. I&#x27;ve tried approximately 26 foot creams and lotions. Nothing has ever worked like this product! I normally try each new product with skepticism since so many did nothing but make my feet greasy without absorbing. This product was non-greasy, yet still able to absorb down to the real problem. For the first time in years I was able to skip a week at the pedicurist. Then another. This stuff is truly amazing!</li>
            <li> I do like this foot cream.  Leaves your feet feeling nice and soft without feeling greasy. I&#x27;m glad I finally tried the product.  I plan to reorder.</li>
            <li> I was turned on to Sole Solution by my pedicurist and I thank her frequently!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I love this product!  I&#x27;ve tried every kind of cream and oil, nothing compares to this!</li>
            <li> I wasn &#x27;t quite sure if the foot cream would work as well as the reviews had indicated and YES I was pleasantly surprised and love the product. It is a non-sticky foot cream which doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent. The wonderful thing is - my dry, slightly cracked heels got better after 2 days and now they look marvellous for strappy sandals. So glad that this foot cream delivers!</li>
            <li> Use on my dry cracked feet then follow up with Nu Skin Epoch Baobab body butter.  After about 2 weeks all cracks went away and feet feel great!</li>
            <li> Tech was using this during pedicure, so i asked about. No they didn&#x27;t sell it but you could order, a bit of a put off. I ordered and used and never looked back. This cream will TRULY WILL SOFTEN your heels (and feet all over) and you may never need another pedicure unless you just need polish! Really, I haven&#x27;t had to go back for one since. Maybe not so good for his business to tell his secret!</li>
            <li> The most amazing lotion for you feet ever created.  I have had rough cracked heels my entire life.  I thought it was hopeless, but not so.  This really does work amazingly.  Try it you will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by the guy that does my nails and pedicure. He uses it every time I get a pedicure and suggested that I use it regularly in between appointments. It really makes your feet feel soft if you use it twice a day, morning and night.</li>
            <li> This is by FAR the best thing on the market for dry cracked feet. You will see immediate results that are lasting. Only a small amount is needed and your feet will become smooth and STAY SMOOTH. CANT SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THIS WONDERFUL PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> My feet were so dry that I would not even wear sandals. After using this product for a week, my feet are so smooth.  I love the fact that it does not have a greasy feel to it, more like a motion. It worked great for me. Iwoild buy this again.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. I have psoriasis on my feet making my feet flakey and not smooth but using this in the morning and at night, my feet have smoothed out to almost normal!&lt;br /&gt;Have not found another product as good!</li>
            <li> The foot cream feels light going on......not sticky and gooey like some foot creams.  The cream itself was highly effective.&lt;br /&gt;I put it on my feet  before bed....let it sink in a bit....and then put on clean white socks.  I could see and feel a difference in the morning.</li>
            <li> This cream is fabulous.  It works better than my prescription cream.  My heels no longer crack and bleed.  The \\&quot;crack lines\\&quot; on my heels have almost disappeared. I saw a lot of improvement in just a few days and I only use it once a day. It&#x27;s not greasy or oily either.</li>
            <li> Tried this after reading review, and I have to say it is a great product. I have dry, cracked heels and I also use&lt;br /&gt;the Emjoi micro pedi for callus removing plus this cream and my soles are soft and no more cracks!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little expensive but worth it to me. It came super fast and the cream does not leave&lt;br /&gt;a greasy residue like others.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you~</li>
            <li> I had battled dry cracked feet for years.  I discovered epoch.  I have used it daily for about 2 years now and have had great results.  No more dry craked feet.</li>
            <li> Its good and works for my skin better than others though expensive but really good. Works alongside Microplane foot file..</li>
            <li> I no longer have dry, cracked heels.  I use it on my hands and elbows, too.  I am looking forward to summer.</li>
            <li> The product Worked wonderfully for me.  It did moisturized the skin on my feet.  I will repurchase in the future.</li>
            <li> Works good to start, but does not last.</li>
            <li> Excellent cream. I can feel the difference already.</li>
            <li> I first bought this product at my nail salon but found it on line cheaper.  This is the best foot cream you can ever buy.  It is worth the money.  It has made my feet so silky soft.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> I have chronic dry skin on my feel and I&#x27;ve used a wide range of different moisturizers to prevent painful cracking on my heels. This is definitely one of the best and comes at a very reasonable price considering that you don&#x27;t need to apply much each time. After less than a week of consistent use my skin was almost completely healed.</li>
            <li> I use it every night, keeps my feet feeling smooth and soft instead of like sand paper. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My pedicurist started carrying this in her salon, and the marketing materials had &amp;#34;before and after&amp;#34; photos of someone with really horrid cracked and dry heels (before) and then amazingly baby-smooth heels (after).  I was a bit skeptical, but I laid out the $24 she was asking because I really don&#x27;t like having dry skin on my heels snagging my bedsheets! I want to point out that before I started to use it, I had a pedicure that day, so I can only vouch that it KEPT my heels soft, not that it MADE them soft.  So I&#x27;m not sure that feet in the state that the &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; picture depicted would actually attain a really soft, smooth state, but I CAN vouch for it KEEPING my feet in GREAT condition.  I&#x27;m 3 weeks out from my pedicure now, and have used this cream twice a day, and my feet look like I just had the pedicure 5 minutes ago.  So I am a VERY happy camper.  This has not been my experience in the past.  Usually several days after a pedicure I am already wishing I was scheduled for another... so I&#x27;m very happy with this cream and will get some more.  I&#x27;ll order online, and I feel a little badly not &amp;#34;supporting&amp;#34; my beautician by buying it at her shop, but the savings buying on Amazon are significant.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by pedicurist for my husbands chronic cracked skin around his thumbs.  Nothing else he&#x27;s trid has had the improvement of this cream...and of course, it works on my dry, crack heels, too!  Very good product, good price.</li>
            <li> I really like the moisturizing power of this product.  I especially like that it&#x27;s quick-absorbing and not oily or greasy.  Over the years, I&#x27;ve used many products such as this, and this is the best non-oily/non-greasy one I&#x27;ve found yet.</li>
            <li> Very good for cracked heels.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what my feet were needing. I&#x27;m so happy my nail salon told about this product. I have been using and can definitely see a difference I don&#x27;t feel bad rubbing my feet on my husband without him making me feel like I scratched him with a brillo pad..lol no more cracked heels with dirt trapped in the middle.  The lines are fading my feet feel soft :) I use as directed. A little pricey for the ounces received! Will buy again (Epoch) is a foot life saver</li>
            <li> I have always had dry rough feet. It is the one thing about me i detest. I have spent hundreds on foot creams in hope for a solution but nothing seemed to work. The other day my manicurist recommended this cream, she was selling it so i tried it. I noticed a change that day after one use! FINALLY SOMETHING THAT WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;I stand by this product and i pray they never discontinue this. It really changed my life. I am no longer embarrassed about my feet. Plan to use it on my hands too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a million!</li>
            <li> This product works great, it&#x27;s not greasy and no smell at all. I will recommend this to friends as well!</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT AND GREAT DOLLAR VALUE</li>
            <li> This product is advertised as 12 ounces when in fact it is only 4.2 ounces, almost 3 times exaggeration. I will not buy from this seller again, it is offered at a lower price from a different seller who states the true weight, I ordered from this one because I thought I was getting a lot more cream. The cream is ok, pretty good, I gave it a try as my nail place recommended it but sells at a higher price.  However the cream I&#x27;ve been using for years is much better and cheaper. Try AHAVA from the Dead Sea minerals, foot cream &amp;#34;mud&amp;#34; very intense moisturizer, in fact all AHAVA products are superb, I will continue with my products and will not buy this cream again, and will not buy from this seller again.  I gave it 3 stars and not lower as the cream is pretty good and overall a good product.</li>
            <li> This is the best cracked heel cream I have ever tried, and I&#x27;ve tried many.  The results are immediate, and lasting.  I don&#x27;t have to use it every day like the others, so it is economical also.</li>
            <li> Awesome!  Painful heel cracks gone in less than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> great cream. Love it Great Book. I would recommend to others. it makes your skin a little darker when in direct sunlight .  Be blessed all of you.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but it isn&#x27;t a miracle lotion</li>
            <li> Nuskin foot cream is one of the best cream for callused feet. Of course, you have to exfoliate feet once in awhile, but the cream does continue to keep feet soften longer.</li>
            <li> If you use this product daily on your feet, it keeps your heels from drying out. I also use it on my elbows. This product was recommended by my nail salon, but for much more money.</li>
            <li> This definitely works. Delivered as promised. You must apply to rough areas twice a day.  Just a dab.</li>
            <li> Love this foot cream....makes my feet feel smooth</li>
            <li> Did not help any more than lotion. So it did not help my dry cracked feet at all. Sorry, I was hoping it would help. I really need something that works, I am on my feet a lot. Maybe I will find something that works. And soon.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!!! It&#x27;s the best foot cream for cracked feet ever and I have tried a lot of them.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Will order more.</li>
            <li> Perfect product, works great for extremely dry soles.  It&#x27;s also nice for any type of dry skin as it hydrates fast and well.</li>
            <li> JUST AS DESCRIBED.  LOVE THIS CREAM.</li>
            <li> This cream did not impress my husband who has dry deeply cracked heels. According to him Flexitol Heel Balm works a lot better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good as I heard about it. Just plain Petroleum Jelly/Vaseline on your soles perform equally good. Not sure if I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have tried many foot creams and this is the only one that actually heals the cracks in my feet.  Highly recommended and very happy the parabens have been removed from this product. I stopped buy it for a while because of the parabens and my feet got terrible.</li>
            <li> Great for your heels. My heels of my feet are very calloused and this cream is very helpful.</li>
