            <li> Great fresh smell! LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine came into town to visit from NYC and she&#x27;d emerged from my bathroom and a beautiful scent followed her as she walked by. When she told me it was a body spray I was pretty surprised- as I don&#x27;t use these often and typically use perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I immediately bought this, and I am hooked. It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Perfect product for a gift</li>
            <li> I love being able to get these delivered to my front door. Smells great and last quite a while. You get your money&#x27;s worth. I&#x27;m beyond satisfied.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, fast delivery:)</li>
            <li> A charming and subtle fragrance that is pure paradise. There are sweet notes that linger on. Pairs well with Ohau coconut sunset and/or also Cool Amazon Rain. It evokes a pina colada vibe. May try it with the Carried Away fragrance to see if it harmonizes</li>
            <li> I love this sent!! I have ben trying to find it at my local Bath and Body Works for a while, and no luck, untill today! I was so excited that I tilted my head to the sky and said outloud &amp;#34;Thank the lord!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love this, will be buying more. Thank you</li>
            <li> I GOT MY SPRAY AND WILL BUT ANOTHER FOR MYSELF..</li>
            <li> For the pure paradise i bought the mist beacause they didn&#x27;t have the perfume yet. It&#x27;s okay it&#x27;s defintely just a MIST... It smells good but its kinda soft. I could just be use to the perfumes from bath and bodyworks. I hope they get this in asap.</li>
            <li> this product smells wonderful. although,the scent dosent last long at all! the lotion lasts longer than the fragrance mist... what a shame!</li>
            <li> my daughter loves it and so does all her gym class</li>
            <li> My favorite clean scent</li>
            <li> Gift - granddaughter loves this one too.</li>
            <li> First people&#x27;s. It smells nothing like it&#x27;s saying. Its gonna. Smell like it smells like powdery coconuts not mixed fruits. I bought a travel size. Of this. A long.  Time. Ago. So I&#x27;m ordering. More it&#x27;s very unique. And sweet. But. Not overpowering. Almost a nutty Smell I* loved it but if coconuts not your. Thing. Then yeah</li>
