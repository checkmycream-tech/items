    <ol>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li>This is the best!!</li>
            <li>so was happy Amazon carries it.  </li>
            <li>This item is great because it is an all-in-one mascara.  </li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>works beautifully and smoothly.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to go with great lashes.  </li>
            <li>how many times I apply eye drops.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work very well, it didn&#x27;t feel good, and it was pricey for not working so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this purchase, after trying many different brands of mascara.</li>
            <li>Two step process is unique.</li>
            <li>Very good product, carbon liquid does not flake after it dries because of the conditioner I apply before I apply the black mascara.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use waterproof and this comes off with Loreal clean artiste oilfree eye makeup remover.  </li>
            <li>A great everyday mascara</li>
            <li>I want a product that makes my eyes stand out right out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>It also washes off very easily and thoroughly with the very gentle face wash I use daily.</li>
            <li>and this is the only mascara I&#x27;ve bought more than once.  </li>
            <li>This is my first review ever.</li>
            <li>Was hoping that this product with the \\&quot;primer\\&quot; would yield lovely lashes, but my lashes looked no different than when I used a cheaper Maybeline product.</li>
            <li>I am now using Lancome Hypnose Drama and am much happier with the result!</li>
            <li>I only paid maybe nine dollars, but I was hoping for something better.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product at drug store and loved it; in comparison my online purchase, was dried out.</li>
            <li>After wearing it all day I would have super cute dark rings under eyes.</li>
            <li>as an older person with not many lashes left - it gives the appearance of more and the primer is good for lashes</li>
            <li>Old and Crusty To Quickly</li>
            <li>I let the primer dry for a minute, add one coat of mascara on top, and I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>Easy to use -- no spikes -- long wearing -- it stays on &#x27;til you take it off -- and is really waterproof!</li>
            <li>It stays on really well, too.</li>
            <li>Really like the conditioner</li>
            <li>I really like the primer-</li>
            <li>The missing star is for the mascara running out too fast :).</li>
            <li>New.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got a shoebox full of other brands  </li>
            <li>I have been using this mascara for a few years now since I got it free to try as a BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>If Not Shut Super Tight and Cleaned Closer</li>
            <li>I have been trying various mascaras for longer lush lashes (mine have thinned as I have gotten older), so tried Double Extend.</li>
            <li>In fact they looked less long and full.</li>
            <li>Was dried out and I threw away when tried first use.</li>

            <li> And I get super thick, yet natural-looking, lashes with NO CLUMPING!</li>
            <li> The carbon black is my favorite because it isn&#x27;t the dark black that would make my eyes look odd in an office setting.</li>
            <li> I have chronic dry eye due to LASIK vision correction, and I use eye drops SEVERAL times daily.</li>
            <li> the idea is to thicken and lengthen with the white end, then apply regular mascara from the dark end.</li>

            <li> One coat white and one coat black</li>
            <li> They are both very dry.</li>
            <li> The mascara doesn&#x27;t go a long way, so I use the primer with other mascara too.</li>
            <li> It only took a little over a week for it to be clumpy and gunk up my lashes.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of daily use its almost gone.</li>
            <li> The white end was dried out.</li>
            <li> my favorite mascara, no longer being produced :-(</li>
            <li> This mascara makes my lashes look longer than any other mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried...and I&#x27;ve tried tons of them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The primer coat lengthens and thickens and finds even the tiniest lashes, and the mascara end finishes your eyelashes with a luxurious dark black.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what it would take for me to try it again.</li>
            <li> Overall , this mascara was a stinker.</li>

            <li> Sometimes very hard to find</li>
            <li> Not happy with it.</li>

            <li> No need for expensive eye makeup remover.</li>

            <li> my favorite mascara, no longer being produced :-(</li>
            <li> They are both very dry.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Miss it in stores!</li>
            <li> Puny lashes?  I&#x27;ve got a shoebox full of other brands  and this is the only mascara I&#x27;ve bought more than once.  I buy this for birthday presents for a friend who also loves this stuff.  One coat white and one coat black and I&#x27;m ready to go with great lashes.  No clumping.  Don&#x27;t even need eyeliner, just brushon eyebrows.  I don&#x27;t use waterproof and this comes off with Loreal clean artiste oilfree eye makeup remover.  Don&#x27;t change anything, just leave it alone and I will be a faithful customer!  Sometimes very hard to find so was happy Amazon carries it.  This is my first review ever.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mascara for a few years now since I got it free to try as a BzzAgent. I have chronic dry eye due to LASIK vision correction, and I use eye drops SEVERAL times daily. L&#x27;Oreal Double Extend Mascara (and its sister product in the red tube) is the only mascara that doesn&#x27;t smudge no matter how many times I apply eye drops. And I get super thick, yet natural-looking, lashes with NO CLUMPING! It also washes off very easily and thoroughly with the very gentle face wash I use daily. No need for expensive eye makeup remover. If this product ever gets discontinued, I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do!</li>
            <li> Very good product, carbon liquid does not flake after it dries because of the conditioner I apply before I apply the black mascara. I would buy it again and again and again....</li>
            <li> I have been trying various mascaras for longer lush lashes (mine have thinned as I have gotten older), so tried Double Extend. Not happy with it. I don&#x27;t want to spend 20 minutes putting on mascara, curling my lashes etc... I want a product that makes my eyes stand out right out of the bottle. Was hoping that this product with the \\&quot;primer\\&quot; would yield lovely lashes, but my lashes looked no different than when I used a cheaper Maybeline product. In fact they looked less long and full. I am now using Lancome Hypnose Drama and am much happier with the result!</li>
            <li> This item is great because it is an all-in-one mascara.  I hope they never stop selling this brand.</li>
            <li> Two step process is unique. the idea is to thicken and lengthen with the white end, then apply regular mascara from the dark end. works beautifully and smoothly.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have been using this mascara for years. Why are you taking them off the shelves. We both have thin eyelashes and this helps us both look like we have a lot.</li>
            <li> Item: Double Extend Mascara&lt;br /&gt;Brand: L&#x27;Oreal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9 times out of 10 L&#x27;Oreal makes a smash hit product I would use over and over again, this is an item in the 1 out of 10. It didn&#x27;t work very well, it didn&#x27;t feel good, and it was pricey for not working so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to Open (Unless Crushed Over)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives&lt;br /&gt;-Crushes If Not Shut Super Tight and Cleaned Closer&lt;br /&gt;-Heavy and You Can Feel It&lt;br /&gt;-Clumps&lt;br /&gt;-Makes Lashes Stick in Big Clumps You Can&#x27;t Get Apart&lt;br /&gt;-Hard to Wash Off, Even With Eye Makeup Remover&lt;br /&gt;-The White Doesn&#x27;t Always Cover With the Black&lt;br /&gt;-To Thick a Brush&lt;br /&gt;-Gets Old and Crusty To Quickly</li>
            <li> I just wish they didn&#x27;t test on animals.</li>
            <li> This mascara makes my lashes look longer than any other mascara I&#x27;ve ever tried...and I&#x27;ve tried tons of them.&lt;br /&gt;The trick to the primer for me is to use only one coat. (If I try to use two, the mascara goes on lumpy.) I let the primer dry for a minute, add one coat of mascara on top, and I&#x27;m done. It stays on really well, too. I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Really like the conditioner</li>
            <li> My experience was not like any the reviews I read. The packaging, the product - it all came the way it was supposed to. New. It only took a little over a week for it to be clumpy and gunk up my lashes. After wearing it all day I would have super cute dark rings under eyes. So obviously it couldn&#x27;t even stay put. After a few weeks of daily use its almost gone. I only paid maybe nine dollars, but I was hoping for something better. I&#x27;m not sure what it would take for me to try it again. Overall , this mascara was a stinker.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> I have been using the &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; stuff (ie $$$) for years. I had to buy some between orders and ended up with this. I love it. The mascara doesn&#x27;t go a long way, so I use the primer with other mascara too. I really like the primer- it rocks. The missing star is for the mascara running out too fast :).</li>
            <li> Easy to use -- no spikes -- long wearing -- it stays on &#x27;til you take it off -- and is really waterproof! I am very pleased with this purchase, after trying many different brands of mascara.</li>
            <li> This is the best!! The primer coat lengthens and thickens and finds even the tiniest lashes, and the mascara end finishes your eyelashes with a luxurious dark black. You instantly have thicker, longer, voluminous non-clumping lashes!!</li>
            <li> as an older person with not many lashes left - it gives the appearance of more and the primer is good for lashes</li>
            <li> Was dried out and I threw away when tried first use.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother with this product. The white end was dried out.</li>
            <li> A great everyday mascara and I especially like the primer and the shape of the brushes.  Works well for me.  The carbon black is my favorite because it isn&#x27;t the dark black that would make my eyes look odd in an office setting.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product at drug store and loved it; in comparison my online purchase, was dried out. I won&#x27;t purchase this online again.</li>
