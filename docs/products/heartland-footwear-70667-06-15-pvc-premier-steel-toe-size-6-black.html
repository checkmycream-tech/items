            <li>I will come back after Mother&#x27;s day to add more to this review.</li>
            <li>It was the first thing I noticed when I opened the box.  </li>
            <li>Made my skin feel so clean and soft.</li>
            <li>The same is true of the soap, very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>For years I have only used body wash because of the skin drying results I have had from using soaps but this soap is very moisturizing and leaves your skin silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>The soap also has a nice, but subtle fragrance, and does not dry out my skin, as many soaps do.</li>
            <li>I like the soap and candle, very lavendery,&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Thanks for the high quality products!  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t comment on much.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>and I really like the scrub.  </li>
            <li>This gift set was even better than I expected.</li>
            <li>I found the light fragrance of the candle soothing and calming and the lavender sea salt, which I added to the bath water, deeply relaxing.  </li>
            <li>The artisan soap felt creamy on my skin and knowing it was free of harmful chemicals was such a relief.  </li>
            <li>one of the reasons I am not usually a bar soap kinda person -- but this one is also pretty to leave on the sink edge.</li>
            <li>I particularly like it because the smell isn&#x27;t over powering as some lotions can be.  </li>
            <li>This is a high quality product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this gift set.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and often break out in rashes.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed is the deep scent when I opened the amazon box.</li>
            <li>It made my skin soft, but wasn&#x27;t too oily either.</li>
            <li>The scent is soft, but there.</li>
            <li>The lotion leaves your hands so soft and not greasy.  </li>
            <li>I like that these products are made with all natural ingredients and do not have harmful chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Gives off a rich eucalyptus fragrance but is not overpowering and the glass cup is heavy and substantial.</li>
            <li>The bar soap could use a little more scent for my taste but it makes a soft lather and didn&#x27;t leave my hands dry...</li>
            <li>After spending several days helping my daughter install a new floor, every bone and muscle in my body ached.  </li>
            <li>I love those he natural ingredients in it and that it isn&#x27;t loaded with all kinds of fake perfume.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I live in New Mexico which is a very dry climate and the lotion replaces moisture lost in our dry climate.  </li>
            <li>, the fragrance is so fresh and not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>I also tried some of the salts in my bath, which was relaxing, but there was some residue to clean out of the tub afterwards, which is the only negative I found with anything in the set.</li>

            <li> (it lasts a very long time).</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin and used the lotion immediately.</li>
            <li> I typically struggle finding a moisturizer that actually lasts throughout the day, but this one does it!</li>
            <li> In addition, my hands ended up dry and rough.  </li>
            <li> My skin usually soaks up lotion like a sponge and then I feel dry again, but this actually felt like it was saturating and staying.</li>
            <li> The candle is fragrant but not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> and I usually cringe if I get a bath set as a gift!</li>
            <li> I have always struggled with lotion not helping, being too oily, or smelling awful or too overpowering.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was looking for something to get my mom for mothers day and couldn&#x27;t decide. I saw this product and that it had great reviews, but I have given her bath sets many times. I decided to get one for myself to see how it was.  I think I may need to buy her one now!&lt;br /&gt;  For starters, I could smell it as soon as I opened the amazon package. It was a very pleasant scent that wasn&#x27;t overwhelming. The product looks very high quality, not one of those cheap sets you can find in discount stores. I love those he natural ingredients in it and that it isn&#x27;t loaded with all kinds of fake perfume.&lt;br /&gt;  I have really dry skin and used the lotion immediately. It made my skin soft, but wasn&#x27;t too oily either. I have always struggled with lotion not helping, being too oily, or smelling awful or too overpowering. This product does none of those. It is the perfect balance. It has a nice, relaxing scent to it.&lt;br /&gt;  The candle is perfect to light in the bathroom whole taking a bath to help you relax. It goes perfect with the bath salts. I personally have not tried them in the bath, but I did mix them with some coconut oil to use as a scrub. It worked great! Made my skin feel so clean and soft. I haven&#x27;t used the bar soap yet, but plan to. I received this product at a reduced price in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Smells ok but item arrived damaged during shipping. The cardboard protector for the candle is not well designed, if the item shifts the candle will get damaged. Also, the box is bigger than expected so have that in mind in case you&#x27;re planning on giving this to someone as a gift.</li>
            <li> Well received, as it was a gift.</li>
            <li> I received the Eucalyptus Blush set as a gift. The first thing I noticed is the deep scent when I opened the amazon box. I just wanted to inhale deeply over and over! I lit the candle right away and it burns well. Gives off a rich eucalyptus fragrance but is not overpowering and the glass cup is heavy and substantial. The bar soap could use a little more scent for my taste but it makes a soft lather and didn&#x27;t leave my hands dry...one of the reasons I am not usually a bar soap kinda person -- but this one is also pretty to leave on the sink edge. I followed the directions for the scrub with avocado oil in my pantry and I LOVED it...fully exfoliated with the smoothness of my own oil added. Now the lotion -- YES. That stuff is nice! My skin usually soaks up lotion like a sponge and then I feel dry again, but this actually felt like it was saturating and staying. The scent is soft, but there. This product got a thumbs up from me and I usually cringe if I get a bath set as a gift! I will be buying this as gifts to give,</li>
            <li> This is a high quality product. I tried the lavender, and was very pleased with all of it. I mixed olive oil with some of the bath salts to make a scrub, as suggested on the tin, and it makes a nice exfoliant. I also tried some of the salts in my bath, which was relaxing, but there was some residue to clean out of the tub afterwards, which is the only negative I found with anything in the set. I love the body lotion. It is rich and creamy with a lovely fragrance that is not overpowering at all. The soap also has a nice, but subtle fragrance, and does not dry out my skin, as many soaps do. I like the candle too. It makes the room smell great, without causing me to start sneezing, which is a problem I&#x27;ve had with other scented candles. I would highly recommend this if you want to pamper yourself a bit, or are looking for a really nice gift for someone.</li>
            <li> I received the Eucalyptus set as a gift. It smells wonderful and the lotion feels great. I am not a candle person but I set it on my window sill,the sun heats it and makes the room smell great. I will recomend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> By all accounts the gifts of this that I&#x27;ve give have had the women go over the moon! They found the products divine.</li>
            <li> I like the soap and candle, very lavendery,&lt;br /&gt;But the bath bubbles weren&#x27;t bubbly or fragrant</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift, and it is of the highest quality! The ingredients are all natural, the packaging is elegant, the lotion feels amazing, and the candle smells delicious without being overpowering (it lasts a very long time). I will definitely purchase more for gifts.</li>
            <li> I received this bath set as a gift and I absolutely love it! I typically struggle finding a moisturizer that actually lasts throughout the day, but this one does it! I get positive comments in the office whenever I put it on because the lavender is so potent and wonderful. I love that the products are made of essential oils. I love all the goodies in this set, this would be a great gift to spoil someone with!</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift from my husband.  I am a lavender fan and these products did not disappoint!  The lotion smells great and it is very smooth and moisturizing.  I particularly like it because the smell isn&#x27;t over powering as some lotions can be.  The bar of soap is beautiful and smells great.  I have been burning the beautiful candle which has a very pleasant lavender smell and is nice for evening relaxation.  I can&#x27;t wait to use the scrub!  Thanks for the high quality products!  The package is a great value for products of such high quality.</li>
            <li> Once I opened the box, I could immediately smell the fragrance of lavender. The soap is great and doesn&#x27;t leave your hands dry. The smell isn&#x27;t too strong for the soap or lotion.  The salt scrub is the best and has the strongest smell. I did received the product for a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.  After using the soap and lotion daily, I have fell in love with these products.  The lotion leaves your hands so soft and not greasy.  And the soap is great for your hands, esp since we have hard water.  Great combo for daily use and very happy with them :)</li>
            <li> Gave to a friend for a birthday present. She loved it!</li>
            <li> These products are incredible.  I live in New Mexico which is a very dry climate and the lotion replaces moisture lost in our dry climate.  I like that these products are made with all natural ingredients and do not have harmful chemicals.  The candle is fragrant but not overwhelming.  For years I have only used body wash because of the skin drying results I have had from using soaps but this soap is very moisturizing and leaves your skin silky smooth.  These products are a great value for the price.</li>
            <li> It is a gift so I can&#x27;t comment on much. I will say that it came on time, was well put together and looks beautiful. I will come back after Mother&#x27;s day to add more to this review. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> A fabulous gift set.  Scents are perfect.  My daughter loved the bath salts.  I loved the candle and the lotion.  I would strongly recommend all of the products in this set.</li>
            <li> This set smells amazing!  It was the first thing I noticed when I opened the box.  The products are all natural and they feel great on the skin.  Given the harsh winter we have had, the moisturizing products feel great.  I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> What a lovely gift set!  I have very sensitive skin and often break out in rashes.  I was able to use the beautifully, crafted soap, bath salts and lotion and the scent (lavender)  wasn&#x27;t over-whelming but just perfect!  I can&#x27;t wait to use it all again.  I am so happy to have a product made in the United States and made out of natural products and essential oils.  This is definitely a quality product that would make a wonderful gift for any occasion.  Trinity</li>
            <li> I have the citrus scented package and love the smell!  It is so light and refreshing! The bar soap has a good lather and I really like the scrub.  The lotion is nice and is not oily.  I like the candle too, the fragrance is so fresh and not overwhelming.  I would highly recommend this gift set.</li>
            <li> Was given as a gift and very well liked. Thank you for the great product!</li>
            <li> This gift set was even better than I expected. Not only does everything look very nice, but the product quality is great. The Lotion is probably the best lotion I have ever used, it is very smooth and not greasy. The same is true of the soap, very soft and smooth. The fragrance on the candle is very nice, i lit it in my office and was not overwhelmed by the scent but received comments all day about how great my office smelled. I have yet to try the bath salt but am looking forward to it. I plan on giving this as a gift for special occasions and recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> After spending several days helping my daughter install a new floor, every bone and muscle in my body ached.  In addition, my hands ended up dry and rough.  I thought this would be the perfect time to try out the lavender spa set.  I found the light fragrance of the candle soothing and calming and the lavender sea salt, which I added to the bath water, deeply relaxing.  The artisan soap felt creamy on my skin and knowing it was free of harmful chemicals was such a relief.  I could feel myself coming back to life!  The lightly scented lotion was a great way to finish my home spa experience.  It was smooth and moisturizing and I love that it made my hands soft again.  I slept great that night, and the next morning, I felt fully rested and renewed.  Wow, truly, who can ask for more? The quality of this gift set was reminiscent of more expensive spa treatments and I especially appreciated that I could do it at my own leisure, right in my own home!</li>
