            <li>good stuff.</li>
            <li>The bar was in good shape with no breakage and comes with a plastic storage case.  </li>
            <li>Just remember to keep a good lather - if you missed a spot, reapply shaving cream/soap before you try to trim it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for nicks from shaving , and chigger bites too.</li>

            <li>Works and a good price.</li>
            <li>So the purity and quality of the block is actually really good.  </li>
            <li>Thank you,very good product I will recommend you to all my friends.</li>
            <li>Plus it is a good size</li>
            <li>This comes with it&#x27;s own case, which makes storage very nice.</li>
            <li>most of the time i use Shavex &amp; I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li>This is a nice sized chunk of alum at a really good price.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s compacted nicely.</li>
            <li>This is a high-quality block, and the included plastic case is a nice feature.  </li>
            <li>Comes with a nice plastic case for storage which is a plus.</li>
            <li>The case is flimsy but still a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>/&gt;By the way, the straight razor, that I&#x27;m now using, was also purchased from Amazon, and I&#x27;m very impressed with it&#x27;s quality.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;By the way, the straight razor, that I&#x27;m now using, was also purchased from Amazon, and I&#x27;m very impressed with it&#x27;s quality.  </li>
            <li>This is a good-sized alum block for the money, and it comes with a handy plastic container if you want to travel with it.  </li>
            <li>It works great as an antihemorrhagic, leaves the skin smooth and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li>You pay about 6x more for this one because of the branding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice to have a carrying case for your alum, though.</li>
            <li>Much more effective than salt water.</li>
            <li>Potassium alum is the kind that is designed for shaving, while ammonium alum is stronger and so will burn a lot more, and is therefore used in deodorants and the like.</li>
            <li>Many reviewers even comment on how nice the plastic box is.  </li>
            <li>Many reviewers even comment on how nice the plastic box is.  </li>
            <li>So far very happy with the Osma Alum Block.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>and very quickly too!  </li>
            <li>block itself is nicely packaged in a plastic box so it easy to take it with me on my travels.</li>
            <li>nope there is more to say .....</li>
            <li>Usable, but for the price i would have assumed better quality control.</li>
            <li>It sure stops the bleeding if you cut yourself.</li>
            <li>What more is there to say?</li>
            <li>Could use a better case, but beggars can&#x27;t be choosers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are many alum shaving blocks available, this one came with a nice travel case.</li>
            <li>Love this block.</li>
            <li>You can purchase a SOAP case at most stores that carry Bath Products and any Alum Block can be stored in it.</li>
            <li>make sure its dry&lt;br /&gt;8.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many lotions, pre shaves, after shaves, etc</li>
            <li>Well it for sure does the job it&#x27;s described to do.</li>
            <li>I needed more product, and I paid more money for more product.  </li>
            <li>My favorite alum block.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hurt in any way but reminds you you&#x27;re a man :)</li>
            <li>Make sure that you buy potassium alum instead of ammonium alum.</li>
            <li>Totally satisfied with the quality and packaging.</li>
            <li>Plus it comes with a case for storage or travel which many others don&#x27;t provide.  </li>
            <li>I love shaving on the weekend when I can leave the alum on my face for about an hour.</li>
            <li>&quot; I can say it works for calming the skin of most superficial ailments too.</li>
            <li>it is a 125 gram large alum block that comes in a carry/travel case for storage and transport as well as most importantly it works !!!</li>
            <li>First the good -does</li>
            <li>It is very light weight, but seems fine for the purpose and the cost.</li>
            <li>It had a quick burn but it felt nice after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But now I enjoy shaving better than ever.</li>
            <li>fortunately thats exactly what i was expecting when i bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;nice cooling astringent, does a good job of sealing nicks and closing pores after a shave.  </li>
            <li>GOOD PRODUCT, FAST DELIVERY.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m lucky the box may hold be able to survive for more than a month or so with care.  </li>
            <li>it chips easily, and</li>
            <li>Easy to use and eliminates the need for alcohol-based after shave.  </li>
            <li>The case is a nice touch, and it&#x27;s a pretty sizeable block.</li>
            <li>did it&#x27;s job and did it well, a fine block of alum.</li>
            <li>The case is very cheap but still does a good job for daily storage.</li>
            <li>smooth skin...</li>
            <li>It is 100% fragrance free, and does not string when applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fantastic product and service ...</li>
            <li>without nicking myself, I enjoy the skin-tightening sensation post-shave of wetting an alum block and rubbing it over my freshly-shaved face, before applying any after-shave lotion or balm.</li>
            <li>The case is inexpensive (cheap), but it serves the purpose.  </li>
            <li>I will see where I can get 2-5 blocks at once for a cheap price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The instant feedback on how well your technique is working is great to.</li>
            <li>your face baby smooth.</li>
            <li>As a former pawn in the great shave conspiracy, I found myself in need of an alum block.</li>
            <li>Thank goodness for Amazon Prime&#x27;s free two day shipping.  </li>
            <li>My first time using this, but it is pretty good</li>
            <li>but so far so good</li>
            <li>I am so tempted to take the case as my own, but this was so cheap that I really should just buy one for myself.</li>
            <li>Great alum block, and it comes in a nice little plastic case!</li>
            <li>Starts out pretty smooth and gets better with use.</li>
            <li>Heals cuts quickly and leaves the skin feeling smooth.  </li>
            <li>High quality block that gets ultra smooth as you use it and becomes better with time.</li>
            <li>By far the best post shave product I&#x27;ve ever used, it makes your shin burn a little more than after shave but makes your pours tighten, elemanates  a lot of razor</li>
            <li>This alum rock has been a great addition to my wet shaving ritual.</li>
            <li>Gives your face a cool feeling when finished shaving.</li>
            <li>Wait a minute or two and rinse with cool water.</li>
            <li>The plastic case solves the problem &amp;#34;what to do with the alum when it&#x27;s drying?&amp;#34;  I bought this for my nephew who I am gifting a full wet-shaving set for his 30th birthday.  </li>
            <li>I found the top portion of the block nice and smooth when I wet it and rubed it over my neck and face after shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a very unique functional design, is stainless steel, and uses Feather replaceable blades.  </li>
            <li>It has a very unique functional design, is stainless steel, and uses Feather replaceable blades.  </li>
            <li>I received my Shavex alum block very quickly, and after one use, it works exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>case was super flimsy but it works.</li>
            <li>This is super stuff.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using an alum block for far more years than I care to think of, and yes, it&#x27;s an important part of my morning shaving routine, followed by an aftershave cream or balm.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s loyal users.  </li>
            <li>Awesome, long lasting, large, and a plastic case #WINNING</li>
            <li>It tightens my skin without making it dry or itchy and in a world of overpriced shaving products it certainly is a good value.</li>
            <li>The block is nice and big.</li>
            <li>so i cut myself and get razor burn after the shave i wash the irritated or cut areas and it stops the bleeding and feels fresh afterword</li>
            <li>This block is fresh and comes with a plastic container.</li>
            <li>Stands up to water, handy plastic case (I travel a lot), works as advertised, low price.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice block feels like it will last forever, with a light-duty but useful storage case.</li>
            <li>The steps in processing blocks of this type, would seem, most likely, to be fairly straightforward and not difficult to do well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is an effective styptic for minor nicks</li>
            <li>This really helps to quickly sanitize your face from razor burns, nicks, and cuts.</li>
            <li>I soon found that it was going to take a lot more than 220, or even 120 grit sandpaper, especially to even begin to smooth out that one particular side&#x27;s surface on the block.  </li>
            <li>and it is very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>There is a little sting which feels good.</li>
            <li>THANKS!</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re ready to go!</li>
            <li>The plastic case is pretty flimsy.</li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time this morning after my first shave with the DE razor, and it worked well</li>
            <li>I noticed improvement after my first use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>During hot weather, a lump of this in your pocket will help not chafing.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>This block is bigger than most, so it&#x27;s a bit easier (IMHO) to use.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Finally, alum burns more than any aftershave I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>Does a great job on closing minor nicks and definitely gives you feedback on where you may have been to aggressive with your razor.</li>
            <li>Actually, yesterday I noticed one side of the block to still be in need of some more sanding</li>
            <li>When the time comes I will, most likely, order another Shavex Alum Block.  </li>
            <li>When the time comes I will, most likely, order another Shavex Alum Block.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a great deal compared to other brands and sellers out there, expecially with it&#x27;s carrying case!!!!</li>
            <li>It is just the right size and it is real ALUM not</li>
            <li>This is a large alum block, and will probably last forever for me - good thing, because I&#x27;d likely never buy it again.</li>
            <li>BUT, at the end of the day, I would rather maintain a positive attitude.  </li>
            <li>BUT, at the end of the day, I would rather maintain a positive attitude.  </li>
            <li>Based on reviews here and a few web sites, I decided to try incorporate an Alum block - and I&#x27;m very glad</li>
            <li>, honestly, I&#x27;m going to give Shavex the &amp;#34;benefit of the doubt&amp;#34;, and make the assumption that the particular alum block that I received, was a very rare exception (to the usual very high quality alum blocks that Shavex produces).  </li>
            <li>Alum is a great post shave product, it will close most minor weepers following my less than stellar shaves.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to dry the block before putting it away (as you would have to with any alum block) - the case will trap in any moisture and eat away at the block.   </li>
            <li>the block is a good size and will last a long time</li>
            <li>I find the single blade of a DE razor cuts better and causes almost no irritation</li>
            <li>Block arrived with a large crack or fissure in one side.  </li>
            <li>This is a vey large, semi translucent block that is well packaged to sit on your bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li>I use it everyday and love it!</li>
            <li>the price may be slightly higher than others and cheaper than some as well that tells me I made the right choice with shavex as the old saying goes</li>
            <li>But it is a nice sized block and after using mine for a little while, it still shows no use.</li>
            <li>Very convenient.</li>
            <li>It worked really well rubbing it on my face post-shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>delivered fast.... still using it as deodorant</li>
            <li>so cant really say if the block will hold until the end....</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Alum serves several important roles as a disinfectant and astringent.</li>
            <li>This block of Alum works as really well as an after shave.</li>
            <li>I get INTENSE stinging in places where I  have weepers and nicks.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really want to send it back, primarily because I recently began shaving with a straight razor, which has somewhat of a learning curve, resulting in a lot more frequent nicks and abrasions (than when using a trusty multi-blade razor).  </li>
            <li>It was a lot more rough than the others.  </li>
            <li>This bar really helps and you can feel it working, I like</li>
            <li>What can I say its a simple alum block that is quite smooth</li>
            <li>This was worth the buy for d/e shaving the product gets in very smoothly into the my very sensitive skin, and I expect to last for a very long time so in the long run its very cheap.</li>
            <li>decided that I could &amp;#34;make&amp;#34; the surfaces of my new alum block, into what they should have been like, in the first place, using some sandpaper and elbow grease.  </li>
            <li>Great addition to wet shaving or any other shaving.</li>
            <li>One of the two broad surfaces of this block literally felt like a roughly finished concrete driveway... the kind of driveway that you would  n e v</li>
            <li>I am new to straight razor shaving a.k.a cutthroat razor shaving and this block is a saver.</li>
            <li>I get an occasional nick or a cut with the blade and this alum quickly stops bleeding and closes up the pores.</li>
            <li>and they all give me the same lovely red bumps and rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until</li>
            <li>I mainly bought this brand because of the case that comes with it.</li>
            <li>Decent alum.</li>
            <li>I love the bloc because it provides a finished look after you complete your wet shave ritual.  </li>
            <li>larger than the others I&#x27;ve seen, and seems to be lasting a good long time.</li>
            <li>I even bought a second - easy to apply - leaves my face fealing sealed and tight - ready for a full day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>Others have mentioned that the plastic case is not of high quality.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend to anyone</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly, highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>your new to wet shaving or just want a more natural deodorant</li>
            <li>B004QVBFBM Alum Block 110gr - Shavex]]I purchased this fine item from Amazon and highly recomment the alum block by Shavex for all the wet shaving people out there.</li>
            <li>While a styptic pencil stings a little more, the pencil works just as well at stopping bleeding and does not cause the razor bumps on my face to stand out.  </li>
            <li>I rinse mine clean and air dry after each use.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, it just doesn&#x27;t kill razor burn like a normal aftershave.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, the burn does not last very long, and as I said above, it will prevent further bleeding and disinfect all those cuts, so overall a bit of burning is quite a fair price to pay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>Plus you get the right size plastic box to put the chunky back in after your done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dray</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to assume that this particular alum block, just somehow managed to slip past, what is normally an outstanding quality control system.  </li>
            <li>New SR user.</li>
            <li>And if (or more likely, when) I do nick myself, rubbing a wet alum block over the insulted skin</li>
            <li>Lasts a very long time, if you don&#x27;t drop it, and helps to stop bleeding from small to good size nicks.</li>
            <li>Useful in shaving both to stop the bleeding on any minor nicks and to tone the skin.  </li>
            <li>Size is larger than most other alum blocks, and has a plastic case.  </li>
            <li>Very happy with the alum block but disappointed with the flimsy plastic case that came with it.</li>
            <li>Considering the very small cost of including a plastic box, that would be able to function well, and easily last as long as the alum block, itself, you would think that Shavex would have a lot more pride in how their product is presented to</li>
            <li>This block is my first and only alum block.</li>
            <li>I could easily deal with the fact that this Shavex Alum Block&#x27;s surfaces were quite uneven and asymmetrical.  </li>
            <li>It was smooth on one long side and mostly smooth on the other long side.</li>
            <li>I make sure to dry the block with a towel and leave the lid open for several hours after use.</li>
            <li>Smooth shave and little to no sting lets you know that your blade is sharpe and you&#x27;ve mastered the art of shaving.</li>
            <li>The days of the old styptic pencil are gone.</li>
            <li>A must have for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and I do have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I use it as an underarm deodorant, and it completely stops all odor for hours on end.  </li>
            <li>Can use as a post shave skin bracer or natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural and helps to heal the skin.</li>
            <li>When I was a young child and had a mouth sore, my grandmother would dab her finger into a jar of alum powder and apply her finger onto the mouth sore.</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>you owe it to yourself to complete the experience with alum.</li>
            <li>It feels good with a gentle glide over a wet face and neck, and there is a dramatic improvement in skin bumps, razor nicks, electic razor burn, etc.</li>
            <li>Moreover, alum is even useful for those with acne, due to its disinfectant and pore tightening qualities.</li>
            <li>I may go buy a small bar soap container - the types you use when you travel - at the local Walmart, but other than that inconsequential issue, this is still a good option for anyone using alum post-shave.  </li>
            <li>Its just that the thing is so small it doesn&#x27;t fit my hand well.  </li>
            <li>of all, this is a large bar, almost as big as a standard size bar of soap.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really add any new information to the other reviews, so I&#x27;ll just echo the 5-star ratings and urge you to buy this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this one for several weeks now, and it&#x27;s still like new.</li>
            <li>i use a double edge saftey razor i am quite new</li>
            <li>The container is much appreciated since it helps keep the block dry when stored.</li>
            <li>is this 56 year old guy using it?&lt;br /&gt;Because, when you grow up and shave like an adult, with a double edge</li>
            <li>As a suggestion for those with sensitive skin - look into a double edge safety razor and some old shaving soap.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely big enough for anyone who wants to use it as a deodorant bar.</li>
            <li>The replaceable blades avoid the necessity of having to strop (and, occasionally, hone) the blade before use, as is the case with a traditional straight razor.  </li>
            <li>The replaceable blades avoid the necessity of having to strop (and, occasionally, hone) the blade before use, as is the case with a traditional straight razor.  </li>
            <li>a rule, I rarely quibble over little discrepancies with products that I buy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m clumsy and I&#x27;d be more likely to drop (and break) a smaller block.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for a month, and it barely shows any use.</li>
            <li>The plastic box that came with my Shavex Alum Block, was about as rinky-dink as you can get...  extremely thin and barely able to maintain it&#x27;s shape.  </li>
            <li>I have used about twice weekly(sometimes more, sometimes less depending on how often I shave) for almost a year and a half still have quite a bit left.</li>
            <li>I have not used any other Alum Blocks to compare with but this has worked very well.</li>
            <li>I recently switched to the old school way of shaving with a safety razor and a double edged blade.</li>
            <li>;, is that the surfaces of the particular block of alum, that I received, were EiXiTiRiEiMiEiLiY ROUGH.  </li>
            <li>Due to this, I would have liked to have seen some venting in the case and possibly a couple of small plastic pieces to elevate the block ensuring the bottom is dry.  </li>
            <li>But if you have cut yourself, or if you&#x27;re just learning to wetshave and have dozens of little nicks from trying to shave against the grain for the first time....</li>
            <li>bottom line is that this particular Shavex Alum Block arrived with surfaces so rough, that I can not imagine that anyone would be willing to slide it across their face following a wet shave;  and certainly not, in the event that they sustained any skin abrasions or nicks, during their shave.  </li>

            <li> good stuff.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s good for nicks from shaving , and chigger bites too.</li>

            <li> Works and a good price.</li>
            <li> So the purity and quality of the block is actually really good.  </li>
            <li> Thank you,very good product I will recommend you to all my friends.</li>
            <li> Plus it is a good size</li>
            <li> This comes with it&#x27;s own case, which makes storage very nice.</li>
            <li> most of the time i use Shavex &amp; I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is a nice sized chunk of alum at a really good price.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s compacted nicely.</li>
            <li> This is a high-quality block, and the included plastic case is a nice feature.  </li>
            <li> Comes with a nice plastic case for storage which is a plus.</li>
            <li> The case is flimsy but still a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> /&gt;By the way, the straight razor, that I&#x27;m now using, was also purchased from Amazon, and I&#x27;m very impressed with it&#x27;s quality.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;By the way, the straight razor, that I&#x27;m now using, was also purchased from Amazon, and I&#x27;m very impressed with it&#x27;s quality.  </li>
            <li> This is a good-sized alum block for the money, and it comes with a handy plastic container if you want to travel with it.  </li>
            <li> It works great as an antihemorrhagic, leaves the skin smooth and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li> You pay about 6x more for this one because of the branding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice to have a carrying case for your alum, though.</li>
            <li> Much more effective than salt water.</li>
            <li> Potassium alum is the kind that is designed for shaving, while ammonium alum is stronger and so will burn a lot more, and is therefore used in deodorants and the like.</li>
            <li> Many reviewers even comment on how nice the plastic box is.  </li>
            <li> Many reviewers even comment on how nice the plastic box is.  </li>
            <li> So far very happy with the Osma Alum Block.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> and very quickly too!  </li>
            <li> block itself is nicely packaged in a plastic box so it easy to take it with me on my travels.</li>
            <li> nope there is more to say .....</li>
            <li> Usable, but for the price i would have assumed better quality control.</li>
            <li> It sure stops the bleeding if you cut yourself.</li>
            <li> What more is there to say?</li>
            <li> Could use a better case, but beggars can&#x27;t be choosers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are many alum shaving blocks available, this one came with a nice travel case.</li>
            <li> Love this block.</li>
            <li> You can purchase a SOAP case at most stores that carry Bath Products and any Alum Block can be stored in it.</li>
            <li> make sure its dry&lt;br /&gt;8.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many lotions, pre shaves, after shaves, etc</li>
            <li> Well it for sure does the job it&#x27;s described to do.</li>
            <li> I needed more product, and I paid more money for more product.  </li>
            <li> My favorite alum block.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt in any way but reminds you you&#x27;re a man :)</li>
            <li> Make sure that you buy potassium alum instead of ammonium alum.</li>
            <li> Totally satisfied with the quality and packaging.</li>
            <li> Plus it comes with a case for storage or travel which many others don&#x27;t provide.  </li>
            <li> I love shaving on the weekend when I can leave the alum on my face for about an hour.</li>
            <li> &quot; I can say it works for calming the skin of most superficial ailments too.</li>
            <li> it is a 125 gram large alum block that comes in a carry/travel case for storage and transport as well as most importantly it works !!!</li>
            <li> First the good -does</li>
            <li> It is very light weight, but seems fine for the purpose and the cost.</li>
            <li> It had a quick burn but it felt nice after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But now I enjoy shaving better than ever.</li>
            <li> fortunately thats exactly what i was expecting when i bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;nice cooling astringent, does a good job of sealing nicks and closing pores after a shave.  </li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCT, FAST DELIVERY.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m lucky the box may hold be able to survive for more than a month or so with care.  </li>
            <li> it chips easily, and</li>
            <li> Easy to use and eliminates the need for alcohol-based after shave.  </li>
            <li> The case is a nice touch, and it&#x27;s a pretty sizeable block.</li>
            <li> did it&#x27;s job and did it well, a fine block of alum.</li>
            <li> The case is very cheap but still does a good job for daily storage.</li>
            <li> smooth skin...</li>
            <li> It is 100% fragrance free, and does not string when applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fantastic product and service ...</li>
            <li> without nicking myself, I enjoy the skin-tightening sensation post-shave of wetting an alum block and rubbing it over my freshly-shaved face, before applying any after-shave lotion or balm.</li>
            <li> The case is inexpensive (cheap), but it serves the purpose.  </li>
            <li> I will see where I can get 2-5 blocks at once for a cheap price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The instant feedback on how well your technique is working is great to.</li>
            <li> your face baby smooth.</li>
            <li> As a former pawn in the great shave conspiracy, I found myself in need of an alum block.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness for Amazon Prime&#x27;s free two day shipping.  </li>
            <li> My first time using this, but it is pretty good</li>
            <li> but so far so good</li>
            <li> I am so tempted to take the case as my own, but this was so cheap that I really should just buy one for myself.</li>
            <li> Great alum block, and it comes in a nice little plastic case!</li>
            <li> Starts out pretty smooth and gets better with use.</li>
            <li> Heals cuts quickly and leaves the skin feeling smooth.  </li>
            <li> High quality block that gets ultra smooth as you use it and becomes better with time.</li>
            <li> By far the best post shave product I&#x27;ve ever used, it makes your shin burn a little more than after shave but makes your pours tighten, elemanates  a lot of razor</li>
            <li> This alum rock has been a great addition to my wet shaving ritual.</li>
            <li> Gives your face a cool feeling when finished shaving.</li>
            <li> Wait a minute or two and rinse with cool water.</li>
            <li> The plastic case solves the problem &amp;#34;what to do with the alum when it&#x27;s drying?&amp;#34;  I bought this for my nephew who I am gifting a full wet-shaving set for his 30th birthday.  </li>
            <li> I found the top portion of the block nice and smooth when I wet it and rubed it over my neck and face after shaving.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a very unique functional design, is stainless steel, and uses Feather replaceable blades.  </li>
            <li> It has a very unique functional design, is stainless steel, and uses Feather replaceable blades.  </li>
            <li> I received my Shavex alum block very quickly, and after one use, it works exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> case was super flimsy but it works.</li>
            <li> This is super stuff.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an alum block for far more years than I care to think of, and yes, it&#x27;s an important part of my morning shaving routine, followed by an aftershave cream or balm.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s loyal users.  </li>
            <li> Awesome, long lasting, large, and a plastic case #WINNING</li>
            <li> It tightens my skin without making it dry or itchy and in a world of overpriced shaving products it certainly is a good value.</li>
            <li> The block is nice and big.</li>
            <li> so i cut myself and get razor burn after the shave i wash the irritated or cut areas and it stops the bleeding and feels fresh afterword</li>
            <li> This block is fresh and comes with a plastic container.</li>
            <li> Stands up to water, handy plastic case (I travel a lot), works as advertised, low price.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice block feels like it will last forever, with a light-duty but useful storage case.</li>
            <li> The steps in processing blocks of this type, would seem, most likely, to be fairly straightforward and not difficult to do well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is an effective styptic for minor nicks</li>
            <li> This really helps to quickly sanitize your face from razor burns, nicks, and cuts.</li>
            <li> I soon found that it was going to take a lot more than 220, or even 120 grit sandpaper, especially to even begin to smooth out that one particular side&#x27;s surface on the block.  </li>
            <li> and it is very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> There is a little sting which feels good.</li>
            <li> THANKS!</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re ready to go!</li>
            <li> The plastic case is pretty flimsy.</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time this morning after my first shave with the DE razor, and it worked well</li>
            <li> I noticed improvement after my first use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> During hot weather, a lump of this in your pocket will help not chafing.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> This block is bigger than most, so it&#x27;s a bit easier (IMHO) to use.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Finally, alum burns more than any aftershave I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> Does a great job on closing minor nicks and definitely gives you feedback on where you may have been to aggressive with your razor.</li>
            <li> Actually, yesterday I noticed one side of the block to still be in need of some more sanding</li>
            <li> When the time comes I will, most likely, order another Shavex Alum Block.  </li>
            <li> When the time comes I will, most likely, order another Shavex Alum Block.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a great deal compared to other brands and sellers out there, expecially with it&#x27;s carrying case!!!!</li>
            <li> It is just the right size and it is real ALUM not</li>
            <li> This is a large alum block, and will probably last forever for me - good thing, because I&#x27;d likely never buy it again.</li>
            <li> BUT, at the end of the day, I would rather maintain a positive attitude.  </li>
            <li> BUT, at the end of the day, I would rather maintain a positive attitude.  </li>
            <li> Based on reviews here and a few web sites, I decided to try incorporate an Alum block - and I&#x27;m very glad</li>
            <li> , honestly, I&#x27;m going to give Shavex the &amp;#34;benefit of the doubt&amp;#34;, and make the assumption that the particular alum block that I received, was a very rare exception (to the usual very high quality alum blocks that Shavex produces).  </li>
            <li> Alum is a great post shave product, it will close most minor weepers following my less than stellar shaves.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to dry the block before putting it away (as you would have to with any alum block) - the case will trap in any moisture and eat away at the block.   </li>
            <li> the block is a good size and will last a long time</li>
            <li> I find the single blade of a DE razor cuts better and causes almost no irritation</li>
            <li> Block arrived with a large crack or fissure in one side.  </li>
            <li> This is a vey large, semi translucent block that is well packaged to sit on your bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday and love it!</li>
            <li> the price may be slightly higher than others and cheaper than some as well that tells me I made the right choice with shavex as the old saying goes</li>
            <li> But it is a nice sized block and after using mine for a little while, it still shows no use.</li>
            <li> Very convenient.</li>
            <li> It worked really well rubbing it on my face post-shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> delivered fast.... still using it as deodorant</li>
            <li> so cant really say if the block will hold until the end....</li>
            <li> Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Alum serves several important roles as a disinfectant and astringent.</li>
            <li> This block of Alum works as really well as an after shave.</li>
            <li> I get INTENSE stinging in places where I  have weepers and nicks.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really want to send it back, primarily because I recently began shaving with a straight razor, which has somewhat of a learning curve, resulting in a lot more frequent nicks and abrasions (than when using a trusty multi-blade razor).  </li>
            <li> It was a lot more rough than the others.  </li>
            <li> This bar really helps and you can feel it working, I like</li>
            <li> What can I say its a simple alum block that is quite smooth</li>
            <li> This was worth the buy for d/e shaving the product gets in very smoothly into the my very sensitive skin, and I expect to last for a very long time so in the long run its very cheap.</li>
            <li> decided that I could &amp;#34;make&amp;#34; the surfaces of my new alum block, into what they should have been like, in the first place, using some sandpaper and elbow grease.  </li>
            <li> Great addition to wet shaving or any other shaving.</li>
            <li> One of the two broad surfaces of this block literally felt like a roughly finished concrete driveway... the kind of driveway that you would  n e v</li>
            <li> I am new to straight razor shaving a.k.a cutthroat razor shaving and this block is a saver.</li>
            <li> I get an occasional nick or a cut with the blade and this alum quickly stops bleeding and closes up the pores.</li>
            <li> and they all give me the same lovely red bumps and rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until</li>
            <li> I mainly bought this brand because of the case that comes with it.</li>
            <li> Decent alum.</li>
            <li> I love the bloc because it provides a finished look after you complete your wet shave ritual.  </li>
            <li> larger than the others I&#x27;ve seen, and seems to be lasting a good long time.</li>
            <li> I even bought a second - easy to apply - leaves my face fealing sealed and tight - ready for a full day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Others have mentioned that the plastic case is not of high quality.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly, highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> your new to wet shaving or just want a more natural deodorant</li>
            <li> B004QVBFBM Alum Block 110gr - Shavex]]I purchased this fine item from Amazon and highly recomment the alum block by Shavex for all the wet shaving people out there.</li>
            <li> While a styptic pencil stings a little more, the pencil works just as well at stopping bleeding and does not cause the razor bumps on my face to stand out.  </li>
            <li> I rinse mine clean and air dry after each use.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, it just doesn&#x27;t kill razor burn like a normal aftershave.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, the burn does not last very long, and as I said above, it will prevent further bleeding and disinfect all those cuts, so overall a bit of burning is quite a fair price to pay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> Plus you get the right size plastic box to put the chunky back in after your done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dray</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to assume that this particular alum block, just somehow managed to slip past, what is normally an outstanding quality control system.  </li>
            <li> New SR user.</li>
            <li> And if (or more likely, when) I do nick myself, rubbing a wet alum block over the insulted skin</li>
            <li> Lasts a very long time, if you don&#x27;t drop it, and helps to stop bleeding from small to good size nicks.</li>
            <li> Useful in shaving both to stop the bleeding on any minor nicks and to tone the skin.  </li>
            <li> Size is larger than most other alum blocks, and has a plastic case.  </li>
            <li> Very happy with the alum block but disappointed with the flimsy plastic case that came with it.</li>
            <li> Considering the very small cost of including a plastic box, that would be able to function well, and easily last as long as the alum block, itself, you would think that Shavex would have a lot more pride in how their product is presented to</li>
            <li> This block is my first and only alum block.</li>
            <li> I could easily deal with the fact that this Shavex Alum Block&#x27;s surfaces were quite uneven and asymmetrical.  </li>
            <li> It was smooth on one long side and mostly smooth on the other long side.</li>
            <li> I make sure to dry the block with a towel and leave the lid open for several hours after use.</li>
            <li> Smooth shave and little to no sting lets you know that your blade is sharpe and you&#x27;ve mastered the art of shaving.</li>
            <li> The days of the old styptic pencil are gone.</li>
            <li> A must have for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and I do have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I use it as an underarm deodorant, and it completely stops all odor for hours on end.  </li>
            <li> Can use as a post shave skin bracer or natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural and helps to heal the skin.</li>
            <li> When I was a young child and had a mouth sore, my grandmother would dab her finger into a jar of alum powder and apply her finger onto the mouth sore.</li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> you owe it to yourself to complete the experience with alum.</li>
            <li> It feels good with a gentle glide over a wet face and neck, and there is a dramatic improvement in skin bumps, razor nicks, electic razor burn, etc.</li>
            <li> Moreover, alum is even useful for those with acne, due to its disinfectant and pore tightening qualities.</li>
            <li> I may go buy a small bar soap container - the types you use when you travel - at the local Walmart, but other than that inconsequential issue, this is still a good option for anyone using alum post-shave.  </li>
            <li> Its just that the thing is so small it doesn&#x27;t fit my hand well.  </li>
            <li> of all, this is a large bar, almost as big as a standard size bar of soap.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really add any new information to the other reviews, so I&#x27;ll just echo the 5-star ratings and urge you to buy this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this one for several weeks now, and it&#x27;s still like new.</li>
            <li> i use a double edge saftey razor i am quite new</li>
            <li> The container is much appreciated since it helps keep the block dry when stored.</li>
            <li> is this 56 year old guy using it?&lt;br /&gt;Because, when you grow up and shave like an adult, with a double edge</li>
            <li> As a suggestion for those with sensitive skin - look into a double edge safety razor and some old shaving soap.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely big enough for anyone who wants to use it as a deodorant bar.</li>
            <li> The replaceable blades avoid the necessity of having to strop (and, occasionally, hone) the blade before use, as is the case with a traditional straight razor.  </li>
            <li> The replaceable blades avoid the necessity of having to strop (and, occasionally, hone) the blade before use, as is the case with a traditional straight razor.  </li>
            <li> a rule, I rarely quibble over little discrepancies with products that I buy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m clumsy and I&#x27;d be more likely to drop (and break) a smaller block.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a month, and it barely shows any use.</li>
            <li> The plastic box that came with my Shavex Alum Block, was about as rinky-dink as you can get...  extremely thin and barely able to maintain it&#x27;s shape.  </li>
            <li> I have used about twice weekly(sometimes more, sometimes less depending on how often I shave) for almost a year and a half still have quite a bit left.</li>
            <li> I have not used any other Alum Blocks to compare with but this has worked very well.</li>
            <li> I recently switched to the old school way of shaving with a safety razor and a double edged blade.</li>
            <li> ;, is that the surfaces of the particular block of alum, that I received, were EiXiTiRiEiMiEiLiY ROUGH.  </li>
            <li> Due to this, I would have liked to have seen some venting in the case and possibly a couple of small plastic pieces to elevate the block ensuring the bottom is dry.  </li>
            <li> But if you have cut yourself, or if you&#x27;re just learning to wetshave and have dozens of little nicks from trying to shave against the grain for the first time....</li>
            <li> bottom line is that this particular Shavex Alum Block arrived with surfaces so rough, that I can not imagine that anyone would be willing to slide it across their face following a wet shave;  and certainly not, in the event that they sustained any skin abrasions or nicks, during their shave.  </li>
            <li> have you to actually nick myself, but frequently have a few spots near my neck that weep blood after shaving - using this block, wet, on a wet face closes them up and actually doesn&#x27;t do more than slightly sting (less than aftershave).</li>
            <li> Second, from what I&#x27;ve gathered alum will start to dissolve if left in water, so you should always dry it before storing it, or leave it somewhere that it can dry naturally.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s, also, about half the cost of the better than average traditional straight razor, and doesn&#x27;t require the up-front cost of expensive accessories, such as quality Japanese Water Stones for honing and a quality Strop to keep it shave-ready.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s, also, about half the cost of the better than average traditional straight razor, and doesn&#x27;t require the up-front cost of expensive accessories, such as quality Japanese Water Stones for honing and a quality Strop to keep it shave-ready.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve been shaving without an Alum block for the past 24 years, I&#x27;ve been missing out an important shaving accessory.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few months now, not on a daily basis though and still looks new.  </li>
            <li> After shaving underarms (which really reduces odor), using Shavex, &amp; using a small amount of body spray, it protects me all day.</li>
            <li> It stings less than a styptic pencil, and it may be just the product you need if you don;t have sensitive skin.    </li>
            <li> I leave it in the case with the lid open, so it can dry out during the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going to last for a long , long time.</li>
            <li> I definitely reccommend this over both less and more expensive blocks.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I&#x27;ll need to find something else to store the block in because the plastic case came split at the corner and doesn&#x27;t even fit the lid now.</li>
            <li> Shavex is well known among double edged safety razor wet shavers.  </li>
            <li> This is a larger block of Alum than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Stops bleeding almost immediately from minor shaving nicks and doesn&#x27;t sting or burn (for me atleast).  </li>
            <li> I have no problem, whatsoever, with the quality of the alum, itself, or it&#x27;s ability to do what it&#x27;s intended to do, following wet</li>
            <li> /&gt;Relatively speaking, there&#x27;s another a minor issue.  </li>
            <li> if you spend too much you just got taken too little and you wasted your money.....</li>
            <li> Other than that this is just an alum block, and they&#x27;re all the same.</li>
            <li> Wait 5 minutes and rinse off any residue and dry your shaving area.</li>
            <li> Wash off the block and dry it with a paper towel&lt;</li>
            <li> I was told that Alum Bloc really dry out your skin...not this one.</li>
            <li> let it dry then rinse.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since the plastic container doesn&#x27;t have any holes, I store my block on a soap dish to allow it to dry well.  </li>
            <li> The case gives you for immediate storage for the bloc instead of leaving it on a towel to dry.  </li>
            <li> Believe it or not, I even resorted to using a random orbital sander (with some success), during my initial smoothing efforts.  </li>
            <li> As such, when I&#x27;d work down to a void (where there was air instead of alum), the edges would get a bit</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been wetshaving and using it for a little over a week, and I&#x27;ve already noticed a reduction in my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never before written a negative review on anything that I&#x27;ve purchased from Amazon, and that would include a proverbial &amp;#34;ton&amp;#34; of products, over the last several years.  </li>
            <li> Kinda rough</li>
            <li> glide it over your wet face for 60 seconds, leave it alone for 60 seconds,&lt;br /&gt;Rinse off...</li>
            <li> be careful not to drop it</li>
            <li> Wet the block, glide it over the areas that you shaved&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re wet shaving without an alum block or styptic pencil:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leave your face wet after rinsing residual lather and just rub the end of the block over your skin.  </li>
            <li> The alum closed up the sore immediately.&lt;br</li>
            <li> do need to be careful with alum, however.</li>
            <li> Just wet and rub the bar on your face.</li>
            <li> Case closed.</li>
            <li> It braces, but I assume that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> have seen some crumbling on the bottom side of the block, which as a rough feel, and the corners are a bit pointy.  </li>
            <li> Case made of very cheap plastic, and it arrived already cracked and half-broken ... had to repair it myself with tape :(&lt;br</li>
            <li> You simply cool off your face with cold water, leaving it wet, and rub the alum block all over the shaved area.</li>
            <li> What I have found is that the block has to be dried completely before shutting the lid or small crystals</li>
            <li> I needed the alum block to doctor up all those little shaving war wounds, to avoid the risk of needing professional medical attention, or worse yet, a transfusion or something of the like!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> rub this stone over your wet race after shaving, and feel the difference!</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t want the sharp edges on your face.</li>
            <li> This is just a big chunk of alum for a small price.  </li>
            <li> No better way to test the quality of your shave than to run one of these over your face after your last pass.</li>
            <li> will develop making the block extremely scratchy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an alum block like any other, just feel like it wasn&#x27;t as dense as I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li> Even though it does not have a cooling effect &amp; tends to leave the skin a little dry after using, it does tighten the skin &amp; reduce irritation from shaving.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want that, so be very careful with it.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the plastic case will not stay closed.</li>
            <li> It burns when applied, which I like, but unlike a typical liquid splash-on aftershave, the burning does not completely subside after a few seconds.</li>
            <li> It got a lot of little holes and a rough surface.    </li>
            <li> I switched to wet shaving with a safety razor a few months ago.</li>
            <li> But my guess is that this is potash alum as it stings much less.</li>
            <li> This stings way less than the ammonia alum that I used.</li>
            <li> The alum closes any slight wounds, and soothes the pores.</li>
            <li> i purchased it a year and half ago and still using it ...</li>
            <li> I think it will last at least a few years.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t skimp on something less or over spend on some chalky stick.</li>
            <li> block arrived in one piece, with a small corner missing, but that is to be expected with such a hard block.</li>
            <li> No frills, no special features (for an alum block)</li>
            <li> My face feels tight and youthful during that period.</li>
            <li> However, after checking around the item is a little pricey.</li>
            <li> (sting range from little to none)</li>
            <li> I just wet the block in cold tap water, rub it on my face and neck generously, rinse of the clock and tap dry with  my hand towel and put it back in the box.</li>
            <li> be careful as it will shatter if dropped on a hard surface, like a cast iron sink.</li>
            <li> I had a bad experience purchasing a lesser quality Alum Block, which was old and basically disintegrated.</li>
            <li> The two little thin plastic pieces on the front, intended to keep the box closed, are very weak (and it&#x27;s still brand new).  </li>
            <li> only drawback to this block is that it is a little expensive.</li>
            <li> Just get it a little damp, apply to damp face and there you have it!</li>
            <li> no more bleeding...</li>
            <li> period it will close your pores stop weepers in their track and even seal small nics and cuts .....</li>
            <li> I recommend to anyone that gets small nicks.  </li>
            <li> I passed on the Osma because it was too small --  </li>
            <li> Mine came packaged sturdily and enclosed in a small, lidded plastic box.  </li>
            <li> stops small cuts bleading</li>
            <li> and it comes with a small plastic carrying case.</li>
            <li> Not very good.</li>
            <li> Hard to screw it up.</li>
            <li> Before I knew it, the sore was gone or at least well on its way to healing.</li>
            <li> but I think that may be related to my shaving routine &amp; not shaving too close or cutting myself.</li>
            <li> after a shave and rinse just water this bar down with cold water and rub your face and neck down.</li>
            <li> (I brush my teeth) and then give your face a cold water rinse and dry.  </li>
            <li> It was such a bad decision.</li>
            <li> Works well, but it came with a piece broken.</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t do 6 &amp; 7, the Alum Block will slowly deteriorate from the wet moisture, then when you use it, the block will have cracked patches, leaving a very unpleasant glide over your face.</li>
            <li> , I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for serious wounds!), and tones the face by closing and tightening pores.</li>
            <li> I have never used one before, so there may be something wrong with me and not the alum.  </li>
            <li> I think this would be uncomfortable if I tried to use the bottom of the block.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be careful around the lips area since the taste is awful!</li>
            <li> I have ammonia alum before and that stings like crazy.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;razor, you MUST use alum block rinsed under cold water after you shave.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> Wash off face with cold water</li>
            <li> Chill your face with a cold towel (one from the freezer)&lt;br /&gt;6.</li>
            <li> The bad - this product aggravates the razor burn on my neck to no end.  </li>
            <li> trust me just add this to your cart you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It tasted horrible.</li>

            <li> Kinda rough but it&#x27;s compacted nicely. Probably the cheapest caseat possible</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an alum block. Does the trick.  Stops the bleeding and tightens up your skin for the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s potash alum. It does what it is supposed to do. You pay about 6x more for this one because of the branding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice to have a carrying case for your alum, though.</li>
            <li> I recently switched to the old school way of shaving with a safety razor and a double edged blade. I used to do this back in India but switched to the Mach 3 when I came to the US. It was such a bad decision. But now I enjoy shaving better than ever. This alum rock has been a great addition to my wet shaving ritual. I get an occasional nick or a cut with the blade and this alum quickly stops bleeding and closes up the pores. There is a little sting which feels good. There is no mention in the product description if this is a potash alum or ammonia alum. But my guess is that this is potash alum as it stings much less. I have ammonia alum before and that stings like crazy. This stings way less than the ammonia alum that I used. So I came to a conclusion that this is potash alum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The block itself is nicely packaged in a plastic box so it easy to take it with me on my travels. I just wet the block in cold tap water, rub it on my face and neck generously, rinse of the clock and tap dry with  my hand towel and put it back in the box. Very convenient.</li>
            <li> I received my Shavex alum block very quickly, and after one use, it works exactly as advertised.  This is a high-quality block, and the included plastic case is a nice feature.  I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> First the good -does this stop bleeding from razor cuts? Yes! and very quickly too!  It stings less than a styptic pencil, and it may be just the product you need if you don;t have sensitive skin.    The bad - this product aggravates the razor burn on my neck to no end.  As with anything cosmetic of course, YMMV.  While a styptic pencil stings a little more, the pencil works just as well at stopping bleeding and does not cause the razor bumps on my face to stand out.  It&#x27;s taken me a week of not using this product to get my razor burn under control.     This is a large alum block, and will probably last forever for me - good thing, because I&#x27;d likely never buy it again.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B004QVBFBM Alum Block 110gr - Shavex]]I purchased this fine item from Amazon and highly recomment the alum block by Shavex for all the wet shaving people out there. The days of the old styptic pencil are gone. You simply cool off your face with cold water, leaving it wet, and rub the alum block all over the shaved area. Wait 5 minutes and rinse off any residue and dry your shaving area. You can use after shave afterwards. The alum closes any slight wounds, and soothes the pores. A great product. Ted</li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCT, FAST DELIVERY. THANKS!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother buying STYPTIC pencils, this is what you should own.&lt;br /&gt;Can also be used as deoderant.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I have got to buy it again.</li>
            <li> My first time using this, but it is pretty good and I am happy.</li>
            <li> Why alum block?&lt;br /&gt;Because it is all natural.&lt;br /&gt;Why is this 56 year old guy using it?&lt;br /&gt;Because, when you grow up and shave like an adult, with a double edge&lt;br /&gt;razor, you MUST use alum block rinsed under cold water after you shave.&lt;br /&gt;You glide it over your wet face for 60 seconds, leave it alone for 60 seconds,&lt;br /&gt;Rinse off...smooth skin...no more bleeding...</li>
            <li> Shavex is well known among double edged safety razor wet shavers.  After shaving and rinsing face with warm and then cold water, rub this over your face.  It closes the pores, tightens the skin and stops some bleeding.  Then rinse and add whatever shave balm or splash and you&#x27;re ready to go!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve been shaving without an Alum block for the past 24 years, I&#x27;ve been missing out an important shaving accessory.  It works great as an antihemorrhagic, leaves the skin smooth and healthy looking.  It is 100% fragrance free, and does not string when applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all, this is a large bar, almost as big as a standard size bar of soap.  The plastic case works great too!</li>
            <li> Case made of very cheap plastic, and it arrived already cracked and half-broken ... had to repair it myself with tape :(&lt;br /&gt;The alum block is ... an alum block !</li>
            <li> What is there to say it is a Alum block..... nope there is more to say ..... it is a 125 gram large alum block that comes in a carry/travel case for storage and transport as well as most importantly it works !!! period it will close your pores stop weepers in their track and even seal small nics and cuts ..... what else could you want from a alum block NOTHING !!! the price may be slightly higher than others and cheaper than some as well that tells me I made the right choice with shavex as the old saying goes if you spend too much you just got taken too little and you wasted your money..... trust me just add this to your cart you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The block is nice and big. The plastic case is pretty flimsy.</li>
            <li> i purchased it a year and half ago and still using it ... Fantastic product and service ... I like the box to&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00CX6K70W Shavex Alum Block with Plastic Case - 125g]]</li>
            <li> Block arrived with a large crack or fissure in one side.  Usable, but for the price i would have assumed better quality control.</li>
            <li> It sure stops the bleeding if you cut yourself. I recommend to anyone that gets small nicks.  I have been using it for a few months now, not on a daily basis though and still looks new.  Should last me a while.  Comes with a nice plastic case for storage which is a plus.</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> I will always have this in my shave kit. after a shave and rinse just water this bar down with cold water and rub your face and neck down. You will know where you nicked your self as you feel that sting. This alum  bar stops bleeding nicks and soothes the skin. A must have for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an alum block at a good price and in a plastic case. What more is there to say?</li>
            <li> Great product. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> This is a nice sized chunk of alum at a really good price.</li>
            <li> its a good block. larger than the others I&#x27;ve seen, and seems to be lasting a good long time. it feels great on the skin, and does in fact help to close up nicks and slow/stop bleeding.</li>
            <li> good stuff. I don&#x27;t use it every shave, but when I do use it, it makes a world of difference, especially in the summer! Cools your face, tightens and makes the shave feel like you just came from the barber!</li>
            <li> This is a vey large, semi translucent block that is well packaged to sit on your bathroom counter.  I definitely reccommend this over both less and more expensive blocks.</li>
            <li> On time, as advertised.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time this morning after my first shave with the DE razor, and it worked well, I had one nick and some redness and the alum block stopped the bleeding on the nick. It had a quick burn but it felt nice after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The block arrived in one piece, with a small corner missing, but that is to be expected with such a hard block. It was smooth on one long side and mostly smooth on the other long side. It worked really well rubbing it on my face post-shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case was super flimsy but it works. Could use a better case, but beggars can&#x27;t be choosers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did it&#x27;s job and did it well, a fine block of alum.</li>
            <li> delivered fast.... still using it as deodorant so cant really say if the block will hold until the end.... but so far so good</li>
            <li> This is a larger block of Alum than I expected.  I am quite happy.  It works as it should.  Others have mentioned that the plastic case is not of high quality.  It is very light weight, but seems fine for the purpose and the cost.</li>
            <li> A great product and the plastic case is a plus.</li>
            <li> The bar was in good shape with no breakage and comes with a plastic storage case.  However, after checking around the item is a little pricey. The case has no ventilation so the alum will set in water and breakdown faster (I guess poke some holes in it).</li>
            <li> Useful in shaving both to stop the bleeding on any minor nicks and to tone the skin.  There are many alum shaving blocks available, this one came with a nice travel case.</li>
            <li> Works great for underarm deodorant.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t use alum after shaving, definitely do. It tells you where you shave badly,and also does a lot for your skin. If you struggle with facial acne, I definitely recommend using alum as it cleared mine up almost instantly. Other than that this is just an alum block, and they&#x27;re all the same. The case is a nice touch, and it&#x27;s a pretty sizeable block. I have used about twice weekly(sometimes more, sometimes less depending on how often I shave) for almost a year and a half still have quite a bit left.</li>
            <li> This was worth the buy for d/e shaving the product gets in very smoothly into the my very sensitive skin, and I expect to last for a very long time so in the long run its very cheap.</li>
            <li> Love this block. It&#x27;s solid like a crystal, not pressed powder. This will last me for YEARS. The case is flimsy but still a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> New SR user. some blades I have used (DERBY / Shark) have left me all nicked up. I have not used any other Alum Blocks to compare with but this has worked very well. I feel it is a must have and great addition to the Shaving Kit. Priced perfect compared to most i viewed and comes with a nice plastic case to hold the ALUM Block. You can purchase a SOAP case at most stores that carry Bath Products and any Alum Block can be stored in it. Shipped fast. Highly recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> Helped the back of my neck from breaking out.I shave my head and it use it all over my head post shave.  Helps heal any cuts and stops the bleeding.</li>
            <li> its a block of alum in a somewhat flimsy plastic case.  fortunately thats exactly what i was expecting when i bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;nice cooling astringent, does a good job of sealing nicks and closing pores after a shave.  be careful not to drop it or you&#x27;ll have alum chunks instead of an alum bar.</li>
            <li> I even bought a second - easy to apply - leaves my face fealing sealed and tight - ready for a full day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful as it will shatter if dropped on a hard surface, like a cast iron sink.</li>
            <li> The block comes with a nice case and works perfectly.  Stops bleeding almost immediately from minor shaving nicks and doesn&#x27;t sting or burn (for me atleast).  Unlike another reviewer, this has not caused any skin problems for me and I do have sensitive skin. Just be sure to dry the block before putting it away (as you would have to with any alum block) - the case will trap in any moisture and eat away at the block.   As a suggestion for those with sensitive skin - look into a double edge safety razor and some old shaving soap.  I find the single blade of a DE razor cuts better and causes almost no irritation (I used to avoid shaving because of constant razor burn but now I look forward to it).  Just remember to keep a good lather - if you missed a spot, reapply shaving cream/soap before you try to trim it.</li>
            <li> This block works great. This really helps to quickly sanitize your face from razor burns, nicks, and cuts. here&#x27;s how I use it.&lt;br /&gt;1. After you&#x27;re done shaving, wash your face&lt;br /&gt;2. Wet the block, glide it over the areas that you shaved&lt;br /&gt;3. Wait 15-20 seconds&lt;br /&gt;4. Wash off face with cold water&lt;br /&gt;5. Chill your face with a cold towel (one from the freezer)&lt;br /&gt;6. Wash off the block and dry it with a paper towel&lt;br /&gt;7. The case it comes with.... make sure its dry&lt;br /&gt;8. -- WARNING -- if you don&#x27;t do 6 &amp; 7, the Alum Block will slowly deteriorate from the wet moisture, then when you use it, the block will have cracked patches, leaving a very unpleasant glide over your face.</li>
            <li> It is just the right size and it is real ALUM not the junk they call alum from some places that is something else and burns like everything when it hits a cut. Plus you get the right size plastic box to put the chunky back in after your done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;dray</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re wet shaving without an alum block or styptic pencil:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) I hope you&#x27;ve got a steadier hand than I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.) You&#x27;re depriving yourself of a treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even without nicking myself, I enjoy the skin-tightening sensation post-shave of wetting an alum block and rubbing it over my freshly-shaved face, before applying any after-shave lotion or balm. And if (or more likely, when) I do nick myself, rubbing a wet alum block over the insulted skin stauches the blood immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it. You&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> Im always plagued by razor burn, no matter what I do. Safety razor, electric, they all bother my skin. I&#x27;ve tried many lotions, pre shaves, after shaves, etc and they all give me the same lovely red bumps and rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just rub this stone over your wet race after shaving, and feel the difference! I noticed improvement after my first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets slippery, do don&#x27;t drop it- it chips easily, and you don&#x27;t want the sharp edges on your face.</li>
            <li> It does what alum is supposed to do. Hard to screw it up. So, price led me to shavex. They win there. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Great alum block, and it comes in a nice little plastic case! I honestly have no complaints! If you want an alum block look no further!</li>
            <li> Well it for sure does the job it&#x27;s described to do. I have no complaints  as others seem to. I am very happy and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I switched to wet shaving with a safety razor a few months ago. Based on reviews here and a few web sites, I decided to try incorporate an Alum block - and I&#x27;m very glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have you to actually nick myself, but frequently have a few spots near my neck that weep blood after shaving - using this block, wet, on a wet face closes them up and actually doesn&#x27;t do more than slightly sting (less than aftershave).</li>
            <li> This is super stuff.  I use it as an underarm deodorant, and it completely stops all odor for hours on end.  It&#x27;s good for nicks from shaving , and chigger bites too. I&#x27;ve had this one for several weeks now, and it&#x27;s still like new. It&#x27;s going to last for a long , long time.</li>
            <li> So (face) alum is alum.  Size distinguishes products.  I passed on the Osma because it was too small --  I&#x27;m clumsy and I&#x27;d be more likely to drop (and break) a smaller block.  I needed more product, and I paid more money for more product.  Alum works as advertised, and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.  The plastic carrying case is also convenient.</li>
            <li> This is just a big chunk of alum for a small price.  Mine came packaged sturdily and enclosed in a small, lidded plastic box.  It has shown no tendency to crumble or fracture and it is obviously going to last a longgggg time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have not tried using an alum block, I urge you to give it a shot.  Leave your face wet after rinsing residual lather and just rub the end of the block over your skin.  Do something else for a couple of minutes (I brush my teeth) and then give your face a cold water rinse and dry.  It does not sting at all unless you have nicked yourself.  It is an effective styptic for minor nicks but you&#x27;ll want a different product such as My Nik is Sealed or Proraso Styptic Gel for a larger nick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care for after shave so the alum stick is perfect for me. It tightens my skin without making it dry or itchy and in a world of overpriced shaving products it certainly is a good value.</li>
            <li> Even though it does not have a cooling effect &amp; tends to leave the skin a little dry after using, it does tighten the skin &amp; reduce irritation from shaving. Be careful around the lips area since the taste is awful! Suprsingly I experimented with using this as a deodorant &amp; it worked! After shaving underarms (which really reduces odor), using Shavex, &amp; using a small amount of body spray, it protects me all day. I still use Degree if I know my day will include physical activity but most of the time i use Shavex &amp; I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> My favorite alum block. Used them all my life and this is as good as it gets. High quality block that gets ultra smooth as you use it and becomes better with time. Can use as a post shave skin bracer or natural deodorant. Lasts a very long time, if you don&#x27;t drop it, and helps to stop bleeding from small to good size nicks. No better way to test the quality of your shave than to run one of these over your face after your last pass. A sure fire incentive to perfect your technique. Smooth shave and little to no sting lets you know that your blade is sharpe and you&#x27;ve mastered the art of shaving.</li>
            <li> This product is a must for cuts and chafing. During hot weather, a lump of this in your pocket will help not chafing.[[ASIN:B004QVBFBM Alum Block 110gr - Shavex]]</li>
            <li> This a fair priced alum bar. Everyone that shaves should be using an alum bar post shave. It&#x27;s all natural and helps to heal the skin. A word of caution here. Avoid getting alum in your eye(s). It stings and irritates immediately. Wash/rinse hands and flush eye(s). Also avoid allowing any alum to get in your mouth. If any gets in just spit and rinse out your mouth. When I was a young child and had a mouth sore, my grandmother would dab her finger into a jar of alum powder and apply her finger onto the mouth sore. It tasted horrible. I would keep it there for about a minute then rinse my mouth out. Before I knew it, the sore was gone or at least well on its way to healing. Much more effective than salt water. The alum closed up the sore immediately.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, an alum bar is great for your skin post shave!</li>
            <li> Quality block of alum, so no problem there. My only complaint is the plastic case will not stay closed.</li>
            <li> Works well, but it came with a piece broken. Will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> The case is inexpensive (cheap), but it serves the purpose.  This block is bigger than most, so it&#x27;s a bit easier (IMHO) to use.  I may go buy a small bar soap container - the types you use when you travel - at the local Walmart, but other than that inconsequential issue, this is still a good option for anyone using alum post-shave.  It is definitely big enough for anyone who wants to use it as a deodorant bar.</li>
            <li> I not only use this after every shave but I now also use it on my entire face every time i wash it. Have not had a problem with razor rash at all since I started using it and my face is clearer than ever.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was told that Alum Bloc really dry out your skin...not this one. I applied after shaving and rinsing and wow. Just get it a little damp, apply to damp face and there you have it! Doesn&#x27;t hurt in any way but reminds you you&#x27;re a man :)&lt;br /&gt;Have fun&lt;br /&gt;Great product, and the case is wonderful as well.</li>
            <li> Using an alum block should be a part of every post-shave. This comes with it&#x27;s own case, which makes storage very nice.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  Sometimes if I shave too close, it does sting but not enough to warrant not using it.  the case is great too for when I am traveling or if I need to store it off the counter.</li>
            <li> Does what you want. I think next time I buy this I will see where I can get 2-5 blocks at once for a cheap price.&lt;br /&gt;If your new to wet shaving or just want a more natural deodorant this is for you.</li>
            <li> This alum block does the trick and the plastic case makes it a breeze to take with me on the road. The instant feedback on how well your technique is working is great to. Gives your face a cool feeling when finished shaving. Follow it up with some lemon witch hazel or Pinuad and you&#x27;re ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback to this block is that it is a little expensive. But it is a nice sized block and after using mine for a little while, it still shows no use.</li>
            <li> Alum serves several important roles as a disinfectant and astringent. This means it disinfects cuts and nicks, slows and prevents bleeding (caused by shaving, anyway, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for serious wounds!), and tones the face by closing and tightening pores. These are integral features for a shaver, in my opinion. Moreover, alum is even useful for those with acne, due to its disinfectant and pore tightening qualities. I&#x27;ve only been wetshaving and using it for a little over a week, and I&#x27;ve already noticed a reduction in my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do need to be careful with alum, however. It is a mineral, so if you drop it, it will crack and break into pieces. You don&#x27;t want that, so be very careful with it. Second, from what I&#x27;ve gathered alum will start to dissolve if left in water, so you should always dry it before storing it, or leave it somewhere that it can dry naturally. Finally, alum burns more than any aftershave I&#x27;ve ever tried. If you manage to not injure your skin in any way, it will simply tingle. But if you have cut yourself, or if you&#x27;re just learning to wetshave and have dozens of little nicks from trying to shave against the grain for the first time.... Be prepared. Fortunately, the burn does not last very long, and as I said above, it will prevent further bleeding and disinfect all those cuts, so overall a bit of burning is quite a fair price to pay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One further note, for all future alum shoppers. Make sure that you buy potassium alum instead of ammonium alum. Potassium alum is the kind that is designed for shaving, while ammonium alum is stronger and so will burn a lot more, and is therefore used in deodorants and the like.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this isn&#x27;t sold here in the States. This block of Alum works as really well as an after shave. Just wet and rub the bar on your face. Wait a minute or two and rinse with cool water. Closes cuts and scrapes from shaving immediately .</li>
            <li> Admittedly, this is the only alum block I have ever used.  What I have found is that the block has to be dried completely before shutting the lid or small crystals will develop making the block extremely scratchy.  Due to this, I would have liked to have seen some venting in the case and possibly a couple of small plastic pieces to elevate the block ensuring the bottom is dry.  I make sure to dry the block with a towel and leave the lid open for several hours after use.</li>
            <li> Works well for shaving irritation and nicks. I like the plastic case that comes with it.</li>
            <li> By far the best post shave product I&#x27;ve ever used, it makes your shin burn a little more than after shave but makes your pours tighten, elemanates  a lot of razor burn.makes your face baby smooth. Good stuff</li>
            <li> i use a double edge saftey razor i am quite new so i cut myself and get razor burn after the shave i wash the irritated or cut areas and it stops the bleeding and feels fresh afterword</li>
            <li> Size is larger than most other alum blocks, and has a plastic case.  I travel a lot, and having the case is great so that I have a place to keep it in my Shaving Kit.</li>
            <li> Got this for Christmas and I absolutely love it!! It&#x27;s also a great deal compared to other brands and sellers out there, expecially with it&#x27;s carrying case!!!!</li>
            <li> Totally satisfied with the quality and packaging. I had a bad experience purchasing a lesser quality Alum Block, which was old and basically disintegrated. This block is fresh and comes with a plastic container. Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely as advertised..have made this part of my morning shaving routine and have noticed a difference. Does a great job on closing minor nicks and definitely gives you feedback on where you may have been to aggressive with your razor. Would order again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an alum block for far more years than I care to think of, and yes, it&#x27;s an important part of my morning shaving routine, followed by an aftershave cream or balm.  My opinion of alum blocks is THEY&#x27;RE ALL THE SAME!  Buy based on oz. or gr. per $.  On that basis, this is the best deal you&#x27;re going to get.  Plus it comes with a case for storage or travel which many others don&#x27;t provide.  Case closed.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and love it! I mainly bought this brand because of the case that comes with it. I leave it in the case with the lid open, so it can dry out during the day. The case is very cheap but still does a good job for daily storage. I very happy with my purchase of Shavex Alum Block and will buy it again!</li>
            <li> Great price for tge size of the block!! Will last forever!!</li>
            <li> As a former pawn in the great shave conspiracy, I found myself in need of an alum block. This one does the job, it&#x27;s as simple as that. No frills, no special features (for an alum block) It braces, but I assume that is to be expected. The container is much appreciated since it helps keep the block dry when stored.</li>
            <li> I am new to straight razor shaving a.k.a cutthroat razor shaving and this block is a saver. All you have to do is when your done shaving remove what ever cream is on your face and just dip an end of the block in water and rub on face it will stop the bleeding instantly, I have experenced some stinging while applying it (sting range from little to none) let it dry then rinse. What made me choose this is that it came with a storage container the block is a good size and will last a long time</li>
            <li> Works and a good price.</li>
            <li> Fantastically priced and works wonders on my face after a shave.  Heals cuts quickly and leaves the skin feeling smooth.  Great product and I can&#x27;t wait for it to be back in stock.</li>
            <li> Decent alum. Could be cheaper for the size however</li>
            <li> I have another alum block at home that doesn&#x27;t seem to be as concentrated as this one.  As soon as I rub it across my face post-shave I get INTENSE stinging in places where I  have weepers and nicks.  So the purity and quality of the block is actually really good.  Its just that the thing is so small it doesn&#x27;t fit my hand well.  I also wish that the plastic case had holes in it so that I could close the case after use and not worry about the water continuing to wear away the product.</li>
            <li> Thank you,very good product I will recommend you to all my friends.</li>
            <li> Awesome, long lasting, large, and a plastic case #WINNING</li>
            <li> Very happy with the alum block but disappointed with the flimsy plastic case that came with it. Unfortunately I&#x27;ll need to find something else to store the block in because the plastic case came split at the corner and doesn&#x27;t even fit the lid now.</li>
            <li> I have no problem, whatsoever, with the quality of the alum, itself, or it&#x27;s ability to do what it&#x27;s intended to do, following wet shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem that I have with my &amp;#34;Shavex Alum Block&amp;#34;, is that the surfaces of the particular block of alum, that I received, were EiXiTiRiEiMiEiLiY ROUGH.  I could easily deal with the fact that this Shavex Alum Block&#x27;s surfaces were quite uneven and asymmetrical.  Although, I am puzzled as to why this should, necessarily, be the case.  The steps in processing blocks of this type, would seem, most likely, to be fairly straightforward and not difficult to do well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a rule, I rarely quibble over little discrepancies with products that I buy.  I&#x27;ve never before written a negative review on anything that I&#x27;ve purchased from Amazon, and that would include a proverbial &amp;#34;ton&amp;#34; of products, over the last several years.  Thank goodness for Amazon Prime&#x27;s free two day shipping.  Otherwise, we would have gone bankrupt, from shipping charges, alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that this particular Shavex Alum Block arrived with surfaces so rough, that I can not imagine that anyone would be willing to slide it across their face following a wet shave;  and certainly not, in the event that they sustained any skin abrasions or nicks, during their shave.  One of the two broad surfaces of this block literally felt like a roughly finished concrete driveway... the kind of driveway that you would  n e v e r  want to fall and scrape your knee on.  Well...  it did feel almost that rough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t really want to send it back, primarily because I recently began shaving with a straight razor, which has somewhat of a learning curve, resulting in a lot more frequent nicks and abrasions (than when using a trusty multi-blade razor).  I needed the alum block to doctor up all those little shaving war wounds, to avoid the risk of needing professional medical attention, or worse yet, a transfusion or something of the like!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided that I could &amp;#34;make&amp;#34; the surfaces of my new alum block, into what they should have been like, in the first place, using some sandpaper and elbow grease.  I soon found that it was going to take a lot more than 220, or even 120 grit sandpaper, especially to even begin to smooth out that one particular side&#x27;s surface on the block.  It was a lot more rough than the others.  I ended up resorting to 80 grit sandpaper, and even then, it took a lot of effort to attain an almost acceptable level of smoothness for use on the face.  Believe it or not, I even resorted to using a random orbital sander (with some success), during my initial smoothing efforts.  Actually, yesterday I noticed one side of the block to still be in need of some more sanding work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Relatively speaking, there&#x27;s another a minor issue.  The plastic box that came with my Shavex Alum Block, was about as rinky-dink as you can get...  extremely thin and barely able to maintain it&#x27;s shape.  The two little thin plastic pieces on the front, intended to keep the box closed, are very weak (and it&#x27;s still brand new).  If I&#x27;m lucky the box may hold be able to survive for more than a month or so with care.  Considering the very small cost of including a plastic box, that would be able to function well, and easily last as long as the alum block, itself, you would think that Shavex would have a lot more pride in how their product is presented to it&#x27;s loyal users.  The current box just screams  &amp;#34; C H E A P &amp;#34;, the moment the product is opened by the consumer.  What were they thinking?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, honestly, I&#x27;m going to give Shavex the &amp;#34;benefit of the doubt&amp;#34;, and make the assumption that the particular alum block that I received, was a very rare exception (to the usual very high quality alum blocks that Shavex produces).  I&#x27;m going to assume that this particular alum block, just somehow managed to slip past, what is normally an outstanding quality control system.  With all the 4 &amp; 5 star reviews I&#x27;m seeing here, this is likely the case.  Otherwise, perhaps, a change in the actual source of the alum, or a change in the way the alum is processed may have occurred along the way.  Many reviewers even comment on how nice the plastic box is.  This is somewhat puzzling to me.  BUT, at the end of the day, I would rather maintain a positive attitude.  When the time comes I will, most likely, order another Shavex Alum Block.  Chances are, the next one I get will be in pristine condition!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, the straight razor, that I&#x27;m now using, was also purchased from Amazon, and I&#x27;m very impressed with it&#x27;s quality.  It&#x27;s the Feather Artist Club SS Folding Handle Shaving Razor, made in Japan by Feather.  It has a very unique functional design, is stainless steel, and uses Feather replaceable blades.  The replaceable blades avoid the necessity of having to strop (and, occasionally, hone) the blade before use, as is the case with a traditional straight razor.  It&#x27;s, also, about half the cost of the better than average traditional straight razor, and doesn&#x27;t require the up-front cost of expensive accessories, such as quality Japanese Water Stones for honing and a quality Strop to keep it shave-ready.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check the Feather razor out at:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008CF6KMC/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o03_s00_i00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;or view an image of it at:  http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61%2BGS%2Bfif6L._SL1500_.jpgl system.

            <li> This block is my first and only alum block. I&#x27;ve used it for a month, and it barely shows any use. I think it will last at least a few years. Alum is a great post shave product, it will close most minor weepers following my less than stellar shaves. I love shaving on the weekend when I can leave the alum on my face for about an hour. My face feels tight and youthful during that period. I always rinse it off, but some people don&#x27;t. You can definitely feel it working and closing those pores.</li>
            <li> Stands up to water, handy plastic case (I travel a lot), works as advertised, low price.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Came in said condition and works well after you shave.</li>
            <li> Blah. Not very good. Not a completely solid block    Review Edit 08/18/2014. This alum block just went into the trash can. It got a lot of little holes and a rough surface.    DO NOT BUY    So far very happy with the Osma Alum Block.[[ASIN:B004QVCIKE Alum Block by Osma - 2 Pack Value]]</li>
            <li> The plastic case solves the problem &amp;#34;what to do with the alum when it&#x27;s drying?&amp;#34;  I bought this for my nephew who I am gifting a full wet-shaving set for his 30th birthday.  I am so tempted to take the case as my own, but this was so cheap that I really should just buy one for myself.</li>
            <li> This bar really helps and you can feel it working, I like it came with a case for storage this was the best deal I found.</li>
            <li> Works as it has since before recorded time. This is a nice block feels like it will last forever, with a light-duty but useful storage case. My shaving experience has only improved using this. Known for its qualities \\&quot;as an astringent, haemostatic, antiseptic. It has anti-inflammatory, anti-pyretic and antibiotic properties\\&quot; I can say it works for calming the skin of most superficial ailments too. Starts out pretty smooth and gets better with use. I rinse mine clean and air dry after each use. Leaves no detectable residue. Don&#x27;t skimp on something less or over spend on some chalky stick. This substantial heat treated perfect sized brick looks like quartz and is as valuable as diamond, in your shave kit.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like using this alum block as an aftershave.  I have never used one before, so there may be something wrong with me and not the alum.  It burns when applied, which I like, but unlike a typical liquid splash-on aftershave, the burning does not completely subside after a few seconds. In my opinion, it just doesn&#x27;t kill razor burn like a normal aftershave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an alum block like any other, just feel like it wasn&#x27;t as dense as I&#x27;d like.  As such, when I&#x27;d work down to a void (where there was air instead of alum), the edges would get a bit sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend &amp;#34;Bloc Osma Alum Block, 2.65 Ounce.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> stops small cuts bleading</li>
            <li> This is a good-sized alum block for the money, and it comes with a handy plastic container if you want to travel with it.  Alum helps soothe and close up your skin pores after a shave.  I found the top portion of the block nice and smooth when I wet it and rubed it over my neck and face after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen some crumbling on the bottom side of the block, which as a rough feel, and the corners are a bit pointy.  I think this would be uncomfortable if I tried to use the bottom of the block.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the plastic container doesn&#x27;t have any holes, I store my block on a soap dish to allow it to dry well.  I used the plastic container the last time I traveled, and it held up well.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really add any new information to the other reviews, so I&#x27;ll just echo the 5-star ratings and urge you to buy this product.  If you are taking the time to give yourself a great shave with good blades, shave cream and technique you owe it to yourself to complete the experience with alum.</li>
            <li> I gave this a 5 star rating because of the case that was provided.  The case gives you for immediate storage for the bloc instead of leaving it on a towel to dry.  I love the bloc because it provides a finished look after you complete your wet shave ritual.  It doesn&#x27;t sting but I think that may be related to my shaving routine &amp; not shaving too close or cutting myself.</li>
            <li> Great addition to wet shaving or any other shaving. It feels good with a gentle glide over a wet face and neck, and there is a dramatic improvement in skin bumps, razor nicks, electic razor burn, etc. Plus it is a good size and it is very reasonably priced. I highly, highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and eliminates the need for alcohol-based after shave.  I use it after each shave and will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> What can I say its a simple alum block that is quite smooth and it comes with a small plastic carrying case. This is the only alum block I&#x27;ve ever used but it works quite well.</li>
