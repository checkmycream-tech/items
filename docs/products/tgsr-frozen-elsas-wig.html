            <li>hair quality is good but head part is deformative  over all.</li>
            <li>She loved it.</li>
            <li>She loved it with her Elsa dress.</li>
            <li>Is good for one time use</li>
            <li>Very cute wig.</li>
            <li>bodied, silky smooth, and beautiful coloring.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the better Elsa wigs I&#x27;ve seen!</li>
            <li>The hair is of nice quality.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I liked the wig.  </li>
            <li>This was perfect for my 4 year old granddaughter.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my seven year old worked perfect</li>
            <li>We bobby pinned the sides and she was able to run around and play/jump on the jumpers without the wig coming off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much better than expected.&lt;br /&gt;Full</li>
            <li>Wore this wig as part of my Elsa costume this weekend and it looked fantastic!</li>
            <li>and I was able to make it work.</li>
            <li>nice fit &amp; weight.</li>
            <li>More like for a toddler.</li>
            <li>Okay - you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li>so okay but smallish.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try and put some cute pins on in and see how it goes.</li>
            <li>Cute for a one time use</li>
            <li>The expandable part is what convinced me to purchase it not know precisely the size of my granddaughter&#x27;s head.  </li>
            <li>is a nice wig but not for adult</li>
            <li>Elsa hair looked better than everyone else&#x27;s by far</li>
            <li>Wish it would have covered my daughters hair more (6 year old).</li>
            <li>It looked real and fit her head good after I bought a wig cap and held the wig in with a few bobby pins.  </li>
            <li>Was exactly what we needed for our Elsa costume.</li>
            <li>I received so many compliments on this and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The top is a little hard to control, but it worked out very nicely!</li>
            <li>This was a very nicely made wig but because there is so much hair and the braid is so long, it kept falling back off my daugter&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li>It looks more white in the picture, but its a light blonde.</li>
            <li>Adequate for my 5 year old&#x27;s Halloween costume.</li>
            <li>I will certainly us TGS again.</li>
            <li>I who wear a US size large hat cannot wear this wig</li>
            <li>pin those loose hairs on top, too.  </li>
            <li>Color is beauty, quality is better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Though this was advertised as able to fit both child and adult heads, wig did not fit on my 10 year olds head.  </li>
            <li>Very well made.  </li>
            <li>Does not stay styled very well.</li>
            <li>The top required a bit of styling, but not much.</li>
            <li>The adjustable strap proved very helpful in keeping the wig in place</li>
            <li>As many reviewers have mentioned the side portions of the wig were very loose.</li>
            <li>Better than expected!</li>
            <li>The color is a very pretty blonde.</li>
            <li>I just wish the loose hair on top would stay back and not come in my daughter&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li>The actual hair is good quality - thick, and not shiny.</li>
            <li>The braid is heavy and it slides off my 6-yr-old&#x27;s head easily.</li>
            <li>The hair on it is soft and not stiff in at all.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the top is very &amp;#34;whispy&amp;#34; and kind of hard to manage.</li>
            <li>Bought this wig for my 7 yr old daughter.</li>
            <li>This does not stay on a kid (4 yrs) or adult size head.  </li>
            <li>It was a bit snug, but I&#x27;m an adult</li>
            <li>so you can see half of her own hair, even if we put my daughter&#x27;s dark hair in a pony tail.</li>
            <li>Looks great but the hair falls out in clumps when you touch it and it is impossible to put on and not have your hair showing.</li>
            <li>I did have to leave some of my natural hair (tucked into a wig cap) outside the wig at the nape of my neck, however the braid covered it</li>
            <li>Much nicer than I expected - it has LOTS of hair.  </li>
            <li>apparently Americans have bigger heads than the Chinese folks who make lots of stuff for us, so</li>

            <li> The wig was almost too small for my 7 year old.  </li>
            <li> Way too small for an adult.</li>
            <li> It is really small for a 5 year old.</li>
            <li> It is very heavy for a young child.  </li>
            <li> Pretty wig, but not ideal for a toddler it falls off.</li>

            <li> It does suffer from a common problem of Chinese-made</li>
            <li> Would not even cover my 8 year olds small head!</li>
            <li> Overall: Quality hair, bad design.</li>
            <li> Hard to keep on head!</li>

            <li> Color is beauty, quality is better than I expected. I recieved the product two days after I placed the order</li>
            <li> hair quality is good but head part is deformative  over all. The forehead area is flat that doesn&#x27;t grip on the head snugly plus A clip is too small to hold entire wig piece. No thank you.</li>
            <li> Though this was advertised as able to fit both child and adult heads, wig did not fit on my 10 year olds head.  Too small.</li>
            <li> Pretty wig, but not ideal for a toddler it falls off.</li>
            <li> Bought this wig for my 7 yr old daughter. She loved it. The color is a very pretty blonde. It looks more white in the picture, but its a light blonde. All the other wigs I saw were very yellow. The braid is thick and long. It worked out perfect for her Elsa costume. The wig held well and covered her entire head. We bobby pinned the sides and she was able to run around and play/jump on the jumpers without the wig coming off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wig will not fit an adult.</li>
            <li> The wig was almost too small for my 7 year old.  It lasted through two trick or treat nights though so it served its purpose.</li>
            <li> This was a very nicely made wig but because there is so much hair and the braid is so long, it kept falling back off my daugter&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> Great wig.  Very well made.  My daughters Elsa hair looked better than everyone else&#x27;s by far</li>
            <li> Adequate for my 5 year old&#x27;s Halloween costume. But it was ill fitting.</li>
            <li> This does not stay on a kid (4 yrs) or adult size head.  It needs to come with instructions.  It is very heavy for a young child.  The hair is of nice quality.</li>
            <li> Looks like a sea hags head of hair</li>
            <li> This was perfect for my 4 year old granddaughter.  She loved it with her Elsa dress.</li>
            <li> Does not stay styled very well. Is good for one time use but I don&#x27;t plan on getting to wear it again.</li>
            <li> Received Elsa&#x27;s Wig today.  It is wonderful!  Much better than expected.&lt;br /&gt;Full bodied, silky smooth, and beautiful coloring. Ordered it on the 8th&lt;br /&gt;of August and received it on the 13th.  I will certainly us TGS again.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what we needed for our Elsa costume.</li>
            <li> Wish it would have covered my daughters hair more (6 year old). You could still see the hair around her face and felt it should have been a bit bigger.</li>
            <li> Great wig! Better than expected!</li>
            <li> The actual hair is good quality - thick, and not shiny. However, the fit is poor. The braid is heavy and it slides off my 6-yr-old&#x27;s head easily. The wig only cover&#x27;s the crown of my daughter&#x27;s head - so you can see half of her own hair, even if we put my daughter&#x27;s dark hair in a pony tail. Overall: Quality hair, bad design. This is a return.</li>
            <li> Wore this wig as part of my Elsa costume this weekend and it looked fantastic! The top required a bit of styling, but not much. It was a bit snug, but I&#x27;m an adult and I was able to make it work. I did have to leave some of my natural hair (tucked into a wig cap) outside the wig at the nape of my neck, however the braid covered it (also, I have fairly long, thick hair). The adjustable strap proved very helpful in keeping the wig in place and I&#x27;m hoping that in the future I can use it to adjust the wig size so my daughter can wear it for dress up. I received so many compliments on this and would definitely recommend it. It&#x27;s one of the better Elsa wigs I&#x27;ve seen!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I liked the wig.  It looked real and fit her head good after I bought a wig cap and held the wig in with a few bobby pins.  I just wish the loose hair on top would stay back and not come in my daughter&#x27;s face.  I had to bobby pin those loose hairs on top, too.  Other than that, it was perfect!</li>
            <li> Very nice quality.  Hard to keep on head!</li>
            <li> nice fit &amp; weight. The top is a little hard to control, but it worked out very nicely!</li>
            <li> Very hard to keep on my six year old</li>
            <li> Way too small for an adult.</li>
            <li> Looks great but the hair falls out in clumps when you touch it and it is impossible to put on and not have your hair showing. Would not even cover my 8 year olds small head!</li>
            <li> As many reviewers have mentioned the side portions of the wig were very loose. Hoping with enough hair spray we can style the wig so that it resembles Elsa&#x27;s hair. The braided section was excellent though.</li>
            <li> Horrible fit. Too small. More like for a toddler. Waste of $.</li>
            <li> Okay - you get what you pay for.  It does suffer from a common problem of Chinese-made headwear- apparently Americans have bigger heads than the Chinese folks who make lots of stuff for us, so I who wear a US size large hat cannot wear this wig properly- we made it work for Halloween  (2 daughters, wife, and I were all Elsa - avoided conflict over who gets to be Elsa), so okay but smallish.</li>
            <li> Very nice wig, it fits my child and she is very happy with it. It will need some styling on the front but that&#x27;s about it. Can&#x27;t wait for Halloween! She has the Elsa dress and shoes so the wig completes the look. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my seven year old worked perfect</li>
            <li> is a nice wig but not for adult</li>
            <li> It is really small for a 5 year old. we have to hold it on with bobby pins.</li>
            <li> Very cute wig. The hair on it is soft and not stiff in at all. Unfortunately, the top is very &amp;#34;whispy&amp;#34; and kind of hard to manage. I&#x27;m going to try and put some cute pins on in and see how it goes. With some adjustement, it fits my 5 year daughter with no problem.</li>
            <li> Much nicer than I expected - it has LOTS of hair.  The expandable part is what convinced me to purchase it not know precisely the size of my granddaughter&#x27;s head.  Gave it to her for her birthday along with the Elsa dress, wand, tiara, jewelry.  She was a very happy birthday girl.</li>
            <li> Nothing holds up the wig. Bought for a child. Cute for a one time use</li>
