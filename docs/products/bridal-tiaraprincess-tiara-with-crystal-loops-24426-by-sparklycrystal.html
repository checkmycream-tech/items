            <li>The Delivery was fast .The</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>I really wish the combs in it</li>
            <li>It is very nice and extremely sparkly, but on close inspection some of the crystals are not straight and are misaligned.</li>
            <li>When I got this first time, I found one cubic is missing (it was even hard to see because whole tiara was so bright), so I contacted seller and they send me a new one with out any charge, which arrived in 2 days :)  </li>
            <li>I really liked my sister is very pretty but arrived a little bent by transport, this arrangement would only hand the material is well</li>

            <li>This tiara was given as a gift to a young princess in her 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It sparkles so much, noone would get close enough to tell the difference.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on something that looks cheap, get a tiara like this</li>
            <li>Purchased for my niece seventh birthday just what she needed to complete her princess outfit.</li>
            <li>Would be fine for a party or other less intense activity.</li>
            <li>I used this tiara in a musical production with high schoolers.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a tiara and needs to wear it for a long period of time (like a bride).</li>
            <li>This was so much nicer than I expected.  </li>
            <li>A bit wide and the combs used to secure it on your hair a bit small</li>

            <li> i highly recommend getting this tiara (:</li>
            <li> It looked great on but was difficult to keep on my head.</li>
            <li> This tiara was given as a gift to a young princess in her 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It sparkles so much, noone would get close enough to tell the difference.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on something that looks cheap, get a tiara like this</li>
            <li> Purchased for my niece seventh birthday just what she needed to complete her princess outfit.</li>
            <li> Would be fine for a party or other less intense activity.</li>
            <li> I used this tiara in a musical production with high schoolers.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a tiara and needs to wear it for a long period of time (like a bride).</li>
            <li> This was so much nicer than I expected.  </li>
            <li> A bit wide and the combs used to secure it on your hair a bit small</li>
            <li> The stones are fake, but give off a great sparkle, even in poor lighting.  </li>
            <li> It took me a long time to buy a tiara online.</li>
            <li> It is fairly delicate, as expected, so be gentle with it.</li>
            <li> The tiara sits really wide on my head and leaves gaps on the sides.</li>
            <li> It is not very fitted</li>
            <li> was a bit stronger or maybe if there was something in the center to keep it firm on my head because whenever I throw my head back it raised up.</li>
            <li> The tiara is a little on the large side, but a small amount of gental bending will bring it down to size!</li>

            <li> Purchased it to wear for my wedding in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Not sure though.  </li>
            <li> The medal did not fade or become dull in luster, the gems held its sparkle and stayed in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>

            <li> I manage a retirement community and I ordered 2 of these to use for 2 of our residents.  They were having housewarming parties and they were each \\&quot;Qeeen of their Castle\\&quot;.  I was very impressed with the quality of the tiaras.  For the price they were beautiful and my residents loved them!!!</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with how fast I received the item.  Although inexpensive it looks and feels of high quality and I look forward to wearing it on my special day.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item based on the reviews in amazon, and was quite satisfied.  When I got this first time, I found one cubic is missing (it was even hard to see because whole tiara was so bright), so I contacted seller and they send me a new one with out any charge, which arrived in 2 days :)  Overall, pretty and shiny, good quality compared to the price.</li>
            <li> HI GIRLS, THIS TIARA IS ALSO AMAZIN... LOOKS SO PRETTY.... AND THE PRICE... UFFF YOU WON&#x27;T BELIEVE IT... WHY GO BUY TIARAS FOR YOUR WEDDING IN ANY OTHER PLACE AND PAY ALOT OF MONEY.... HERE YOU WILL FIND THE SAME WITH THE BEST PRICES... BELIEVE ME LOOKS SO PRETTY... DON&#x27;T GO ANYWHERE ELSE, GET IT HERE.</li>
            <li> Very Beautiful and received in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my birthday and I LOVE IT!! Definitely more beautiful in person. Gorgeous!</li>
            <li> This is simple lovely. I compare it with the one at davids bridal and you could not tell the difference. I cant wait for my big day to wear it. Lovely!!</li>
            <li> This was so much nicer than I expected.  The stones are sparkly and the tiara is sturdily made.  Oh, and so much fun to wear!</li>
            <li> I bought this to wear for my wedding in 04/18/09. I loved it! Everyone told me I looked like a real princess in it!!</li>
            <li> This tiara was given as a gift to a young princess in her 20&#x27;s. She just loved it! I think the timeless design and sparkling beauty of this very well made tiara would thrill any princess of any age!</li>
            <li> The Tiara was beautiful.  My daughter did a modern Cinderella for prom and this just made the dress.  Horrible story, the day the first Tiara was delivered it was a windy day. The postman placed it in our mailbox and a gust of wind placed it in the driveway.  I did not see it when I pull in and ran over it.  I hurried and ordered another and we received it in two days.  Someone at the company must have felt something happen to the first and rushed us another.  Prom was in 2 days.  All worked out and like I said the Tiara made it all come together.</li>
            <li> It arrived very quickly just in time and was the perfect fit for a formal Top Hat and Tiara themed gala.</li>
            <li> This looks better on than in the picture :)  I think a more intricate pattern tends to get \\&quot;lost\\&quot; with the veil and dress drawing focus.  This has a nice line and compliments my gown but doesn&#x27;t overpower anything.</li>
            <li> This Tiara was beautiful, it looks even better in person. I can&#x27;t wait to wear it at my 50th birthday party.</li>
            <li> The tiara is beautiful more than what I expected. It looks just like in the picture. The Delivery was fast .The price was right.</li>
            <li> It took me a long time to buy a tiara online. This one has good quality and doesn&#x27;t look cheap. I was plan to use it for my wedding but for some reason, i feel like its better for a party (personal taste). Its very beautiful.</li>
            <li> I ordered this tiara for my wedding in August. It is very nice and extremely sparkly, but on close inspection some of the crystals are not straight and are misaligned. The quality is ok, guess you get what you pay for, and at this price I guess it&#x27;s ok!!</li>
            <li> This is going to be perfect for my upcoming wedding. Can&#x27;t wait to wear it. I think it is going to look very nice with my dress and accessories.</li>
            <li> I purchased this tiara for my birthday celebration. It arrived in a timely manner and looked great.</li>
            <li> im so happy i got this tiara!  the shipping was fast and the tiara is amazing. the quality is perfect too, it really wont break. i cant wait to use this crown for my pageant! i highly recommend getting this tiara (:</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grand-daughter and it was a very good quality for the price. Looks just as it is pictured and arrived promptly,</li>
            <li> I have ordered two tiara&#x27;s through Amazon.com. Both were received in less than a week, and have been enjoyed by those receiving them.     I would definitely recommend them!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife, as I could not buy a diamond tiara, this is cool, like it and hoping my wife like it too.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful tiara.  The stones are fake, but give off a great sparkle, even in poor lighting.  The picture doesn&#x27;t do it justice.  I think it is Australian crystal. Not sure though.  It sparkles so much, noone would get close enough to tell the difference. It is better than even the novelty ones you find at accessory shops.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on something that looks cheap, get a tiara like this; it is worth the value.</li>
            <li> This Tiara is awsome!!! The delivery time was fast and I was suprised to see it looked liked the photo. I was very pleased when I open the package. I kept the plastic bubble wrap on until the day of my wedding, it looked good through the plastic wrap. When I took the plastic wrap off I was amazed at the size and the quality of the medal!! Its heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose to wear this Tiara for my wedding day it looked so pretty I received alot of compliments. In my opinion this Tiara is worth the investment, a great price. I have seen similar and identical Tiaras in Bridal Shops ranging for $125.00 - $179.00!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Sparkly Crystal has reduced the price making it affordable. The medal did not fade or become dull in luster, the gems held its sparkle and stayed in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its adjustable with combs to fit any hairdo and head shape and the medal does not weaken when being shaped to fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall its a great buy and looks just as good as the designer and real gemmed Tiaras.</li>
            <li> This tiara is absolutely beautiful! It&#x27;s well made, sturdy and oh so sparkly!! Purchased it to wear for my wedding in a few weeks. It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my niece for her wedding.  She love, love, loves it.  She is loving how it will look with her jewelry and dress.  Could hardly take it off.  Very nice!</li>
            <li> Very nice Tiara built real good. Purchased for my niece seventh birthday just what she needed to complete her princess outfit. I was able to bend the metal so it fit her head perfectly.</li>
            <li> This was a big hit for a birthday party. In fact, some friends kept it for theirs. Nothing makes a woman feel beautiful like being dressed as a princess.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughters 7th birthday party.  It was a princess theme.  She really enjoyed wearing it.  It made her feel special.  It&#x27;s been months later and she still likes to get this out and put it on.</li>
            <li> I really liked my sister is very pretty but arrived a little bent by transport, this arrangement would only hand the material is well</li>
            <li> I ordered this tiara for my daughter - or, I should say my grown daughter just because I thought she should have one.&lt;br /&gt;It was surprise and she was absolutely thrilled.  It is really quite lovely, well made and for the price just perfect.</li>
            <li> I am wearing this for my wedding and the item is perfect!! It does not look cheap, it fits perfectly, and it is what description says it is.</li>
            <li> I used this tiara in a musical production with high schoolers.  It looked good, held up well and was delivered promptly.  All in all, I felt it was a great deal for the money.</li>
            <li> I bought two tiaras for a Vacation Bible School I taught this summer.  My co-teacher and I got many compliments on our royal headgear!  I am passing them on to two nieces--sisters who will love being princesses.  A bit delicate--I had one of the rhinestone clusters come off--but remember they were worn through 5 sets of kids per day for a week and I had to take it off and on for other costumes.  Would be fine for a party or other less intense activity.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wedding. Mooorre than happy with this!! Beautiful &amp; is bendable to fit your head. Loved it &amp; highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This tiara is gorgeous.  I knew from the moment I saw it, it would be the one.  Very nice details, pretty and sophisticated. Well worth the reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The tiara sits really wide on my head and leaves gaps on the sides. It is not very fitted and I can&#x27;t bend it without breaking it.</li>
            <li> A great Tiara for our Winter formal this past year.  The students loved it, and it looked fantastic in photos!</li>
            <li> Purchased this crown to wear for my bi 40 birthday. It looked great on but was difficult to keep on my head. A bit wide and the combs used to secure it on your hair a bit small so it kept sliding</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s pretty but it b&lt;br /&gt;Cannot fit my head, although I tried squeezing it in , it seems it will break , I can&#x27;t use this again :(</li>
            <li> My granddaughter &amp;#34;The Princess &amp;#34; loved it!</li>
            <li> My wedding is on September 20th 2014.  I haven&#x27;t worm it yet but it is the right weight with combs so it wouldn&#x27;t fall off.  I love it. It would be perfect for my day</li>
            <li> I was scheduled to receive this tiara on October 5th, I received the tiara on October 1! It was such a wonderful surprise to see that I received it early and to see just how stunning it was! The tiara is a little on the large side, but a small amount of gental bending will bring it down to size! My fiancee thinks it is just beautiful, he can&#x27;t believe how much I paid for it, because the quality is so great!   It is fairly delicate, as expected, so be gentle with it. I cannot wait to wear this on my wedding day! Just wearing it makes me feel like a princess! The sparkle is unreal, the stones are secure.   Totally satisfied!</li>
            <li> I purchased this tiara for my wedding &amp; it is absolutely BEAUTIFUL. It was just the right sized, EXCELLENT quality, I thought it was real. It definitely completed my wedding day look w/an extreme amount of bling. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Not made well..picture was deceiving</li>
            <li> I love this tiara, I cant wait to wear it on my wedding day. I have been trying different hair styles with it and I can&#x27;t figue out which I like the best. Thank you for great service and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Beautiful tiarra, but the sides were stretched out (came in the box that way) and wouldn&#x27;t stay on my head. Didn&#x27;t get to wear this piece at my wedding.</li>
            <li> excellent quality, sparkles beautifully.  Excellent service, was shipped right away without problem.  Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> Nice product...arrived in damaged inner package</li>
            <li> The was a xmas gift for my daughter.  She will most likely use it for her wedding this coming May.</li>
            <li> my niece loved it.lol  shes a princess.  as good as any I suppose. didn&#x27;t have any problems.  would recommend getting at amazon as mucha s anywhere</li>
            <li> I hate wearing headbands or anything because I get a lot of headaches.  However, this was so light weight, as well as beautiful; I wore it all day at my 60th birthday party.  I forgot I had it on, it was so comfortable.  Highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a tiara and needs to wear it for a long period of time (like a bride).</li>
            <li> VERY PRETTY BUT TOO FLIMSY FOR THE PRICE I PAID!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely Beautiful. I worn it on my wedding day GREAT RAVES</li>
            <li> My daughter always wanted a tiara but I didn&#x27;t know this until she was grown. However, she didn&#x27;t even choose a tiara to wear on her wedding day. So when her husband and I decided to have a &amp;#34;Forty and Fabulous&amp;#34; birthday celebration for her, I figured a tiara would be perfect for her to wear at the party! I was thrilled when it arrived in the mail and she was thrilled when she saw it! Her dream finally came true!</li>
            <li> Nice quality and pretty.</li>
            <li> I really liked this. I wore it on my wedding day. I really wish the combs in it was a bit stronger or maybe if there was something in the center to keep it firm on my head because whenever I throw my head back it raised up. Didn&#x27;t like that very much. it was a very nice piece nevertheless.</li>
