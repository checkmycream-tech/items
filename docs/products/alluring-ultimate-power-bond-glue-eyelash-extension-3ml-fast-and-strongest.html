            <li>This product burns and smells strong.</li>
            <li>and then after two weeks it started to have a strong odor and burned.</li>
            <li>this is super glue!</li>
            <li>I have tried so many glues out there including the big companies in the market and so far this is the best glue I have found!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get it in the mail</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of buying several bottles thinking it was good.</li>
            <li>The first try it was strong in smell but not bad</li>
            <li>I bought this glue and had used it for the very first time and it took about 10 seconds&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are a license professional I strongly recommend this glue!</li>
            <li>High fume!!!</li>
            <li>I wish the product would came in a bigger bottle because it is kind of pricey..</li>
            <li>u r not doing it right</li>
            <li>Works and glues on really quickly, really love the product,  does burn a little bit when close to the open eyes, but works good</li>
            <li>this glue is great and last as long as it says it does.</li>
            <li>I first used it to fill in the two or three lashes that I accidentally pull off between fills.  </li>
            <li>I have tried all sorts of glues in search of an affordable option, and this is most definitely it!  </li>
            <li>this stuff holds just as long as my top brand glue, but does have a higher odor to it.</li>
            <li>It drys pretty fast if u don&#x27;t use too much which u not supposed to anyway..</li>

            <li>it  burned  my  wife&#x27;s  eyes  and could not open her eyes for a day or two to strong fir tge eyes</li>
            <li>Do not try to apply the eyelash extensions by yourself because you can&#x27;t have your eyes open at all, make sure you find a good professional (which are hard to find).</li>
            <li>Really, Really disapointed.</li>
            <li>It dries so fast there is no time for adjusting.</li>

            <li>This is definitley a STRONG glue, however this glue was irritating to eyes and there is no way you can put on your own lashes if you&#x27;e not a professional.  </li>
            <li>glue definitely lasts better than any other that I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as it states on the bottle very difficult to work with.expected it to be very much stronger adhesive.</li>
            <li>or maybe my eyes are just really sensitive?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a License Esthetician and Professional Eyelash Extensions Stylist</li>
            <li>I really need my money back.  </li>
            <li>I would suggest the glue because it works but only if you are a professional or going to have a professional do them for u.</li>
            <li>it is the longest lasting eyelash glue so far!</li>
            <li>Of course this is only for use when applying eyelash extensions to OTHER people, it is not safe to use this kind of glue on yourself.</li>
            <li>The lashes last a long time but this glue is not for amateurs, you really need to know how to use it.</li>
            <li>I honestly thought I was going blind.</li>
            <li>None of my clients have complained about fumes and it sets quickly.  </li>

            <li> I cannot even take it long enough to finish eyelashes!!</li>
            <li> It was basically like using super glue on ur eyes (that turns black when it dries).. if it gets in ur real lashes ur pretty much screwed and in ur eyes.. probably the worst pain ever!!..</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time on the lashes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sensitive to products on my face.  </li>
            <li> If you are not a professional you should not be using this glue!</li>
            <li> This product did not sting my eyes like other products but when I woke up the next day my eyes were almost closed shut and irritated and itchy.  </li>
            <li> I used a few different kinds of glue already n been doing lashes for awhile now</li>
            <li> but when I tired to take them off I needed to use professional strength eyelash remover anddd it didn&#x27;t all come off for days..</li>
            <li> No matter how little I used it seemed to always burn my eyes, I don&#x27;t even think the product was actually going in my eyes, maybe it&#x27;s just too hard of a product</li>
            <li> Drying time sucks because it took my twice as long to do lashes on my client.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say tis but only people that r not a professional at doing lashes will complain becuz</li>
            <li> Clients come in for a 2 weeks fill missing over half their lashes.</li>
            <li> This glue is for Eyelash Extensions only, not for fake lashes of clusters that you could apply at home!</li>
            <li> I seriously thinkg</li>
            <li> Poor adhesive.</li>
            <li> and this is BY FAR THE WORST GLUE EVER!</li>

            <li> n not too expensive.</li>
            <li> Almost went Blind trying to use this.  </li>
            <li> but this sucker made my eyes water badly!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this glue is great and last as long as it says it does. im happy with my purchase and i will repurchase it when i run out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this glue for quite a while now, and am happy with it. Lasts a long time on the lashes.  I keep my bottle in the fridge to extend its shelf life.  I&#x27;ll continue to order it. I didn&#x27;t get it through this seller, but I think I will next time.  This is a good price.</li>
            <li> I seriously thinkg this is super glue! I was so excited to get it in the mail and when i got it i wanted to ship it back. It burned my eye! and the glue took about 6 days to come off. My eyelashes got stuck together. I would not buy this.</li>
            <li> This is the best lash glue that I&#x27;ve ever used. My Clint&#x27;s return and most of they&#x27;re lashes are still in tact since using this product. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Burns my eyes sooooooo bad I cannot even take it long enough to finish eyelashes!! No matter how little I used it seemed to always burn my eyes, I don&#x27;t even think the product was actually going in my eyes, maybe it&#x27;s just too hard of a product or maybe my eyes are just really sensitive?</li>
            <li> This glue works great..  It drys pretty fast if u don&#x27;t use too much which u not supposed to anyway.. All eyelash glue is going to burn. I used a few different kinds of glue already n been doing lashes for awhile now but this one works great n not too expensive. Sorry to say tis but only people that r not a professional at doing lashes will complain becuz u r not doing it right that&#x27;s why r eyes burn... I recommend tis ...</li>
            <li> Just as described, would reccommend to friends! Great product! Good quality glue! Arrived quickly and is so strong and holds so well! I will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is a good and reliable glue.  I first used it to fill in the two or three lashes that I accidentally pull off between fills.  However, I&#x27;ve started requesting my lash technician use this brand when applying my lash extensions.  Actually, when compared to the glue my lash technician uses, my lashes seem to last longer when Alluring Bond Glue is used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: April 8, 2014&lt;br /&gt;This glue definitely lasts better than any other that I&#x27;ve used.  I&#x27;m still very satisfied with its performance.</li>
            <li> i was in a bind and needed adhesive asap. this stuff holds just as long as my top brand glue, but does have a higher odor to it. it worked for the time being.</li>
            <li> Works and glues on really quickly, really love the product,  does burn a little bit when close to the open eyes, but works good</li>
            <li> burns -  caused a horrible reaction, one of my eyes almost swollen shut, burning, itching, running, clouded up my eyes --- worst experience I have had -- ruined two pairs of contacts --- almost went to emergency</li>
            <li> it  burned  my  wife&#x27;s  eyes  and could not open her eyes for a day or two to strong fir tge eyes</li>
            <li> I am a licensed cosmetologist and one of the services I provide in my Salon is eyelash extensions. I have been doing them for years and wanted to try out different glues and this is BY FAR THE WORST GLUE EVER! The fumes are so bad when I unscrewed the cap my client and I had to leave the room until the smell went away and our eyes stopped burning. DO NOT BUY!!!</li>
            <li> Almost went Blind trying to use this.  My eyes were read for a week. Never again!  Burns like H#@L!  Also no ingredient list</li>
            <li> This burned my eye! Alert: High fume!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this glue! Dries fast,no offensive smell and etc.&lt;br /&gt;the only reason I am giving 4 stars I wish the product would came in a bigger bottle because it is kind of pricey..</li>
            <li> Love this product. Easy flow never clogs.  Professionals should only use, not for amateurs. I definitely will continue to purchase. Shipped professionally and quickly. 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this adhesive &amp; it dries within seconds! Clients lashes last &amp; last!!!!</li>
            <li> This product worked but it&#x27;s very hard to use! It was basically like using super glue on ur eyes (that turns black when it dries).. if it gets in ur real lashes ur pretty much screwed and in ur eyes.. probably the worst pain ever!!.. it did work though it lasted for a week on me while I was away on vacation through swimming in a pool and salt water but when I tired to take them off I needed to use professional strength eyelash remover anddd it didn&#x27;t all come off for days.. I also lost a lot of my own lashes. I would suggest the glue because it works but only if you are a professional or going to have a professional do them for u.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a License Esthetician and Professional Eyelash Extensions Stylist I have been doing eyelashes for over 5yrs. I have tried so many glues out there including the big companies in the market and so far this is the best glue I have found! The lashes last a long time but this glue is not for amateurs, you really need to know how to use it. If you are a license professional I strongly recommend this glue! Do not try to apply the eyelash extensions by yourself because you can&#x27;t have your eyes open at all, make sure you find a good professional (which are hard to find). This glue is for Eyelash Extensions only, not for fake lashes of clusters that you could apply at home!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a licensed costmetologist.  I like to use products on myself as the guinea pig before I use on customers.  This product did not sting my eyes like other products but when I woke up the next day my eyes were almost closed shut and irritated and itchy.  It&#x27;s the 3rd day now and my  swollen eyes is down some but really disapointed with this product.  I really need my money back.  I don&#x27;t recommend this product.  I&#x27;m not sensitive to products on my face.  I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in this product that made my eyes swell up.  Really, Really disapointed.</li>
            <li> This did not hold like its description said. Clients come in for a 2 weeks fill missing over half their lashes. Poor adhesive.</li>
            <li> I would purchase again!</li>
            <li> I have tried all sorts of glues in search of an affordable option, and this is most definitely it!  None of my clients have complained about fumes and it sets quickly.  Of course this is only for use when applying eyelash extensions to OTHER people, it is not safe to use this kind of glue on yourself. I highly recommend this glue to all, I am SO happy that I discovered it!!</li>
            <li> Not as good as it states on the bottle very difficult to work with.expected it to be very much stronger adhesive.</li>
            <li> I honestly thought I was going blind.</li>
            <li> Stings the eyes and I have a high pain tolerance but this sucker made my eyes water badly! Does the job though</li>
            <li> This product burns and smells strong. I made the mistake of buying several bottles thinking it was good. The first try it was strong in smell but not bad and then after two weeks it started to have a strong odor and burned.</li>
            <li> I bought this glue and had used it for the very first time and it took about 10 seconds&lt;br /&gt;before it actually grips the lash.  Drying time sucks because it took my twice as long to do lashes on my client.</li>
            <li> I have been doing eyelash extensions for quite awhile and have tried many glues. This one has a very strong bond and dries quickly! If you are not a professional you should not be using this glue! Especially trying to apply lashes on yourself!</li>
            <li> This is definitley a STRONG glue, however this glue was irritating to eyes and there is no way you can put on your own lashes if you&#x27;e not a professional.  It dries so fast there is no time for adjusting.</li>
            <li> I have used many glues before i found this one! it is the longest lasting eyelash glue so far! i have been using this glue for 3 years now.</li>
            <li> Great glue, very fast and works excellent!</li>
