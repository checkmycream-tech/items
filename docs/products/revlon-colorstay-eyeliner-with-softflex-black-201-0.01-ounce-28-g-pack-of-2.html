            <li>so when I saw it on here for that price I had to get more than one!</li>
            <li>I still love the liner though!</li>
            <li>Easy on, perhaps one reapplication through the day, and looks great.</li>
            <li>Faced Perfect Eyes Waterproof Eyeliner, Perfect Black, 0.04 Ounce]]</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, great color, just what I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li>It was amazing, no raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely and stays put.  </li>
            <li>ABSOLUTE best eyeliner EVER!!</li>
            <li>However, it does look nice once it is on for about 2-3 hours.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for many years and love it!  </li>
            <li>Really easy to use!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t run, smudge, and is very precise.</li>
            <li>They go on easily and look nice.  </li>
            <li>As for the product, it was okay, it does stay on pretty good, but it needs to be on warm skin and it takes some work.</li>
            <li>I have been using this liner for more than a year.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love it and it stays where I put it.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite eyelinersss.</li>
            <li>Love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I also love that there is a built in sharpener</li>
            <li>My favorite eyeliner--- and I love that it now comes with a sponge applicator on the bottom.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>In fact, I would pay a lot more for it.</li>
            <li>and I love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I wish there were more product for the price.  </li>
            <li>I love the color, and texture, I just wish there was an easier way to sharpen.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>but my girl love it :)</li>
            <li>and I got one for free!</li>
            <li>Excellent Product Overall!!!</li>
            <li>I have used revlon color stay eyeliner for many years.</li>
            <li>I keep trying this pencil hoping to love it.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>I love Color Stay products.  </li>
            <li>Until my most recent purchase of this product, I thought it was the best eyeliner ever!</li>
            <li>Its okay but not waterproof.</li>
            <li>and it did seem to glide on just a tad better</li>
            <li>but I just have to make sure I remove makeup before going to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>think Prestige and the Revlon Colorstay have slightly better staying power and that is their appeal</li>
            <li>Revlon colorstay lasts all day on my lids and a pretty good amount of time on my waterline.</li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s good because it makes your eyes water so freaking much!</li>
            <li>It had superb pigmentation; however in a couple hours it had transferred to the creases in my eye the way every single eyeliner has ever done for me, and smudged under the lower lash line.</li>
            <li>Luckily, after sharpening (or if it breaks) the liner resumes its nice and easy application.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just now really becoming a trend, so for years I used just what ever I could find.</li>
            <li>Shipping was great 4 days early.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy and stays on yet is easy to remove.</li>
            <li>The tip breaks off easily; the sharpener doesn&#x27;t work well.  </li>
            <li>It stays on for awhile, and it easy to put on.</li>
            <li>It stays on all day and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily</li>
            <li>It works great for lower rims too, which in my book is a major plus.</li>
            <li>I never need the built in sharpener as it always makes a fine line that I can build upon easily when desired.</li>
            <li>For a smudgy look this works out fine but for any sort of precision application this isn&#x27;t going to work out -</li>
            <li>and my eyes were fine.</li>
            <li>but it works fine without being sharpened because it&#x27;s a twist up eyeliner.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and easily - doesn&#x27;t have that scratchy pencil consistency.</li>
            <li>Pencil eyeliners never stay on an do not run smoothly across the eyelid.</li>
            <li>I have Amazon Prime, so the free shipping comes into play when considering the price.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s astounding how fast this product disappears from your skin.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t seem to go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner is good for my top and bottom lashlines, and even tightlining my upper lashes.</li>
            <li>This particular liner goes on kind of light.</li>
            <li>This pencil is nice and soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is more of a crayon that runs very smoothly and has no mess!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d only suggest to use this if you plan on keeping it on your make up bag :P</li>
            <li>I hear that the original (the one advertised) was discontinued</li>
            <li>I goes on smoothly, but runs out quickly.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite non-liquid eyeliner!</li>
            <li>I do love this pencil for the nice, smooth line it makes and its long wear.</li>
            <li>I have tried several eyeliners and this product is superior</li>
            <li>By the time I get ready to head out the door, most of it has faded away.</li>
            <li>even when I did, the color wasn&#x27;t as intense and seemed more grayish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice black color and it goes on smoothly and easily!</li>
            <li>I like that it goes on pretty easily</li>
            <li>I really wished this had worked for me, as the color was rich and smooth.</li>
            <li>About six months ago, I noticed that my favorite eyeliner had a new packaging.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very creamy and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Arrived in a timely manner prior to first arrival date in good order.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s goes on smooth and is very opaque.</li>
            <li>eye liner is comparable right up there with Ulta and Sephora products.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply not hard feeling glides very well on waterline would suggest!</li>
            <li>It is long-lasting as long as you don&#x27;t use a face moisturizer of any kind.  </li>
            <li>No thanks!&lt;br /&gt;It would be nice if there were more color options available (like Sephora) for fun days, but I only ever wear black to work</li>
            <li>, I always use this eyeliner as it provides a good result (as long as you have a steady hand).</li>
            <li>While it looked new, it was not in the original package.</li>
            <li>It really does stay on all day !</li>
            <li>I have been using this eyeliner for more than a year now, and although i don&#x27;t wear eyeliner daily</li>
            <li>(that is the only reason why I am giving it four instead of five stars) but most Revlon items are up to my expectations.</li>
            <li>Thanks Revlon!</li>
            <li>If you sweat a lot though I would get a higher end eyeliner.</li>
            <li>sure enough it did it again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a big fan of putting eyeshadow on top of liner at my waterline, but in a pinch, it does work.  </li>
            <li>First of all I bought this eyeliner because I needed something waterproof and smudge proof.</li>
            <li>This was one of my favorite eyeliners that would actually last all day for me.</li>
            <li>Beats the heck out of the so called higher end products.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s never failed me.</li>
            <li>Overall they are pretty good, the color is deep</li>
            <li>The only issue is the anytime I use it my eyes turn bright red and start to water and sting.</li>
            <li>, I love that the ColorStay product does just that and stays on all day long without running and smudging!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and lasts the entire day!</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t differ much from bog-standard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>One thing is that you really have to work to get it off</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really ever seem to set and stays creamy and</li>
            <li>but it don&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think much of it and bought it anyway.</li>
            <li>I can go the whole work day and not need a touch up.</li>
            <li>Well, I expected more for Revlon...</li>
            <li>Came fast in the mail in a sealed package.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t like the application as much as the Too Faced eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that makes sense to other eyeliner wearers-</li>
            <li>Love how this doesn&#x27;t come off all over your face like other brands.</li>
            <li>In the morning, I do have more raccoon eyes than I do with the other two</li>
            <li>It just easier to apply and looks so much better than the other two, there is no comparison.  </li>
            <li>I thought I was getting the older style that was a self sharpening eye liner and worked very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried extending the pencil out less, more, in between - it doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li>Glad I found a stay on eye liner for much less than the Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder one</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s retractable too so is more than your bog-standard pencil liner, but I found this more difficult to apply as there was no control and unless retracted right back</li>
            <li>The product this seller must have is very old; I would not recommend buying.</li>
            <li>Anyway, the color is a good, dark black and it stayed put on my lash lines.  </li>
            <li>Overall this is the first eyeliner, in my life, that hasn&#x27;t ended up all over my face and hands.</li>
            <li>It leaves a bold, dark line but you can make it look more natural and not as dramatic by applying it lightly or blending it out a bit.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want a stark line, they are easy to blend.  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought several over the years that didn&#x27;t apply easily and were very dry, not creamy like they are supposed to be.</li>
            <li>but all I&#x27;ve been able to find are blue or black brown.</li>
            <li>My eyes are so sensitive</li>
            <li>I circulate between maybe three different eyeliners once i finish them, because sometimes if I use a makeup product (mascara or eyeliner) too much it can irritate my skin...</li>
            <li>When I used it it crumbles away like it is old.</li>
            <li>The formula seems to be fairly soft.  </li>
            <li>The only problem I have with this is that if you twist too much liner out it breaks when you are applying it.</li>
            <li>It also helps to sharpen it if you like a nice thin line.</li>
            <li>The color is intense, a deep, true black.  </li>
            <li>One thing to keep in mind is that on my arm I can apply a little more pressure since the skin is taut and straight where as your eyelid is not so its harder to apply more pressure unless you pull it taut which is not good for wrinkles.adow</li>
            <li>One thing to keep in mind is that on my arm I can apply a little more pressure since the skin is taut and straight where as your eyelid is not so its harder to apply more pressure unless you pull it taut which is not good for wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I much prefer liquid eyeliner for my eyes, only wearing pencil liner on lazy days, so normally I&#x27;d not spend this sort of money on a pencil liner and although this has more &#x27;features&#x27; than a normal pencil how it wears</li>
            <li>then it is back to normal.</li>
            <li>Is good,  but little hard when you aply the product in your eyes</li>
            <li>It is super strange, and if that happens then just draw with it on something to get the dry layer off</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve used the expensive stuff to the cheap stuff and this is just above average price but amazing quality.</li>
            <li>obviously as a liquid liner user I&#x27;m somewhat biased, but as stated above this one doesn&#x27;t differ much in wear from bog-standard pencils at</li>
            <li>I had a bit of trouble getting a precise line on my upper lashes, but i suppose I need a liquid liner for that.  </li>
            <li>Besides that it stays all day and barely smudges at all!</li>
            <li>If your eyes are sensitive or water a lot, don&#x27;t expect this to last 18 hours.</li>
            <li>And barely lasted one hour on my lids.</li>
            <li>(just be careful how much you twist out to use because I have had pieces break off)</li>
            <li>I also love that it is self sharpening, so you don&#x27;t waste half the product sharpening the tip.  </li>
            <li>The one huge negative is that this eyeliner definitely smudges a lot.</li>
            <li>It lasts really long, but I prefer a soft liner.</li>
            <li>For those people who are fortunate enough to not have insanely oily eyelids, this would be a good eyeliner.</li>

            <li> Really easy to use!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t run, smudge, and is very precise.</li>
            <li> They go on easily and look nice.  </li>
            <li> As for the product, it was okay, it does stay on pretty good, but it needs to be on warm skin and it takes some work.</li>
            <li> I have been using this liner for more than a year.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love it and it stays where I put it.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite eyelinersss.</li>
            <li> Love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I also love that there is a built in sharpener</li>
            <li> My favorite eyeliner--- and I love that it now comes with a sponge applicator on the bottom.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> In fact, I would pay a lot more for it.</li>
            <li> and I love this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I wish there were more product for the price.  </li>
            <li> I love the color, and texture, I just wish there was an easier way to sharpen.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> but my girl love it :)</li>
            <li> and I got one for free!</li>
            <li> Excellent Product Overall!!!</li>
            <li> I have used revlon color stay eyeliner for many years.</li>
            <li> I keep trying this pencil hoping to love it.</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> I love Color Stay products.  </li>
            <li> Until my most recent purchase of this product, I thought it was the best eyeliner ever!</li>
            <li> Its okay but not waterproof.</li>
            <li> and it did seem to glide on just a tad better</li>
            <li> but I just have to make sure I remove makeup before going to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> think Prestige and the Revlon Colorstay have slightly better staying power and that is their appeal</li>
            <li> Revlon colorstay lasts all day on my lids and a pretty good amount of time on my waterline.</li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s good because it makes your eyes water so freaking much!</li>
            <li> It had superb pigmentation; however in a couple hours it had transferred to the creases in my eye the way every single eyeliner has ever done for me, and smudged under the lower lash line.</li>
            <li> Luckily, after sharpening (or if it breaks) the liner resumes its nice and easy application.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just now really becoming a trend, so for years I used just what ever I could find.</li>
            <li> Shipping was great 4 days early.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy and stays on yet is easy to remove.</li>
            <li> The tip breaks off easily; the sharpener doesn&#x27;t work well.  </li>
            <li> It stays on for awhile, and it easy to put on.</li>
            <li> It stays on all day and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily</li>
            <li> It works great for lower rims too, which in my book is a major plus.</li>
            <li> I never need the built in sharpener as it always makes a fine line that I can build upon easily when desired.</li>
            <li> For a smudgy look this works out fine but for any sort of precision application this isn&#x27;t going to work out -</li>
            <li> and my eyes were fine.</li>
            <li> but it works fine without being sharpened because it&#x27;s a twist up eyeliner.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and easily - doesn&#x27;t have that scratchy pencil consistency.</li>
            <li> Pencil eyeliners never stay on an do not run smoothly across the eyelid.</li>
            <li> I have Amazon Prime, so the free shipping comes into play when considering the price.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s astounding how fast this product disappears from your skin.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t seem to go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is good for my top and bottom lashlines, and even tightlining my upper lashes.</li>
            <li> This particular liner goes on kind of light.</li>
            <li> This pencil is nice and soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is more of a crayon that runs very smoothly and has no mess!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d only suggest to use this if you plan on keeping it on your make up bag :P</li>
            <li> I hear that the original (the one advertised) was discontinued</li>
            <li> I goes on smoothly, but runs out quickly.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite non-liquid eyeliner!</li>
            <li> I do love this pencil for the nice, smooth line it makes and its long wear.</li>
            <li> I have tried several eyeliners and this product is superior</li>
            <li> By the time I get ready to head out the door, most of it has faded away.</li>
            <li> even when I did, the color wasn&#x27;t as intense and seemed more grayish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice black color and it goes on smoothly and easily!</li>
            <li> I like that it goes on pretty easily</li>
            <li> I really wished this had worked for me, as the color was rich and smooth.</li>
            <li> About six months ago, I noticed that my favorite eyeliner had a new packaging.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very creamy and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely manner prior to first arrival date in good order.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s goes on smooth and is very opaque.</li>
            <li> eye liner is comparable right up there with Ulta and Sephora products.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply not hard feeling glides very well on waterline would suggest!</li>
            <li> It is long-lasting as long as you don&#x27;t use a face moisturizer of any kind.  </li>
            <li> No thanks!&lt;br /&gt;It would be nice if there were more color options available (like Sephora) for fun days, but I only ever wear black to work</li>
            <li> , I always use this eyeliner as it provides a good result (as long as you have a steady hand).</li>
            <li> While it looked new, it was not in the original package.</li>
            <li> It really does stay on all day !</li>
            <li> I have been using this eyeliner for more than a year now, and although i don&#x27;t wear eyeliner daily</li>
            <li> (that is the only reason why I am giving it four instead of five stars) but most Revlon items are up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> Thanks Revlon!</li>
            <li> If you sweat a lot though I would get a higher end eyeliner.</li>
            <li> sure enough it did it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of putting eyeshadow on top of liner at my waterline, but in a pinch, it does work.  </li>
            <li> First of all I bought this eyeliner because I needed something waterproof and smudge proof.</li>
            <li> This was one of my favorite eyeliners that would actually last all day for me.</li>
            <li> Beats the heck out of the so called higher end products.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s never failed me.</li>
            <li> Overall they are pretty good, the color is deep</li>
            <li> The only issue is the anytime I use it my eyes turn bright red and start to water and sting.</li>
            <li> , I love that the ColorStay product does just that and stays on all day long without running and smudging!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and lasts the entire day!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t differ much from bog-standard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> One thing is that you really have to work to get it off</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really ever seem to set and stays creamy and</li>
            <li> but it don&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think much of it and bought it anyway.</li>
            <li> I can go the whole work day and not need a touch up.</li>
            <li> Well, I expected more for Revlon...</li>
            <li> Came fast in the mail in a sealed package.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like the application as much as the Too Faced eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that makes sense to other eyeliner wearers-</li>
            <li> Love how this doesn&#x27;t come off all over your face like other brands.</li>
            <li> In the morning, I do have more raccoon eyes than I do with the other two</li>
            <li> It just easier to apply and looks so much better than the other two, there is no comparison.  </li>
            <li> I thought I was getting the older style that was a self sharpening eye liner and worked very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried extending the pencil out less, more, in between - it doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> Glad I found a stay on eye liner for much less than the Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder one</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s retractable too so is more than your bog-standard pencil liner, but I found this more difficult to apply as there was no control and unless retracted right back</li>
            <li> The product this seller must have is very old; I would not recommend buying.</li>
            <li> Anyway, the color is a good, dark black and it stayed put on my lash lines.  </li>
            <li> Overall this is the first eyeliner, in my life, that hasn&#x27;t ended up all over my face and hands.</li>
            <li> It leaves a bold, dark line but you can make it look more natural and not as dramatic by applying it lightly or blending it out a bit.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want a stark line, they are easy to blend.  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought several over the years that didn&#x27;t apply easily and were very dry, not creamy like they are supposed to be.</li>
            <li> but all I&#x27;ve been able to find are blue or black brown.</li>
            <li> My eyes are so sensitive</li>
            <li> I circulate between maybe three different eyeliners once i finish them, because sometimes if I use a makeup product (mascara or eyeliner) too much it can irritate my skin...</li>
            <li> When I used it it crumbles away like it is old.</li>
            <li> The formula seems to be fairly soft.  </li>
            <li> The only problem I have with this is that if you twist too much liner out it breaks when you are applying it.</li>
            <li> It also helps to sharpen it if you like a nice thin line.</li>
            <li> The color is intense, a deep, true black.  </li>
            <li> One thing to keep in mind is that on my arm I can apply a little more pressure since the skin is taut and straight where as your eyelid is not so its harder to apply more pressure unless you pull it taut which is not good for wrinkles.adow</li>
            <li> One thing to keep in mind is that on my arm I can apply a little more pressure since the skin is taut and straight where as your eyelid is not so its harder to apply more pressure unless you pull it taut which is not good for wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I much prefer liquid eyeliner for my eyes, only wearing pencil liner on lazy days, so normally I&#x27;d not spend this sort of money on a pencil liner and although this has more &#x27;features&#x27; than a normal pencil how it wears</li>
            <li> then it is back to normal.</li>
            <li> Is good,  but little hard when you aply the product in your eyes</li>
            <li> It is super strange, and if that happens then just draw with it on something to get the dry layer off</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used the expensive stuff to the cheap stuff and this is just above average price but amazing quality.</li>
            <li> obviously as a liquid liner user I&#x27;m somewhat biased, but as stated above this one doesn&#x27;t differ much in wear from bog-standard pencils at</li>
            <li> I had a bit of trouble getting a precise line on my upper lashes, but i suppose I need a liquid liner for that.  </li>
            <li> Besides that it stays all day and barely smudges at all!</li>
            <li> If your eyes are sensitive or water a lot, don&#x27;t expect this to last 18 hours.</li>
            <li> And barely lasted one hour on my lids.</li>
            <li> (just be careful how much you twist out to use because I have had pieces break off)</li>
            <li> I also love that it is self sharpening, so you don&#x27;t waste half the product sharpening the tip.  </li>
            <li> The one huge negative is that this eyeliner definitely smudges a lot.</li>
            <li> It lasts really long, but I prefer a soft liner.</li>
            <li> For those people who are fortunate enough to not have insanely oily eyelids, this would be a good eyeliner.</li>
            <li> When I first got it, I found it difficult to apply because it was shaped like a hollow pipe, so until I was able to wear it down to one even solid dube</li>
            <li> In general , I love Revlon, in fact, it&#x27;s one of my favourite brands ,but this eyeliner is extremely disappointing.</li>
            <li> Some liners don&#x27;t even last that long.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long lasting and doesn&#x27;t smear.</li>
            <li> long lasting</li>
            <li> I like it, but I can do just as well with a less expensive liner and get more product at the same time.</li>
            <li> I am unable to get out much to shop, therefore, when I see it for a decent price online, I buy it.  </li>
            <li> i no longer need to use my gel eyeliner for long nights.</li>
            <li> This stuff won&#x27;t move all day long.</li>
            <li> and it lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> Pencils were dried up and old</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried a lot of black eyeliners (american, japanese, korean brands) and revlon stays on the longest.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last as long as my other eyeliners like this</li>
            <li> I have tried other lines and they always end up under my eye up above my eye but not where I put it</li>
            <li> But, this did not stay very long on my waterline.  </li>
            <li> If you leave the cap off though it will dry up almost.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t last nearly as long or come out as dark.</li>
            <li> It usually lasts all day, so it is still my go to for soft eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> But recently they did make some change to the formula because it does not show up dark like it did</li>
            <li> This was not normal.</li>
            <li> I was gone 8 hours and it only smudged under my eyes a little, but the intensity had worn off and it just looked kinda grey.</li>
            <li> when i buy it it was so dry!</li>
            <li> The regular covergirl black eyeliner I used to buy, would be all over my face in no time at all.</li>
            <li> i put black eyeshadow over the liner to make it last longer.</li>
            <li> I had even stopped wearing eyeliner for a while because it was such a mess.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too soft nor too hard.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t bad but not my favorite.</li>
            <li> Okay so I am really bad at writing reviews after purchasing something.</li>
            <li> Received way before I expected it in well protected packaging.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s constantly wet</li>
            <li> I got it home and applied to my lower water line a few hours later...</li>
            <li> have a smudger and sharpener on one end and the liner itself on the other end</li>
            <li> pencils always get too sharp and hurt and I tried the Almay version of this</li>
            <li> Although, I&#x27;ve had other liners that were creamier.  </li>
            <li> sharpener is pretty much useless</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like that i have to swipe and swipe a bunch of times to get the dark line that i want.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve literally worn it sun up to sun down and had no problems.</li>
            <li> It does not run down your face, but it still does not do the job</li>
            <li> half the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Half the time its SOLD OUT in stores here in Hawaii.  </li>
            <li> It decided to break in half inside my purse and get on everything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it wore off after about a half hour.  </li>
            <li> I chose to buy online because my stores aren&#x27;t selling the black anymore...</li>
            <li> B00433VGVW Prestige Mechanical Eye Pencil, Black, 0.01-Ounce</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve added a photo of the Too Faced, Revlon and Prestige in Black on my arm over mac Eyeshadow primer.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve begun to get little wrinkles</li>
            <li> I tried so politely to say no thanks because I know how much it sucks, but she insisted.</li>
            <li> Liquid is too messy and you have to start all over if you screw up.</li>
            <li> , i caught my boyfriend cheating on me and did alot of crying</li>
            <li> Purchasing from Amazon this time, I ended up saving a few dollars, even with shipping!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> and you would have to apply it a few times.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t go on as dark and thick as my maybeline pencil.</li>
            <li> This one is a little bit hard for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does stay on for a while without smudging all over your face, but no more than another pencil liner.</li>
            <li> But I find this liner to last longer than others even expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I usually use this eyeliner to tightline and to line my waterline.</li>
            <li> I always use this eye liner, but I usually buy it from WalMart.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really difficult to find black liner that comes out BLACK without using liquid</li>
            <li> The one with the smudger is the WORST because the sharpener doesn&#x27;t work and pieces of the &amp;#34;crayon&amp;#34; break off inside of it every single time, thus sending me into a fitful rage as I&#x27;m rushing to get ready in the mornings.</li>
            <li> Prefer the older style and was disappointed when I received this newer style.  </li>
            <li> All three pencils have broken and wasted the liner &amp;#34;lead&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very frustrated, it doesn&#x27;t worth 9 $.</li>
            <li> I have tried all the expensive eyeliner and by the end of the day it runs down my eyes.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter whether you apply it to bare skin, eyeshadow base, primer, powder, or some combination.</li>
            <li> Looks like I&#x27;m tired by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Its not great.</li>
            <li> Amazon needs to update this product presentation because it is false advertising.</li>
            <li> After a few hours it can smudge a bit, but not too bad.</li>
            <li> all things that other eyeliners hate.</li>
            <li> It stays on forever and it difficult to get off</li>
            <li> I think it outperforms every expensive version I have tried from Chanel to MAC.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t go well in your purse.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what happened, but the last one I bought is terrible.</li>
            <li> They are almost twice as expensive but they are waxier and they just glide on.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d rather have an eyeliner that is difficult to get off rather than not staying on at all!</li>
            <li> sort of disappointed.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll have to check Almay for some hypoallergenic products... &#x3D;/.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I ordered these (as pictured and described on the site), but what I got was the awful substitute that has the smudger attached.</li>
            <li> So annoying!!!!!</li>
            <li> Within 10 minutes, my eyes were watery and cloudy as well as horribly blood shot.</li>
            <li> The packaging does a horrible job of advertising that it is waterproof.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Goes on smooth, great color, just what I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> I have been using this liner for more than a year. I have tried some others, whether it be a sample, bought because I wanted a different color etc and everytime I kick myself for wasting money on anything else. I even had a friend give me a Covergirl &#x27;waterproof&#x27; one because she got a two pack and only wanted one. I tried so politely to say no thanks because I know how much it sucks, but she insisted.No thanks!&lt;br /&gt;It would be nice if there were more color options available (like Sephora) for fun days, but I only ever wear black to work anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only apply liner on my upper lid, below the lashes (you could say upper water line I guess) and just above the lash line.... I&#x27;m sure that makes sense to other eyeliner wearers- I never need the built in sharpener as it always makes a fine line that I can build upon easily when desired. It doesn&#x27;t run or smear. Awesome. Love it.</li>
            <li> I much prefer liquid eyeliner for my eyes, only wearing pencil liner on lazy days, so normally I&#x27;d not spend this sort of money on a pencil liner and although this has more &#x27;features&#x27; than a normal pencil how it wears doesn&#x27;t differ much from bog-standard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have a smudger and sharpener on one end and the liner itself on the other end, it&#x27;s retractable too so is more than your bog-standard pencil liner, but I found this more difficult to apply as there was no control and unless retracted right back it felt like it was going to snap. For a smudgy look this works out fine but for any sort of precision application this isn&#x27;t going to work out - obviously as a liquid liner user I&#x27;m somewhat biased, but as stated above this one doesn&#x27;t differ much in wear from bog-standard pencils at half the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does stay on for a while without smudging all over your face, but no more than another pencil liner.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It really does stay on all day ! Best one I&#x27;ve ever used. Great price too !</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite non-liquid eyeliner! pencils always get too sharp and hurt and I tried the Almay version of this and it didn&#x27;t last nearly as long or come out as dark. It&#x27;s really difficult to find black liner that comes out BLACK without using liquid and this does the trick.</li>
            <li> By the end of the day, my eyes looked like raccoons. It definitely smudged as the day went on. I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been using this eyeliner for years.  It goes on nicely and stays put.  I also love that it is self sharpening, so you don&#x27;t waste half the product sharpening the tip.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I have tried other lines and they always end up under my eye up above my eye but not where I put it I only switch when I cant find this. This is the best for me I love it and it stays where I put it.</li>
            <li> This is the only eyeliner that exists to me. I&#x27;ve used it for over a decade and I&#x27;ll never use anything else. I have oily eyelids and prefer shimmery shadows, all while living in a humid climate-- all things that other eyeliners hate. I have sweated in, touched up around, cried through, and slept on this stuff, and it stays on. Please god never stop making this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using eyeliner on my inner rim for about 15 years. It&#x27;s just now really becoming a trend, so for years I used just what ever I could find. Now there are options. My eyes water ALOT. The regular covergirl black eyeliner I used to buy, would be all over my face in no time at all. I had even stopped wearing eyeliner for a while because it was such a mess. For a while I tried liquid, but now that I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s and I&#x27;ve begun to get little wrinkles, I don&#x27;t like how it looks anymore. This particular liner goes on kind of light. You have to do two, sometimes, three applications to get the intensity you desire. I cannot stand setting it with eyeshadow. My eyes are so sensitive I just can&#x27;t handle that feeling. I put this stuff on before heading to my families christmas party. I was gone 8 hours and it only smudged under my eyes a little, but the intensity had worn off and it just looked kinda grey. Overall this is the first eyeliner, in my life, that hasn&#x27;t ended up all over my face and hands. If your eyes are sensitive or water a lot, don&#x27;t expect this to last 18 hours.</li>
            <li> when i buy it it was so dry! i could use it. and i used to buy this product cause this was good. but ive stopped buying it!</li>
            <li> The only issue I have with this eyeliner is that for some reason I think I might be allergic to it. I&#x27;ve had it for about two weeks and I absolutely love it! The only issue is the anytime I use it my eyes turn bright red and start to water and sting. I know it&#x27;s not allergies because I stopped using it for 3 days and my eyes were fine. Besides that it stays all day and barely smudges at all! It&#x27;s easy to apply and lasts the entire day! I would definitely recommend this to someone even though I have to stop using mine!</li>
            <li> I have been using this eyeliner for more than a year now, and although i don&#x27;t wear eyeliner daily it&#x27;s the best drugstore eyeliner i&#x27;ve come across. It stays, it&#x27;s affordable. Doesn&#x27;t smear or run! yay! Reccommend it :D</li>
            <li> I circulate between maybe three different eyeliners once i finish them, because sometimes if I use a makeup product (mascara or eyeliner) too much it can irritate my skin... so that&#x27;s where the circulation begins! This is one of the ones I use. It&#x27;s a nice black color and it goes on smoothly and easily! Very good product and vurrry good qualiteh! One of my favorite eyelinersss. So ya... :D</li>
            <li> Received way before I expected it in well protected packaging. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it yet (that is the only reason why I am giving it four instead of five stars) but most Revlon items are up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for over 3 years!! Half the time its SOLD OUT in stores here in Hawaii.  ABSOLUTE best eyeliner EVER!!</li>
            <li> I will add this to the list of failing eyeliners. It didn&#x27;t even last an hour. I&#x27;ll continue looking for one that will stay on my eyelids.</li>
            <li> As for the product, it was okay, it does stay on pretty good, but it needs to be on warm skin and it takes some work. Shipping was great 4 days early.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like that i have to swipe and swipe a bunch of times to get the dark line that i want. i was hoping to only have to swipe once. sort of disappointed.</li>
            <li> Item Pictured / described was not the one I received.</li>
            <li> Love this eyeliner. Goes on easy and stays on yet is easy to remove. I also love that there is a built in sharpener so you can have a thinner line when you need it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought several over the years that didn&#x27;t apply easily and were very dry, not creamy like they are supposed to be. I did not have this problem though, when ordering from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a great liner.  It stays on all day just like it claims.  Can be smudged for a smokey look.  I&#x27;ve used it for many years and love it!  I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it breaking or coming out of the tube like I&#x27;ve heard others say.</li>
            <li> Pencil eyeliners never stay on an do not run smoothly across the eyelid. Liquid is too messy and you have to start all over if you screw up. That is why I love this eyeliner! It is more of a crayon that runs very smoothly and has no mess! It stays on forever and it difficult to get off but I&#x27;d rather have an eyeliner that is difficult to get off rather than not staying on at all! I have finally found an eyeliner that I am going to stick with!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. It works well and stays put. I like it and should have ordered two.</li>
            <li> This is the best eyeiner i have ever used. it is great for eyeliner as well as for eyebrows and stays better then any eyeliner i&#x27;ve ever used before it. i&#x27;ve used the expensive stuff to the cheap stuff and this is just above average price but amazing quality. recommend it to all my friends. will never use another eyeliner.</li>
            <li> This pencil is nice and soft and easy to use. No sharpener necessary. I plan to order another one as this one finishes.</li>
            <li> It is long-lasting as long as you don&#x27;t use a face moisturizer of any kind.  Then it smears and doesn&#x27;t last.  It also takes patience to put it on over powder eye shandow.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried a lot of black eyeliners (american, japanese, korean brands) and revlon stays on the longest. i no longer need to use my gel eyeliner for long nights. i put black eyeshadow over the liner to make it last longer.</li>
            <li> Very good eyeliner easy to use make a nice line&lt;br /&gt;Do not run</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought the eyeliner recently. In general , I love Revlon, in fact, it&#x27;s one of my favourite brands ,but this eyeliner is extremely disappointing.It&#x27;s not waterproof at all and it doesn&#x27;t stay on waterline even for 10 minutes! I&#x27;m very frustrated, it doesn&#x27;t worth 9 $. I ,definitely, don&#x27;t recommend it!</li>
            <li> The tip breaks off easily; the sharpener doesn&#x27;t work well.  Prefer the older style and was disappointed when I received this newer style.  Threw it away.  I thought I was getting the older style that was a self sharpening eye liner and worked very well.</li>
            <li> My favorite eyeliner--- and I love that it now comes with a sponge applicator on the bottom. Thanks Revlon!</li>
            <li> For those people who are fortunate enough to not have insanely oily eyelids, this would be a good eyeliner. It had superb pigmentation; however in a couple hours it had transferred to the creases in my eye the way every single eyeliner has ever done for me, and smudged under the lower lash line. I really wished this had worked for me, as the color was rich and smooth.</li>
            <li> Great price for this product! It&#x27;s more expensive in stores so when I saw it on here for that price I had to get more than one! Great deal!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me or what but it keeps on smudging thus, having raccoon eyes; I&#x27;ll try putting primer I guess</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used similar products to tightline and it never stayed on. This stuff won&#x27;t move all day long. I&#x27;ve literally worn it sun up to sun down and had no problems. Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner. It stays on for awhile, and it easy to put on. If you leave the cap off though it will dry up almost. It is super strange, and if that happens then just draw with it on something to get the dry layer off then it is back to normal.</li>
            <li> This is the only eyeliner that stays on me.  I have tried all the expensive eyeliner and by the end of the day it runs down my eyes.  This does not do that</li>
            <li> After a few hours it can smudge a bit, but not too bad. It works great for lower rims too, which in my book is a major plus. One thing is that you really have to work to get it off</li>
            <li> I have tried several eyeliners and this product is superior</li>
            <li> In fact, I would pay a lot more for it. I think it outperforms every expensive version I have tried from Chanel to MAC. It stays on all day and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It works great and I love this eyeliner. Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t go well in your purse. It decided to break in half inside my purse and get on everything. I&#x27;d only suggest to use this if you plan on keeping it on your make up bag :P</li>
            <li> Have used this for years, and it still is my choice for my purpose. I am unable to get out much to shop, therefore, when I see it for a decent price online, I buy it.  I have Amazon Prime, so the free shipping comes into play when considering the price.  It usually lasts all day, so it is still my go to for soft eyeliner.  I would recommend for the above reasons.</li>
            <li> While it looked new, it was not in the original package. When I used it it crumbles away like it is old.</li>
            <li> I ordered three pencils from this seller.  I have been using this pencil from Revlon for over 15 years.  All three pencils have broken and wasted the liner &amp;#34;lead&amp;#34;. The product this seller must have is very old; I would not recommend buying.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner works for me and my job.  If you sweat a lot though I would get a higher end eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item for my mother and she was very happy with the item and the price you can&#x27;t beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THX&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rich</li>
            <li> Amazon needs to update this product presentation because it is false advertising. I ordered these (as pictured and described on the site), but what I got was the awful substitute that has the smudger attached. The one with the smudger is the WORST because the sharpener doesn&#x27;t work and pieces of the &amp;#34;crayon&amp;#34; break off inside of it every single time, thus sending me into a fitful rage as I&#x27;m rushing to get ready in the mornings. Also, the swivel doesn&#x27;t lock so when you&#x27;re using it, it keeps swiveling and extending. So annoying!!!!! I hear that the original (the one advertised) was discontinued, so AMAZON--please update your site to reflect this!</li>
            <li> This is the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve found for waterline. I&#x27;ve even tried mac eye liners for 16$ macs eyeliner didntneven last on my waterline for 2 minutes. And barely lasted one hour on my lids. Revlon colorstay lasts all day on my lids and a pretty good amount of time on my waterline. Truth is though..your waterline is called a waterline for a reason. No eyeliner is going to last all day on your waterline...it&#x27;s there to flush our things from yours eyes it&#x27;s constantly wet everytime you blink. You just have to keep applying though out the day. But I find this liner to last longer than others even expensive brands. It&#x27;s goes on smooth and is very opaque.</li>
            <li> On vaca i borrowed my sisters eyeliner because i left mine at home and it was the stay color by Revlon. It was amazing, no raccoon eyes. when i got home I went and bought some for myself and its was great, i caught my boyfriend cheating on me and did alot of crying but my eyeliner was perfect. i bought about 3 of them after that before everything changed. I dont know if they changed the formula but it started giving me the raccoon eyes i thought i had bought a dud so i bought another one and sure enough it did it again. with this said i am still on a search for the perfect eyeliner that wont give me the raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li> Very good product, I always use this eyeliner as it provides a good result (as long as you have a steady hand).</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is good for my top and bottom lashlines, and even tightlining my upper lashes. But, this did not stay very long on my waterline.  I&#x27;d say it wore off after about a half hour.  Some liners don&#x27;t even last that long.  I&#x27;m not a big fan of putting eyeshadow on top of liner at my waterline, but in a pinch, it does work.  I had a bit of trouble getting a precise line on my upper lashes, but i suppose I need a liquid liner for that.  The formula seems to be fairly soft.  Although, I&#x27;ve had other liners that were creamier.  Thankfully, I didn&#x27;t get raccoon eyes with this product.  I wish there were more product for the price.  Anyway, the color is a good, dark black and it stayed put on my lash lines.  I like it, but I can do just as well with a less expensive liner and get more product at the same time.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t bad but not my favorite. It doesn&#x27;t last as long as my other eyeliners like this and it doesn&#x27;t go on as dark and thick as my maybeline pencil.</li>
            <li> I usually use this eyeliner to tightline and to line my waterline. It leaves a bold, dark line but you can make it look more natural and not as dramatic by applying it lightly or blending it out a bit. It&#x27;s very creamy and easy to apply. It doesn&#x27;t irritate your eye or tug at it during application. The one huge negative is that this eyeliner definitely smudges a lot. It doesn&#x27;t really ever seem to set and stays creamy and tacky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sharpener is pretty much useless but it&#x27;s not a big deal. The eyeliner is so creamy that it just breaks off when I try to sharpen it but it works fine without being sharpened because it&#x27;s a twist up eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I love the color, and texture, I just wish there was an easier way to sharpen. There is a sharpener in the bottom of the pen but it don&#x27;t really work. I still love the liner though!</li>
            <li> I was pleased with this purchase. I like that it goes on pretty easily and it lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had an eyeliner stay as well as this one. Easy to apply not hard feeling glides very well on waterline would suggest!</li>
            <li> I always use this eye liner, but I usually buy it from WalMart. Purchasing from Amazon this time, I ended up saving a few dollars, even with shipping!&lt;br /&gt;This eye liner is comparable right up there with Ulta and Sephora products.  Goes on easily (just be careful how much you twist out to use because I have had pieces break off), I love that the ColorStay product does just that and stays on all day long without running and smudging!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know but my girl love it :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s astounding how fast this product disappears from your skin. It doesn&#x27;t matter whether you apply it to bare skin, eyeshadow base, primer, powder, or some combination. Also, it does NOT go onto your inner lids/waterlines at all. Finally, it is also not possible to sharpen it at all, so once it&#x27;s been used, you&#x27;re stuck with the same thickness of line.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with this is that if you twist too much liner out it breaks when you are applying it.</li>
            <li> First of all I bought this eyeliner because I needed something waterproof and smudge proof. This one is neither. When I first got it, I found it difficult to apply because it was shaped like a hollow pipe, so until I was able to wear it down to one even solid dube it was basically a pain to apply. However, it does look nice once it is on for about 2-3 hours. After that my eyelids were smudged with eyeliner and every time I touched my eyes for any reason my fingers would get stained too. It does not run down your face, but it still does not do the job a it claims to do.</li>
            <li> This is the only eyeliner I will use and I got one for free! plus it was cheaper then buying it from a store.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product Overall!!!</li>
            <li> I goes on smoothly, but runs out quickly.</li>
            <li> For a make-up novice, this stuff is great! It goes on smoothly and easily - doesn&#x27;t have that scratchy pencil consistency. It even comes with a sharpener. The only downside is that the creamyness wears off. Luckily, after sharpening (or if it breaks) the liner resumes its nice and easy application. It also helps to sharpen it if you like a nice thin line. I think almost anyone can successfully use this liner!</li>
            <li> Okay so I am really bad at writing reviews after purchasing something. This was one of my favorite eyeliners that would actually last all day for me. But recently they did make some change to the formula because it does not show up dark like it did and you would have to apply it a few times. For that reason I gave the product a 3 star. The 3 star is for Revlon and the change made to the product. Nothing towards seller. I give seller a * * * * * star. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Good quality for good price.</li>
            <li> I have used revlon color stay eyeliner for many years. About six months ago, I noticed that my favorite eyeliner had a new packaging. I didn&#x27;t think much of it and bought it anyway. I got it home and applied to my lower water line a few hours later... Within 10 minutes, my eyes were watery and cloudy as well as horribly blood shot. This was not normal. I read my &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; packaging to find out that the formula had been changed and the eyeliner was waterproof. I guess that&#x27;s good because it makes your eyes water so freaking much! The packaging does a horrible job of advertising that it is waterproof. Some us DO NOT want waterproof eyeliner. I have not found any replacement that works as well, or looks as good as this eyeliner did. I guess I&#x27;ll have to check Almay for some hypoallergenic products... &#x3D;/. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely manner prior to first arrival date in good order. This eyeliner is one of the great ones.  It has 16hr staying power.  Goes on smooth and looks great with a great price to match.  Beats the heck out of the so called higher end products. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> A &#x27;must&#x27;. Affordable and works like a charm. Easy on, perhaps one reapplication through the day, and looks great. Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this eyeliner for years and have no plans on switching.  It&#x27;s not too soft nor too hard.  It&#x27;s long lasting and doesn&#x27;t smear.</li>
            <li> I keep trying this pencil hoping to love it. I give up, then after awhile try it again.  I do love this pencil for the nice, smooth line it makes and its long wear. I can go the whole work day and not need a touch up. BUT, one thing drives me nuts with this product. It comes with a built-in sharpener, but every time I try to sharpen it, the point breaks inside the sharpener. I&#x27;ve tried extending the pencil out less, more, in between - it doesn&#x27;t matter. It breaks 99.9% of the time. Do any of you sharpen it and if so, do you have any tips?</li>
            <li> Love how this doesn&#x27;t come off all over your face like other brands. Will definitely order this again...just need to use up what I have!</li>
            <li> Great product ...long lasting</li>
            <li> Glad I found a stay on eye liner for much less than the Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder one I was purchasing. Happy to save some $$ and still have quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 5 years now and I love it</li>
            <li> Really easy to use! Stays on all day even in the water line!</li>
            <li> Well, I expected more for Revlon... This eyeliner is good, but not an excellent one. I used to use another Revlon eyeliner and it was super awesome... However, they stopped producing it. This one is a little bit hard for me. It lasts really long, but I prefer a soft liner.</li>
            <li> I love Color Stay products.  They go on easily and look nice.  I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Is good,  but little hard when you aply the product in your eyes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eyeliner for 5 or 6 years now and it&#x27;s never failed me. Doesn&#x27;t run, smudge, and is very precise. I chose to buy online because my stores aren&#x27;t selling the black anymore...don&#x27;t know why but all I&#x27;ve been able to find are blue or black brown. Came fast in the mail in a sealed package. Very nice.</li>
            <li> Until my most recent purchase of this product, I thought it was the best eyeliner ever! I don&#x27;t know what happened, but the last one I bought is terrible. I have to work and work just to get the line to show up,  and it is still not like it used to be. By the time I get ready to head out the door, most of it has faded away. Maybe I got a defective product???</li>
            <li> Its okay but not waterproof. All over my eyelid and under eyes. Looks like I&#x27;m tired by the end of the day. Its not great. you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Pencils were dried up and old</li>
            <li> Revlon Colorstay-I had used these for the longest time.  Overall they are pretty good, the color is deep but I was having problems with applying them. Maybe its because I apply over eye shadow, I don&#x27;t know if it gets coated or something and it didn&#x27;t seem to go on smoothly. I had to keep sharpening it. Again, this may have to do with my application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prestige Eye Pencil-I tried to find a similar item and found these [[ASIN:B00433VGVW Prestige Mechanical Eye Pencil, Black, 0.01-Ounce (Pack of 3)]]. I loved the price so I decided to try them.  I think they are similar to the Revlon and it did seem to glide on just a tad better but I still had problems applying it.  I had to go over a couple of times to get the color intensity I wanted and even when I did, the color wasn&#x27;t as intense and seemed more grayish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too Faced-I recently decided to splurge and tried these [[ASIN:B0057VH8QQ Too Faced Perfect Eyes Waterproof Eyeliner, Perfect Black, 0.04 Ounce]] because of the great reviews and I loved them. They are almost twice as expensive but they are waxier and they just glide on.  I don&#x27;t have any problems applying it. If you don&#x27;t want a stark line, they are easy to blend.  The color is intense, a deep, true black.  In the morning, I do have more raccoon eyes than I do with the other two but I just have to make sure I remove makeup before going to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think Prestige and the Revlon Colorstay have slightly better staying power and that is their appeal but I don&#x27;t like the application as much as the Too Faced eyeliner.  It just easier to apply and looks so much better than the other two, there is no comparison.  I am going to stick with them.  I am going to try wearing one of each around the house (it would be noticeable so I don&#x27;t want to wear out) to compare them side by side and see how they do and I&#x27;ll try to upload some pictures later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve added a photo of the Too Faced, Revlon and Prestige in Black on my arm over mac Eyeshadow primer.  One thing to keep in mind is that on my arm I can apply a little more pressure since the skin is taut and straight where as your eyelid is not so its harder to apply more pressure unless you pull it taut which is not good for wrinkles.adow primer.
