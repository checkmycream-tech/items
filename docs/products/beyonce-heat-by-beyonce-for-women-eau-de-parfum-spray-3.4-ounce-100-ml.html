            <li>love it great smell very mild</li>
            <li>This fragrance is the perfect blend of sweet - almonds - almost an undertone of rich caramel and sultry - a hint of musk (which I don&#x27;t like to be overpowered with).  </li>
            <li>Great product, pricing, and quick delivery time.</li>

            <li>I have fallen in love with this fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>Blood vessels are closest to the skin giving off more heat and the pulse helps spread the scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume and you can&#x27;t beat the deal for this.  </li>
            <li>Impressive lasting power!</li>
            <li>I love this smell....</li>

            <li>love it, Not doing all 5 starts.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it smells against my skin.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li>Thsi perfume is just ok..</li>
            <li>but so many guys love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>it has a lighter and more sexy scent.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent of this perfume, it&#x27;s very unique and seductive.</li>
            <li>The light and refreshing scent was perfect for my teenage daughter.  </li>
            <li>Good product, first time of using it.</li>
            <li>Worth the money!!</li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t worn spray perfume in years, so this was a pleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice, clean scent without being too strong.  </li>
            <li>it was a really good price for such a good smelling perfume.</li>
            <li>Very good deep scent to this.  </li>
            <li>Great perfum to wear if you like soft fragrances.</li>
            <li>but it sure as hell isn&#x27;t the Beyonce Heat we&#x27;ve come to enjoy.</li>
            <li>I can put it on in the morning and in the evening I am still able to enjoy it.</li>
            <li>In addition to the beautiful fragrance, the bottle is also very pretty and well deserving to be left out on display!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sultry but slightly sweet!</li>
            <li>Great scent and after a long hunt for the perfect perfume, I can say I finally found it!</li>
            <li>it last long, smells great, and the size is perfect.</li>
            <li>Best price around, big bottle, fresh.</li>
            <li>It smells so good on my skin, sweet and hot.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so pungent, musky and strong.</li>
            <li>Some perfumes I also enjoy are Marc Jacobs Honey &amp; Dot, Coach Poppy, Vera Wang Princess, Love Struck and Escada; so if you enjoy sweet not spicy or musky perfumes, you will love HEAT.</li>
            <li>im more of a sweet flowery perfume girl</li>
            <li>I love the sweet smell of this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>and it starts smelling more like almonds and gets sweet rather than musky.</li>
            <li>At first, smells nice.</li>
            <li>PLUS BEYONCE IS HEKKA FINE</li>
            <li>the scent smells absolutely amazing, and apparently someone else liked it too.</li>
            <li>I was super bummed after spending the money on it, but it Does smell better once it&#x27;s on the skin.</li>
            <li>(Twisting off or pulling off cover of bottle, it is quite snug like a cheap perfume would be.)</li>
            <li>She has used/wore Beyonce Heat for a couple of years and enjoy it.</li>
            <li>i enjoy it</li>
            <li>Lots of compliments, light fruity scent.</li>
            <li>love it,smell good,i recomend the product to any one it good and smell good,you will enjoy it and buy next tim</li>
            <li>The ladies of the house really enjoy this item.</li>
            <li>Great for romantic times.</li>
            <li>Its a light smell</li>
            <li>When I googled where to find it, I found Amazon carried it at such a great price.</li>
            <li>it is still a fabulous</li>
            <li>i enjoy</li>
            <li>Not a perfume i would recommend: the scent reminds me of a cheap perfume I once encountered.</li>
            <li>fantastic</li>
            <li>although the smell is still good, it doesn&#x27;t wow me and excite me like it used to before.</li>
            <li>If you are on the hunt for a sexy but sophisticated fragrance, I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It stays rather close to the skin which is probably a good thing because the fruitiness is big and would be overwhelming otherwise.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong and not too light, it&#x27;s just right!</li>
            <li>It is not over powering, and it has just that right amount of bite to have your &#x27;victims&#x27; squirming :)  Enjoy.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was fast!!!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this fragrance!!!!</li>
            <li>for all those women who love the sweet taste, I recommend this perfume, which, other than its rich aroma, has a beautiful presentation and size.</li>
            <li>but Fire Dance is fresh and bright with a hint of musk while Heat is a bit richer, thicker, and older.</li>
            <li>It is def a sexy fragrance that I find doesn&#x27;t go with my everyday wear, but it&#x27;s great for a night out or some one on one time with a special someone!</li>
            <li>I am aware that the bottle is not always filled to the top when purchasing a perfume but the amount of the perfume excluded from the bottle itself made me LIVID.</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful perfume - long lasting and a gorgeous scent.  </li>
            <li>I had the original for years.</li>
            <li>I bought this when mine ran out and it smells nothing like the original.</li>
            <li>I was excited when I saw this perfume at the store.</li>
            <li>plum is in this original Heat.</li>
            <li>nice different smell than most perfumes.</li>
            <li>If you like sweet, fresh, and flirty scents, this might be for you!</li>
            <li>a sweet smell,,not too</li>
            <li>Sweet and still one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>I love that you don&#x27;t need to douce yourself in too much of it and it lasts for the majority of the day.</li>
            <li>Now I can only hope that the &amp;#34;Midnight Heat&amp;#34; smells good.</li>
            <li>My bottle was sent not even full.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, my wifes favorite</li>
            <li>Bomb love it so much</li>
            <li>and i was pretty surprised that it smelled that good as well.</li>
            <li>not bad</li>
            <li>no bad at all i like after seaching for one perfume i decide for this one and when i got it</li>
            <li>Not a bad thing but</li>
            <li>my friends ask me what kind of perfume is this for those who don &#x60;t like strong smell so, is not for you, this perfume it last all day , not regret.</li>
            <li>Its a smell more for older ladies in my opinion</li>
            <li>love this perfume, so glad i bought this from Amazon very big bottle of perfume for the price.</li>
            <li>Luckily I stumbled upon a comment online where someone compared this perfume to Fire Dance and recommended it.  </li>
            <li>Putting on a spritz of this perfume makes me feel more confident, and well put-together in almost in instant.</li>
            <li>I love trying new scents</li>
            <li>I have fallen in love with this scent and it may become my new signature spray.</li>
            <li>Product exactly as described!</li>
            <li>Not the real perfume smells cheap</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really match up to my expectation or maybe because i was expecting something really fantastic..</li>
            <li>its worth the money</li>
            <li>she didnt mind smelling like an old granny :)</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I am not crazy about this perfume</li>
            <li>Totally worth it,</li>
            <li>It has a soft &amp; sexy smell to it.</li>
            <li>It has a fruity, almost peachy smell to it, but at the same time it&#x27;s warm and musky.</li>
            <li>I  love the smell not to loud.  </li>
            <li>Price very reasonable and very fast delivery!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments from both friends and strangers on this perfume, as I imagine is the case for most other people who wear it too.</li>
            <li>A very warm and cozy type of fragrance.</li>
            <li>I bought this parfume on july 22, for my wife, after I recive it on my house, I give it to my wife and she love it, the floral scent are gorgeous, and has a long last arom.</li>
            <li>however my sister loves it, and other people say it smells good.</li>
            <li>I got the perfume right on time.</li>
            <li>But even though it&#x27;s light its strong enough to smell without getting too close to whoever has it on.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own but certainly for a different occasion or person.  </li>
            <li>It was unique for sure and it has been the only long standing favorite for me.  </li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m glad it does last long since it smells amazing</li>
            <li>was very pleased with OxKom to refund the money for the other product, Thank you</li>
            <li>I was in shock because I expected more from Amazon!</li>
            <li>Just an FYI, it doesn&#x27;t take very much application either, just a couple of strategically placed spritzes.</li>
            <li>One of my fav perfume and price is very reasonable</li>
            <li>But then, the undertones came out and smelled very much like cinnamon.</li>
            <li>Overall not dissappointed, because it&#x27;s always a little risky buying online, and this was a good price. :)</li>
            <li>Smells great and is long lasting!</li>
            <li>My husband came home from work one day and said, \\&quot;Honey, you have to get this cologne because it is exactly what a woman should smell like!\\</li>
            <li>The first time I smelled this</li>
            <li>I hope Amazon continues to offer these fragrances at these prices because I will surly be back for more.</li>
            <li>I love this scent, and only wear this.  </li>
            <li>My fault that I bought it solely based on reviews instead of trying first.  </li>
            <li>:) i can&#x27;t get enough of it!!!</li>
            <li>WHEN I FIRST RECIEVED THIS ITEM</li>
            <li>I EXPECTED IT TO HAVE A MORE SWEET SMELL.</li>
            <li>IDK but this one does not smell exactly like the one I had.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the smell lasts through the day, so may buy the better quality next time.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more of this.</li>
            <li>MY SON SAID THAT IT MADE FOR A HOT (HEAT) NIGHT OF ROMANCE</li>
            <li>No defects of which I was aware.</li>
            <li>It will only enhance your special evening rather on a special date or right out of the shower/bath before retiring for the evening.</li>
            <li>Well ,but first of all what I purchased was not what arrived at my house,It was listed as Beyonce</li>
            <li>Mine came in the box with the wrapping on it and looked exactly like it does in the picture on here as it&#x27;s advertised.</li>
            <li>Heat is Queen Bey&#x27;s debut fragrance (aside from her Tommy Hilfiger perfume back in &#x27;03, but that was more of a promotional tie-in) all her</li>
            <li>I did love the store samples, but this just smells different to me..</li>
            <li>It is now definitely one of my favorites and I will make sure to keep it in stock.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>So first off for those looking this is not even in the ballpark as a dupe for Amy Brown Fire Dance.</li>
            <li>it arrived, it smelled old and not like I had experienced previously</li>
            <li>Overall, its a pleasant combination of a musk and maybe flowery scent, but with the best of both instead of the heaviness of a musk or the fruity sickly scent of too much flower.  </li>
            <li>Was very satisfied with the price and the scent itself but the bottle was definitely not full.</li>
            <li>Heat is much muskier, and closer to a men&#x27;s cologne smell while Fire Dance is much younger and sharper to the nose with more floral fruity tones.</li>
            <li>This was a gift to my special one , she was amazed and surprised about the smell and the presentation of the product, I made it.</li>
            <li>I never considered buying this fragrance but kept seeing all of the positive feedback.</li>
            <li>Men seem to love this smell and it lady a long time.</li>
            <li>After purchasing it it smells like mostly plum to me, which is so strange</li>
            <li>thanks for being fast on delivery!</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore it, in fact i bought a second bottle as a present to a good friend.</li>
            <li>Satisfied with my purchase &amp; shipping didn&#x27;t take that long either pretty fast</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t complain about this small because its smalls good on her skin.</li>
            <li>It is not too strong and lasts for several hours when worn.</li>
            <li>but I can certainly say I will keep it around.   </li>
            <li>I might try mixing it with a purely musk scent to even out the sweetness.</li>
            <li>I just recently bought Beyoncé&#x27;s new fragrance &amp;#34;Rise&amp;#34; in February and fell in love with its scent.</li>
            <li>this is one of the best female fragances I have smelled on my wifes body it is soft and long lasting</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very strong and it&#x27;s definitely something to wear while going out at later hours, but that is exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Dont get the cheap knock off, spend the extra to get this.</li>
            <li>I thought it was too much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very muskey, and old-woman smelly.</li>
            <li>and it was sent without a hitch so fast.  </li>
            <li>but this one I really don&#x27;t care for the smell.  </li>
            <li>I feel like a real lady when I wear this perfume.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft yet powerful just like Beyoncé.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this, but have not received any compliments on it.</li>
            <li>That being said, I don&#x27;t think the scent has much staying power.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>The smell is very sexy and long lasting.</li>
            <li>This is such a soft and sexy fragrance</li>
            <li>&#x3D;) I usually do not buy celeb scents, they just don&#x27;t last very long or they go on way to strong and they are gone by lunch time</li>
            <li>Wow!!!</li>
            <li>This fragrance has a very fresh feminine scent to it and this is something you can wear daily.</li>
            <li>Heat is one of two of my favorite fragrances, and the other is Pulse.</li>
            <li>I love this and will continue to buy it in addition to the other fragrances that I wear.</li>
            <li>Nice, rich, and while it is a bit different than the normal fruity-florals we see in celebrity fragrances, it is still predictable.</li>
            <li>Nice but scent does not last as long as it should.</li>
            <li>A good subtle smells that men can resist</li>
            <li>I will continue to purchase as long as available at this value.</li>
            <li>I can see this being a young girl&#x27;s first &amp;#34;grown</li>
            <li>is a change of pace from typical celebrity sweet-smelling fragrances; it&#x27;s: spicy, woodsy, sultry, sexy &amp; has a hint of musk (but not overpowering at all!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is less plumy-to-me and more floral.</li>
            <li>Very classy!</li>
            <li>Very professional!</li>
            <li>I think I bought too much and the novelty wore off early</li>
            <li>Needless to say, she was happy when this arrived.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for a better smelling and long lasting perfume</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this perfume and wear it almost everyday.</li>
            <li>So I was looking for a perfume to replace my long sought after Amy Brown Fire Dance perfume and finally caved and decided to try this since my many internet searches kept suggesting it.</li>
            <li>I actually have an empty bottle of Amy Brown Fire Dance and did a direct comparison just to be sure, but sadly it&#x27;s not even close.&lt;br</li>
            <li>,  I apply lotion right after a bath or shower and wait to apply perfume, oils on our skin seem to help it last longer.</li>
            <li>I am not a big perfume user and this scent was just right for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a subtle, not in-your-face kind of fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I will be getting more for other family members for next christma and birthday presents.</li>
            <li>It also smells exactly the same as the ones I&#x27;ve smelt in the stores.</li>
            <li>Have tried many other scents that have similar ingredients</li>
            <li>I chosen this rating, because my mother was hoping to enjoy the perfume, I got for her birthday, a little bit longer.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this fragrance to almost every young woman.</li>
            <li>I think it smells like an old lady&#x27;s perfume instead of a young lady&#x27;s perfume.</li>
            <li>Seemed almost old, or as if the perfume itself had lost its oomph... gave it to my daughter</li>
            <li>it Smell&#x27;s old .....</li>
            <li>Wow, i have used the bottle up and just bought it...</li>
            <li>it smells like an expired old fashioned 1960&#x27;s perfume that you&#x27;d find lying around in a thrift shop.</li>
            <li>Not the same as the real Beyonce Heat.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re young and just looking to impress the guys, this perfume is for you.</li>
            <li>i just use it as when all else fails when i run out of the good stuff</li>
            <li>This smell is really sharp and kind of childish...</li>
            <li>however, it is worth the money spent.....!</li>
            <li>Nicely done, Amazon - selling a fake product, and then not allowing me to return it - classy!</li>
            <li>After some time, I grew sick of it and decided it wasn&#x27;t a good fit for me since I like more subtle scents that don&#x27;t overpower me or other people.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although there are a few stronger scents I enjoy, I am not a fan of perfumes that are powdery, musky, rose-jasmine nor perfumes like Yves Saint Laurent Opium, Chanel No.5 or Elizabeth Taylor White Diamonds.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells mature, sexy, flirty, its not overwhelming, and last a long time.</li>
            <li>I have searched high and low for Amy Brown&#x27;s \\&quot;Fire Dance\\&quot; and was convinced to buy this product only because someone posted a review claiming it smelled just like it.  </li>
            <li>There is barely any fragrance...</li>
            <li>It doesnt necessarily stay strong for very long, but the subtle scent stays a whole.</li>
            <li>Before you say the bottle is never full i just want to say im completely aware of that</li>
            <li>I was wary of this being a knock off since it was so cheaply priced, but my mom assured me it seemed to be the real product.</li>
            <li>Well.. what can I say, it really cheap, like 20usd, but ladies tends to like this perfume, also this was a better present than a more expensive givenchy perfume(that hurts when you buy a expensive present and everyone prefer the cheap one), any way, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li>Nice perfume for a casual daily outing.</li>
            <li>It seems like a watered down version of the real thing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased 3 small bottles over the past year for my wife from other outlets and we both loved the fragrance.</li>
            <li>It was sweet, but not in the typical sickly perfume smelling kind of way.  </li>
            <li>Like other reviewers say, it does last long and a little goes a long way since the scent is ( to me) quite strong.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I bought that product for a friend and she loved it.</li>
            <li> so I decided to order it and to my surprise it does not smell as good as it did in the store.</li>
            <li> and she loved it.</li>

            <li> IN A GOOD WAY..</li>
            <li> I was fairly displeased with this item.</li>
            <li> The price was good and the perfume is to die for.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s way cheaper than Nicki Minaj perfume and just as good.  </li>

            <li> it does smell good.</li>
            <li> I loved the way It smelled on her.</li>
            <li> Delivery was on time, and price is a bit cheaper on here, so good deal.</li>

            <li> love it great smell very mild</li>
            <li> This fragrance is the perfect blend of sweet - almonds - almost an undertone of rich caramel and sultry - a hint of musk (which I don&#x27;t like to be overpowered with).  </li>
            <li> Great product, pricing, and quick delivery time.</li>

            <li> Very pleased with it and enjoy spritzing it on every morning.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d buy that as well.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased it for my fiancé</li>
            <li> I have fallen in love with this fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li> Blood vessels are closest to the skin giving off more heat and the pulse helps spread the scent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume and you can&#x27;t beat the deal for this.  </li>
            <li> Impressive lasting power!</li>
            <li> I love this smell....</li>
            <li> I also love heat rush.. depending on how I feel determines which one I wear....</li>
            <li> love it, Not doing all 5 starts.  </li>
            <li> I love the way it smells against my skin.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li> Thsi perfume is just ok..</li>
            <li> but so many guys love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> it has a lighter and more sexy scent.  </li>
            <li> I love the scent of this perfume, it&#x27;s very unique and seductive.</li>
            <li> The light and refreshing scent was perfect for my teenage daughter.  </li>
            <li> Good product, first time of using it.</li>
            <li> Worth the money!!</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t worn spray perfume in years, so this was a pleasant surprise.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice, clean scent without being too strong.  </li>
            <li> it was a really good price for such a good smelling perfume.</li>
            <li> Very good deep scent to this.  </li>
            <li> Great perfum to wear if you like soft fragrances.</li>
            <li> but it sure as hell isn&#x27;t the Beyonce Heat we&#x27;ve come to enjoy.</li>
            <li> I can put it on in the morning and in the evening I am still able to enjoy it.</li>
            <li> In addition to the beautiful fragrance, the bottle is also very pretty and well deserving to be left out on display!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sultry but slightly sweet!</li>
            <li> Great scent and after a long hunt for the perfect perfume, I can say I finally found it!</li>
            <li> it last long, smells great, and the size is perfect.</li>
            <li> Best price around, big bottle, fresh.</li>
            <li> It smells so good on my skin, sweet and hot.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so pungent, musky and strong.</li>
            <li> Some perfumes I also enjoy are Marc Jacobs Honey &amp; Dot, Coach Poppy, Vera Wang Princess, Love Struck and Escada; so if you enjoy sweet not spicy or musky perfumes, you will love HEAT.</li>
            <li> im more of a sweet flowery perfume girl</li>
            <li> I love the sweet smell of this fragrance.  </li>
            <li> and it starts smelling more like almonds and gets sweet rather than musky.</li>
            <li> At first, smells nice.</li>
            <li> PLUS BEYONCE IS HEKKA FINE</li>
            <li> the scent smells absolutely amazing, and apparently someone else liked it too.</li>
            <li> I was super bummed after spending the money on it, but it Does smell better once it&#x27;s on the skin.</li>
            <li> (Twisting off or pulling off cover of bottle, it is quite snug like a cheap perfume would be.)</li>
            <li> She has used/wore Beyonce Heat for a couple of years and enjoy it.</li>
            <li> i enjoy it</li>
            <li> Lots of compliments, light fruity scent.</li>
            <li> love it,smell good,i recomend the product to any one it good and smell good,you will enjoy it and buy next tim</li>
            <li> The ladies of the house really enjoy this item.</li>
            <li> Great for romantic times.</li>
            <li> Its a light smell</li>
            <li> When I googled where to find it, I found Amazon carried it at such a great price.</li>
            <li> it is still a fabulous</li>
            <li> i enjoy</li>
            <li> Not a perfume i would recommend: the scent reminds me of a cheap perfume I once encountered.</li>
            <li> fantastic</li>
            <li> although the smell is still good, it doesn&#x27;t wow me and excite me like it used to before.</li>
            <li> If you are on the hunt for a sexy but sophisticated fragrance, I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It stays rather close to the skin which is probably a good thing because the fruitiness is big and would be overwhelming otherwise.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too strong and not too light, it&#x27;s just right!</li>
            <li> It is not over powering, and it has just that right amount of bite to have your &#x27;victims&#x27; squirming :)  Enjoy.  </li>
            <li> Delivery was fast!!!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this fragrance!!!!</li>
            <li> for all those women who love the sweet taste, I recommend this perfume, which, other than its rich aroma, has a beautiful presentation and size.</li>
            <li> but Fire Dance is fresh and bright with a hint of musk while Heat is a bit richer, thicker, and older.</li>
            <li> It is def a sexy fragrance that I find doesn&#x27;t go with my everyday wear, but it&#x27;s great for a night out or some one on one time with a special someone!</li>
            <li> I am aware that the bottle is not always filled to the top when purchasing a perfume but the amount of the perfume excluded from the bottle itself made me LIVID.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful perfume - long lasting and a gorgeous scent.  </li>
            <li> I had the original for years.</li>
            <li> I bought this when mine ran out and it smells nothing like the original.</li>
            <li> I was excited when I saw this perfume at the store.</li>
            <li> plum is in this original Heat.</li>
            <li> nice different smell than most perfumes.</li>
            <li> If you like sweet, fresh, and flirty scents, this might be for you!</li>
            <li> a sweet smell,,not too</li>
            <li> Sweet and still one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I love that you don&#x27;t need to douce yourself in too much of it and it lasts for the majority of the day.</li>
            <li> Now I can only hope that the &amp;#34;Midnight Heat&amp;#34; smells good.</li>
            <li> My bottle was sent not even full.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, my wifes favorite</li>
            <li> Bomb love it so much</li>
            <li> and i was pretty surprised that it smelled that good as well.</li>
            <li> not bad</li>
            <li> no bad at all i like after seaching for one perfume i decide for this one and when i got it</li>
            <li> Not a bad thing but</li>
            <li> my friends ask me what kind of perfume is this for those who don &#x60;t like strong smell so, is not for you, this perfume it last all day , not regret.</li>
            <li> Its a smell more for older ladies in my opinion</li>
            <li> love this perfume, so glad i bought this from Amazon very big bottle of perfume for the price.</li>
            <li> Luckily I stumbled upon a comment online where someone compared this perfume to Fire Dance and recommended it.  </li>
            <li> Putting on a spritz of this perfume makes me feel more confident, and well put-together in almost in instant.</li>
            <li> I love trying new scents</li>
            <li> I have fallen in love with this scent and it may become my new signature spray.</li>
            <li> Product exactly as described!</li>
            <li> Not the real perfume smells cheap</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really match up to my expectation or maybe because i was expecting something really fantastic..</li>
            <li> its worth the money</li>
            <li> she didnt mind smelling like an old granny :)</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I am not crazy about this perfume</li>
            <li> Totally worth it,</li>
            <li> It has a soft &amp; sexy smell to it.</li>
            <li> It has a fruity, almost peachy smell to it, but at the same time it&#x27;s warm and musky.</li>
            <li> I  love the smell not to loud.  </li>
            <li> Price very reasonable and very fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments from both friends and strangers on this perfume, as I imagine is the case for most other people who wear it too.</li>
            <li> A very warm and cozy type of fragrance.</li>
            <li> I bought this parfume on july 22, for my wife, after I recive it on my house, I give it to my wife and she love it, the floral scent are gorgeous, and has a long last arom.</li>
            <li> however my sister loves it, and other people say it smells good.</li>
            <li> I got the perfume right on time.</li>
            <li> But even though it&#x27;s light its strong enough to smell without getting too close to whoever has it on.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own but certainly for a different occasion or person.  </li>
            <li> It was unique for sure and it has been the only long standing favorite for me.  </li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m glad it does last long since it smells amazing</li>
            <li> was very pleased with OxKom to refund the money for the other product, Thank you</li>
            <li> I was in shock because I expected more from Amazon!</li>
            <li> Just an FYI, it doesn&#x27;t take very much application either, just a couple of strategically placed spritzes.</li>
            <li> One of my fav perfume and price is very reasonable</li>
            <li> But then, the undertones came out and smelled very much like cinnamon.</li>
            <li> Overall not dissappointed, because it&#x27;s always a little risky buying online, and this was a good price. :)</li>
            <li> Smells great and is long lasting!</li>
            <li> My husband came home from work one day and said, \\&quot;Honey, you have to get this cologne because it is exactly what a woman should smell like!\\</li>
            <li> The first time I smelled this</li>
            <li> I hope Amazon continues to offer these fragrances at these prices because I will surly be back for more.</li>
            <li> I love this scent, and only wear this.  </li>
            <li> My fault that I bought it solely based on reviews instead of trying first.  </li>
            <li> :) i can&#x27;t get enough of it!!!</li>
            <li> WHEN I FIRST RECIEVED THIS ITEM</li>
            <li> I EXPECTED IT TO HAVE A MORE SWEET SMELL.</li>
            <li> IDK but this one does not smell exactly like the one I had.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the smell lasts through the day, so may buy the better quality next time.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more of this.</li>
            <li> MY SON SAID THAT IT MADE FOR A HOT (HEAT) NIGHT OF ROMANCE</li>
            <li> No defects of which I was aware.</li>
            <li> It will only enhance your special evening rather on a special date or right out of the shower/bath before retiring for the evening.</li>
            <li> Well ,but first of all what I purchased was not what arrived at my house,It was listed as Beyonce</li>
            <li> Mine came in the box with the wrapping on it and looked exactly like it does in the picture on here as it&#x27;s advertised.</li>
            <li> Heat is Queen Bey&#x27;s debut fragrance (aside from her Tommy Hilfiger perfume back in &#x27;03, but that was more of a promotional tie-in) all her</li>
            <li> I did love the store samples, but this just smells different to me..</li>
            <li> It is now definitely one of my favorites and I will make sure to keep it in stock.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> So first off for those looking this is not even in the ballpark as a dupe for Amy Brown Fire Dance.</li>
            <li> it arrived, it smelled old and not like I had experienced previously</li>
            <li> Overall, its a pleasant combination of a musk and maybe flowery scent, but with the best of both instead of the heaviness of a musk or the fruity sickly scent of too much flower.  </li>
            <li> Was very satisfied with the price and the scent itself but the bottle was definitely not full.</li>
            <li> Heat is much muskier, and closer to a men&#x27;s cologne smell while Fire Dance is much younger and sharper to the nose with more floral fruity tones.</li>
            <li> This was a gift to my special one , she was amazed and surprised about the smell and the presentation of the product, I made it.</li>
            <li> I never considered buying this fragrance but kept seeing all of the positive feedback.</li>
            <li> Men seem to love this smell and it lady a long time.</li>
            <li> After purchasing it it smells like mostly plum to me, which is so strange</li>
            <li> thanks for being fast on delivery!</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore it, in fact i bought a second bottle as a present to a good friend.</li>
            <li> Satisfied with my purchase &amp; shipping didn&#x27;t take that long either pretty fast</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t complain about this small because its smalls good on her skin.</li>
            <li> It is not too strong and lasts for several hours when worn.</li>
            <li> but I can certainly say I will keep it around.   </li>
            <li> I might try mixing it with a purely musk scent to even out the sweetness.</li>
            <li> I just recently bought Beyoncé&#x27;s new fragrance &amp;#34;Rise&amp;#34; in February and fell in love with its scent.</li>
            <li> this is one of the best female fragances I have smelled on my wifes body it is soft and long lasting</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very strong and it&#x27;s definitely something to wear while going out at later hours, but that is exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dont get the cheap knock off, spend the extra to get this.</li>
            <li> I thought it was too much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very muskey, and old-woman smelly.</li>
            <li> and it was sent without a hitch so fast.  </li>
            <li> but this one I really don&#x27;t care for the smell.  </li>
            <li> I feel like a real lady when I wear this perfume.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft yet powerful just like Beyoncé.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this, but have not received any compliments on it.</li>
            <li> That being said, I don&#x27;t think the scent has much staying power.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> The smell is very sexy and long lasting.</li>
            <li> This is such a soft and sexy fragrance</li>
            <li> &#x3D;) I usually do not buy celeb scents, they just don&#x27;t last very long or they go on way to strong and they are gone by lunch time</li>
            <li> Wow!!!</li>
            <li> This fragrance has a very fresh feminine scent to it and this is something you can wear daily.</li>
            <li> Heat is one of two of my favorite fragrances, and the other is Pulse.</li>
            <li> I love this and will continue to buy it in addition to the other fragrances that I wear.</li>
            <li> Nice, rich, and while it is a bit different than the normal fruity-florals we see in celebrity fragrances, it is still predictable.</li>
            <li> Nice but scent does not last as long as it should.</li>
            <li> A good subtle smells that men can resist</li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase as long as available at this value.</li>
            <li> I can see this being a young girl&#x27;s first &amp;#34;grown</li>
            <li> is a change of pace from typical celebrity sweet-smelling fragrances; it&#x27;s: spicy, woodsy, sultry, sexy &amp; has a hint of musk (but not overpowering at all!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is less plumy-to-me and more floral.</li>
            <li> Very classy!</li>
            <li> Very professional!</li>
            <li> I think I bought too much and the novelty wore off early</li>
            <li> Needless to say, she was happy when this arrived.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for a better smelling and long lasting perfume</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume and wear it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> So I was looking for a perfume to replace my long sought after Amy Brown Fire Dance perfume and finally caved and decided to try this since my many internet searches kept suggesting it.</li>
            <li> I actually have an empty bottle of Amy Brown Fire Dance and did a direct comparison just to be sure, but sadly it&#x27;s not even close.&lt;br</li>
            <li> ,  I apply lotion right after a bath or shower and wait to apply perfume, oils on our skin seem to help it last longer.</li>
            <li> I am not a big perfume user and this scent was just right for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a subtle, not in-your-face kind of fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I will be getting more for other family members for next christma and birthday presents.</li>
            <li> It also smells exactly the same as the ones I&#x27;ve smelt in the stores.</li>
            <li> Have tried many other scents that have similar ingredients</li>
            <li> I chosen this rating, because my mother was hoping to enjoy the perfume, I got for her birthday, a little bit longer.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this fragrance to almost every young woman.</li>
            <li> I think it smells like an old lady&#x27;s perfume instead of a young lady&#x27;s perfume.</li>
            <li> Seemed almost old, or as if the perfume itself had lost its oomph... gave it to my daughter</li>
            <li> it Smell&#x27;s old .....</li>
            <li> Wow, i have used the bottle up and just bought it...</li>
            <li> it smells like an expired old fashioned 1960&#x27;s perfume that you&#x27;d find lying around in a thrift shop.</li>
            <li> Not the same as the real Beyonce Heat.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re young and just looking to impress the guys, this perfume is for you.</li>
            <li> i just use it as when all else fails when i run out of the good stuff</li>
            <li> This smell is really sharp and kind of childish...</li>
            <li> however, it is worth the money spent.....!</li>
            <li> Nicely done, Amazon - selling a fake product, and then not allowing me to return it - classy!</li>
            <li> After some time, I grew sick of it and decided it wasn&#x27;t a good fit for me since I like more subtle scents that don&#x27;t overpower me or other people.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although there are a few stronger scents I enjoy, I am not a fan of perfumes that are powdery, musky, rose-jasmine nor perfumes like Yves Saint Laurent Opium, Chanel No.5 or Elizabeth Taylor White Diamonds.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells mature, sexy, flirty, its not overwhelming, and last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have searched high and low for Amy Brown&#x27;s \\&quot;Fire Dance\\&quot; and was convinced to buy this product only because someone posted a review claiming it smelled just like it.  </li>
            <li> There is barely any fragrance...</li>
            <li> It doesnt necessarily stay strong for very long, but the subtle scent stays a whole.</li>
            <li> Before you say the bottle is never full i just want to say im completely aware of that</li>
            <li> I was wary of this being a knock off since it was so cheaply priced, but my mom assured me it seemed to be the real product.</li>
            <li> Well.. what can I say, it really cheap, like 20usd, but ladies tends to like this perfume, also this was a better present than a more expensive givenchy perfume(that hurts when you buy a expensive present and everyone prefer the cheap one), any way, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> Nice perfume for a casual daily outing.</li>
            <li> It seems like a watered down version of the real thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased 3 small bottles over the past year for my wife from other outlets and we both loved the fragrance.</li>
            <li> It was sweet, but not in the typical sickly perfume smelling kind of way.  </li>
            <li> Like other reviewers say, it does last long and a little goes a long way since the scent is ( to me) quite strong.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it fades rather quickly and I highly doubt I&#x27;ll repurchase it.</li>
            <li> Last really long.</li>
            <li> Smell didn&#x27;t last to long smell like some knock off perfume</li>
            <li> Fragrance doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> the scent does not last as long as I wish</li>
            <li> last long.</li>
            <li> However does not last very long.</li>
            <li> Gonna go back to the small bottles and give this to some old bag lady.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous how much it is priced for a 3.4 - Ounce bottle.</li>
            <li> much larger than i expected!! ^_^</li>
            <li> Scent lasts just about all day long!!</li>
            <li> I once paid double this price for much less product.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t reapply perfume and it still last until the following day.  </li>
            <li> Only bad thing, especially with most perfumes, is how small the bottle is.</li>
            <li> it was everything I expected.</li>
            <li> expected an nicer fragance from beyonce</li>
            <li> I recommend it widely.</li>
            <li> , i am just letting everyone know to be careful who you order this from.</li>
            <li> not what i expected.</li>
            <li> I have not tried her other perfumes after this one b/c i expected something lighter.</li>
            <li> I was extremely ecstatic to receive this item</li>
            <li> but when I opened up the box I realized that the neck of the bottle was almost completely empty!</li>
            <li> and I cannot stand the other variations or perfumes in the Beyoncé line.</li>
            <li> and so do other&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> not sure what all these comments are, about how the product looked &amp;#34;used&amp;#34; and how it&#x27;s not the actual product.</li>
            <li> out of the 100 MI id say only 75 MI the least was in my bottle .</li>
            <li> not the real purfume sadly</li>
            <li> As it sits on the skin, the peach starts to die down</li>
            <li> I have gotten a few compliments on this as well.</li>
            <li> I waste my money because I don&#x27;t even wear it at all.</li>
            <li> but it shouldn&#x27;t be that much missing.</li>
            <li> No perfume was missing from the bottle whatsoever.</li>
            <li> this was a waste of money&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
            <li> It is one that can&#x27;t be worn year round.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a musky, heavily feminine scent.</li>
            <li> The perfume doesnt smell real and the sprayer was broken and poorly constructed.</li>
            <li> It does not last all day/night like other expensive perfumes</li>
            <li> I was super disappointed when Macy&#x27;s stopped carrying this perfume.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, and even more so because this was supposed to be one of my daughter&#x27;s Xmas presents - she specifically asked for it.</li>
            <li> I have had a bad track record lately with buying perfumes that wear off after only a short time.  </li>
            <li> I was given the small 1oz version of this perfume a while ago</li>
            <li> This perfume also arrived with the cap missing and had leaked (Amazon promptly sent me a replacement)!</li>
            <li> It is almost like Victoria Secret Pink.</li>
            <li> This is definitely NOT a genuine article!</li>
            <li> It was a waste of my money!</li>
            <li> A small 1oz bottle will cost $25 retail so $17.50 for</li>
            <li> In fact, I expect the makers might be the same or trying to capitalize on the fan base of a discontinued product as the bottle is even very similar.  </li>
            <li> and that if returned ,no guarantee that there would not be a restocking charge taken out of my refund,So basically I was very unhappy with the whole</li>
            <li> My wife loves the scent, and this is a hard product to find in any brick and mortar store.</li>
            <li> and I did not know it,then I learned the hard way that you can&#x27;t return colognes via the mail in which I had to eat the cost of sometime I could not use.</li>
            <li> After spraying this I was afraid i let loose the walking apocalyptical dead, tease then tone virus, or osiris thorn</li>
            <li> How disappointing to find out that it&#x27;s not returnable - should have done my homework prior to making a purchase...</li>
            <li> Beyonce Heat is less expensive of the two.  </li>
            <li> However, the bottle is manufactured poorly, the cap fell apart and it is hard to spray.</li>
            <li> Not that it&#x27;s not a good &amp;#34;granny&amp;#34; perfume like you said...</li>
            <li> This perfume certainly shocked me, as it did not smell the same as what I remember.  </li>
            <li> So, being the big Beyoncé fan that I am, I decided to purchase Beyoncé &amp;#34;Heat&amp;#34; and Beyoncé &amp;#34;Midnight Heat.&amp;#34; Just received &amp;#34;Heat&amp;#34; and I HATE the smell...</li>
            <li> I have been reluctant to share with them what I&#x27;m wearing as I want to keep it a secret.</li>
            <li> If you want it to last longer, don&#x27;t just spray your clothing, try spraying it on your pulse points (wrists, behind the ear, base of the throat, crook of the knees and arms, and ankles).</li>
            <li> ewwwww nasty completely unsatisfactory</li>
            <li> Money wasted and totally disappointed.</li>
            <li> Sorry,</li>
            <li> Dont get me wrong</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> it looked like it was used, not happy about this at all!</li>
            <li> But I am not too crazy about it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for Amy Brown&#x27;s Fire Dance perfume, but it is impossible to find anymore.  </li>
            <li> I was definitely disappointed...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please stop buying this horrible stuff, you make people around you get sick.  </li>
            <li> I hated them...</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to my worst enemy!  </li>
            <li> It smells awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> On time I receive the item in Colombia, without damage, and good quality</li>
            <li> much larger than i expected!! ^_^ awesome!!</li>
            <li> Yes; very nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> i absolutely LOVE Beyonce&#x27;s Heat Perfume!  This was sold to me at a great price! I truly am appreciative of the seller&#x27;s expediency in getting this product to me</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend and its smell so good and i would buy more of beyonce stuff for my girlfriend its worth the money</li>
            <li> Great perfum to wear if you like soft fragrances.</li>
            <li> I have had a bad track record lately with buying perfumes that wear off after only a short time.  Heat doesn&#x27;t!  Smells great and is long lasting!</li>
            <li> The smell is a Lil musky to me. Its a smell more for older ladies in my opinion I like the citrus fruity smells but not this one bought it for myself  but now it will be a gift don&#x27;t like the smell. So if ur younger in age I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for u but if its for ur mom aunt etc definitely would.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful perfume - long lasting and a gorgeous scent.  It isn&#x27;t too overpowering but seems to last all day.</li>
            <li> love this perfume, so glad i bought this from Amazon very big bottle of perfume for the price.Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have searched high and low for Amy Brown&#x27;s \\&quot;Fire Dance\\&quot; and was convinced to buy this product only because someone posted a review claiming it smelled just like it.  Sorry, but this does NOT smell just like \\&quot;Fire Dance\\&quot;.  It is very similar.  In fact, I expect the makers might be the same or trying to capitalize on the fan base of a discontinued product as the bottle is even very similar.  However, \\&quot;Fire Dance\\&quot; had something of a spicy kick to it.  It was sweet, but not in the typical sickly perfume smelling kind of way.  It was unique for sure and it has been the only long standing favorite for me.  So, be warned, if you are looking for a stand in for \\&quot;Fire Dance\\&quot;, this product is a half-assed effort.</li>
            <li> My husband came home from work one day and said, \\&quot;Honey, you have to get this cologne because it is exactly what a woman should smell like!\\&quot;  I love it!</li>
            <li> Product came in. Quality product. Came in the gift pack. girlfriend loves it to death. Dont get the cheap knock off, spend the extra to get this. got my girlfriend the gift pack and the individual 3.4 oz bottle. best thing i did this year. Will buy from them again.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely fragrance. It is not too strong and lasts for several hours when worn. I would recommend this fragrance to almost every young woman.</li>
            <li> I was looking for Amy Brown&#x27;s Fire Dance perfume, but it is impossible to find anymore.  Luckily I stumbled upon a comment online where someone compared this perfume to Fire Dance and recommended it.  If you are looking for a perfume to replace Fire Dance this would be it!  When it came in I immediately opened it to sniff test it and it passed with flying colors.  :)  Aside from the scent, both the bottle and the box are attractive if that matters to anyone reading this review and considering this perfume for purchase.</li>
            <li> Had smelled the scent in the store and liked it.  Very pleased with it and enjoy spritzing it on every morning.  Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. I got the perfume right on time.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I&#x27;ll be honest. The first time I smelled this I thought it was too much. Meaning, I felt a lil overwhelmed by the initial try on BUT it did wear off on me and now I absolutely love it. This is the perfume I wear for when I&#x27;m going out on the scene or wearing something real fly. It&#x27;s that kind of scent to me. I like the lotion also that goes with it. It doesn&#x27;t make my hands itch or anything. The perfume has good endurance to it as well. It doesn&#x27;t last like some others I have tried but it gets the job done so I definitely recommend Beyonce&#x27;s Heat. I think its her best one thus far and its truly something for us youngins, lol!</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m not that big of a Beyonce fan, but this perfume smells so wonderful.  I bought it a while back and it&#x27;s almost gone.  I&#x27;m more into body oils nowadays, and if they make it into a body oil I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d buy that as well.  I really haven&#x27;t worn spray perfume in years, so this was a pleasant surprise.  If you like sweet, fresh, and flirty scents, this might be for you!</li>
            <li> Love the scent and GREAT price!!</li>
            <li> NOTHING like what ACTUAL Beyonce Heat smells like.  It&#x27;s very muskey, and old-woman smelly.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and it was sent without a hitch so fast.  Better than the stores because I save money.  what&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> It smells VERY good. You can feel the difference between the difference in material used to make this bottle. (Twisting off or pulling off cover of bottle, it is quite snug like a cheap perfume would be.) Still, I would buy another because of the smell. It does not last all day/night like other expensive perfumes however, it is worth the money spent.....!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my Girlfriend and she loves it and i was pretty surprised that it smelled that good as well. Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Ohhhhh this scent. It smells so good on my skin, sweet and hot. Ordered from perfumania, excellent price and it arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Price very reasonable and very fast delivery!</li>
            <li> excellent product, very good quality recommend</li>
            <li> The bottle is large and beautiful and the fragrance is scrumptious. Heat is one of two of my favorite fragrances, and the other is Pulse. I hope Amazon continues to offer these fragrances at these prices because I will surly be back for more.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this perfume, it&#x27;s very unique and seductive. Heat lasts all day and is just perfect!</li>
            <li> Not the real perfume smells cheap</li>
            <li> Nice but scent does not last as long as it should.</li>
            <li> I love this scent, and only wear this.  It is kind of a woody, earthy smell but not to strong....it is amazing and I have worn a lot more expensive one and this is my all time favorite.  I recommend this, because I do not like floral or fruit scents.....AMAZING</li>
            <li> Love it! I call it my fall and winter scent. Affordable!</li>
            <li> I had a great experience as always</li>
            <li> Gave this as a gift to my daughter.  She has used/wore Beyonce Heat for a couple of years and enjoy it.</li>
            <li> and gives me a  headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please stop buying this horrible stuff, you make people around you get sick.  Plus, you can&#x27;t smell it after you put it on and you have no idea that I can smell it from 15 or 20 feet away.  yuck.</li>
            <li> I Love this parfum,,,has a sweet smell,,not too over powering,,,receive compliments all the time. Worth the money!! Well I am a Beyonce Fan so anything of hers I try to purchase. Will recommend to a Friend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased 3 small bottles over the past year for my wife from other outlets and we both loved the fragrance. I figured I&#x27;d get her the big bottle for Christmas but we both choke on the smell of this. Not that it&#x27;s not a good &amp;#34;granny&amp;#34; perfume like you said... but it sure as hell isn&#x27;t the Beyonce Heat we&#x27;ve come to enjoy. Gonna go back to the small bottles and give this to some old bag lady.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0039VOSPU Beyonce Heat By Beyonce For Women Eau De Parfum Spray, 3.4-Ounce / 100 Ml]] I just stumbled across this scent while browsing the perfume aisle. I love trying new scents but I tend to be cautious because I have gotten some that as soon as I got home and put them on I hated them... Definately NOT the case with Heat by Beyonce. I have fallen in love with this scent and it may become my new signature spray. &#x3D;) I usually do not buy celeb scents, they just don&#x27;t last very long or they go on way to strong and they are gone by lunch time or you have to spray on a gallon to make it through the work day. NOT with this one. I can put it on in the morning and in the evening I am still able to enjoy it. &#x3D;) I have gotten a few compliments on this as well. I&#x27;ve only had it for a couple of days but I can certainly say I will keep it around.   Just an FYI, it doesn&#x27;t take very much application either, just a couple of strategically placed spritzes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for a better smelling and long lasting perfume but this one I really don&#x27;t care for the smell.  My fault that I bought it solely based on reviews instead of trying first.  I think it smells like an old lady&#x27;s perfume instead of a young lady&#x27;s perfume.</li>
            <li> I love beyonce and I love the scent. However, the bottle is manufactured poorly, the cap fell apart and it is hard to spray.</li>
            <li> The woman I bought this for loves it. She wears it all the time. It smells really good. I love that she loves it.</li>
            <li> I bought that product for a friend and she loved it. This fragrance has a very fresh feminine scent to it and this is something you can wear daily. Don&#x27;t forget the great price.</li>
            <li> i am so happy with this perfume! i went back to Macy&#x27;s and bought the lotion! It&#x27;s the longest lasting perfume i have ever tried! and i&#x27;m glad it does last long since it smells amazing :) i can&#x27;t get enough of it!!! my boyfriend likes it too so that is always a plus</li>
            <li> This scent is so great! It smells sexy and alluring. My friends and I wear it as a date perfume because it works just as well as the pheromone perfumes! Best part: it lasts ALL day!</li>
            <li> I tried this perfume in the store and it smelled wonderful so I decided to order it and to my surprise it does not smell as good as it did in the store. I waste my money because I don&#x27;t even wear it at all.</li>
            <li> REAL SEXY SMELLING MY LADY LOVES IT</li>
            <li> My wife loves this fragrance!</li>
            <li> It has a lovely smell/ Bought it for my girlfriend and she loved it. I also love the smell as well.</li>
            <li> This perfume certainly shocked me, as it did not smell the same as what I remember.  Seemed almost old, or as if the perfume itself had lost its oomph... gave it to my daughter she didnt mind smelling like an old granny :)</li>
            <li> Very good deep scent to this.  I can only describe it as a lighter Female version of Joop.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This product smells so good - I feel like a real lady when I wear this perfume.</li>
            <li> I was waiting for my order.Please I would like to have my money back.</li>
            <li> Great size and price.&lt;br /&gt;  However does not last very long.</li>
            <li> Something I love to wear in the summer....&lt;br /&gt;I got plenty of compliments when I wore this...&lt;br /&gt;Seems to last all day</li>
            <li> I bought this parfume on july 22, for my wife, after I recive it on my house, I give it to my wife and she love it, the floral scent are gorgeous, and has a long last arom. I bought the 3.4 oz version, so she used every day in almost every ocacion.  The clothes she used days before still has the arom of \\&quot;heat\\&quot;. Totally recomend this product.</li>
            <li> WHEN I FIRST RECIEVED THIS ITEM I EXPECTED IT TO HAVE A MORE SWEET SMELL. BUT I LIKE IT . ITS GIVES A SOPHISTICATED YET CHARMING SMELL . ITS DIFERENT BUT IN A GOOD WAY.. PLUS BEYONCE IS HEKKA FINE</li>
            <li> Absolutey love this scent.  Lasts all day and I get compliments whenever I wear it.  Delivery was fast!!!</li>
            <li> Heat has always been a favorite of mine! It&#x27;s sultry but slightly sweet! It&#x27;s a very sexy fragrance! Heat has no age limit!</li>
            <li> Great fragrance and good value 3.4 ounce for only $20. I will continue to purchase as long as available at this value.</li>
            <li> It met my expectations in every way. A good purchase!</li>
            <li> Smells delightful. A good subtle smells that men can resist</li>
            <li> This fragrance is the perfect blend of sweet - almonds - almost an undertone of rich caramel and sultry - a hint of musk (which I don&#x27;t like to be overpowered with).  It&#x27;s a subtle, not in-your-face kind of fragrance.  Very classy!</li>
            <li> There is barely any fragrance...I bought it for my wife after reading the amazon reviews of this product.Money wasted and totally disappointed.</li>
            <li> el producto llego en el tiempo estipulado, en excelentes condiciones, recomendado totalmente este proveedor, muy responsable y el producto funciona al 100%</li>
            <li> This is the worste smelling parphume I spayed it on one day and it Smell&#x27;s old .....so I won&#x27;t ever use or buy this again .....ewwwww nasty completely unsatisfactory</li>
            <li> Bottle was leeking by delivery</li>
            <li> Sweet and still one of my favorites. Perfect for Winter and I received the correct size.</li>
            <li> this is one of the best female fragances I have smelled on my wifes body it is soft and long lasting I recomend</li>
            <li> Great product, pricing, and quick delivery time. The seller was on top of it!</li>
            <li> nice thank you i enjoy it alot glad i came across this i am very happy with it thank you thank you</li>
            <li> I love the smell.  It&#x27;s soft yet powerful just like Beyoncé. I will  buy more of this. I will be buying this for gifts at Christmas. One of the best I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> I was given the small 1oz version of this perfume a while ago and I love it, IDK but this one does not smell exactly like the one I had. Its ok. But I am not too crazy about it. Meh.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this, but have not received any compliments on it. I don&#x27;t think the smell lasts through the day, so may buy the better quality next time.</li>
            <li> I was fairly displeased with this item. Dont get me wrong the scent smells absolutely amazing, and apparently someone else liked it too. It appeared as if someone else was using the perfume before it arrived to me. Before you say the bottle is never full i just want to say im completely aware of that but it shouldn&#x27;t be that much missing. out of the 100 MI id say only 75 MI the least was in my bottle .</li>
            <li> excellent product, excellent seller, recommend</li>
            <li> The product came before Christmas and my wife loved it! Very pleased...no complaints! My wife says the perfume was what she wanted so that makes for a very happy couple.</li>
            <li> One of the best perfumes i own :) I absolutely adore it, in fact i bought a second bottle as a present to a good friend. Definitely buy it.</li>
            <li> Nice perfume for a casual daily outing. She likes it, I love it</li>
            <li> I think I bought too much and the novelty wore off early so if you like it I recommend buying a small sample first.</li>
            <li> My wife did not like it, found out that she did like the Beyonce Heat Rush, which we did purchase, but havent recd yet.&lt;br /&gt;Will write a review once we receive it.&lt;br /&gt;Also was very pleased with OxKom to refund the money for the other product, Thank you</li>
            <li> Great smell! Got mom this and she luvs it</li>
            <li> Wow, i have used the bottle up and just bought it...lol...wish they sold it by the gallon. Between lady gaga and this one I don&#x27;t know which one has one my heart...I love them both. I want more!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I  love the smell and the bottle is cute also</li>
            <li> I love this perfume...I will buy it again</li>
            <li> Last really long. Get alot of compliments.</li>
            <li> Though this is not one of my favorites, I do like the scent. Unfortunately, it fades rather quickly and I highly doubt I&#x27;ll repurchase it. This perfume also arrived with the cap missing and had leaked (Amazon promptly sent me a replacement)!</li>
            <li> Leaves no noticable fragrance once you put it on  and it stained my clothes.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to my worst enemy!  I will not buy it again</li>
            <li> I bought this without ever smelling it and I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.  It has a nice, clean scent without being too strong.  That being said, I don&#x27;t think the scent has much staying power.  Seems to dissipate throughout the day.  Overall, its a pleasant combination of a musk and maybe flowery scent, but with the best of both instead of the heaviness of a musk or the fruity sickly scent of too much flower.  I like it.</li>
            <li> This is a very good perfume that was reasonably priced at the time of my purchase. I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> The price was good and the perfume is to die for. I love this and will continue to buy it in addition to the other fragrances that I wear.</li>
            <li> Once my woman wears this perfume it gets my blood boiling! It is on of the most sexually alluring scents I ever smelled on a woman. This is better than Viagra!</li>
            <li> not the smell i was looking for i just use it as when all else fails when i run out of the good stuff im more of a sweet flowery perfume girl i never smelled it before i bought it guess i wanted it because beyonces name was on it</li>
            <li> My wife loves the scent, and this is a hard product to find in any brick and mortar store. Needless to say, she was happy when this arrived.</li>
            <li> Very good fast shipping</li>
            <li> Well.. what can I say, it really cheap, like 20usd, but ladies tends to like this perfume, also this was a better present than a more expensive givenchy perfume(that hurts when you buy a expensive present and everyone prefer the cheap one), any way, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Great price!</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend for Christmas. I like the price, it&#x27;s way cheaper than Nicki Minaj perfume and just as good.  She said it came within 3-5 days, and she just loves it.  The scent is very nice.</li>
            <li> This perfume was a great buy!  It arrived as promised, and was in great condition.  The light and refreshing scent was perfect for my teenage daughter.  I was very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend last Christmas and she loves the smell. Beyonce really did a great job with this one.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and this is a great scent for the summer. Men seem to love this smell and it lady a long time.</li>
            <li> Satisfied with my purchase &amp; shipping didn&#x27;t take that long either pretty fast</li>
            <li> Very good and smell good!!</li>
            <li> Best price around, big bottle, fresh. Lots of compliments, light fruity scent.</li>
            <li> it was everything I expected.</li>
            <li> I sampled HEAT before buying it and I loved it. it arrived, it smelled old and not like I had experienced previously</li>
            <li> I am not crazy about this perfume but it&#x27;s wearable it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> Divine Fragrance! for all those women who love the sweet taste, I recommend this perfume, which, other than its rich aroma, has a beautiful presentation and size. I&#x27;ve stayed in.</li>
            <li> I was extremely ecstatic to receive this item but when I opened up the box I realized that the neck of the bottle was almost completely empty! I was in shock because I expected more from Amazon! I am aware that the bottle is not always filled to the top when purchasing a perfume but the amount of the perfume excluded from the bottle itself made me LIVID. I felt as if I had gotten ripped off.</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting Heat rush so I don&#x27;t know what it is supposed to smell like but it smells like something spoiled it and the bottle has scratches on it as if used.</li>
            <li> Great scent and after a long hunt for the perfect perfume, I can say I finally found it!</li>
            <li> This smells soo good! I love it!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this perfume.  I purchased it as one of her birthday gifts, it is one of her favorite.</li>
            <li> love this perfume. love Beyonce. I love that you don&#x27;t need to douce yourself in too much of it and it lasts for the majority of the day.</li>
            <li> love it,smell good,i recomend the product to any one it good and smell good,you will enjoy it and buy next tim</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this perfume!! It smells amazing and lasts awhile once sprayed on yourself. I&#x27;ve got a lot of comments on it too!! I will definitely be buying more of this.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift. Great price.</li>
            <li> I like the low keyed smell!</li>
            <li> This is a famyastic product. The ladies of the house really enjoy this item. The price and size are great. I will be getting more for other family members for next christma and birthday presents.</li>
            <li> it was a really good price for such a good smelling perfume. Would deffinately but it again. Totally worth it,</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the scent!! It&#x27;s not too strong and not too light, it&#x27;s just right! Scent lasts just about all day long!! My Boyfriend LOVES when I wear it!!</li>
            <li> I got this as a Christmas gift for my mother that loves the scent and had her bottle run out. I was wary of this being a knock off since it was so cheaply priced, but my mom assured me it seemed to be the real product.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume! It may be tacky and cliche, but I love the warm-maple like smell that it has. This was a great deal.</li>
            <li> WAS A GIFT TO MY DAUGHTER IN LAW MY SON SAID THAT IT MADE FOR A HOT (HEAT) NIGHT OF ROMANCE</li>
            <li> The wife did not like the smell and I did not know it,then I learned the hard way that you can&#x27;t return colognes via the mail in which I had to eat the cost of sometime I could not use.</li>
            <li> This was a gift to my special one , she was amazed and surprised about the smell and the presentation of the product, I made it.</li>
            <li> I once paid double this price for much less product. My favorite scent!!! Now I know to shop Amazon for my next bottle</li>
            <li> this parfum is delicious smell!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for a teenage girl.  I have no idea what is smells like, but it was what it was supposed to be.  No defects of which I was aware.</li>
            <li> I just received this perfume that I got for my wife. The smell is very sexy and long lasting. It is almost like Victoria Secret Pink. Great for romantic times.</li>
            <li> It was great thanks a lot.</li>
            <li> This is nice fragrance and I do not regret purchasing it. It will only enhance your special evening rather on a special date or right out of the shower/bath before retiring for the evening.</li>
            <li> Smells nice. I get many compliments when wearing this. The scent doesn&#x27;t last all day though. It seems like a watered down version of the real thing.</li>
            <li> Smell didn&#x27;t last to long smell like some knock off perfume</li>
            <li> I like the way this one smells. It doesnt necessarily stay strong for very long, but the subtle scent stays a whole.</li>
            <li> I had the original for years. I bought this when mine ran out and it smells nothing like the original. It smells awful. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance and I cannot stand the other variations or perfumes in the Beyoncé line. Fruity, spicy, sexy. I get many compliments.</li>
            <li> I purchased this on a whim not knowing what it smells like. Wow!!! I absolutely LOVE it and will be getting this one again!</li>
            <li> This is definitely NOT a genuine article! I know what the actual perfume smells like, and this is NOT it! Very disappointed, and even more so because this was supposed to be one of my daughter&#x27;s Xmas presents - she specifically asked for it. How disappointing to find out that it&#x27;s not returnable - should have done my homework prior to making a purchase... Nicely done, Amazon - selling a fake product, and then not allowing me to return it - classy! Will definitely have to rethink if I&#x27;ll ever purchase anything from you again.</li>
            <li> expected an nicer fragance from beyonce</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE LOVE the smell. It has a soft &amp; sexy smell to it.</li>
            <li> Well ,but first of all what I purchased was not what arrived at my house,It was listed as Beyonce heat,3.4 oz/100ml,what I got was beyonce heat 1.7 oz/50ml,when I called the company they said that is what was susposed to be listed as the 1.7 oz. and that if returned ,no guarantee that there would not be a restocking charge taken out of my refund,So basically I was very unhappy with the whole purchase.and i am only giving it 5 stars because of the smell not the service</li>
            <li> Already have this brand and I, personally, love the fragrance and so do other&#x27;s. Hence why I just purchased a quantity of three :)  It is not over powering, and it has just that right amount of bite to have your &#x27;victims&#x27; squirming :)  Enjoy.  Just remember that fragrance smells are different per body chemistry&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> very good fragrance ideal for women the most fine and elegant the perfect gift for a mother, sister, girlfriend or wife</li>
            <li> I love the sweet smell of this fragrance.  It reminds me of another cologne called &amp;#34;Wish&amp;#34;......Beyonce Heat is less expensive of the two.  I would highly recommend this fragrance!!!!</li>
            <li> Neither here nor there with this fragrance.  Packaging was way too big though, may recommend to my friends</li>
            <li> Nice elegant night time scent.</li>
            <li> smell was exceptable. I think I should had purchase a sweetier smell.</li>
            <li> She fell in love with it the moment she opened the case for it and she smells nice too.. the end!! :-)</li>
            <li> This smells amazing. It has a fruity, almost peachy smell to it, but at the same time it&#x27;s warm and musky. As it sits on the skin, the peach starts to die down and it starts smelling more like almonds and gets sweet rather than musky. It&#x27;s very strong and it&#x27;s definitely something to wear while going out at later hours, but that is exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what all these comments are, about how the product looked &amp;#34;used&amp;#34; and how it&#x27;s not the actual product. Mine came in the box with the wrapping on it and looked exactly like it does in the picture on here as it&#x27;s advertised. No perfume was missing from the bottle whatsoever. It also smells exactly the same as the ones I&#x27;ve smelt in the stores.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume and wear it almost everyday. Putting on a spritz of this perfume makes me feel more confident, and well put-together in almost in instant. Heat is a perfect combination of sweeter \\&quot;light\\&quot; scents and sexier warm scents. This perfume lasts all day without being obtrusively pungent, and because of it&#x27;s perfect fragrant balance, it can be worn day or night. I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments from both friends and strangers on this perfume, as I imagine is the case for most other people who wear it too. In addition to the beautiful fragrance, the bottle is also very pretty and well deserving to be left out on display!</li>
            <li> this was a waste of money&lt;br /&gt;its not the real purfume sadly</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom as a gift and she loved it.</li>
            <li> Now I know the reason she doesn&#x27;t wear perfume. Take a class....FERGIE got you BEAT.....like a marathon.</li>
            <li> i tried a sample at the store once and i loved it, although the smell is still good, it doesn&#x27;t wow me and excite me like it used to before. Wouldn&#x27;t get it again</li>
            <li> Heat is Queen Bey&#x27;s debut fragrance (aside from her Tommy Hilfiger perfume back in &#x27;03, but that was more of a promotional tie-in) all her own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heat is a change of pace from typical celebrity sweet-smelling fragrances; it&#x27;s: spicy, woodsy, sultry, sexy &amp; has a hint of musk (but not overpowering at all!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very nice, welcomed fragrance from Mrs. Carter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Chloe</li>
            <li> I like this as my girlfriend does, smell good</li>
            <li> Maybe I just can&#x27;t smell, but this definitely smells different than the stuff I&#x27;ve sampled at stores! I did love the store samples, but this just smells different to me.. however my sister loves it, and other people say it smells good. so I guess it does. Overall not dissappointed, because it&#x27;s always a little risky buying online, and this was a good price. :)</li>
            <li> perfect for evening. I recommend it widely.</li>
            <li> This is such a soft and sexy fragrance</li>
            <li> I never considered buying this fragrance but kept seeing all of the positive feedback. I went to the perfume store, smelled it and knew that I wasn&#x27;t leaving the store without it. It is now definitely one of my favorites and I will make sure to keep it in stock.&lt;br /&gt;It smells mature, sexy, flirty, its not overwhelming, and last a long time. You can wear in the mornings or evenings. A must buy!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Nice smell that I get lots of compliments on when I wear it.  Have tried many other scents that have similar ingredients but like this one much more.</li>
            <li> Me encanta su fragancia</li>
            <li> The perfume doesnt smell real and the sprayer was broken and poorly constructed. I had to return it and I still have not received my replacement. I wouldnt buy their products again.</li>
            <li> I like because  is good price</li>
            <li> Anything Beyonce gets my thumbs up and this fragrance is no exception! It is def a sexy fragrance that I find doesn&#x27;t go with my everyday wear, but it&#x27;s great for a night out or some one on one time with a special someone!</li>
            <li> Just another mediocere celebrity fragrance. not bad but nothing great either. would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this fragrance because of the name.  It has a nice smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s lovely however I never recieved it as it went to Indiana instead of Michigan</li>
            <li> el perfume llego a tiempo, en una envoltura que protege, y huele muy delicioso un aroma que me encanto y se lo regale a mi esposa</li>
            <li> Fantastic transaction! Product exactly as described! Love it! Thank you! Very professional!</li>
            <li> bought it as a christmas gift and she loved it. it last long, smells great, and the size is perfect. i would recommend it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so pungent, musky and strong. it smells like an expired old fashioned 1960&#x27;s perfume that you&#x27;d find lying around in a thrift shop. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone. Don&#x27;t wear this to work for the lovE OF GOD. People are gonna think you stink.</li>
            <li> Was very satisfied with the price and the scent itself but the bottle was definitely not full. Does indeed smell like&amp;#34;Firedance&amp;#34; by Amy Brown.</li>
            <li> This perfume smell great I&#x27;m glad I purchased it for my fiancé</li>
            <li> I was excited when I saw this perfume at the store. I even bought it triple this price at walgreen( my mistake). For such a price, I thought it would  last but I was wrong. It smelt nice when I put it on but once I left the house it was all gone before midday. I never, I repeat, never got complimented on it. I was happy when the bottle was done. That was my honest experience. Maybe it could work for u , but it&#x27;s not a purchase I would repeat or recommend.</li>
            <li> Did not like it. I gave it to my sister. She use that fragrance but it wasn&#x27;t a pleasant scent to me.</li>
            <li> I have fallen in love with this fragrance. Its a light smell but it stays all day. But even though it&#x27;s light its strong enough to smell without getting too close to whoever has it on.</li>
            <li> Fragrance doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> Smells nice!!! But doesn&#x27;t last enough for me</li>
            <li> Was a gift and she was pleased!</li>
            <li> Im very satisfied with this product my wife loves it made very happy</li>
            <li> I just recently bought Beyoncé&#x27;s new fragrance &amp;#34;Rise&amp;#34; in February and fell in love with its scent. So, being the big Beyoncé fan that I am, I decided to purchase Beyoncé &amp;#34;Heat&amp;#34; and Beyoncé &amp;#34;Midnight Heat.&amp;#34; Just received &amp;#34;Heat&amp;#34; and I HATE the smell...It is definitely not enticing or seductive. I was definitely disappointed...Not I have to figure out what to do with this fragrance since Amazon will not allow me to return this item. Now I can only hope that the &amp;#34;Midnight Heat&amp;#34; smells good. Such a bummer.</li>
            <li> I bought for my girlfriend and she just loved it. I can&#x27;t complain about this small because its smalls good on her skin.</li>
            <li> I would not buy this fragrance.  I purchased a bottle and it smelled rancid. It was a waste of my money!</li>
            <li> One of my fav perfume and price is very reasonable</li>
            <li> I bought this for mom as a Christmas gift. i ordered it not knowing how it smelled, so i went to Walmart to and got a chance to. Mom loves it. it does smell good.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. If you are on the hunt for a sexy but sophisticated fragrance, I highly recommend! Smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Really love this product, and the price is wonderful.  The size is great as well.  Will continue to order this.</li>
            <li> This scent of this perfume is pretty good, and it is perfect for winter time. A very warm and cozy type of fragrance. It is one that can&#x27;t be worn year round. My bottle was sent not even full. about 20% gone. I am not basing my rating or review on the sellers mistake, i am just letting everyone know to be careful who you order this from.</li>
            <li> The order of perfume shipped on time. It smells great. I got it for an amazing price. Best buy of my life!</li>
            <li> great smell she loves it thank you,</li>
            <li> Excellent!...The product arrived without problems, fully recommended&lt;br /&gt;Excellent!...The product arrived without problems, fully recommended&lt;br /&gt;Excellent!...The product arrived without problems, fully recommended</li>
            <li> I was super disappointed when Macy&#x27;s stopped carrying this perfume. When I googled where to find it, I found Amazon carried it at such a great price. I&#x27;ve been using Beyoncé Heat since 2010 and it continues to be my signature scent. Some perfumes I also enjoy are Marc Jacobs Honey &amp; Dot, Coach Poppy, Vera Wang Princess, Love Struck and Escada; so if you enjoy sweet not spicy or musky perfumes, you will love HEAT. Both At work and at play, I have gotten compliments from men and women. I have been reluctant to share with them what I&#x27;m wearing as I want to keep it a secret. I have purchased it as a gift for another family member, although it smells differently on her it is still a fabulous scent.&lt;br /&gt;To make any perfume last,  I apply lotion right after a bath or shower and wait to apply perfume, oils on our skin seem to help it last longer. I usually don&#x27;t reapply perfume and it still last until the following day.  If you want it to last longer, don&#x27;t just spray your clothing, try spraying it on your pulse points (wrists, behind the ear, base of the throat, crook of the knees and arms, and ankles). Blood vessels are closest to the skin giving off more heat and the pulse helps spread the scent.&lt;br /&gt;Although there are a few stronger scents I enjoy, I am not a fan of perfumes that are powdery, musky, rose-jasmine nor perfumes like Yves Saint Laurent Opium, Chanel No.5 or Elizabeth Taylor White Diamonds. I recommend you try this perfume. I ordered several bottles and have not had any issues with perfume degradation nor receiving open used bottles.</li>
            <li> no bad at all i like after seaching for one perfume i decide for this one and when i got it i enjoy i used it every day my friends ask me what kind of perfume is this for those who don &#x60;t like strong smell so, is not for you, this perfume it last all day , not regret.</li>
            <li> Not the same as the real Beyonce Heat. It smells gross. Do not waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> Was a gift for my mother and she LOVED it!  Highly recommended, a great buy from Amazon!</li>
            <li> Great price from amazon! Got it quickly for good price I will recommend this to friends! Don&#x27;t purchase perfume without 1st trying samples...</li>
            <li> not what i expected. This is stronger then cologne. I have not tried her other perfumes after this one b/c i expected something lighter. After spraying this I was afraid i let loose the walking apocalyptical dead, tease then tone virus, or osiris thorn</li>
            <li> I  love the smell not to loud.  Lots of comments.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife. She was so happy. I loved the way It smelled on her. Promptly shipped.</li>
            <li> At first, smells nice. It&#x27;s a musky, heavily feminine scent. But then, the undertones came out and smelled very much like cinnamon. Not a bad thing but still, not what I was looking for. Like other reviewers say, it does last long and a little goes a long way since the scent is ( to me) quite strong. After some time, I grew sick of it and decided it wasn&#x27;t a good fit for me since I like more subtle scents that don&#x27;t overpower me or other people.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume and you can&#x27;t beat the deal for this.  A small 1oz bottle will cost $25 retail so $17.50 for the 3.4oz size is awesome!  Great price, received quickly, and free shipping!</li>
            <li> Love!! love !!love !! Wonderful price ! Wonderful product! !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not my favorite, but it is nice. On me this is all juicy cherries and warm amber. Nice, rich, and while it is a bit different than the normal fruity-florals we see in celebrity fragrances, it is still predictable. Impressive lasting power! It stays rather close to the skin which is probably a good thing because the fruitiness is big and would be overwhelming otherwise. I can see this being a young girl&#x27;s first &amp;#34;grown up&amp;#34; fragrance.</li>
            <li> love it great smell very mild</li>
            <li> Not a perfume i would recommend: the scent reminds me of a cheap perfume I once encountered.</li>
            <li> esquisito....un perfume que me encanto algo que las personas deverian recordar y usar waoo que prefume es mi favorito i lovit</li>
            <li> Great product! The Ol&#x27;lady lives it. Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying although I like the smell  of Beyonce Heat once the bottle arrived it looked like it was used, not happy about this at all! I will not order anything else from this company again.</li>
            <li> I love this smell.... I also love heat rush.. depending on how I feel determines which one I wear.... love it, Not doing all 5 starts.  the scent does not last as long as I wish</li>
            <li> Aside from Burberry, this is the only perfume that doesn&#x27;t trigger my migraines..</li>
            <li> I get this perfume all the time. I love the warm scent, quite seductive. Delivery was on time, and price is a bit cheaper on here, so good deal.</li>
            <li> Good product, first time of using it. fantastic</li>
            <li> From spay in magazine samples, I thought this was going to be a mix of vanilla and musk/amber, which is my fav and it smelled so so good. After purchasing it it smells like mostly plum to me, which is so strange and it doesn&#x27;t seem like plum is in this original Heat. I was super bummed after spending the money on it, but it Does smell better once it&#x27;s on the skin. It is less plumy-to-me and more floral. It still smells a bit too fruity for me though. What a shame. I might try mixing it with a purely musk scent to even out the sweetness. It doesn&#x27;t smell sensual to me at all. But this all might be because I was expecting it to be something specific.</li>
            <li> I am not a big perfume user and this scent was just right for me. Not overpowering but lingering.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, my wifes favorite</li>
            <li> not a fan of the smell</li>
            <li> After reading all of mixed reviews on this scent, I was skeptical on buying it, but I must say that this perfume is sure to seduce. I love the way it smells against my skin. The scent rises to my nose throughout the day. It isn&#x27;t overwhelming at all. It lingers as you walk out the room. I would definitely purchase this perfume again. Also, I read some reviews that the item was a knock off. I disagree. It is an official perfume for a great price.</li>
            <li> I chosen this rating, because my mother was hoping to enjoy the perfume, I got for her birthday, a little bit longer. When you spray on the scent it dosn&#x27;t last long. Maybe that&#x27;s how Beyonce wanted it. I don&#x27;t know.?</li>
            <li> Thsi perfume is just ok.. Didn&#x27;t really match up to my expectation or maybe because i was expecting something really fantastic.. it has a good scent.&lt;br /&gt;Good perfume</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this!!</li>
            <li> en espera del paquete por favor entregarlo en la dirección nueva de liberty express  MEDLEY FLORIDA 33178-1044** mil gracias</li>
            <li> nice different smell than most perfumes. thanks for being fast on delivery!</li>
            <li> This smell is really sharp and kind of childish... but so many guys love it. I don&#x27;t understand. So if you&#x27;re young and just looking to impress the guys, this perfume is for you.</li>
            <li> So I was looking for a perfume to replace my long sought after Amy Brown Fire Dance perfume and finally caved and decided to try this since my many internet searches kept suggesting it. So first off for those looking this is not even in the ballpark as a dupe for Amy Brown Fire Dance. I actually have an empty bottle of Amy Brown Fire Dance and did a direct comparison just to be sure, but sadly it&#x27;s not even close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said I like the smell of Heat on it&#x27;s own but certainly for a different occasion or person.  Heat is much muskier, and closer to a men&#x27;s cologne smell while Fire Dance is much younger and sharper to the nose with more floral fruity tones. They both smell good in their own right but Fire Dance is fresh and bright with a hint of musk while Heat is a bit richer, thicker, and older.</li>
            <li> This perfume is the perfect mix of fruity and sophisticated. I LOVE THE SCENT! Only bad thing, especially with most perfumes, is how small the bottle is. Ridiculous how much it is priced for a 3.4 - Ounce bottle.</li>
            <li> Large Bottle, great smell, great price. Whereever I go, I am told I smell great. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;My male friend once sprayed the perfum on himself. He said, &amp;#34;If I could keep this smell with me all day I would.&amp;#34; My students love the smell too and often comment on how good I smell.</li>
            <li> Bomb love it so much smells so good</li>
            <li> I prefer Heat Rush...it has a lighter and more sexy scent.  But I like this one too.  I would buy it again.</li>
