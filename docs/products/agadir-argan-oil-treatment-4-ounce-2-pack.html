            <li>Leaves you hair silky soft, shiny and feeling really healthy.</li>
            <li>It provides just the right balance.</li>
            <li>Great buy didn&#x27;t like the other Agadir products from another vendor, left the hair sticky.</li>
            <li>I have tried several different anti-frizz products and this is hands down the best I have ever tried!!!  </li>
            <li>A tiny amount in my hair after I wash it, makes it looking silky and feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>I have chin-length  hair that tends to be very frizzy.</li>
            <li>Smell is intense, I have started using Agadir instead of a conditioner</li>
            <li>The ends of my hair was really damaged from the heat and color .</li>
            <li>Hair dries SO much faster.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get ready without this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Plus hair dries extremely fast when using this product.</li>
            <li>Provides shine and body, especially for those who have gray hair, which is naturally drier and more brittle.  </li>

            <li>Recommend highly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend .&lt;br /&gt;Woooow</li>

            <li>Unlike other Argan oils that smooth your hair and make it flat, this one actually makes it fuller.</li>
            <li>I use quite a bit for styling my curls and it is only product I use on my natural hair.</li>
            <li>I started using it to calm down my frizzy hair but not only does it do that</li>

            <li> Do not need to use a lot, so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have medium to long hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders on my extremely dry color treated hair.  </li>
            <li> But I do not blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter would not live without this stuff</li>
            <li> I love agadir argan oil, too bad</li>
            <li> I work in a high dollar salon and this product is very commonly used.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way; a bottle lasts for 6-8 months depending on the length of hair and how often you wash.</li>
            <li> Use it daily and never have dull dry</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little pricey.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stupid how expensive this stuff is, but it does a really good job.</li>
            <li> It also helps tame frizzy hair when it&#x27;s humid.</li>
            <li> I vary the other hair product depending on my style, but use this for both ways!!!  </li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair and Agadir Argan Oil is God sent.  </li>
            <li> Got broken bottles.</li>
            <li> The lady who cuts my hair uses this product on my hair after cutting it.</li>

            <li> You may look at the price and think it is a lot of money for the product, but it is very worth it.  This stuff works wonders on my extremely dry color treated hair.  A tiny amount in my hair after I wash it, makes it looking silky and feeling smooth. It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Very cool product I advise everyone to use it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stupid how expensive this stuff is, but it does a really good job. DO NOT bother with the spray. I know it seems like a good idea, but it doesn&#x27;t work at all. Go with the pure oil, and apply to wet hair, especially lengths and ends.</li>
            <li> very fast and product as expected</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Unlike other Argan oils that smooth your hair and make it flat, this one actually makes it fuller.</li>
            <li> My daughter would not live without this stuff</li>
            <li> A wonderful leave-in product that conditions the hair and makes it manageable, soft and shiny. A little goes a long way; a bottle lasts for 6-8 months depending on the length of hair and how often you wash.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have chin-length  hair that tends to be very frizzy. I apply about a 1-inch dollop of the product to my damp hair before blow drying. What a difference it makes! It also come in a sprayer application bottle. I use that when I under-dollop :-)  Keeps my hand moisturized too!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and makes my hair feel amazing.  I&#x27;ve tried alot of products and not only is this the best product I&#x27;ve used it&#x27;s one of the cheapest!</li>
            <li> Great stuff &amp; great cost!</li>
            <li> Provides shine and body, especially for those who have gray hair, which is naturally drier and more brittle.  This product is neither too light weight nor too heavy.  It provides just the right balance.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted and on time!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best treatment for unruly frizzy hair!!  And the Best Value!  Would highly recommend and will definitely purchase from again.</li>
            <li> Smell is intense, I have started using Agadir instead of a conditioner and my hair have never been better. Great buy didn&#x27;t like the other Agadir products from another vendor, left the hair sticky. Agadir does not leave hair sticky....use only a drop or two after a head bath.</li>
            <li> Liked it for my hair light and good for my colored hair. The ends of my hair was really damaged from the heat and color . But now with this oil it&#x27;s good. I&#x27;ll buy it again and advise to buy it for any type of hair.</li>
            <li> Delicious-smelling product AND it gives a beautiful shine &amp; shimmer to my naturally coily hair. However, it is CHOCKED-FULL of Silicons, so beware.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different anti-frizz products and this is hands down the best I have ever tried!!!  I am hooked for life.  I have coarse wavy hair that gets really big in humidity and this makes my hair behave and look beautiful!!!!!</li>
            <li> It is the best product for hair Tx I&#x27;ve found, great feel, and feels good on your body.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best oil conditioners for African American hair.  I have used many hair oils and this is one of the very best I would recommend to any of my brothers and sisters.  It softens, conditions and brings a glowing shine to your hair.  Try it and you will like it.</li>
            <li> Best leave-in moisturizer 4 my very dry hair without being oily after application. This was a re-order and I ordered the 2 for 1. Great</li>
            <li> Best hair product EVER for curly, fizzy hair!  Does not weigh down hair and makes your hair very, very soft!</li>
            <li> My fiance uses this &amp; he loves it.  It makes his hair shiny, keeps it in place without the sticky look  &amp; it smells real good.</li>
            <li> In my case it is an excellent treatment after blow-drying. I have been using it for only a short time but I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Is amazing. I used it👍</li>
            <li> I was a WA State Licensed Cosmetologist for 17yrs. I have tried hundreds of oils! I can go to the beauty supply to buy professional hair products for 50% off...but I choose this hair oil! Its the best and The smell is heaven! I wish someone knew of a perfume that smelled this way! Ifa buy it!♡</li>
            <li> If you have dry, frizzy hair and live through summers in New Orleans, this product is a must! Do not need to use a lot, so it lasts a long time. Helps shine up my hair and greatly decreases the frizz.</li>
            <li> As long as the quality stays the same this is a product that i even use for my eye brows hhhhhhh seriously this is good</li>
            <li> The lady who cuts my hair uses this product on my hair after cutting it. I like how the product softens my hair to the touch.</li>
            <li> Excellent Argan oil from the first time I used and the smell was good&lt;br /&gt;I recommand to have it for all texture hair</li>
            <li> Love the scent. Also doesn&#x27;t make your hair/scalp oily by end of the day. A must have for a healthier and touchable hair:)</li>
            <li> I work in a high dollar salon and this product is very commonly used.  Compared to Morrocanoil it is favored as it isn&#x27;t as heavy and weighing.</li>
            <li> The best hair oil ever for damaged hair</li>
            <li> OUTSTANDING PRODUCT, makes hair feels extremely soft an silky!!</li>
            <li> This product is great! It keeps my hair shinny and not dull. The great is great . I was paying double the price for one at my beauty supply store</li>
            <li> Excellent product i will buy again</li>
            <li> Hair dries SO much faster.  Hair looks and feels very healthy.</li>
            <li> For my dry hair, this treatment gives it extra body and shine. It also helps tame frizzy hair when it&#x27;s humid. Love it!</li>
            <li> Order arrived ontime. Very good quality items</li>
            <li> its really good its keep my hair shiny and its turn my hair color like before its really help my hair</li>
            <li> Awesome product, I use it after I get out of the shower on the length of my hair, my hair is much softer and the amount of frizziness is lessened. I recommend this for sure. But I do not blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist got me hooked on this.  I started using it to calm down my frizzy hair but not only does it do that but it makes it shine but not a greasy look.  This stuff is definately worth the try.  I believe once you&#x27;ve tried it you&#x27;ll be hooked like me.</li>
            <li> Cannot live without it. My hair is so healthy and shiny. Great for ALL hair types too so don&#x27;t be afraid to use it.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  A little goes a long way!  Use it daily and never have dull dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;Best argan oil on the market</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as heavy but does the job better IMO. I have been using this product for 4-5 years and absolutely love it. I have naturally curly hair which I sometimes dry curly and sometimes straight. I vary the other hair product depending on my style, but use this for both ways!!!  Awesome stuff!</li>
            <li> Got broken bottles. Oil was spilled in the packing bag.</li>
            <li> This is the best juice for my hair!</li>
            <li> I had previously used the product and was pleased&lt;br /&gt;with the 2 pack price. Recommend highly.Goes on easily&lt;br /&gt;and no residue. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I use this product on damp, clean hair. It adds shine and conditions my hair. I have medium to long hair. I use color on my hair, and I would tell my friends and family about this product. It is worth the money if you enjoy using oils on your hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair and Agadir Argan Oil is God sent.  I like it way better than Moroccan Oil.  I don&#x27;t get ready without this stuff.  Enough said.</li>
            <li> I love agadir argan oil, too bad it&#x27;s a little pricey. I use quite a bit for styling my curls and it is only product I use on my natural hair.</li>
            <li> Luv this stuff, takes the frizz out.</li>
            <li> Leaves you hair silky soft, shiny and feeling really healthy. Protects hair while drying and literally a pea sized drop is all I use. Plus hair dries extremely fast when using this product. The price of it on Amazon is amazing too... I used to purchase it from our local salon and it was almost three times higher than what I got here!  It&#x27;s a no lose deal!!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend .&lt;br /&gt;Woooow amazing product with good smell.</li>
            <li> You are the best always</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t the same as what came in the sample packs</li>
            <li> I have tried several &amp;#34;leave in&amp;#34; hair treatments to reduce frizz and moisturize my hair.  This is by far the best leave in treatment ever and never leaves my hair looking or feeling greasy!  I love this stuff and will continue to purchase it!</li>
            <li> The best, works great on my hair</li>
