            <li>That&#x27;s just my best guess.  </li>
            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>Not the best out there.</li>
            <li>It feels amazing!!!  </li>
            <li>Great buy!</li>
            <li>IT HAS A BEAUTIFUL GLOW.</li>
            <li>Great price here on Amazon, too.</li>
            <li>and she was so happy.  </li>
            <li>Still I thought that it did a great job exfoliating</li>
            <li>Lol</li>
            <li>, my face looks great.  </li>
            <li>This sponge makes my skin look and feel great.</li>
            <li>For its price, that&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very effective and lasts a couple months before it needs replacing.</li>
            <li>Loved it great product</li>
            <li>THE BEST CHEAP WAY TO REMOVE MAKEUP!</li>
            <li>Good quality and swift shipping on time.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think that is a good choice for this sponge.  </li>
            <li>I love this sponge!</li>
            <li>I ordered four more to have on hand!</li>
            <li>I love these sponges!</li>
            <li>BETTER THAN USING YOUR HANDS TO REMOVE UR MAKEUP!</li>
            <li>Initially I really liked this Konjac sponge.  </li>
            <li>Love konjac sponges and this one is a good size that covers the palm of the hand.  </li>
            <li>Its not as dense as the others that I&#x27;ve liked.</li>
            <li>Gorgeous&lt;br /&gt;Clean nice for the skin</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell if it makes any difference in my complexion, honestly.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pure magic!!!</li>
            <li>Gentle, but very effective!  </li>
            <li>After 3 months though most of the activated charcoal in it would have been depleted anyways, so it&#x27;s best to get a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m soon glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I love this sponge.</li>
            <li>Better choice to wash your face by the sink</li>
            <li>They were always running out and am glad to find them on Amazon  </li>
            <li>my skin can take something a bit more abrasive than that.</li>
            <li>This is the &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; one, so I also don&#x27;t find that it provides any meaningful exfoliation.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT,</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ve enjoyed using this.</li>
            <li>I love this, it cleans my face</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s on auto-ship. :-)</li>
            <li>Love this Complexion Sponge.  </li>
            <li>After the wash, my face feels so squeaky clean, I love it!</li>
            <li>It sure feels nice and all while rubbing around on my face, but I don&#x27;t find that my face is any more clean that it would be otherwise.  </li>
            <li>This works great, cleans my face and leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>Excellent quality, very soft and gentle on my face.</li>
            <li>I really love the texture of this sponge, as it felt like I was getting a good level of exfoliation without being overly abrasive on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I will make sure to ALWAYS use this to clean my face</li>
            <li>I received thus free in my influenster box.</li>
            <li>It lightly exfoliates my face each time I use it, and carries away excess oils as well.</li>
            <li>So I guess if you have sensitive skin it will be good for you.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to get the right sponge for your face type and condition.</li>
            <li>My new favorite beauty tool!</li>
            <li>I love my Konjac sponges, very gently exfoliates your face and leaves it beautifully clean without irritation.</li>
            <li>My face feels so clean after using this to wash my face.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and am able to use this item three or more times a week without my face getting irritated.</li>
            <li>My face feels clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>IT MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE FROM FIRST TIME YOU USE IT!</li>
            <li>Helps to clean skin better than with just your fingers but doesn&#x27;t help get off the dry skin, just kind of rolls it up.</li>
            <li>It provides gentle exfoliation and is safe for the environment, unlike the micro bead face washes.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t about to pay full retail for that name brand, so</li>
            <li>Good quality sponge that is not extra brittle.  </li>
            <li>: It&#x27;s the same size, fitting in the palm of your hand easily, though unlike the more pricey Konjac that is flatter, this one is more rounded which allows it to scrub around your nose better, while the bottom is flat for your forehead and</li>
            <li>and it is pretty easy to take care of.</li>
            <li>The activated charcoal and rougher exfoliation of this sponge is good to keep my face clean and smooth, but it&#x27;s not too rough.</li>
            <li>I have mild cyclical acne (period break-outs, etc).</li>
            <li>I would prefer something with a more scrubby texture (you&#x27;ll get more exfoliation from a regular washcloth than this)</li>
            <li>They really work at keeping my complexion acne free.  </li>
            <li>Worth every cent.</li>
            <li>If the sponge lasts 1-3 months like the packaging says then it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It feels sooo good when I used it wet with my face.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure it would be great for someone with super delicate, sensitive skin, or for treating eczema or psoriasis.</li>
            <li>The activated charcoal does seem to help clear up my face, but the sponge is honestly too soft to use for exfoliation.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a very gentle exfoliation and not abrasive at all.</li>
            <li>Good little sponge.</li>
            <li>I first found these at a local Target and fell in love with these things.</li>
            <li>This was my first Konjac sponge.</li>
            <li>Put it in the microwave soaked in water for 30 seconds or until the sponge is hot to sanitize it.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this after seeing positive reviews on YouTube re: Konjac sponges.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time that I&#x27;ve used konjac sponge and now I really know what all the raves are about.  </li>
            <li>It gives you a deep clean leaving your skin feeling fresh and revitalized.</li>
            <li>It is convenient but it takes forever to dry even on a soap saver or counter top</li>
            <li>Super soft, silky....</li>
            <li>LEAVES UR SKIN SUPER SOFT AND FEELING</li>
            <li>However, the sponge does a great job at getting deep down dirt without the need to scrub with force.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing special, just a small sponge with a goofy texture.</li>
            <li>My skin has really improved in brightness and scarring since I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li>This really improved my skin.  </li>
            <li>That sponge was really dense, and took a while to soften in the water.</li>
            <li>I use the sponge with my face wash and it exfoliates very well.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to get on the konjac sponge bandwagon.</li>
            <li>i really like this sponge.</li>
            <li>I only rubbed the konjac sponge on my facial soap like 2 or 3 times and it already foamed up a  nice lather.  </li>
            <li>Even when wet, it remained firm enough to gently exfoliate, and it felt wonderful.</li>
            <li>, IT IS SOFT AND VERY GENTLE.</li>
            <li>When wet it feels very soft and I actually love the way it feels -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually recommended these for my niece, who is 11 and is starting to have hormonal break-outs (better for her than using treatments with salicylic acid, which tend to overdry).</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t worth the low price if it falls apart.</li>
            <li>I normally have to use a face scrub twice a week.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used three of the MY Konjac brand and really liked them, but always felt like they were a little too big.  </li>
            <li>: I don&#x27;t use any soap or product on my face, allowing my skins natural oils and ph to balance and keep my face clear, which works as long as you exfoliate your face daily and eat healthy.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with this product!</li>
            <li>I was pleased with it&#x27;s performance initially, but over the three short weeks I&#x27;ve used the sponge, despite taking precautions to dry it out after each use, the outer layer of the sponge separated, as if it was sloughing off a layer of skin.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps the regular version has a little more texture to it and could exfoliate to a noticeable degree?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product, but with such a short lifespan, I think I will stick to something with a little more staying power.</li>
            <li>My skin is so clear and radiant since using this sponge.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Certainly not harsh on my sensitive skin, but if it&#x27;s exfoliating, I can&#x27;t tell</li>
            <li>I had a different brand before, and it cost twice as much.</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, its too soft for me</li>
            <li>No complaints so far.  </li>
            <li>THIS IS BY FAR</li>
            <li>I typically shy away from physical exfoliation in favor of chemical exfoliation, but I feel good about using this since it is so gentle.</li>
            <li>but this is very gentle but still works at those blackheads and dry skin.</li>
            <li>I had expected something more along the lines of a facial loofah, but this is just a regular sponge (finer in texture, but with similar firmness to an O-Cello kitchen sponge).</li>
            <li>I was thinking that it was going to the rough on my face, but when it is wet it is smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>It lasts for quite a while if you take care of it (my first was bit in half by my 2 year old.</li>
            <li>I had done some research beforehand on these sponges and had heard to make them last to make sure not to leave them in a wet environment and to handle with some care, but even those tips didn&#x27;t keep this thing from basically disintegrating after less than a month of use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen it for a few dollars more at some other brick and mortar stores.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not rough on the face.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps the middle of the sponge never adequately dried out, causing the outer layer to peel off.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the small price and mine</li>
            <li>negative is that it does not have a string to hang it, so it does not dry quickly.</li>
            <li>And I do try to let it dry completely between uses.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I really wanted to like this product, but with such a short lifespan, I think I will stick to something with a little more staying power.</li>
            <li> My skin is so clear and radiant since using this sponge.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Certainly not harsh on my sensitive skin, but if it&#x27;s exfoliating, I can&#x27;t tell</li>
            <li> I had a different brand before, and it cost twice as much.</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, its too soft for me</li>
            <li> No complaints so far.  </li>
            <li> THIS IS BY FAR</li>
            <li> I typically shy away from physical exfoliation in favor of chemical exfoliation, but I feel good about using this since it is so gentle.</li>
            <li> but this is very gentle but still works at those blackheads and dry skin.</li>
            <li> I had expected something more along the lines of a facial loofah, but this is just a regular sponge (finer in texture, but with similar firmness to an O-Cello kitchen sponge).</li>
            <li> I was thinking that it was going to the rough on my face, but when it is wet it is smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> It lasts for quite a while if you take care of it (my first was bit in half by my 2 year old.</li>
            <li> I had done some research beforehand on these sponges and had heard to make them last to make sure not to leave them in a wet environment and to handle with some care, but even those tips didn&#x27;t keep this thing from basically disintegrating after less than a month of use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen it for a few dollars more at some other brick and mortar stores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not rough on the face.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps the middle of the sponge never adequately dried out, causing the outer layer to peel off.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the small price and mine</li>
            <li> negative is that it does not have a string to hang it, so it does not dry quickly.</li>
            <li> And I do try to let it dry completely between uses.  </li>
            <li> It feels ridiculously hard at first, and you wonder why you bought a pumice stone for your face.</li>
            <li> I have oily acne prone skin and as long as I drink enough water and use this sponge morning and night</li>
            <li> so I can hang it outside of my bathroom in a dry area.</li>
            <li> After each use I squeezed out the sponge and left it to dry on the ledge of my bathroom window.  </li>
            <li> I have bought other more expensive Konjac sponges and they have lasted months.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately these sponges did not last more than a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I expected it to last longer.</li>
            <li> But similar to other beauty sponges, once you get it wet it starts to fluff up, becomes larger and way softer.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t dry up my face</li>
            <li> can get that mildew smell if it stays wet for a long period of time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still trying to get some use out of what&#x27;s left of the sponge, but bits of it are coming off on my face and going down the drain.  </li>
            <li> so it can dry out!</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t seem to have the little blackheads that would occasionally pop up by my noise.  </li>
            <li> almost jelly like when wet.  </li>
            <li> In  fact, I expected the sponge to be coarser, and found myself scrubbing at my skin, thinking that would get it cleaner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure this is doing anything particularly different from using any other sponge, but I still like to use it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical paying such a low price for a Konjac sponge, but after having this one for two months I&#x27;ve come to realize it&#x27;s the same quality as the ones you pay $10-12</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like how it partially dries, and is partly hard and partly slimy the next day.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money and doesn&#x27;t do a thing for my skin that any other product or cream doesn&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li> This sponge fell apart after using it for less than a month.</li>
            <li> It should dry out before uses (so that it becomes hard again)</li>
            <li> (Little pieces of the sponge started coming off of it.)</li>
            <li> It is true...very stiff and hard when dry.  </li>
            <li> It dries hard almost like a pumice stone and softens when wet.</li>
            <li> It is soft (but has a weird slimy feeling to it, but is not coated with anything)&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> I just let this scrub my face to remove dead skin cells and then rinse</li>
            <li> My face broke out pretty badly after I started using this.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> I like the small end to get in the corners by my nose.  </li>
            <li> This was extremely disappointing, even for the low price.</li>
            <li> it is next to impossible to use anymore.</li>
            <li> Also the others actually smelled a bit like charcoal but not in a bad way, but this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> :  Totally unnecessary</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t exfoliate, so it is really useless.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have bad skin to begin with it - no acne.  </li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I received this sponge as a sample and I&#x27;m soon glad I did.  I&#x27;m 33 and I&#x27;ve suffered from moderate acne all my life.  Since I&#x27;ve been using this sponge, I have not had any break outs.  My skin is so clear and radiant since using this sponge.  If you suffer from moderate acne, give this sponge a try!</li>
            <li> I love this sponge. It dries hard almost like a pumice stone and softens when wet. My skin has really improved in brightness and scarring since I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li> My face broke out pretty badly after I started using this. Not a fan.</li>
            <li> Not something I would ever buy again.  Not worth the money and doesn&#x27;t do a thing for my skin that any other product or cream doesn&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li> I love this sponge! I have sensitive skin and I definitely noticed a difference after using this. Washcloths hurt my face but this is very gentle but still works at those blackheads and dry skin. I just put a dab of face soap on it and scrub. I use it everyday! I have had it for about a month and it has not fallen apart at all!</li>
            <li> The sponge started to grow mold on it after one use.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately these sponges did not last more than a few weeks.  Konjac sponges are terrific, but this one needs some improvement.</li>
            <li> My face feels so clean after using this to wash my face.  It&#x27;s not rough on the face.  I do replace mine about every 3 months, just in case.  And I do try to let it dry completely between uses.  There is no scent and it does not seem to hold onto any of the face washes I use with it.</li>
            <li> I love my Konjac sponges, very gently exfoliates your face and leaves it beautifully clean without irritation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure this is doing anything particularly different from using any other sponge, but I still like to use it. It feels ridiculously hard at first, and you wonder why you bought a pumice stone for your face. But similar to other beauty sponges, once you get it wet it starts to fluff up, becomes larger and way softer. It&#x27;s not abrasive at all. I typically shy away from physical exfoliation in favor of chemical exfoliation, but I feel good about using this since it is so gentle. It lasts for quite a while if you take care of it (my first was bit in half by my 2 year old. Whoops), and it is pretty easy to take care of. Great price here on Amazon, too. I&#x27;ve seen it for a few dollars more at some other brick and mortar stores.</li>
            <li> This works great, cleans my face and leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> It was for my wife, fits the requirement and she was so happy.  Good quality and swift shipping on time.</li>
            <li> Terrible. Spend the extra money and g</li>
            <li> This really improved my skin.  When I look in the mirror and photos I feel that my skin looks smoother and younger.  I didn&#x27;t have bad skin to begin with it - no acne.  Still I thought that it did a great job exfoliating and I don&#x27;t seem to have the little blackheads that would occasionally pop up by my noise.  When wet it feels very soft and I actually love the way it feels - I try to only do a once over because I don&#x27;t want to over exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;I like to wash my face in the shower but I don&#x27;t think that is a good choice for this sponge.  It should dry out before uses (so that it becomes hard again) but I noticed that it wasn&#x27;t drying out between my showers.&lt;br /&gt;This can get that mildew smell if it stays wet for a long period of time.  Better choice to wash your face by the sink so it can dry out!</li>
            <li> Good little sponge. Helps to clean skin better than with just your fingers but doesn&#x27;t help get off the dry skin, just kind of rolls it up. I still have to go back in with a washcloth to finish the job. It is convenient but it takes forever to dry even on a soap saver or counter top so I am concerned that it may harbor bacteria. I have not seen any change in my skin with this after several months of use.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, very soft and gentle on my face. Rinses well and has no smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only negative is that it does not have a string to hang it, so it does not dry quickly. I did sting some waxy (so it doesn&#x27;t hold water) floss through it so I can hang it outside of my bathroom in a dry area.</li>
            <li> Initially I really liked this Konjac sponge.  I&#x27;ve used three of the MY Konjac brand and really liked them, but always felt like they were a little too big.  Although they are also teardrop shaped, I thought this smaller sized sponge would be easier to maneuver, especially around my nose, and it was.  After each use I squeezed out the sponge and left it to dry on the ledge of my bathroom window.  I was pleased with it&#x27;s performance initially, but over the three short weeks I&#x27;ve used the sponge, despite taking precautions to dry it out after each use, the outer layer of the sponge separated, as if it was sloughing off a layer of skin.  Although it is smaller in size, it&#x27;s actually thicker in the middle. Perhaps the middle of the sponge never adequately dried out, causing the outer layer to peel off.  That&#x27;s just my best guess.  I&#x27;m still trying to get some use out of what&#x27;s left of the sponge, but bits of it are coming off on my face and going down the drain.  I don&#x27;t recommend this item, and will go back to the My Konjac brand.</li>
            <li> I first found these at a local Target and fell in love with these things. They were always running out and am glad to find them on Amazon  They are, when soaked for a minute, are like washing your face with silk.  I use them for applying my daily glycolic scrub.  Well worth the small price and mine typically last 6 months with daily use. And no they have no smell !!</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was touted in some women&#x27;s magazine. I use it, but I don&#x27;t see what it&#x27;s doing for me. Certainly not harsh on my sensitive skin, but if it&#x27;s exfoliating, I can&#x27;t tell</li>
            <li> Not all konjac sponges are created equal. I had a different brand before, and it cost twice as much. That sponge was really dense, and took a while to soften in the water. Even when wet, it remained firm enough to gently exfoliate, and it felt wonderful. This sponge takes just a second to soften and begins to feel mushy and gross. It reminds me of a dish sponge. It doesn&#x27;t exfoliate, so it is really useless.</li>
            <li> This was my first Konjac sponge. I really love the texture of this sponge, as it felt like I was getting a good level of exfoliation without being overly abrasive on my sensitive skin. However, this sponge only lasts a couple of weeks, and once it starts to fall apart it is next to impossible to use anymore. This was extremely disappointing, even for the low price. I had done some research beforehand on these sponges and had heard to make them last to make sure not to leave them in a wet environment and to handle with some care, but even those tips didn&#x27;t keep this thing from basically disintegrating after less than a month of use. I really wanted to like this product, but with such a short lifespan, I think I will stick to something with a little more staying power.</li>
            <li> I bought the sponge to use with a cream cleanser but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, its too soft for me my skin can take something a bit more abrasive than that. At night I always use an apricot scrub then in the morning cleanser with washcloth, does the trick! Lol So I guess if you have sensitive skin it will be good for you.</li>
            <li> This is my 4th sponge purchase.  They really work at keeping my complexion acne free.  I have oily acne prone skin and as long as I drink enough water and use this sponge morning and night, my face looks great.  I will continue to purchase this sponge.  Worth every cent.</li>
            <li> The product holds well. I sometimes use it without any soap or cleanser. I like it coz it doesn&#x27;t dry up my face</li>
            <li> This sponge makes my skin look and feel great.</li>
            <li> I received thus free in my influenster box. I like it. It provides gentle exfoliation and is safe for the environment, unlike the micro bead face washes.</li>
            <li> This sponge fell apart after using it for less than a month. I expected it to last longer. I have bought other more expensive Konjac sponges and they have lasted months. It isn&#x27;t worth the low price if it falls apart. (Little pieces of the sponge started coming off of it.)</li>
            <li> Works great! I have sensitive skin and am able to use this item three or more times a week without my face getting irritated. I ordered four more to have on hand!</li>
            <li> Loved it great product</li>
            <li> Pros:  It is soft (but has a weird slimy feeling to it, but is not coated with anything)&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Totally unnecessary&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this after seeing positive reviews on YouTube re: Konjac sponges.  I wasn&#x27;t about to pay full retail for that name brand, so though I&#x27;d try this.  It sure feels nice and all while rubbing around on my face, but I don&#x27;t find that my face is any more clean that it would be otherwise.  This is the &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; one, so I also don&#x27;t find that it provides any meaningful exfoliation.  Perhaps the regular version has a little more texture to it and could exfoliate to a noticeable degree?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll use it for it&#x27;s lifetime, but won&#x27;t repurchase.</li>
            <li> Perfection!!!! I will make sure to ALWAYS use this to clean my face it&#x27;s pure magic!!!</li>
            <li> No complaints so far.  I use the sponge with my face wash and it exfoliates very well.  I normally have to use a face scrub twice a week.  If the sponge lasts 1-3 months like the packaging says then it&#x27;s well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Love konjac sponges and this one is a good size that covers the palm of the hand.  Would have given it 4 stars if it came with a hook to hang it up for drying.  Good quality sponge that is not extra brittle.  I recommend.</li>
            <li> Not the best out there. Its not as dense as the others that I&#x27;ve liked. Also the others actually smelled a bit like charcoal but not in a bad way, but this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> THIS FEELS LIKE AM WASHING MY FACE WITH SILK, IT IS SOFT AND VERY GENTLE. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT, AFTER I WAS MY FACE IT HAS A BEAUTIFUL GLOW.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical paying such a low price for a Konjac sponge, but after having this one for two months I&#x27;ve come to realize it&#x27;s the same quality as the ones you pay $10-12 for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DESIGN: It&#x27;s the same size, fitting in the palm of your hand easily, though unlike the more pricey Konjac that is flatter, this one is more rounded which allows it to scrub around your nose better, while the bottom is flat for your forehead and cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EFFICACY: I don&#x27;t use any soap or product on my face, allowing my skins natural oils and ph to balance and keep my face clear, which works as long as you exfoliate your face daily and eat healthy. That&#x27;s where this comes in. The activated charcoal and rougher exfoliation of this sponge is good to keep my face clean and smooth, but it&#x27;s not too rough. I just let this scrub my face to remove dead skin cells and then rinse off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MAINTENANCE: After a week, it collects a bit of the oil from my face so I put a dab of soap on it and rinse it out. After a month, it&#x27;s time to disinfect. Put it in the microwave soaked in water for 30 seconds or until the sponge is hot to sanitize it. Just like you do (or should) with your dish sponges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DURABILITY: This sponge lasts me about 3 months with daily use. For its price, that&#x27;s a great value. The sponge does start to get bigger holes after about 2 months of daily use, but it&#x27;s still in the same shape and not losing chunks until 3-4 months. After 3 months though most of the activated charcoal in it would have been depleted anyways, so it&#x27;s best to get a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ve enjoyed using this. It lightly exfoliates my face each time I use it, and carries away excess oils as well. Just be sure to get the right sponge for your face type and condition.</li>
            <li> I got it this morning from Amazon delivery and I immediately tried it out with my morning wash.  This is the first time that I&#x27;ve used konjac sponge and now I really know what all the raves are about.  It feels amazing!!!  Super soft, silky....almost jelly like when wet.  It feels sooo good when I used it wet with my face.  I only rubbed the konjac sponge on my facial soap like 2 or 3 times and it already foamed up a  nice lather.  After the wash, my face feels so squeaky clean, I love it!</li>
            <li> Gorgeous&lt;br /&gt;Clean nice for the skin</li>
            <li> I have mild cyclical acne (period break-outs, etc). The activated charcoal does seem to help clear up my face, but the sponge is honestly too soft to use for exfoliation. I had expected something more along the lines of a facial loofah, but this is just a regular sponge (finer in texture, but with similar firmness to an O-Cello kitchen sponge). I would prefer something with a more scrubby texture (you&#x27;ll get more exfoliation from a regular washcloth than this) but I&#x27;m sure it would be great for someone with super delicate, sensitive skin, or for treating eczema or psoriasis. I&#x27;ve actually recommended these for my niece, who is 11 and is starting to have hormonal break-outs (better for her than using treatments with salicylic acid, which tend to overdry).</li>
            <li> I really wanted to get on the konjac sponge bandwagon. It&#x27;s nothing special, just a small sponge with a goofy texture. I don&#x27;t like how it partially dries, and is partly hard and partly slimy the next day.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if it makes any difference in my complexion, honestly.</li>
            <li> It scrubs and cleans my skin the way I like it.  It gives you a deep clean leaving your skin feeling fresh and revitalized.</li>
            <li> I love this, it cleans my face so will ❤❤</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this product! Softens with water, and gives my skin a thorough cleansing without being too abrasive. In  fact, I expected the sponge to be coarser, and found myself scrubbing at my skin, thinking that would get it cleaner. However, the sponge does a great job at getting deep down dirt without the need to scrub with force. Just let it do its job!</li>
            <li> i really like this sponge. it&#x27;s a very gentle exfoliation and not abrasive at all.</li>
            <li> It is true...very stiff and hard when dry.  I was thinking that it was going to the rough on my face, but when it is wet it is smooth and soft.  I like the small end to get in the corners by my nose.  I use it with my face cleaner in the shower.  Great buy!</li>
            <li> I love these sponges!</li>
            <li> THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST CHEAP WAY TO REMOVE MAKEUP! IT MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE FROM FIRST TIME YOU USE IT! 100Ã— BETTER THAN USING YOUR HANDS TO REMOVE UR MAKEUP! LEAVES UR SKIN SUPER SOFT AND FEELING THE CLEANEST ITS EVER FELT! IAM HOOKED ON THIS FOR LIFE! WILL DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN!</li>
            <li> My new favorite beauty tool!</li>
            <li> I use this sponge twice a day for cleaning my face. It&#x27;s very effective and lasts a couple months before it needs replacing. This is my second purchase of this sponge-- it&#x27;s on auto-ship. :-)</li>
            <li> Love this Complexion Sponge.  Gentle, but very effective!  My face feels clean and refreshed.</li>
