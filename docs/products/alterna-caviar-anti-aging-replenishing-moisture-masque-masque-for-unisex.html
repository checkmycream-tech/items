            <li> I use this twice weekly instead of conditioner. My hair is naturally very dry and this makes it silky soft.</li>
            <li> Love all of the products that I&#x27;ve tried from this line.  I out it on my hair after washing and towel drying and sit under a heat cap for an hour and then rinse.  It gives my hair elasticity.  I watched a utube video where this was recommended and it was right on the money.  I do a protien treatment twice a month and always follow up with this product.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Seems like a pretty basic, lightweight conditioner.</li>
            <li> wow wow wow!!! This product is amazing.  My hair was dried out and frizzy due to a long, cold winter season.  It is back to normal now, better than normal!  My hair is naturally curly, soft lazy curls, and very long.  I do not blow dry it at all so I do not know how this product performs combined with a blow drier.  If you do know, please add a reply to my review, please.  I would be interested to know as well!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was meant for dry hair... My hair don&#x27;t brush well after this mask</li>
            <li> Just great! repaired my thin blond hair. Spend the money and repair your hair! This stuff is wonderful! Fast delivery and customer service was great!Thank you!</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a different product when I ordered this. It works OK but nothing better than the regular conditioner I&#x27;m using. Smells So-so. Probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> makes my hair super soft</li>
            <li> I got this cause my hair dresses said its really good for your hair, however I could not brush my hair after I washed it out. I followed instructions amd it just doesn&#x27;t do what it says it does. I won&#x27;t be wasting my money again.</li>
            <li> Product was late on arrival but  once I received I was super pleased with the product and how it left my hair feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner - it makes my hair feel super soft and silky, and the smell is incredible. Great product in a great line of hair products.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Nice scent, but not too strong - makes hair silky but not weighted down.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this from Amazon, received this as a gift, but happy I did! I will use this when I&#x27;m NOT using my Body Shop Grape Hair Serum. This helped soften up my hair from my last Wen fiasco-I&#x27;m just trying to use the darn stuff up, but who knows if I&#x27;ll have any hair left by then, so I think I&#x27;ll just use the Wen for foot soaks, or cleaning clogs out of my tub, no kidding-it works for that purpose-might be our soft water. Will purchase this from Amazon in the future-QVC is TOO darn expensive for this line!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.  I highly recommend it.  I&#x27;m at that age now where my hair needed help, and I am so glad I found it in this product.</li>
