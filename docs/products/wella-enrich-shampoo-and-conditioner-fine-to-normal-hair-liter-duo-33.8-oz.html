            <li>I love these products</li>
            <li>This was an OK shampoo and conditioner combo.</li>
            <li>I tried so many Shampoo &amp; Conditioner for my hair</li>
            <li>Great smell, leaves the hair fresh and clean without drying the scalp.</li>
            <li>but since I use Wella Enrich Shampoo &amp; Conditioner my hair looks better, healthy and strong.</li>

            <li>I thought it was a fluke the first day, but three days of the same</li>
            <li>It did nothing good for my very wavy hair (no added shine, volume, or ease of styling), but it also did nothing bad.</li>
            <li>First of all this product is seems like not a original product .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> First of all this product is seems like not a original product .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> am using well from last long time</li>
            <li> But this time it has left my hair very dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell the same as it used to and even when I use a ton of conditioner my hair is hard to comb after my shower.</li>
            <li> My previous pump bottle pumps  (from John Freida)</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of this product.</li>
            <li> Not sure why companies have to change things that work.</li>
            <li> II&#x27;ve purchased this is the past</li>
            <li> It takes FOREVER to rinse out and if you don&#x27;t spend at least 10 minutes rinsing your hair feels grimy.</li>
            <li> Some people have complained that they received two shampoo or two conditioner</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s seems no good after use .&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seriously no good at all</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t so bad that I will stop using it, but I probably will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> ; shampoo was making it a tear out so badly.</li>

            <li> Great smell, leaves the hair fresh and clean without drying the scalp.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  Have used it for years.</li>
            <li> great product and service was fantastic!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo/conditioner at a great price.</li>
            <li> Wella must have changed their formula. Not sure why companies have to change things that work. Doesn&#x27;t smell the same as it used to and even when I use a ton of conditioner my hair is hard to comb after my shower. I thought it was a fluke the first day, but three days of the same and I just think it is the product. It&#x27;s not the seller&#x27;s fault. Product arrived quickly and as advertised. Just wish Wella hadn&#x27;t messed with a perfectly good thing.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I use this product.  We both have fine hair and it works great!</li>

            <li> First of all this product is seems like not a original product .&lt;br /&gt;I am using well from last long time and I can feel the product by its smell and touch . It&#x27;s seems no good after use .&lt;br /&gt;Seriously no good at all</li>
            <li> LOVE Wella hair are products.</li>
            <li> I have been using Wella for 5 years now. My hair and I love it! Leaves my hair smooth, shiny and silky.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> II&#x27;ve purchased this is the past and it it has been great! But this time it has left my hair very dry and frizzy. I&#x27;ve had to switch back to regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> Recommend by my hair dresser. Love the smell and how healthy my hair feels.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for my colored hair. &amp;#34;Regular&amp;#34; shampoo was making it a tear out so badly. Great packaging and swift delivery.</li>
